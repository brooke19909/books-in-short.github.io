Step-by-step recommendations, necessary documents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For the first time, they talked about the part of the pension that can be accumulated in 2001.  It was at this time that there were changes in the legislation regarding the pension business.  Such concepts as basic, funded and insurance pensions appeared.  Moreover, each individual part is financed separately from each other from different sources of cash funds.  Let's talk about how to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension. </p><h2>  What is a pension that accumulates? </h2><p>  As you know, the first mention of this began to appear in 2002, after the <span>pension reform.</span>  Nevertheless, over the long 13 years there have been significant changes in the legislation to improve the funded system.  And in 2015, not only the concept of ‚Äúfunded pension‚Äù was rooted, but the procedure for calculating it was developed. </p><p>  To date, the law provides for two concepts that are independent of each other - this is insurance and funded pensions. </p><p>  Many are confused and cannot understand what is their difference, and what is a pension that can be accumulated.  Each citizen of the Russian Federation has a personal account in the <span>Pension Fund,</span> on which money is accumulated.  We will figure out how exactly they are credited there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/1901309.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the same time, accordingly, the higher the salary, the greater the deductions. </p><p>  16% go to an insurance fund and 6% to a funded fund.  A person can dispose of the funded part independently. </p><p>  In the period when the work will be behind, and the person will receive his well-deserved retirement vacation, he will receive 2 pensions - insurance and funded.  And since 2015, citizens who are over the age of 48 years or younger can write a statement about the transition to full pension insurance or a funded fund.  You can replenish the funded part yourself by making additional contributions to your personal account, which upon retirement will be paid in addition to the main payments. </p><h2>  Cumulative pension: check its size using SNILS </h2><p>  You can find out the amount of the funded part of the pension according to the insurance certificate and check what specific amount of money is in your personal account in two ways: </p><ul><li>  using the worldwide system of integrated computer networks - the Internet; </li><li>  directly at the branch of the fund dealing with pensions at the place of residence. </li></ul><p>  Everything will depend on your capabilities and desire to get to the necessary information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where and how to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57150/1899578.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Find out information at Sberbank </h2><p>  How to find out the amount of the funded part of a pension if you are a member of a pension program and are a member of a <span>non-state pension fund (NPF) of</span> Sberbank? </p><p>  At the same time, you should know that you invest your money not in a bank, but in a fund that already manages the funds received at its discretion.  Invests your money and makes profit on it. </p><p>  How to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension at Sberbank in this situation? </p><p>  There are three options for obtaining information: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to visit a branch of a non-state pension fund and ask specialists for data on the amount of cash savings in your personal account.  In this case, you must provide your social card. </li><li>  Find information on the Internet.  Employees of Sberbank will help to assist in this, if you yourself are not able to cope with the task. </li><li>  Use an ATM or terminal. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Find out the amount of the funded part of the pension according to SNILS" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57150/1899582.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  What happens to a funded pension after death? </h2><p>  After the death of a person, two types of payments remain on his account in the Pension Fund.  This is the current pension, which was accrued but not paid, and the funded part.  How to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension in this situation?  To do this, you need to go through a series of procedures. </p><p>  If a pension is accrued, but as a result of death, the person was not given it, then relatives can apply for it, applying to the Pension Fund with an appropriate application, passport, certificate of residence, death certificate and documents confirming family ties. </p><p>  But with the <span>funded part of the</span> pension, the procedure is longer, since the savings are considered an inheritance.  Receive them on the basis of a notarized certificate.  In the process of registration of the inheritance deed, the notary includes in the inventory and pension savings of a person who has left this world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Find out the amount of the funded part of the pension via the Internet" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57150/1899586.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to avoid the inheritance procedure? </h2><p>  There are only two basic rules by which, after the death of a person, his relatives can come to the department dealing with the pension business and write an application for the part of the pension that has been accumulated.  It happens: </p><ol><li>  if even before the moment of his death a person appeared in the Pension Fund and wrote a statement in which he specified who should receive all the savings after the death of the owner of this money; </li><li>  if the funds are concentrated in a private pension fund, then the identity of the citizen applying for the funded part is indicated in the contract. </li></ol><p>  At the same time, anyone can claim for payments, not even a relative. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the amount of the funded part of the deceased's pension" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57150/1899608.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to find out the amount of the funded part of the pension of the deceased? </h2><p>  For this, the close relatives of the person who died must apply to the Pension Fund and NPF within the period of six months after his death.  These are parents, wives or husbands and children. </p><p>  At the same time, if several people submitted the application, then the amount in equal shares is divided by each. </p><p>  In addition to the statement, you must attach: </p><ol><li>  Passport of the recipient of funds. </li><li>  If the funded part is drawn up as an inheritance, then documents confirming kinship with the person who died are attached.  This can be a certificate of registration of birth or certificate of registration of marriage. </li><li>  A certificate confirming the death of a person, the funded part of which is inherited. </li><li>  Insurance certificate of a deceased person.  You can simply specify its number. </li></ol><p>  If documents are sent by mail, then notarized copies are sufficient. </p><p>  The application is considered within four weeks, and payment is made no later than the second decade of the next month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The funded part of the pension how to find out the amount of Sberbank" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57150/1899604.jpg" width="600"></div>
