    <p>  To begin with, we denote the general concept of the device and the company that produces it.  So, the manufacturer Senseit is a Russian developer who orders devices for production from Chinese companies and sells them in the domestic market.  The company launched the line of its devices with the E400 model, the name of which contains the Life prefix.  The next version of the smartphone, obviously, carries the E500 index - and the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãpreserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Phones sold under the designated brand bear all the hallmarks of Chinese smartphones.  They cost not so much - the E500 model, for example, is offered at 10 thousand rubles.  At the same time, the technical characteristics of the device can please any fan of high-tech devices.  Here is a fairly functional filling, placed in an attractive case, painted ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù (made on the model of Apple-technology).  However, first things first.  We begin our review of the Senseit E500 with the configuration of the phone.  Next, we move smoothly to the other modules of the device in order to understand what customers should expect from a <span>Russian-Chinese smartphone.</span>  Reviews will also be given for those who are fortunate enough to work with the device. </p><h2>  Kit </h2><p>  The policy according to which the developers of mobile phones supply their customers with a mass of additional accessories (film, case and battery in addition) has probably proved to be not so effective.  At least, judging by some of the newest Chinese devices, we can say that the set of such devices is becoming more modest.  Here, for example, the reviews characterizing the Senseit E500 smartphone indicate that it comes with only a protective film on the screen, which is installed ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù.  That is, on the one hand, the advantage of such a solution is the lack of the need to mess with it;  on the other hand, a conditional flaw is the lack of a cover and other accessories.  That is, if the buyer wants, he should look for a cover on his Senseit E500 separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the telephone and film, the set of the described device contains operating instructions, as well as a paper clip for removing a special tray where the SIM card will be installed, and a charger.  All this is placed in a white compact box, which is decorated with a photograph of the phone. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Senseit E500 smartphone has a design that is not too bright and somewhat significantly different from other similar devices.  Quite the contrary - manufacturers tried to make the appearance of the model as discreet as possible, unsightly for a potential buyer.  So, as we have already noted, the phone is painted ‚Äúfor metal‚Äù and made of plastic.  The features of the case resemble a design that is often used by other manufacturers, so the model is not endowed with anything individual.  However, the Senseit E500, which we are reviewing, has something attractive.  For example, the edging of the <span>camera</span> eye in <span>red</span> on a gray background creates a favorable impression.  In addition, you can also praise the manufacturer‚Äôs decision to paint the frames around the display so that the screen appears to occupy the entire front of the phone.  ‚ÄúExposing‚Äù the trick is easy - just unlock the screen and you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs not so big here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Navigation elements </h2><p>  Smartphone Senseit E500 White has a classic layout of keys used for navigation, as well as functional holes.  In particular, on the front panel, under the display, we found the usual physical buttons for switching to the desktop, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, and also for viewing the available options. </p><p>  The button for unlocking the screen and adjusting the sound level is located on the right side panel.  Above them, you can see the hole in the tray, where both SIM cards are installed.  Symmetrically to this, on the left side there is the same hole where the memory card fits. </p>

    <p>  As for the headphone jacks and the charger, they are located on the upper edge.  This decision, although it is somewhat bold (after all, most manufacturers prefer to leave the port for charging at the bottom of the device), is justified, because it does not interfere with working with the smartphone in the process of connecting to the network. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The phone has a classic screen for its class, the diagonal of which is 5.5 inches.  There is a display based on IPS technology, thanks to which a maximum of colors is transmitted, and the picture comes out quite bright and saturated.  In order for the user to comfortably read from the phone in the sun, the model is equipped with flexible brightness settings.  Also worth mentioning is the protection of the display with Asahi Glass - a powerful glass that resembles the well-known <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  With it, the <span>Senseit</span> E500 can successfully resist the formation of scratches, chips and cracks.  The model screen also supports HD transmission. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The performance of any smartphone primarily depends on the characteristics of its technical stuffing, and more specifically - the processor.  So, the E500 model operates on the basis of the <span>Mediatek MT6582M</span> - not the newest ‚Äúengine‚Äù, which showed itself not in the best light on the previous model - E400.  But the Senseit E500 smartphone (reviews are confirmation of this) works with the new version of the operating system - we are talking about Android 5.0.  As practice has shown, it changes everything dramatically - a processor with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz for each of the 4 cores behaves smoothly and without braking.  The device has a RAM of 1 GB - a low indicator, and you should not count on launching applications with high requirements.  Rather, the model can show itself well in everyday use, while performing basic tasks. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Another important indicator of how convenient the model will be is its autonomy.  This factor is directly determined by the battery capacity that is preinstalled on the model. </p><p>  In the case of the Senseit E500 (which we are reviewing), we should talk about a 2000 mAh battery.  This characteristic is perhaps less than the average for this class of devices, so the lack of charge will be logical even in order to ‚Äúhold out‚Äù to the end of the working day.  Perhaps the developers did not optimally optimize the charge, and also chose a not so capacious battery. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  With the amount of space available for downloading data, the phone is not so smooth.  At least that's what the Senseit E500 reviews say.  In particular, of the pre-installed 8 GB of memory, only 2 GB is available to the user.  This is catastrophically small if we are talking about a modern smartphone.  A 32 GB memory card, which can be installed additionally, could fix the situation.  Apparently, that's what buyers are doing.  We, making a review for the Senseit E500, used a model without a card. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  According to the scheme typical for such phones, two cameras are installed here: frontal (matrix resolution - 5 megapixels) and main (13 megapixels).  Given the quality of the survey, the deception of manufacturers in the declared indicators becomes obvious.  Takes the phone much worse, and you can read about it in the reviews.  On the back cover, right under the camera‚Äôs eye, is a flash.  With it, shooting in dark conditions will, of course, be better - but again, you should not count on something high-tech. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  As we already noted, the previous version of the device - E400 - worked on the basis of Android OS 4th generation.  In the case of the Senseit E500 Mild Gray, we need to talk about a newer modification - the Android 5.0 operating system.  This is somewhat more convenient in terms of using the phone.  According to reviews, the device began to respond faster than before.  The increased productivity, of course, was achieved precisely due to software optimization - all the technical stuffing remained the same. </p><p>  In addition to speed, the new version of the operating system promises the buyer a completely different appearance of the user interface. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  The phone is offered with support for 2 SIM cards.  Like many other similar models, it works with all communication standards common in our country.  So, in the first place is the usual GSM format (2G / 3G / LTE networks), then we can note the possibility of receiving a WiFi signal.  The Bluetooth adapter allows you to exchange file data, and GPS and GLONASS - to navigate the terrain.  True, problems with the latter two often arise. </p><p>  As the reviews characterizing the Senseit E500 show, navigating the map, following the pointer on this device, is very problematic.  The point on the screen that indicates the location of the phone can change dramatically.  It seems that the device just briefly loses contact with the satellites, after which it finds and adjusts the data.  The process is then repeated. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  After you saw the features related to the Senseit E500, you need to refer to the reviews of real users, which we did.  Honestly, they were unpleasantly surprised. </p><p>  Many of those who are buyers of the device have brought a lot of criticism towards the developers.  Users claim that the behavior of the device does not match what was originally stated in the technical specifications.  It turned out to be a lie that the Senseit E500 Mild Gray is stable, has powerful features and is very cheap at the same time.  In practice, the model ceased to please the buyer after a couple of days. </p><p>  The reason for this is the mass of malfunctions and ‚Äúglitches‚Äù that occur in the system.  For example, a refusal to receive a signal from a particular SIM card has become a frequent occurrence;  in order to fix the problem, you need to pull out the tray and reinsert it.  Another example is the incorrect operation <span>of the proximity sensor.</span>  Its result was that every time during a conversation a person presses the screen with his face, and thus the speakerphone accidentally turns on, the speaker is turned off, or the conversation ends. </p>

    <p>  Problems can arise with how the network is caught.  Sometimes a device simply does not receive a signal (for some reason) - and this applies not only to GSM, but also to WiFi. </p><p>  More reviews point out the poor quality of the camera and also claim that there are no 13 megapixels (as indicated in the specifications of the Senseit E500 White) there and close. </p><p>  Finally, another group of complaints common among buyers is the unstable operation of a smartphone.  In particular, it can reboot itself, change the sound to contacts.  Some users noted that the phone does not always determine the number of the caller calling him, and also may take an outgoing call for too long. </p><p>  And, as you know, in addition to the indicated ones, there are many other errors that we won‚Äôt even talk about in order to save time. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the model has not so many advantages. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  This article describes a device developed by a Russian company for the domestic market.  The fact that people work in high technology and develop our market in this direction is already laudable.  But, on the other hand, you need to be as objective as possible when evaluating such phones. </p><p>  In their reviews, the majority of those who bought the device spoke negatively about it, then we will not advise you about this device.  A small battery, a weak camera, a low memory capacity and an outdated processor, not to mention the unstable operation as a whole, do not benefit the manufacturer and the device.  Therefore, unfortunately, this review did not show the advantages of the smartphone over other representatives of its class. </p>
