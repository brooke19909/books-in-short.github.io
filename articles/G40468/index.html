Firstly, it is the oldest church in the country, built in the style of Gothic.  Secondly, this is the first Polish brick cathedral.  And thirdly, this is the fourth church, standing in the same place, on the island of Tumsky, on <span>the Odra River</span> in Wroclaw.  In a word, this cathedral is worth visiting, at least virtual.  In the eyes of the Poles and especially the inhabitants of the city, this is a holy place.  And not just because the throne of Bishop of Wroclaw is now located there.  It contains a statue of the Virgin Mary with the Infant Christ, which, according to legend, miraculously saved the temple from complete destruction.  And this was not in ancient times, but at the end of World War II.  When Soviet troops mercilessly bombed Wroclaw, the statue fell and blocked the path of the fire, which destroyed up to seventy percent of the building.  But the flames did no harm to the sculpture, nor to the three chapels behind it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wroclaw Cathedral" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1455334.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the Wroclaw Cathedral </h2><p>  Wroclaw, now the capital of Silesia, was built in the old days on the islands in the middle of Odra for safety.  Of course, now it stretches along both sides of the river.  But the historical center of the city is the Slodovy, Pyasechny, Mlynarsky, Belyarsky islands.  The largest is Tumsky.  It was here that the ancient Wroclaw was located in the tenth century.  But the reviews of tourists claim that in order to find the cathedral of the city, you do not need to know its address.  It is enough to go to the embankment of Odra - and you will see beautiful, sharp as the blade of a sword, high spiers, crowning two brick towers.  The temple is especially beautiful in the evening, when they turn on the backlight.  But Tumsky from the beginning of the nineteenth century ceased to be an island in the geographical sense of the word, since it was connected to the coast by embankment.  Although it continues to be the most popular tourist area in the city - with wonderful water landscapes, river buses and many souvenir shops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the temple </h2><p>  Wroclaw Cathedral is located in the very center of the city.  To get to the island of Tumsky, it is better to approach from the northern shore of the Odra.  Reviews say that the best reference point for finding a church - especially if you travel by public transport - will be the Peace Bridge stop.  Not far from the cathedral (between it and the river) is a botanical garden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wroclaw Cathedral Wroclaw" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1455346.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  The first three temples </h2><p>  Archaeologists confidently argue that the modern Wroclaw Cathedral is the fourth sacred structure in this place.  The first temple dates from the middle of the tenth century.  It was stone, with one nave, transept and apse.  In all likelihood, it was built by one of the Czech rulers of the Przemyslid dynasty.  But this church in 1039 was completely destroyed by the troops of the Duke of Bretislaus.  The second temple was built with the money of King Boleslaw the Brave, since he decided to establish a bishopric in Wroclaw.  This church was completed in 1158.  It was a typical Romanesque basilica with three naves and towers in the eastern part.  Casimir the Restorer (the prince brutally persecuting the remnants of paganism in Silesia), expanded the temple and decorated it with carvings.  But to this day, none of this, except for the insignificant details found by archaeologists, has not reached.  The construction of the third church was started by Bishop Wroclaw Walter of Malonn, and his successor iroslav the Second consecrated the cathedral.  There is evidence that this building copied the Cathedral in Plock.  Numerous fragments remained in the crypt of the current church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wroclaw Cathedral Description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1455348.jpg" width="600"></div>

But when at the beginning of the thirteenth century, people mastered brick firing, everything changed.  From 1244 to 1272, the bishop of Silesia, Thomas the First, carried out extensive work on the restructuring of the throne.  It was then that the Wroclaw Cathedral, whose photo became the hallmark of the city, acquired its modern brick look.  Gothic was in fashion at that time, and the whole building was strictly designed in the same style.  His work was continued by Bishops Heinrich and Psheslav (in 1315 and 1349).  In the second half of the fourteenth century, another reconstruction of the cathedral followed.  The main nave was overgrown with chapels.  The master Pawn was involved in the work.  At the end of the fourteenth century, the very characteristic spiers appeared that make Wroclaw Cathedral so recognizable today.  But subsequent bishops contributed to the decoration of the temple, in keeping with the fashion of their time.  So, in 1517, Jan Turgot added a portal of the sacristy in the style of the northern Renaissance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wroclaw Cathedral photo" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1455351.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wroclaw Cathedral: exterior description </h2><p>  Tourists believe that this temple is certainly worth a visit and devote at least an hour to it.  Do not rush to go inside.  First go around the church around the perimeter.  This is a magnificent basilica with three naves and the same number of entrances.  As befits Christian churches, the altar in it is located in the east.  The main entrance, respectively, is in the west, and the other two in the south and north.  You should slowly inspect the portals.  They are designed in the Gothic style, with elements of the Northern Renaissance.  Take a look at the two belfries.  Their height is ninety seven meters.  Thanks to them, Wroclaw Cathedral is the highest sacred building in the city.  You should also admire the Gothic gutters, decorated with figures and a medieval rose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wroclaw Cathedral landmark Poland" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1455361.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <h2>  Description of interiors </h2><p>  At the main entrance to the cathedral is a Gothic portico with Romanesque columns.  On one of the capitals you can see the image of a lion.  If you want to marry your chosen one, be here on the very first Monday after Easter and rub the stone animal.  The girl will certainly agree to marry you.  Unlike Orthodox churches, Roman Catholic churches can be visited.  Be sure to do this to see three wonderful chapels: St. Elizabeth, built at the end of the seventeenth century, Mary, made in the Gothic style in the middle of the fourteenth century, and the baroque chapel of the Body of Christ.  In all of them there are tombs of Wroclaw bishops.  This is the work of Bernini's students - Ferrat and Domenico Guidi.  In the Mariana Chapel rises the very miraculous statue of the Virgin with the Baby.  Reviews recommend paying attention to the body.  It, of course, is not old, and was ordered at the beginning of the twentieth century in the German city of Ludwigsburg.  For some time it was the largest in Europe, and now it is considered the largest body in Poland.  Take a walk through the other chapels of the cathedral: the Gothic John the Baptist, the baroque Holy Communion, the Resurrection, Casimir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wroclaw Cathedral reviews" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1455358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Observation deck </h2><p>  Do not rush to leave Wroclaw Cathedral.  You have a unique chance to take a bird's eye view of the city.  There is an elevator in the left tower of the temple, which will take you to the observation deck.  Entrance fee is five zlotys.  But the beauty seen, tourists say, is worth the money spent.  You can take breathtaking photos.  There is no time limit for staying on the observation deck.  But inside the cathedral, photographs are unlikely to succeed.  Almost all reviews complain about the poor lighting of the temple. </p><h2>  Other temples of Tumsky island </h2><p>  Wroclaw Cathedral reviews of tourists are called not the only attraction of the old city.  There are many churches around it.  Some of them are no less ancient.  You should take a walk around this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city and admire the churches of St. Gilles (Aegidius), St. Martin and the two-story Holy Cross and Bartholomew. </p>
