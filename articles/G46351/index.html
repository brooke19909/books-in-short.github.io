So, according to tourists, when booking accommodation in Thai Hoa MuiNe Resort 3 * (Phan Thiet), you can choose a room in the main three-story building or in a bungalow.  As guests note, both options are suitable.  As for the rooms themselves, they seemed to the guests not very spacious.  However, the place in them was enough for all the residents.  As pluses, travelers note large comfortable beds, quality bedding.  In general, the apartments have everything that you may need during your vacation - a kettle and dishes, hairdryer, TV, air conditioning.  They also have balconies where you can sit while admiring the beautiful garden.  By the way, a number of apartments have sea views.  As for the minuses, some guests complained about the fact that the air conditioning is not very well located.  As a result, cold air blows directly onto the bed.  You can only adjust it manually.  However, this did not cause much trouble to the guests. </p><p>  Many tourists are also interested in the presence of insects.  Judging by the reviews, most vacationers mosquitoes and other uninvited little guests were practically not bothered.  However, experienced travelers still advise, just in case, to take insect repellent from home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thai hoa muine resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1119256.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  This item is considered by many guests to the advantages of Thai Hoa MuiNe Resort 3 * (Vietnam, Phan Thiet).  After all, the hotel has a very green, beautiful and well-groomed territory.  According to vacationers, gardeners look after plants all day long.  And their work is not in vain, because hotel guests can enjoy magnificent fruit trees, vibrant flowers, picturesque lawns, neat palm trees, etc. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the territory of the hotel is not very large, there is an outdoor pool.  Next to it is a sun terrace with several sun loungers and parasols.  Also in the pool there is a section for the youngest tourists.  According to tourists, the pools are regularly cleaned.  So in them you can safely swim in both adults and children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thai hoa muine resort 3 Phan Thiet" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1119254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Due to the fact that this hotel is a few hours drive from the airport, travelers definitely want to get into their room as soon as possible upon arrival and relax after a long journey.  The hotel administration understands this perfectly.  Therefore, they try to accommodate newly arrived guests immediately after their arrival, regardless of how much time is left before the checkout time.  For this approach, many vacationers express their gratitude to the management and employees of the hotel. </p><p>  As for the departure, it is necessary to vacate your apartment before noon.  However, if you plan to leave the hotel later, you can renew the room at an additional cost.  Or you can leave your suitcases and travel bags in the luggage room, hand over the keys to the apartment and continue to relax until the moment of departure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thai hoa muine resort 3 vietnam" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1119253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in Thai Hoa Beach Resort MuiNe 3 * (Phan Thiet, Vietnam) includes breakfast only.  They pass in the hotel restaurant.  Breakfast here, according to our compatriots, is very good.  So, in the morning you can eat soup, noodles, meat dishes, side dishes, several types of fruits and vegetables, freshly baked pancakes and fried eggs, yogurt, tea, coffee.  For some, the choice of products may seem monotonous, but most of the guests did not express any complaints about this. </p><p>  As for lunch and dinner, tourists can eat both in the hotel restaurant and outside.  However, as noted by travelers, the bulk of the cafe is far from the hotel.  You can reach them in half an hour on foot.  You can also take a taxi or rent a motorbike, as many vacationers in Thailand do. </p><p>  The city has a wide selection of restaurants.  So everyone can find a place with dishes to their taste and wallet.  They cook, according to tourists, everywhere very tasty.  Experienced travelers are also advised not to be afraid to buy food in mashinachniki (mobile food stalls) and in markets. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of the Thai Hoa Beach Resort MuiNe 3 * hotel, undoubtedly, is its proximity to the beach.  So, if you live in a bungalow, the sea will be literally a hundred meters from you.  From the main building to the coast you have to go a little further.  The beach here is not very big, with a fine sand.  Every morning it is cleaned of debris.  However, sometimes during the day the sea brings seaweed, bottles, bags, etc.  But on the whole, there were no complaints from our compatriots regarding the cleanliness of the beach. </p><p>  The hotel offers free use of sun loungers.  However, keep in mind that there are only a few.  Therefore, when the hotel is completely full, not everyone has enough places on the beach.  And sometimes vacationers have to go ashore early in the morning to take a lounger.  Those who did not have enough space can sit right on the sand, laying a mat or towel.  Also, some tourists preferred to sit on the sun loungers by the pool, and go swimming in the sea. </p><p>  There is a bar on the beach where you can buy snacks and drinks at affordable prices.  Seafood is also grilled here.  Therefore, you can always eat and refresh yourself with a drink. </p>
