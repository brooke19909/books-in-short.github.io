The famous reserve is very popular not only among tourists, but also among local residents.  The park zone of Sherwood is divided into several compartments, but the main asset is the centuries-old oak, considered a real miracle.  A variety of seedlings of trees grown in the national reserve are also offered to visitors. </p><p>  You can see photos of England sights with names and descriptions in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitnewarkandsherwood.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sherwood Forest" class="if uuid-2277881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2277881.jpg"></div><h2>  Stonehenge </h2><p>  Have you ever been able to see dolmens?  On the territory of our country, such structures can be found in the Caucasus, but the English Stonehenge is something else and unique. </p><p>  Stonehenge stones are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and are a real treasure of antiquity.  However, many tourists and scientists still do not understand what is the meaning of this building.  And some are completely disappointed with what they saw.  The best way to check is to see for yourself.  An interesting fact is that walking between stones is prohibited, perhaps this has its own magic. </p><p>  The easiest way to get to Stonehenge is to rent a car or taxi.  Since there is no direct flight from London, you cannot get on the bus.  Tourists will have to change trains in Salisbury. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestonehengetour.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stonehenge near London" class="if uuid-2277883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2277883.jpg"></div><h2>  Oxford </h2><p>  The history of this place dates back to the time of the Saxons, the first mention of which was recorded in the IX century.  Previously, a monastery was located on this site, and today one of the oldest and most magnificent universities in the world flaunts here.  This southeastern city of England also boasts the remains of a Norman castle and the Church of Christ. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oxford in southeast England" class="if uuid-2277886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2277886.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  England is an incredible country that can surprise with its personality and unsurpassed style.  The variety of cultural traditions, historical monuments and grandiose structures can drive any tourist crazy.  All the names of the sights of England will not fit on one paper sheet.  This country needs to be studied and learned for years.  Believe me, having come here once, you will want to come back again and again. </p>
