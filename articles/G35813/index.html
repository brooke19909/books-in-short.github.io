    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Do not neglect the information about the negative moments that may await you in Pela Maria 3 *.  Reviews say the following: </p><ul><li>  the doors in different rooms are very different (some have new ones, while others have very old ones with a large gap below); </li><li>  despite the fact that the door is locked with an ordinary key, in order to turn on the light, a card is required (this is very inconvenient); </li><li>  if you want to go on an excursion or you have an early flight, you will not be given a lunch box, and therefore a paid lunch will simply disappear; </li><li>  only Greeks work in the bar and restaurant, and therefore it is difficult to communicate with them because of the language barrier; </li><li>  the strong audibility between the rooms, as well as the rest, is prevented by noise from the corridor; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach (but it is close enough to the sea); </li><li>  cramped shower, bathing in which you will constantly touch the walls, which is quite unpleasant; </li><li>  the nearest beach to the hotel is strewn with large pebbles, and it‚Äôs far to go to the sandy one; </li><li>  constant interruptions in the operation of the elevator; </li><li>  cramped balcony, which is almost completely occupied by plastic furniture; </li><li>  instead of a double bed in the rooms one and a half are shifted, which are constantly moving apart due to the castors on the legs; </li><li>  after 22:00 and until 10:00 drinks are available only at an additional cost; </li><li>  renting vehicles and organizing excursions at the hotel is quite expensive (it is better to use the services of third-party services). </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A good option for a summer sea holiday is Pela Maria Hotel 3 * (Crete).  Convenient location with regard to resort infrastructure and tourist attractions makes this place ideal for active travelers.  In addition, there are several well-maintained beaches nearby.  It is worth noting especially the quality of food and friendly service at the hotel.  As for the number of rooms, it is not in the best condition.  Outdated repairs, shabby furniture and not the latest technical equipment can somewhat spoil the impression.  However, if you are not used to spending a lot of time on site, these shortcomings will not be too striking. </p>
