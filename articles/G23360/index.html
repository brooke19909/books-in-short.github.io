Banks do not require income statements, guarantors, quickly check documents and establish minimum requirements for customers.

Credit institutions usually issue cards to people over 21 years old.  In international practice, it is precisely those graduates who have a small but stable income who are considered more reliable.  But a few years ago, the situation changed.  Banks began to offer programs in which even a student can get a credit card without leaving home.  The final decision largely depends on the income level of the potential client.  Scholarships are <span>welcome</span> .  But before applying for a card, you should calculate all your income. </p>

    <h2>  goal </h2><p>  Reducing customer requirements is made in order to expand the customer base.  Therefore, many banks are ready to issue a credit card without confirming the level of income.  And even the unfavorable market situation, the increased risk of non-return of funds could not greatly affect the situation.  Potential borrowers should understand that credit cards from the age of 19 without proof of income are issued at an excessive interest rate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Youth cards </h2><p>  A credit card for students can teach how to use funds efficiently, plan expenses and service a loan.  These cards usually set a small limit so as not to get into debt over the ears.  With this limit, you can buy your favorite thing, pay off the debt from the scholarship and not pay interest.  A credit card for students is usually issued according to two documents, which makes it possible to accumulate bonuses and receive discounts.  It has an original design and low maintenance cost. </p><h2>  How to get a youth credit card? </h2><p>  The first step is to study in detail the offers on the market and choose a bank.  The conditions of some banks for servicing youth cards will be presented below.  The next step is to submit an application and agree on a credit limit.  There are two ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  visit the bank, fill out a questionnaire and collect a full package of documents; </li><li>  fill out an online application through the site and receive confirmation of loan approval. </li></ul>

    <p>  The borrower must meet certain requirements.  The term for consideration of documents ranges from several hours to several days.  To obtain a card at any bank, you need a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  As a second document, you can submit: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  international passport; </li><li>  military ID; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  certificate 2-personal income tax; </li><li>  TIN; </li><li>  a copy of the work book, etc. </li></ul><p>  Submission of the second document will allow you to get a card on more favorable terms, for example, with an increased credit limit or with a reduced service rate. </p><h2>  Renouncement </h2><p>  The bank may refuse to issue a card without explanation.  Most often, the prerequisites are the lack of a permanent source of income, registration is not in the region of residence.  But this does not mean that the client will not be able to use a credit card at all.  Often, factors that are significant for one bank may not be so important for another lending institution.  If you were denied one bank, do not be upset, because you can always fill out a credit card application at another institution.  Therefore, applications for credit cards from the age of 19 should be sent to several institutions at once. </p>

    <h2>  Maps over the Internet </h2><p>  An online application for a card issue is practiced by many credit institutions.  Usually it is a brief information about the client who is interested in a particular product (full name, phone number, desired time for a call).  The manager processes the information received and calls up with the client to invite him to the office to collect more detailed information and discuss specific conditions of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Existing customers can issue an online application specifically for issuing a credit card.  The bank already has all the information on the potential borrower.  It remains only to determine the credit limit, issue a card and transfer it to the client.  In this case, you will have to wait a couple of days for the card to be sent by registered mail. </p><p>  Before ordering credit cards from the age of 19 via the Internet, you need to choose the most advantageous offer on the site, focusing not only on the maximum credit limit, annual rate, but also on the monthly fee, commission for operations.  It is equally important to make sure that there are ATMs in the city of residence.  Otherwise, you will have to pay an excessive commission for withdrawing funds from the account. </p><p>  There are those banks in which the online application replaces the paper counterpart.  In this case, it should contain detailed information about the client.  Most often they request passport data, phone number, region of residence.  All information provided is verified through the Credit Bureau.  Within a day from the moment of sending the request, the representative of the financial institution contacts the client, answers all questions of interest and tells the conditions of service.  If they are satisfied with the client, the bank issues a credit card and sends it to the client by mail.  Activation is usually done through an ATM or at the customer‚Äôs call to a service center. </p>

    <h2>  Which banks issue credit cards since 19 years? </h2><p>  Credit cards save time on purchases.  But making such a payment instrument is quite difficult.  Not all organizations are ready to issue a credit card to a young student who, in addition to the scholarship, has no other sources of income.  Those organizations that have been offering credit cards since 19 years (Alfa-Bank, MDM, Avangard) set a rate of 50% on such products.  Such a payment tool is intended for non-cash payment of goods.  Therefore, a higher rate is set for withdrawals through an ATM.  Usually it is 5% + a fixed amount.  Let's consider market arrangements in more detail. </p><h2>  Tinkoff </h2><p>  The bank is a leader in the domestic market for issuing plastic credit cards without information.  How old can I get a credit card?  From 18 to 70 years old.  The limit per borrower is limited to 300 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the bank offers the lowest rate on the market for similar products - 24.9%.  It also affects overstated customer demand.  Terms of service are considered individually for each client. </p>
