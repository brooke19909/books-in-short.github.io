  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Baden-Wurttemberg: attractions, what to see</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After hospitable Bavaria, the unique region of Baden-W√ºrttemberg is the second most visited by tourists.  One of the most beautiful places in Germany, located in the south-west of the country, foreign guests knowingly dubbed the "land of pleasure."  Unfortunately, the Russians are not very familiar with the federal state of Germany, ideal for a relaxed and active holiday.  But Baden-W√ºrttember will delight even the most discerning traveler. </p><h2>  Colorful corner </h2><p>  The region occupies the territory of the historical region of Swabia.  The river Rhine serves as its southern and western borders, in addition, it is here that the rapid Danube originates. </p><p>  Baden-W√ºrttemberg, whose attractions are the main reason to visit the wondrous region, has its own government and parliament.  A wonderful corner, famous for its stunning flavor, appeared on the maps in 1952 during the unification of the three lands.  The region, whose capital is Stuttgart, has an enviable location: on the one hand, it borders with France, and on the other with Austria and Switzerland.  The majestic Alps are located nearby, and tourists can visit three countries at once in just one day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.experience-germany.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coat of arms of the region" class="if uuid-2544799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2544799.jpg"></div><h2>  Homeland Automotive </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that Baden-W√ºrttemberg, whose attractions reflect its rich history, is considered the cradle of the automotive industry.  It is here that the main offices of large companies such as Mercedes, Daimler, Porsche are located.  And on the Hockenheimring race track, several Formula 1 stages are held. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Black Forest" - Germany's natural miracle </h2><p>  Amazing beauty of landscapes, architectural values, numerous entertainments - all this attracts vacationers from all over the world.  The main miraculous attraction of Baden-W√ºrttemberg is the Black Forest, and each of its trails leads to adventure.  A natural miracle, whose name translates as "black forest", is famous for its dark emerald shade of the bark of evergreen trees.  Tourists who get to know him seem to fall into a real fairy tale, where the noble robber Robin Hood lives and is dominated by hardworking gnomes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eluxemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Natural masterpiece of the country" class="if uuid-2544685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2544685.jpg"></div><p>  However, the Black Forest is not only a forest, but also open sunny slopes, strewn with bright colors.  Clear lakes with clear water, magnificent waterfalls and powerful mountains create an unforgettable landscape that attracts tourists coming to Baden-W√ºrttemberg. </p><h2>  What to see in the region? </h2><p>  Germany is considered a country of beautiful castles, which, according to conservative estimates, are about 20 thousand.  Many of them have not been preserved, and descendants can only see picturesque ruins, but there are real masterpieces that look as magnificent as several centuries ago. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Heidelberg Castle is one of the most significant architectural monuments of the state, which was not restored after a devastating fire.  The first mention of the symbol of German romance appeared in the XIII century.  Towering above Heidelberg, above the picturesque valley of the Neckar River, it has a romantic charm.  The castle complex, covered with legends, has long served as the residence of local rulers, and even now the ruins, covered with green ivy, preserve the memory of the former power of their masters from the Wittelsbach dynasty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mustseeplaces.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heidelberg castle" class="if uuid-2544696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2544696.jpg"></div><p>  As part of the organized excursion, you can examine every nook and cranny of the Heidelberg castle, admire the beauty of the preserved facades, get acquainted with the rich collection of the historical museum located here.  And the main exhibit is considered the world's largest wine barrel, containing more than 200 thousand liters of sparkling drink. </p><h2>  Neo-Gothic masterpiece </h2><p>  Not far from the capital of the region is the inconspicuous town of Honau, next to which Lichtenstein Castle in Germany stands on a steep cliff.  The perfectly preserved neo-Gothic miracle is more reminiscent of a powerful fortress erected for defensive purposes.  The graceful silhouette of an ideal example of medieval architecture as if crashes into the sky, and the unusual structure is in its bizarre shape, so it looks literally grown out of the ground. </p><h2>  Fairytale castle </h2><p>  The family nest of the noble family of Lichtenstein - the permanent rulers of this land - appeared in the XII century.  The residence was often destroyed, but the greatest damage was done during the Second World War, and only in the 50s of the last century, the townspeople themselves restored local pride. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.locationscout.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lichtenstein Castle in Germany" class="if uuid-2544701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2544701.jpg"></div><p>  The fairytale Lichtenstein castle in Germany, as if descended from the book pages, is striking in its unusual appearance: the lower rooms are carved in rock.  But the most unforgettable view opens from the observation deck of a historical landmark, and guests enjoy the breathtaking panorama of the Swabian Alb (a mountain range in the south of the country) and tiny villages scattered across the plain. </p><h2>  Architectural monuments of the wondrous region </h2><p>  There are more than enough historical attractions in Baden-W√ºrttemberg!  Tourists should definitely visit the following monuments: </p><ul><li>  Roman-Irish baths Friedrichsbad in Baden-Baden.  The thermal complex, built by order of King Frederick, appeared at the end of the XIX century. </li><li>  The main temple of the city of Freiburg with a beautiful stone tower with 16 bells. </li><li>  The ruins of the medieval Vindeck castle in Weinheim, always open to visitors. </li><li>  Unusual stone pyramid in the city of Karlsruhe on the Market Square.

The medieval buildings, lined with wood, cause the greatest interest of holidaymakers. </li><li>  The so-called falling house, made in the traditional half-timbered style.  It is one of the most popular objects of any tourist program in ancient Ulm. </li></ul><h2>  The beautiful cities of Baden-Wurttemberg </h2><p>  One of the most developed cities in the region is considered its administrative center - Stuttgart, famous for the excellence of its products.  The headquarters of the main "mastodons" of the automobile industry is world famous for its many green parks and gardens. </p><p>  On the western slope of the Black Forest is one of the most famous resorts - Baden-Baden.  He became popular thanks to the hot springs, he is famous for his casino.  The beautiful city boasts a large number of historical monuments and amazing nature, </p><p>  Schw√§bisch Hall is a cozy village with a special atmosphere.  The picturesque town, well preserved after the Second World War, will surprise you with gingerbread houses and architectural objects. </p><p>  The fashionable resort of Konstanz is located in the south of the region.  Founded by the Celts, it is surrounded by wonderful vineyards, high Alps and pristine lakes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.steigenberger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Konstanz" class="if uuid-2544716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2544716.jpg"></div><p>  If you have not been to Baden-W√ºrttemberg (Germany), be sure to plan a new trip to where you will find the perfect balance of nature, attractions and a comfortable stay.  We promise that real impressions will exceed all expectations, and the mass of positive emotions from traveling to a real fairy tale will remain forever. </p>
