The reviews of those who already had the opportunity to test the gadget are mixed.  An excellent powerful battery and a good screen are complemented by a very outdated hardware platform.  Of course, this at least looks rather controversial.  But it‚Äôs enough to find out the cost of the device, as all doubts disappear and immediately there is a desire to test the smartphone.  It is sold at a price of about 3900 rubles.  For this money, the manufacturer offers as much as 2 GB of RAM, a camera with two modules, a screen with HD resolution, a 4000 mAh battery.  Interested in?  Then it's time to move on to a detailed review. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leagoo kiicaa power reviews" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2018036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  So, let's get acquainted with Leagoo KIICAA Power.  The review will open a description of the appearance of the device.  The phone case is made of two materials: plastic and metal.  The back cover is removable.  In the reviews, the owners assure that she sits in puzzles tight enough that prevents hanging out.  A metal frame runs along the perimeter of the case, giving it elegance.  In the model range, the manufacturer introduced gold and black options.  Note that both look spectacular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Users have no special comments on the design of the case.  Yes, of course, the design is unoriginal, but in general it looks pretty stylish.  The thickness indicator, which almost reaches 1 cm, was a little upset. But, most likely, this is exactly what allowed the developers to install a capacious battery.  Well, you have to sacrifice something. </p><p>  It makes no sense to dwell separately on the description of the location of the connectors and controls, since they are all displayed in the same way as in most other devices.  The only thing I would like to draw attention to is a separate slot for memory cards. </p><p>  On the rear panel there is also nothing particularly interesting.  At the top are two camera eyes and a flash.  The scanner is displayed a little lower.  It has an oval shape.  In general, there are no complaints about ergonomics. </p><h2>  Leagoo KIICAA Power: Screen Overview </h2><p>  The developers paid a lot of attention to the screen.  Its characteristics are fully consistent with modern requirements.  The 5-inch display is capable of displaying a picture in HD resolution, which, undoubtedly, users liked. </p><p>  The reviews say that there is no graininess, pixels are not visible.  The resolution of the screen is 294 ppi, which guarantees a clear picture.  No special comments were made about the viewing angles.  With a slope of 178 degrees, no bright changes are observed. </p><p>  To protect the screen used glass TM Dragontrail.  Its quality is not bad, but the oleophobic layer does not cope with the main tasks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leagoo kiicaa power" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2018037.jpg" width="455"></div>

MT6580A from MediaTek!  Yes, yes, this is not a mistake.  The system row is 32 bits.  The chipset runs on four computing modules.  The maximum that he is capable of is the frequency of 1300 MHz. </p><p>  Users leaving reviews about Leagoo KIICAA Power do not hide their disappointments.  This processor model was relevant 3-4 years ago. </p><p>  For the graphics in the device, the rather weak Mali-400 graphics card is responsible.  This module is not suitable for players, as it simply will not pull modern games.  But the volume of "RAM" deserves praise.  The gadget implements as many as two gigabytes.  The built-in storage is also not very small.  Its size is 16 GB.  System files occupy about 4, so users have 12 GB.  If necessary, you can always expand the memory to 32 GB with an external drive; a separate slot is provided for it. </p><p>  In the comments, the owners say that the phone, of course, will cope with everyday tasks, but you should not count on anything more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leagoo kiicaa power review" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2018038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  Leagoo KIICAA Power is running the current version of Android - the seventh.  On top of the OS installed shell of its own design.  Users noticed that she did not make any changes, so the question begs: "Why use it?" </p><p>  There are no comments on the OS.  All applications are stable.  For several months of testing, errors were found, but there were no serious failures. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  At Leagoo KIICAA Power, developers have implemented a dual main camera.  It is based on two 5- and 8-megapixel modules.  Unfortunately, according to users, this did not add the benefits of this model.  In fact, the pictures are of poor quality. </p><p>  The front module is also rather mediocre.  Its resolution is 5 megapixels.  You can put up with such characteristics only considering the cost of the gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leagoo kiicaa power mt6580a" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2018039.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  In terms of autonomy Leagoo KIICAA Power reviews deserves only laudatory.  The device is equipped with a 4 thousand mAh battery.  With an average load, the user will be able to work without recharging for two days, and if you ‚Äúput to sleep‚Äù some applications, you can increase the period by 24 hours. </p><p>  In the reviews, users assure that the active screen consumes 100% battery charge in 8-9 hours. And for a phone costing up to 4000 rubles, such results can be safely called worthy.  The only thing that upsets the owners is the lack of an option to quickly restore battery life.  In order to charge the smartphone, you will need to spend more than three hours. </p><h2>  Leagoo KIICAA Power: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the review, it is necessary to highlight the advantages and advantages of the Chinese gadget.  Cope with this will help owners reviews.  The phone was released only in 2017, so it was still not enough time to identify all the hidden problems, but we can already say what disadvantages it has.  Users have comments on the operation of the sensor.  Many were disappointed by the outdated processor and the completely useless main camera with a dual module.  As for the latter, in budget models it is not able to provide decent image quality.  Given the large battery capacity, the owners of this model are sorely lacking in the fast charging function. </p><p>  While it is possible to finish with shortcomings.  Whether system ‚Äúglitches‚Äù will appear during long-term operation, time will tell, and now we will consider what users attributed to the advantages of this device. </p><ul><li>  Nice build and stylish design. </li><li>  Adequate display resolution. </li><li>  Acceptable amounts of memory (2 GB of RAM for this price category is an amazing indicator). </li><li>  Powerful battery. </li><li>  The presence of a separate slot for external drives. </li><li>  Very low price. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, definitely Leagoo KIICAA Power smartphone is good for its price category.  It is able to surprise users with a long battery life and a decent design.  As for performance, it adequately copes with undemanding applications, but problems can arise when launching "heavy" games.  Not very good reviews were made to the cameras, so this model is not recommended for fans to be photographed. </p>
