    <p>  Everyone faces this in different ways.  Someone will be presented with a card in this technique, someone will want to arrange a photo album of their baby and stumble upon a detailed master class.  In any case, this is still not a very popular hobby in our country and takes pride of place abroad.  There, many are engaged in scrapbooking.  <span>What it is?</span>  <span>This is</span> when a beautiful paper produces useful and delicious things.  These include handmade cards, notebooks, <span>albums,</span> passport <span>covers</span> , cookbooks and much more.  Initially, scrapbooking meant creating albums for photographs.  To create it, it was necessary to prepare the basis, paste the picture and make them bright and unusual.  Scraps of newspapers, magazine clippings, dried flowers and much more could be used.  In the scrapbooking technique, the photo album turned out to be lively and non-trivial.  Later, many other objects began to fall under this concept, the main component of which is paper. </p><p>  <strong>Materials</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scrapbooking for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/282892.jpg" width="543"></div>

    <p>  Today, many companies, foreign and Russian, produce such components for scrap as: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - paper; </p><p>  - die cutting; </p><p>  - chipboards; </p><p>  - <span>paper flowers</span> ; </p><p>  - ribbons, lace; </p><p>  - pearls, pendants, cutting down and much more. </p><p>  It is because of the high price of these components that scrapbooking for beginners is not always available.  You can‚Äôt immediately buy all the beautiful scrap paper with suitable decorations.  Yes, and just the names are hard to figure out.  For example, chipboards are figures made of thick cardboard, and felling is made of thin cardboard.  In addition to the usual finished materials, much in scrapbooking can be created with your own hands.  For example, flowers made of paper or satin ribbons.  And to create felling, special machines and knives are sold for them, which make it possible to make an interesting element out of thick cardboard, it is also a cardstock. </p><p>  <strong>For what and to whom</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scrapbooking photo album" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/282893.jpg" width="375"></div>
