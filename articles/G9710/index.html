  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Historical city of Pavlovsk, Voronezh region: hotels, attractions, road</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Pavlovsk is one of the district centers of the <span>Voronezh region.</span>  It is almost famous for nothing, except for a comfortable recreational area, a clean river coast and lots of historical sights.  The province does not have to be abandoned, and Pavlovsk sets an example for this. </p><h2>  Where is it and how to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.45519849999999" data-lng="40.13958750000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/4/4/3/2443.png"></div><p>  The city is located on the banks of the Don River in the southern part of the region at a distance of 154 kilometers from Voronezh.  You can get there by car.  Travel time is about 2.5 hours.  You will have to go along the M-4 federal highway, which means that you can accelerate to the limit of 110 km / h and not worry that the trip will end in a lot of fines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voronezh Pavlovsk road" class="if uuid-2409708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2409708.jpg"></div><p>  Public transport also runs from Voronezh to Pavlovsk.  The central bus station of the city directs regular flights several times a day.  The average ticket price is 250 rubles, travel time is about 3 hours.  But in order not to bore yourself with a grueling move, it is better to stay at a Pavlovsk hotel in the Voronezh region in order to be able to wake up in this corner of the departed nobility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can tell only about a small part of what has been preserved in the city.  The building of a salotopenny factory, a real school, a fire station with bowls, a noble assembly and a merchant club are traces of the past that immerse you in the atmosphere of a real aristocratic county where everyone can feel like a hero of some old Russian book. </p><h2>  Hotel "Don" </h2><p>  In the city of Pavlovsk, Voronezh region, there are simply a huge number of hotels.  Especially for the district center with a population of 25,000 people. </p><p>  The average resident of the region, answering the question of where to stay for a random traveler, from Don Pavlovsk hotels in the Voronezh region will remember first.  Her address is st.  Gottwald, 4. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geocaching.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Don Pavlovsk hotel Voronezh region" class="if uuid-2409714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2409714.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that this institution is located in a historical building and has existed since Soviet times.  The interior leaves much to be desired, and in each of the 31 rooms the tourist will find a gloomy interior resembling a Soviet boarding house. </p><p>  The average price per night for two guests is 1100 rubles.  This is the cheapest accommodation option. </p><h2>  Hotel with access to the river </h2><p>  The requirement for a front page in front of the beach looks rather strange for the Black Earth region.  But among the hotels in Pavlovsk, Voronezh region, there is one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For lovers of beach holidays there is a "Guest house on May 1".  This is not a hotel in the traditional sense, but a kind of tourist hostel with a shared kitchen, a barbecue area and the ability to access the beach. </p><p>  Free Wi-Fi is available for guests, as well as closed private parking. </p><p>  The average price per night for two people is 1200 rubles with breakfast included.  This is one of the lowest prices among hotels in Pavlovsk and Voronezh region. </p><h2>  The most expensive option </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="grand hotel express" class="if uuid-2410532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2410532.jpg"></div><p>  Grand-Hotel Express (6a Severny Microdistrict) is an option with the most comfortable accommodation. </p><p>  It offers air-conditioned rooms with plasma TVs in rooms and free Wi-Fi.
