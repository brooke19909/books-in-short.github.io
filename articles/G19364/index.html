Everyone liked the gentle stylish doll, which dresses in beautiful outfits made of natural fabrics in pastel colors.  All tildes are alike.  Despite the different growth, completeness or color, they are easy to distinguish from many others.  Since the tilde is a handmade doll, there are no two identical ones.  What distinguishes them from each other? </p><p>  The individuality of the doll gives the costume.  Therefore, patterns of clothes for tild dolls are very diverse. </p><h2>  When is a tilde doll born </h2><p>  A feature of the Norwegian doll is the ability to sew to her part of the outfit during manufacture.  This can be a fixed underwear (T-shirt or T-shirt and panties), a corset or the entire upper part of the dress.  In this case, the pattern of the torso and arms will be from elegant fabric.  It remains only to sew a skirt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilda dolls in underwear" class="if uuid-3180269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3180269.jpg"></div><p>  For tild dolls, patterns of clothing that cannot be removed will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  Body - a torso pattern from the neckline to the bottom (two parts).  Can be carved from lace fabric, satin, batiste. </li><li>  Pantaloons - a pattern of legs from the sewing line to the torso to the knee (two parts).  Part of the torso from the waist to the hips (two parts).  Decorated with small lace or broach. </li><li>  The lower shirt is a torso pattern from the d√©collet√© line to the waist (two parts), a left arm pattern from the shoulder to the elbow (two parts), a right arm pattern from the shoulder to the elbow (two parts).  It is sewn of thin white fabric, decorated with lace on cuffs. </li><li>  Corset - torso pattern from the neckline to the waist (two parts).  Sewn from black or red velvet, satin, decorated with lacing.  A white shirt is required for such a corset. </li></ul><p>  For a skirt, you can choose a nylon ribbon and cut segments from it for three tiers.  The lowest tier looks better if it is made of a wide strip, with large folds.  The closer the tier rises to the waist, the shorter the belt should be and less folds.  Otherwise, it will turn out not a stylish tilde, but a woman on a teapot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When tilde changes dress </h2><p>  Over time, a non-removable outfit will fade, get dirty and require replacement.  If the trousers under the skirt are not striking, then the blouse that has lost its appearance spoils the whole impression.  You can gently tear open the handles and sew new ones.  If you want, this is the best option.  But there is another way.  These are options for patterns of clothes for tilde dolls that do not require complex construction (based on rectangles and stripes). </p><p>  Such dresses can be sewn by measuring the fabric directly on the doll.  The principle here is simple: the volume of the arm determines the volume of the sleeve, the volume of the hips - the width of the skirt.  For a very wide one, a 2: 1 coefficient is chosen, that is, two hips, for an average - 1.5, for a very small expansion - 1.2.  Directly on the doll with the help of pins, folds are laid and sewn by hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.luulla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothing that does not require patterns" class="if uuid-3180270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3180270.jpg"></div><p>  You can not tear off the doll‚Äôs hands and don‚Äôt alter them, but sew a dress for her, which will cover the white fabric of the handles and corset.  So that he does not shine through the dress, choose a dark fabric.  Such a dress is sewn on a base pattern. </p><h2>  How to take Tilda's measurements </h2><p>  The tilde's shape is streamlined, its contours are smooth.  It is easy to increase or decrease.  Now you can meet very small pupae, and large, in human height.  There were even bbw.  And the ballerina dolls remained fragile and elegant.  Measurements depend on the particular pupa.  To sew clothes for tild dolls with your own hands, patterns are best done independently by standards.  What measurements need to be taken and how is this done? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Two laces are tied to the doll: on the neck and on the waist.  These markers will be repelled when taking measurements. </p><ul><li>  The width of the chest is measured from one side seam to the other along the d√©collet√© line.  This is the half girth of the chest (Cg). </li><li>  Waist width is measured along the lace from one side seam to another.  This is the waist circumference (St). </li><li>  The width of the shoulders is measured from one place of suturing the arm through the chest to the other (Shp). </li><li>  On the back, measure from the lace on the neck to the lace on the waist (Dst). </li><li>  From the upper point of the hand-in to the hand, the measurement is dr. </li><li>  Arm girth is measured at the armpit level.  This is Ohr. </li><li>  The girth of the neck is measured by the lace on the neck.  This is Osh. </li><li>  From the lower point of stitching the hands in the side seam to the waist - a measure of the height of the chest Vg. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilda doll pattern" class="if uuid-3181517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3181517.jpg"></div><p>  The remaining measurements can be taken by analogy with the doll‚Äôs sewing drawing.  The figure shows a common pattern of a tilde doll, clothes for which are sewn on it.  Her height is 35 centimeters. </p><h2>  Building a base pattern: back </h2><p>  The procedure for constructing a back pattern: </p><ol><li>  Draw a rectangle with a length equal to Cr and a height equal to Dst. </li><li>  Measure the center line and mark the intersection at the top and bottom. </li><li>  ¬º Osh is laid back from the upper intersection point. </li><li>  Two millimeters are laid down from the top intersection point.  Draw an arc through this and the two previous points.  This is the collar sewing line. </li><li>  Five millimeters are laid down from the top intersection point.  Draw a horizontal line.  The highest point of the sleeve is laid on it, departing 1.8 cm from each point of intersection of the sewing line of the collar with the upper horizontal line of the rectangle. </li><li>  From the lower intersection of the rectangle, the center line is laid 2.2 cm in each direction. </li><li>  From the bottom point of intersection of the rectangle, the center line is laid out the measure of Br and draw a horizontal line.  Connect the points where it intersects with the vertical lines of the rectangle with those obtained in step 6. </li><li>  Connect the points obtained in paragraph 7 and paragraph 5 by an arc.  This is the sleeve threading line. </li></ol><p>  The back is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Building a base pattern: shelf </h2><p>  The order of construction of the pattern shelves: </p><ol><li>  Copy half of the back pattern to a separate sheet. </li><li>  Draw a neckline using a compass.  The diagram shows the arrow. </li><li>  1.5 cm are added to the fastener along the center line. </li></ol><p>  Using individual drawings, you can simulate patterns of clothes for Tilda with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilda Denim Jacket" class="if uuid-3182015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3182015.jpg"></div><h2>  Jacket for Tilda </h2><p>  On the basis of the pattern, you can sew a denim jacket.  To do this, take denim of the thinnest weave.  All seams are trimmed with white threads.  Small details are important to smooth.  These are pockets and a collar.  The bottom of the product is bent and sewn, simulating a belt.  To do this, you need to make an increase to the pattern in half a centimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Denim jacket" class="if uuid-3181662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3181662.jpg"></div><p>  The figure shows a pattern for a doll with a height of 35 centimeters, which can be sewn in the sizes given above.  If your tilde has a different height, you can use the principles of building the foundation and draw a pattern of Tilda's clothes in full size.  Measurements are taken similarly to those shown in the figure for sewing dolls. </p><p>  Product Assembly: </p><ol><li>  Pockets are sewn onto the sleeve and on the shelf.  Build up. </li><li>  Suture the shoulder seams.  Build up. </li><li>  Sew on the collar.  Build up. </li><li>  Sew side seams.  Build up. </li><li>  Stitch sleeves. </li><li>  Bend the bottom of the product and flash it.  Build up. </li></ol><p>  If desired, you can put the buttons on the shelf so that the jacket fastens. </p><h2>  Simple pattern of trousers </h2><p>  A huge advantage of sewing clothes for rag dolls is tilds - patterns can be stabbed directly on the doll, since it includes pins.  You can sew a dress according to the pattern of the jacket.  There is no point in building a fluffy skirt according to the pattern.  Measuring the waist and hips, it is easy to cut from the fabric.  For creases, leave three centimeters for stock. </p><p>  Tilde trousers are better not to be sewn to the waist, they will not suit her.  Small models sitting on hips - this is her option.  Sewing them is easy, you do not need to build a drawing for this.  Putting the chrysalis on the fabric folded in half, measure the length of the trousers.  They should reach at least to the wrists.  If a little higher - that's okay.  The width of the trousers is measured along the bottom of the torso, where the legs are sewn.  This is the widest place.  One centimeter allowance is given for freedom - 0.5 cm on each side.  The place where the legs are sewn is measured - this is the beginning of the legs.  Cut to this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothing for Tilda" class="if uuid-3182050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3182050.jpg"></div><p>  A two centimeter allowance is left for the hem and elastic at the waist.  The bottom edge of the legs can simply be hemmed with a stitch, or you can insert a lace.  For simple trousers, skirts, vestments, do not build drawings.  Just put the chrysalis on the tissue and measure the control points, then connect them.  This is how life-size tilde patterns are obtained. </p><h2>  Boho style clothes </h2><p>  Boho style allows you to combine lace and leather, ethno and classic, bulky shoes and frivolous chintz floral.  Such elements, assembled together, create an image of comfort.  For an interior doll, this is what you need.  There are several stylistic trends of boho: classic, eco, hippie, vintage. </p><p>  Skirts must be fluffy, with a lot of frills.  The basic measurement for them is from the waist to the toes of the tilde's legs.  Patterns of boho clothes are required only to create sleeves and a bodice, while skirts are laid directly on the fabric.  The pupa is placed on a piece of fabric, the waist and the widest place of the torso (where the legs are sewn) are measured out, connecting lines are drawn.  Give an allowance of one centimeter from both ends.  There will be two such details.  Sew side seams, sew frills from guipure, lace, chiffon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Boho clothes" class="if uuid-3182345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3182345.jpg"></div><p>  At the back of the skirt, you can make a hook clasp or button so that you can remove it.  The jacket is made according to the principle of undershirts with one-piece sleeves.  They can be decorated with long lace cuffs or just tuck.  Remember to give the doll a bulk bag. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Sewing for a doll is not just a game.  This is an opportunity to get a hand to work with various tissues, and gain experience in modeling.  Patterns of clothes for tilda can be built in three ways: classic, with the construction of drawings, measuring the dimensions in full size and combining from rectangular cuts and ribbons. </p><p>  All three methods broaden your horizons and increase your skill.  If you are not using any of them yet, there is a reason to try to sew a new little thing for your tilde. </p>
