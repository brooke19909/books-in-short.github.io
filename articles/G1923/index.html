Many readers know not only every day, but also almost the hour of his life.  And all the same, it remains a mystery how this man who spent almost the entire beginning of the twentieth century abroad (up to one thousand nine hundred and seventeen) managed to lead the Russian revolution, come to power at the head of his party, and the most important thing is to keep it.  The years of Lenin's rule begin with the year when the Great Revolution took place.  Bloody event for Russia! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="years of reign of Lenin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/581422.jpg" width="439"></div>

    <h2>  Good old man who loved children and peasants so much, but most of all abroad </h2><p>  In Soviet Russia, everyone was fed the image of the great leader - the good grandfather of Lenin.  A sweet old man who infinitely loved the proletariat.  But, what did this good-natured old man who loved to spend time abroad think about the people, as well as the <span>methods of managing the</span> unfortunate inhabitants of Russia?  Vladimir Ilyich quite openly promotes the idea that the authorities need not only to intimidate a defeated country and its people.  The population must be broken! </p><p>  Just conquering the Russian Empire was not enough for bankers such as Schiff, Morgan, Warburg.  They needed guarantees that this great country would not rise anymore.  It will not capture the path by which bread came from Turkey to Europe.  They had to be sure that the Russian peasant would no longer ruin the British wheat producer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the reign of Lenin" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/581427.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Destruction of a market economy </h2><p>  It was important for the authorities of the United States of America and Great Britain that the Russians did not begin expansion into the Far East again.  In this regard, Vladimir Lenin, having done away with the Russian intelligentsia, takes on the peasantry.  It must be said that in the early years of Lenin's rule there was no famine in the villages.  Disruptions occurred only in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  But Vladimir Ilyich, who knew very well that product policy could work effectively only in conditions of hunger, decides to organize it independently.  During the reign of Lenin, the state‚Äôs food market was actually destroyed.  He introduces executions for private trade.  This is what helps to create hunger in big cities.  His next step was to incite anger towards the peasants of the working class, relying on the fact that the latter did not want to provide the city with bread. </p><h2>  Hand over bread or live to the ground </h2><p>  Hiding behind an artificially created famine, the Bolsheviks began a war with villages and villages.  Food detachments began to be sent there to withdraw the stocks of bread.  Because of this, famine now also begins in the villages.  The process of taking bread itself was a terrible way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="results of the reign of Lenin" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/581419.jpg" width="313"></div>

And when he didn‚Äôt turn out, because it was not the first food detachment, they took the first man and buried him alive in the ground.  Vladimir Ilyich loved his people very much! </p><h2>  Terrible famine in the once richest empire </h2><p>  Thanks to the efforts of the Bolsheviks during the reign of Lenin, a terrible famine began.  And this despite the fact that even before the revolution, the Russian Empire could not only feed itself, but also undermine grain production in England.  Now, the people were forced to survive by collecting berries and mushrooms, and sometimes swans.  The leadership knew this very well, since it was the fruit of their work.  But, according to Trotsky, this was not yet a famine.  He cited Jerusalem as an example when Titus took it.  Then Jewish mothers ate their own children. </p><p>  But in fact, there were no problems in Russia with stocks of bread.  Those who served Vladimir Ilyich faithfully were paid in gold and fed to the full.  The famine helped to set off not only workers and peasants, but also began to rob the Russian churches.  During the reign of Lenin, Russian churches were not just burned; at first, representatives of the new government robbed church property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="date of reign of Lenin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/581413.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <h2>  Uprising Against Usurpers </h2><p>  It should be noted that the peasants fiercely resisted the regime of Vladimir Ilyich.  Mass rebellions broke out across the state.  People who were driven to despair began to take up arms.  Everywhere a burning hatred of the Bolsheviks grew. </p><p>  For Russian people, it became clear that enemies in the state seized power.  In one thousand nine hundred and eighteenth year, the Tambov province revolted.  Its population was about four million.  And from the twentieth there arose the Tambov People‚Äôs Republic and the partisan region with their three armies from thirty regiments of peasants. </p><p>  The destruction of mass peasant uprisings killed more than two million people.  Almost the same thing happened all over the country.  These were the results of the reign of Lenin.  The common people resisted the new usurper power as best they could.  And, which is characteristic, the Red Army suffered its main losses not in battles with the White Guard, but in the war against its own population - peasants. </p><p>  The date of the reign of Lenin was connected with the <span>Great October Revolution,</span> which was to liberate the common people from the autocracy of the kings.  But what was the main reason for the coup, it became clear after the first months of the leadership of Vladimir Ilyich.  Lenin very tough, bloody and stubbornly solved his task - to destroy the Russian state, Russian power. </p>
