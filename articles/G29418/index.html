Perceiving masks as a symbol of costume masquerades, they are not taken seriously enough.  Those who choose the <span>ethnic style</span> in the design of the room, prefer the so-called African original art, without thinking about the fact that masks are not just ordinary decoration for the walls.  And many acquire the outwardly liked little thing, considering it a protective spirit for the home, not knowing anything about its meaning. </p><h2>  Access to the other world </h2><p>  The African mask, which appeared in antiquity, played an extremely important role in mystical rites, personifying the spirit of ancestors and creating a special atmosphere.  The carved work of art has always been an occult object, opening access to the invisible world of the dead.  In <span>African tribes,</span> masks were used to combine life and death, they became a kind of key that opens the door to the other world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="african mask" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1099953.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  The main value is protection </h2><p>  A magical totem item has its own meaning and carries certain information about cultural and religious traditions.  Each tribe was confident in the existence of parallel worlds, and the spirits were divided into friendly and hostile.  Those who wanted to harm, carefully watched each of the tribe, trying to send diseases and misfortunes.  And then an African mask came to the rescue, the significance of which for its creator was one - protection from the dark forces through their deception.  It was believed that if the spirits did not see the face, then they could not do any harm, and the resident of the tribe was guarded by the totem item.  However, not everyone could defend themselves so against spirits: masks, which became an invariable attribute of power, were worn only by initiated and noble men, which only strengthened their authority. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A variety of types of masks </h2><p>  The African mask was of different types, most often it had openings for the eyes, and a mouth cut was made much less often.  The construction was held on laces, sometimes those participating in ritual rites held their teeth by the inner rod of wood.  There were masks that were worn on the forehead or worn like a helmet to the shoulders, respectively, their weight and size varied. </p>

    <p>  The African mask used in the rituals from a tree of various species and depicting animals was recognized by researchers of the most ancient African culture.  Later it was already made of strange geometric shapes, with features resembling human ones.  The tree was generously impregnated with oil so that the mask did not rot, and for a long time it was polished to a shine.  Bright vegetable paints were applied to the surface, and for expressiveness and a frightening effect, leather or metal objects were added, decorated with variegated feathers and beads. </p><h2>  Evolution: from the primitive to the realistic </h2><p>  Over time, the African mask evolved, it was cut out as the embodiment of a spirit that helps in various fields.  The design worn on the face symbolized the bearer of strength, wealth, fertility, with its help it caused rains in dry weather, asked for help in the hunt.  To enhance expressive function and a greater resemblance to nature, even real teeth were inserted and hair was glued.  From simplified and crude, as if cut down, images passed to the transfer of talented realism of nature.  Masks could carry distinctive tribal features in the form of tattoos, ornaments or hairstyles.  And the images of the leaders were characterized by obvious portrait similarities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The African mask also got rid of the frozen expression, it began to reproduce a whole gamut of feelings - tears, laughter, irony, threat.  The repulsive malevolent appearance implied a strict prohibition on scrutinizing the image.  Such masks were used in <span>terrible rituals of</span> sacrifice, when even a casual glance could cost a life to the uninitiated in the ritual. </p><h2>  Do not rush with the purchase </h2><p>  Do not treat carved masks as evidence of the primitive culture of Africans, and bring such a vivid manifestation of their creativity into the house.  The bizarre images that are born in the hands of masters do not always bring happiness and luck to the home.  Experts recommend first finding out the meaning of the masks, and then making a purchasing decision. </p>
