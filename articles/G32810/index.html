    <p>  The city of Yeysk is famous for its developed hotel chain.  On its lands there are many recreation centers and several pensions.  In 2007, more than 285,000 people improved their health here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The most popular in Yeysk is a holiday by the sea.  Every year, thousands of Russians seek to soak up the sand on a seashell and swim in the shallow sea in sunny summer.  Most of the beaches are concentrated on the Yeisk Spit.  There is also a children's and urban central beach.  At the very end of the Yeisk Spit there is a very interesting "Youth" beach.  It is near it that the underwater current passes, thanks to which the sea is especially deep here.  You must admit that Yeysk hotels offer an amazing vacation. </p><p>  South of the port is Kamenka beach, which is especially popular.  Its north side is mostly sandy, and the south is completely strewn with pebbles.  The sea here is very shallow.  Numerous shallows come to the surface during low tides.  They form huge "islands" of sand.  The deeper sea begins only a few hundred meters from the coast.  Separate small beaches are equipped in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe second microdistrict on the coast of the Yeisk estuary.  Many recommend holidays in Yeysk.  The hotels here are simply fabulous.  The coastline has an incredible length.  But the lack of high-quality beach land in the city is still felt.  This problem is especially acute at the peak of the holiday season.  Indeed, at this time, the density of people on the basic beaches of the city becomes too high. </p><h2>  Family and children rest </h2><p>  In Yeysk, family vacations are practiced very energetically.  On the beaches of the city there is an incredible amount of water rides.  On the Taganrog embankment in 2007, a dolphinarium was ransacked.  And by 2008, a water park appeared near it.  On the city central beach and in the park of I. M. Poddubny there are several dozens of attractions.  Here you can ride a roller coaster.  At the disposal of vacationers are two Ferris wheels.  There are several cafes for kids in the city: Ficus, Penguin and others.  Movies can be seen in the cinema "Premier" and "Homeland". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
