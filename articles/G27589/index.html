  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human genetics and his health</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Genetics as a science was born at the beginning of the twentieth century, and in the 50s it experienced an intense upsurge.  Human genetics is a section in science that studies the structure <span>of human populations, the</span> characteristics of heredity and <span>hereditary diseases.</span>  This science studies man at the molecular, cellular, biogeochemical, organismic, population, and bio-chorological levels. </p><p>  Human genetics is closely related to medicine and anthropology.  Medical genetics is studying the patterns of transmission of hereditary diseases from generation to generation, the role of heredity in a variety of human pathologies, that is, hereditary pathology (defects, diseases, malformations, etc.), as well as the development of diagnostic methods, prevention and treatment of pathologies, including including diseases with a hereditary predisposition.  Its task is to timely identify sick children, develop recommendations and appointments for their treatment, and, very importantly, find the carrier of these diseases (one of the parents).  Anthropogenetics studies the variability and heredity of normal features of the human body. </p><p>  Despite the fact that human genetics is a relatively young trend in science, studies of recent years are gradually starting to unveil the veil of secrecy of the human gene pool.  Genetics and human health <strong> </strong>  are interconnected, and science already knows several thousand diseases, actually genetic, 100% dependent on the genotype of the individual.  The most terrible of them are galactosemia, acid pancreatic fibrosis (cystic fibrosis), phenylketonuria, hypercholesterolemia, <strong> </strong>  alkaptonuria, Down syndrome, Shereshevsky-Turner, Kleinfelter, as well as various forms of cretinism and hemoglobinopathy.  In addition, there are diseases that depend on both the environment and the genotype: diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid and some oncological diseases, coronary disease, gastrointestinal ulcers, schizophrenia and some other mental illnesses.  And here it is especially important for doctors to understand how decrypted data can be used in treatment, and most importantly - in the prevention of numerous hereditary diseases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Genetics of</span> human <span>sex</span> is that section of genetics that studies the role of the mechanism of heredity, as well as hereditary variation in determining sex.  Success in this area has made possible the prevention and timely treatment of hereditary diseases. </p><p>  Modern medicine and medical genetics always focus on the <span>prevention of hereditary diseases.</span>  Prenatal (prenatal) diagnosis is a diagnostic study of the fetus during pregnancy to identify its genetic defects.  In order to assess the <span>intrauterine development of the</span> fetus, various methods of prenatal diagnosis are used: ultrasound screening, biochemical blood tests, hemostasiogram, cardiotocography, etc. </p><p>  Amniocentesis occupies a leading place among the methods that make it possible to diagnose a child‚Äôs disease even before birth.  The method consists in obtaining amniotic fluid and fetal cells with a puncture (under the control of ultrasound) of the fetal bladder.  It allows you to diagnose certain diseases and <span>chromosomal diseases,</span> which are based on gene mutations.  Such a diagnosis is recommended for absolutely all pregnant women. </p><p>  Advances in science and technology have exposed modern people <strong>to</strong> greater risks with regard to adverse variability than they did during the previous period of the formation and development of human civilization.  Chemical, physical and, quite possibly, biological mutagens may in the future pose a very serious threat to the genetic structure of the population. </p><p>  Human genetics clearly shows that all races are absolute, from a biological point of view, are equivalent and have equal opportunities for their development, determined by socio-historical conditions, and not genetic. </p>
