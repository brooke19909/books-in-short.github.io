This includes all types of organisms that eat foods with protein, carbohydrates and fats.  Such species differ from plants in that they constantly synthesize <span>organic substances</span> necessary for life from certain sources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoology is" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682272.jpg" width="600"></div>  Many representatives of the animal genus are able to move independently.  Mushrooms have always been considered plants.  However, they noticed that they have the ability to absorb <span>organic matter</span> from external sources.  There are also organisms that synthesize starch from inorganic molecules.  However, they do not have the ability to move.  In other words, it is impossible to give a general concept and highlight alternative criteria between animals and plants, since they do not exist.

    <h2>  Categorization </h2><p>  In this case, there is a division into many areas that differentiate depending on which particular object is being studied and which problems are being studied.  Zoology is a science that is divided into two main areas.  Namely, the study of invertebrates and vertebrates.  Also, these disciplines may include these disciplines: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Protistology.  In this case, the study of protozoa is carried out. </p><p>  - Ichthyology - the study of fish. </p><p>  - Helminthology - the study of parasitic worms. </p><p>  - Malacology - a study of mollusks. </p><p>  - Acarology - the study of ticks. </p><p>  - Entomology - the study of insects. </p><p>  - Carcinology - the study of crustaceans. </p><p>  - Herpetology - a study of reptiles and amphibians. </p><p>  - Ornithology - the study of birds. </p><p>  - Theriology - the study of mammals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoology is" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How important is zoology for humanity? </h2><p>  Consider this item in more detail.  A rather peculiar history of development in this science.  Animal zoology has always played an important role in human life.  Looking at these individuals, their behavior, skills, <span>ancient people</span> better understood the environment.  After all, mankind needed to learn to hunt birds and animals on their own, how and where to fish, how to protect themselves from predators.  And all these skills could be learned from animals.  Zoology is a science with ancient roots and an interesting rich history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoology animal science" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the first time in the 4th century BC  this science became known from the books of the great scientist - Aristotle.  This is a reliable fact.  In his books, he described the origin of about 500 species of different animals.  Some of them had red blood, and some were without it at all.  Also in the works of this scientist, the significance of each species of animal was described, as well as their development and structure.  Such a detailed description has become a real encyclopedia. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, this science continued to develop history.  Zoology has moved one step further every year.  Some important information about animals, which became known in ancient times, were forgotten.  Scientists focused only on breeding, hunting and keeping animals.  Lost interest increased again only in the Renaissance.  At that time, attention was paid to shipping and trade.  Thanks to this, numerous expeditions were conducted aimed at the study of new species of plants and animals, of which nothing was previously known. </p><p>  Karl Linney also played an important role in the development of zoology.  It was he who classified the animal kingdom and gave scientific names for each definition in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoology meaning zoology" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, the history of development does not end there.  Zoology is greatly improved in the second half of the XIX century.  This is after Charles Darwin published a book on the Origin of Species by Natural Selection.  In his work, he proved a certain fact.  It lies in the fact that the surrounding world is changing due to natural selection.  That is, new individuals are <span>fighting for existence</span> and survival, and only the strongest remain.  Thanks to this basis, zoology - the science of animals - began to develop rapidly.  These successes will be known in taxonomy.  There will be a description of the emergence of new species of animals. </p><p>  Also, the history of the formation of zoology will become known in Russia after expeditions to the east and north of Siberia.  They were implemented by A.F. Middendorf, N.M. Przhevalsky, Semenov-Tian-Shansky.  Scientific expeditions in Central Asia were also conducted on embryology by I. I. Mechnikov and A. O. Kovalevsky, and on paleontology - by V. O. Kovalevsky, and in physiology - I. M. Sechenov and I. P. Pavlov. </p><h2>  Zoology today </h2><p>  This may include a combination of animal sciences.  Certain directions are taken into account here.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Zoology of man. </li><li>  Paleontology - the study of fossils and the transformation of animals in the process of evolution. </li><li>  Physiology - the study of the functions of cells and the body as a whole. </li><li>  The most important link in zoology is ecology.  It is devoted to the relationship of representatives of the animal world between themselves and other organisms.  She studies their influence on the outside world, that is, their relationship with the environment. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of zoology" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682273.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  As mentioned earlier, zoology studies birds, mammals and insects.  For a simpler perception, this science was divided into special sections.  This will be described later. </p><h2>  The main sections of zoology </h2><p>  These include: </p><ul><li>  <em>The taxonomy of animals.</em>  This is a certain science.  She examines animals.  Here they are divided into classes, building a hierarchy.  This section also gives an explanation of how and why the animal kingdom arose, and so on. </li><li>  <em>Morphology of animals.</em>  This is a science that studies the structure of the animal‚Äôs body. </li><li>  <em>Ecology of animals.</em>  Here we observe the habitat and determine the relationship of animals with it. </li><li>  <em>Comparative or evolutionary morphology.</em>  This is a science that explains the origin of animals of various types.  It also explains the comparative evolution. </li><li>  <em>Ethology.</em>  Here we study the behavior of animals in the process of evolution. </li><li>  <em>Zoogeography.</em>  This science monitors the habitat, studies the structure of animals existing in various environments. </li><li>  <em>Paleozoology</em> .  This is a study of <span>prehistoric animals.</span>  This section resembles the science of animal evolution. </li><li>  <em>Physiology</em> .  This section examines the various functions of the animal. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human zoology" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682269.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  In general, zoology is a science that is directly related to other disciplines and directions.  For example, she has a very close relationship with medicine. </p><h2>  Diverse animal world </h2><p>  It is very large and multifaceted.  Animals live everywhere - in fields, steppes and forests, air, seas, oceans, lakes and rivers. </p><p>  In our world, there are individuals such as parasites who have chosen the organism of an animal or a person as their area.  Individuals of this type can be seen on plants.  For example, these are caterpillars, aphids and ticks. </p><h2>  The value of animals </h2><p>  There are many individuals that benefit not only nature but also man.  For example, these are bees, beetles, flies and butterflies.  They pollinate many flowers and plants.  Also important in nature are birds.  They carry plant seeds over long distances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of zoology" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682270.jpg" width="417"></div>

    <p>  There are animals that harm plants and destroy crops.  However, this does not prove that their existence is meaningless.  They can be the main link in the food chain of various individuals.  All this determines what zoology matters.  Zoology in this direction is an indispensable science. </p><h2>  Pets and wild animals </h2><p>  It is very important for each person to get protein and carbohydrates from meat.  Previously, there were no shops and supermarkets, this product was obtained through hunting.  Then people learned how to fish and gained skills in its breeding. </p><p>  Also, humanity has learned to domesticate wild cattle and use it for their own purposes.  Its breeding made it possible to obtain products such as meat, milk, eggs, etc.  Thanks to animals, people learned to get wool, fluff and skin and used it for their needs. </p><p>  About 10 thousand years ago, man first domesticated a wild wolf.  These were the very first ancestors of the dog.  Now these animals are considered the most faithful and loyal friends of people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="definition of zoology" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/682267.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But animal husbandry began with the domestication of horses.  They were indispensable in the household. </p><h2>  Animal differences and similarities </h2><p>  All individuals of this species are usually distinguished by type, structure of respiration, reproduction, development, and so on.  Animals differ from plants in that they do not have a solid cellulosic membrane.  They feed on ready-made organic substances.  Animals are characterized by active movement.  As a result of this, they themselves can seek food. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  All of the above indicates what versatility this definition has.  Zoology plays an important role in the life of every creature on our planet.  This was described above.  Everything is interconnected in this world.  And zoology is life itself. </p>
