Sights and beaches of this country attract more and more travelers every year.  More details about it will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  Brazil was opened in 1500 by a Portuguese expedition led by Pedra Alvarez Cabral.  Over time, the colonization of the region began, which was directly subordinate to the Portuguese king.  In connection with the issuance in 1574 of a decree banning the use of local Indians as a free labor force, the mass importation of African slaves began here.  In 1889, the country was proclaimed a republic.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, about five million migrants from Japan and Europe moved here. </p><p>  For a long time the state was dominated by capital of British origin, which in the thirties of the last century was supplanted by American investment.  Since 1967, the state became known as the Federative Republic of Brazil (photos are presented below).  Since 1985, the country has embarked on a democratic path of development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Federative Republic of Brazil photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1008115.jpg" width="600"></div>
