    <p>  First of all, travelers note a really convenient location, as there is a large grocery market, many shops and cafes, a shopping center, health salons, etc. near the hotel. The hotel area is clean and well-groomed.  The rooms stand out with a truly original design.  The rooms are spacious, although not all have large balconies.  Furniture and appliances are in good condition, cold and hot water are constantly supplied. </p><p>  Food may seem a little monotonous.  On the other hand, near the hotel and in the city center there are a lot of catering establishments of different price categories and a varied menu - every traveler here will find something to his liking.  The beach is relatively clean.  The advantage is a large number of water rides, the cost of which is quite affordable. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel it can be boring, but you should understand that this is a three-star hotel, and the living conditions here fully correspond to the category.  All employees, without exception, are polite, friendly and helpful, but very few speak Russian, so you should learn a little English. </p>
