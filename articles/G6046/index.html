After all, impressions from the rest largely depend on this.  And even if you do not plan to spend a lot of time in the room, you probably want to return to neat, clean and comfortable apartments.  According to many travelers, the most reliable source of information about hotels around the world are the reviews of those people who have already happened to visit this or that place.  After all, tourists try to tell not only about the advantages, but also about the shortcomings of the hotel.  Therefore, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots who have already stayed at Andaman Cannacia Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Phuket).  Looking ahead a bit, we note that the vast majority of travelers were very pleased with their choice.  Of course, there are some features here, but our compatriots are ready to recommend this hotel to anyone who plans to have a great rest on the island of Phuket.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket andaman cannacia resort spa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1051919.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, experienced tourists are advised to settle in the upper buildings if possible.  In this case, you will almost certainly be provided with a beautiful panoramic view of the hotel surroundings and the sea directly from your room.  According to some of our compatriots, they were delighted with the opportunity to enjoy the sunset and the azure sea, sitting comfortably in the jacuzzi on the terrace.  In general, all the rooms, according to travelers, are quite spacious, stylishly decorated, clean and comfortable.  The equipment here is not very modern, but everything works quite well.  If something fails, then after contacting the reception all problems will be quickly eliminated.  The only minus some tourists considered the fact that the apartments have insufficient lighting.  Therefore, those who, for example, want to spend the evening reading a book, may be a bit dark.  In addition, our compatriots recommend going to this hotel to grab mosquito repellent from the house and, if possible, not to open the doors to the balcony once again so as not to let these little annoying insects inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="andaman cannacia resort spa 4 phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1051920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Andaman Cannacia Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel (Phuket Island) has a rather compact territory, here, according to the guests, there are several nice places where you can have a great rest.  With particular enthusiasm, travelers remember the pool terrace, which offers stunning views of the sea and the surrounding area. </p><p>  As for the location of the hotel, then, according to many of our compatriots, it is quite controversial.  So, the fact is that the hotel is located on a hill, so the road to it goes steeply uphill.  Some guests took this feature positively, stating that unnecessary physical exercise had not disturbed anyone.  However, for older people and parents with young children, this feature can create some inconvenience.  But in any case, if you do not want to walk, you can use the free shuttle service provided by the hotel.  So, several times a day a bus leaves from here to the beach and the shopping area.  In addition, many tourists vacationing in Thailand prefer to rent scooters for their entire vacation.  It is very inexpensive and very convenient.  After all, you can go on your own to any beach, and also go around all the surroundings without resorting to taxi services or travel agencies.  In addition, renting a scooter will also solve the problem of steep climb to the hotel, which does not have to be overcome on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="andaman cannacia resort spa reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1051921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  The work of the maids at Phuket Andaman Cannacia Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, our compatriots, judging by their reviews, were satisfied.  So, they note that wet cleaning was carried out daily.  The maids regularly replenished supplies of personal hygiene products, changed towels and bedding.  In addition, almost every day they built funny figures from towels on the beds, decorating them with flower petals. </p><h2>  Check in </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, as a rule, upon arrival at this hotel you will have to wait for a couple of hours for the room keys.  But you will immediately be offered to stay in the lobby and be treated to freshly squeezed fruit juice.  Newly arrived guests do not have to sit at the reception waiting for check-in.  So, you can change clothes and go to the pool or restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel andaman cannacia resort spa 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1051922.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in this hotel includes breakfast only.  According to tourists, they cannot be called particularly diverse, but there is always something to choose from, and no one will remain hungry here.  You can have lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant.  As our compatriots note, they cook here very tasty, but the prices are an order of magnitude higher than in the surrounding cafes.  Therefore, many travelers preferred to eat outside the Andaman Cannacia Resort &amp; Spa during the day. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As already noted, the nearest Kata beach can be reached by bus at the hotel.  But some of the guests preferred to walk ashore.  According to them, the road takes no more than 10 minutes.  The beach here is quite large, sandy.  However, sometimes under the feet are sharp needles falling from fir trees growing along the coast.  The sea in this place is quite calm and clean.  Most beach visitors bring mats and parasols with them.  However, if you wish, you can rent a sunbed for an additional fee. </p>
