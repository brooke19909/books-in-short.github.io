Geographic features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The warm Black Sea, the golden sand of beaches, beautiful nature, the warm welcome of local residents, a rich history and culture, a lot of attractions - this is Bulgaria.  Where is it located, in what country of Slavic lands can you find mountains, sea and historical sights?  We will talk about this in our article.  We will also do a short review of the main <span>resorts in Bulgaria</span> and its main iconic places. </p><p>  This country of the former socialist camp was accessible to tourists from the USSR.  Now the hotels have undergone a complete renovation.  Tour prices have also risen.  But still, Bulgaria remains a budget direction.  This country specializes in children's vacations.  Both groups of schoolchildren and families with kids come here.  But you can come to Bulgaria not only in the summer.  This state lies in a mountainous area and is famous for its ski resorts.  Of course, Bansko and Borovets cannot be compared with Courchevel in terms of service, but beginner skiers will really like it here without special requests. </p>

    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  So where is Bulgaria located?  It is located in southeastern Europe.  In the north, it borders the Danube with Romania, and in the south - with Turkey and Greece.  The western cordon connects the country with Macedonia and Serbia.  Well, from the east, Bulgaria is washed by the Black Sea.  Therefore, we can say that it borders on our country through this water area.  The area of ​​Bulgaria is comparable with the size of Iceland - 110.5 thousand square kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the nature here is so diverse that I can’t believe it: how did such a small space fit high mountains, deep gorges, wide plains, hills and plateaus?  The capital of the country is Sofia, which means “wisdom”.  The population of this city is 2 million people.  Other large settlements: Plovdiv (in the south of the country), Varna (in the northeast), Ruse (on the banks of the Danube), Burgas (in the east).  The longest waterway in Bulgaria is the Iskar River (368 kilometers).  And the highest point of the country is Mount Musala in the Rila massif (almost 3 thousand meters in height). </p>

    <h2>  Relief </h2><p>  The name of the peninsula where Bulgaria is located is Balkan.  It is distinguished by its rugged relief.  In a relatively small area, several mountain ranges, as well as river valleys, plateaus and lowlands, fit immediately.  Stara Planina, 600 kilometers long, divides Bulgaria into two parts - northern and southern.  These mountains, which are a continuation of the Carpathians, play a large role in the formation of climate. </p><p>  The highest point of the Old Planina is Botev (2376 meters).  In the west of the country are three mountain ranges.  The Pirin massif stretches 75 kilometers along the south of Bulgaria.  The highest peak here is Vihren (2914 meters).  Rila's array is small.  It is located in southwestern Bulgaria.  But it is here that the highest point of the country, and the entire Balkan Peninsula - Musala is located.  And finally, the Rhodope Mountains.  This system is the longest.  It occupies 83 percent of the <span>Balkan Peninsula.</span>  The Rhodopes stretch for 220 kilometers from Macedonia, through southwestern Bulgaria, to <span>Northern Greece.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Where Bulgaria is located, two natural zones converge.  North of Stara Planina a continental temperate climate is observed.  A mountain barrier prevents the penetration of cold winds.  Therefore, south of the Old Planina, the Mediterranean <span>subtropical climate</span> dominates <span>.</span>  In winter, when frosts and heavy snowfall are observed on the Danube lowland, a comfortable plus temperature is in the areas near the Greek and Turkish borders.  In the mountains there is a high-altitude zone.  Bulgaria has many elevated valleys with a very comfortable climate for housing.  In one of these is the capital of Sofia.  The Black Sea affects the climate only in a small coastal strip.  In winter, there are frequent storms and strong winds.  As for precipitation, their amount is extremely uneven.  Most of the rain falls on the northern slopes of the mountains (2.5 thousand millimeters per year), while on the Verkhne-Thracian lowland this figure is five times less.  In summer there are frequent droughts. </p><h2>  Where are Golden Sands in Bulgaria </h2><p>  Zlatni Pyasitsi - this is the name of this famous resort.  And the name is absolutely justified.  After all, Zlatni Pyasitsi is a multi-kilometer strip of beaches covered with golden sand.  Along them towering <span>hotels, pensions</span> and motels, which conduct balneotherapy at local sulfur springs.  This town is located between Kavarna and Varna.  As the resort Golden Sands began to develop in the mid-fifties of the last century.  Thus, the infrastructure of a beach holiday has already developed here.  There are a sufficient number of restaurants, cafes and entertainment.  Of the nearby attractions, the following are worth visiting: <span>Aladzha Monastery,</span> dug in the rocks, caves, nature reserve with deciduous forest.  Noisy young people come to Golden Sands - this resort has a lot of entertainment.  The beaches of the resort are awarded the Blue Flag every year. </p>

    <h2>  Sunny Beach </h2><p>  The Black Sea coast, where Bulgaria is located, is famous for its sandy beaches.  Therefore, the country primarily attracts “summer” tourists.  The entrance to the sea is often gentle, which is convenient for bathing children.  Sandy beaches occupy 25 percent of the entire coast.  One of these “typical” Bulgarian resorts is Sunny Beach.  The length of its golden sand beach is 10 kilometers.  Moreover, its width is one hundred meters.  Therefore, even in the peak season, you can easily find a place in the sun.  Where is Sunny Beach in Bulgaria?  It is located 30 kilometers north of Burgas.  This resort is famous as a place of family relaxation.  There are no mountains, most hotels are on the first line, a shallow, well-warming bay, beaches awarded the Blue Flag for cleanliness, and plenty of entertainment for children (including the country's largest water park). </p><h2>  Where is the Valley of Roses in Bulgaria </h2><p>  This country satisfies the information hunger of curious tourists.  Among the most popular excursions are the Valley of the Roses.  It is located in the center of the country, at the foot of the Old Planina, between the cities of Kazanlak and Karlovo. </p>

    <p>  The first cuttings of a damask oil rose were planted here by the Turks in the seventeenth century.  And since then, the valley has become a center for the production of essential aromas.  In addition to roses, lavender and mint are grown here.  But it is oil from the "Queen of Flowers" that is considered the most valuable.  It is used in cosmetology and perfumery. </p>
