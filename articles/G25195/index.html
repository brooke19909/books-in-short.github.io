This year many new devices were released, each of which has the latest technology and modern styles.  With so many options, it‚Äôs immediately difficult to determine which one will best suit your personal functional needs.  And whether it is necessary to invest significant amounts in large brands or is it enough just to buy a cheap analog of Apple Watch. </p><h2>  The right smartwatch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wareable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The right smartwatch" class="if uuid-2954611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954611.jpg"></div><p>  Many buyers focus on fitness trackers, so first you need to understand what SmartWatch is and how they differ from a fitness or sports tracker.  SmartWatch is a technology that connects to a custom smartphone.  This device usually has a touch screen, various applications that it supports, for example, it tracks steps and heart rate. </p><p>  There are several different key features that SmartWatch selects in order to best select the best Apple Watch counterparts: </p><ol><li>  Health tracking, for example, Fitbit. </li><li>  Compatibility.  You must first make sure that the watch that interested the buyer works with your smartphone.  For example, Apple watches only work with iPhone. </li><li>  Applications  Preliminarily get acquainted with the programs installed on the watch, and also study their user ratings. </li><li>  Notifications and messages.  All smart watches notify the user, but only some of them allow the user to answer messages and calls. </li><li>  The battery life of the best Apple Watch counterparts can range from a few days to several months.  Many of them depend on the installed functions, for example, GPS and heart rate monitoring will use the battery faster. </li><li>  Design.  For many consumers, the design and style of smart cards is a key factor in their choice.  Many SmartWatches look just like a regular watch, some of them are sports, but this is secondary.  Good looks do not compensate for a clumsy interface or buttons that are difficult to operate. </li></ol><h2>  Original Apple Watch 2018 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gntech.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original Apple Watch 2018" class="if uuid-2954612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954612.jpg"></div><p>  In 2018, you can buy the original Apple Watch series 4, like the Series 3, in the Apple Store or order online.  Prices range from $ 279 to $ 1,500.  You can buy the Apple Watch from third-party retailers, who also offer older models that Apple itself has stopped selling.  There are aluminum, cheaper, or stainless, more expensive versions of the Series 4 on sale, as well as numerous color straps available for both the Apple Watch series 4 and the 3rd model, including Hermes sport belts and Nike fashion belts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are two screen sizes for each model, the buyer can also choose whether he wants to pay for cellular communication or if GPS is enough for him. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Material </p></td><td><p>  Belt </p></td><td><p>  Price, $ </p><p>  40 mm, GPS </p></td><td><p>  Price, $ </p><p>  44 mm, GPS </p></td><td><p>  Price, $ </p><p>  40 mm cell </p></td><td><p>  Price, $ </p><p>  44 mm cell </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Aluminum </p></td><td><p>  Sports group </p></td><td><p>  399.0 </p></td><td><p>  429.0 </p></td><td><p>  499.0 </p></td><td><p>  529.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Aluminum </p></td><td><p>  Sports loop </p></td><td><p>  399.0 </p></td><td><p>  429.0 </p></td><td><p>  499.0 </p></td><td><p>  529.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Aluminum </p></td><td><p>  Nike Sports Band </p></td><td><p>  399.0 </p></td><td><p>  429.0 </p></td><td><p>  499.0 </p></td><td><p>  529.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Aluminum </p></td><td><p>  Nike sport loop </p></td><td><p>  399.0 </p></td><td><p>  429.0 </p></td><td><p>  499.0 </p></td><td><p>  529.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Sports group </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  699.0 </p></td><td><p>  749.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Sports loop </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  699.0 </p></td><td><p>  749.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Milan loop </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  799.0 </p></td><td><p>  849.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Hermes leather single </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  1249.0 </p></td><td><p>  1299.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Hermes Leather Double </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  1399.0 </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Hermes Leather Rally </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  1399.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Steel </p></td><td><p>  Tight leather buckle </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  not </p></td><td><p>  1499.0 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Now that the price for all 2018 Watch models is known, you can compare several Apple Watch counterparts that the buyer will be happy to use instead of the original. </p><h2>  Flagship carrier Asus </h2><p>  This chic new Asus shocked customers in 2018.  According to a statement from the Android administration, Asus plans to start selling its flagship media in early November.  It is reported that the device will cost $ 229 with direct conversion.  It's cheaper than the new Asus Zenwatch series, which starts at $ 399.  ZenWatch 3 looks pretty traditional. </p><div class="photo" data-original="musicphotolife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flagship carrier Asus" class="if uuid-2954615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954615.jpg"></div><p>  This is largely achieved thanks to the high-performance 316L stainless steel case and relatively chic leather straps.  It maintains the tradition of classic watchmaking with a case design made of high quality materials.  It provides timely information, offers many features with a multivariate custom design.  Innovative charging keeps the Asus Zenwatch 3 on hand longer, so the user will always be in the know. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  High-tech Pebble Watch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.appcessories.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="High-tech Pebble Watch" class="if uuid-2954627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954627.jpg"></div><p>  The soothing appearance is not just the facade for a Pebble smart watch.  High-tech devices increase adrenaline among users with admiration.  Pebble is more serene and harmonious, connecting the fast-paced modern life with simple and smart watches.  The smartwatch connects to a smartphone, tablet or other portable device via Bluetooth wireless signals. </p><p>  The OS does not matter, the Apple Watch Pebble analog works with devices that run through Apple or Android.  Once connected, Pebble turns into a tech hub on hand, providing notifications for calls, texts and emails in addition to updates from Facebook, Twitter and other social network accounts. </p><p>  You can install many wonderful, outlandish, and sometimes just weird apps on your Pebble watch.  As of the fall of 2018, more than 6,000 applications have been created specifically for this watch.  Since the manufacturer Pebble decided to provide an open source software development kit, almost everyone can design and release applications, which means that new software appears almost daily and makes it possible to constantly customize the clock for your preferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Wireless <span>Apple Watch</span> analogue - Messages are sent via Bluetooth.  The rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery lasts up to 7 days without recharging.  Water-resistant allows users to wear watches in the rain, swimming and even in the shower.  Any music that is played on iTunes, Spotify, and Pandora can be controlled using this device.  Pebble Smart watches are considered very fashionable this season, Amazon prices start at $ 80. </p><h2>  Functional Fitbit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.fitbit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Functional Fitbit" class="if uuid-2954630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954630.jpg"></div><p>  One of the best alternatives to the Apple Watch.  The model was released in the fall of 2017.  This caused a lot of noise due to the fact that it was the first true SmartWatch, although it has a bulky design that not everyone likes.  Its functionality directly competes with the Apple watch and supports the Fitbit mission, focusing mainly on fitness. </p><p>  Some of the key features include: </p><ol><li>  Water resistant up to 50 meters. </li><li>  Built-in GPS. </li><li>  Smart notifications. </li><li>  Application store. </li><li>  Musical control and storage. </li><li>  Track activity and fitness. </li><li>  OS: Fitbit OS. </li><li>  Display: LCD (348 x 250). </li><li>  Size: width 38 mm. </li><li>  Battery: 5 days. </li><li>  Water resistance: 50 m. </li><li>  Heart Rate: Yes. </li><li>  Possibilities of connecting smart watches analogous to Apple Watch: GPS, Bluetooth. </li><li>  Works with: iOS, Android, Windows 10 Mobile. </li><li>  Function check: GPS, heart rate monitoring, music playback, special sports modes, Fitbit Pay. </li><li>  Fitbit SmartWatch iOS is a relatively new system, so customers see constant additions and updates now and will see in the future.  This includes more features for app stores and health tracking options such as diabetes management. </li><li>  The price of the device is from $ 199. </li></ol><p>  Versa is Fitbit‚Äôs newest product with a much more versatile design than an ionic one and a more attractive price.  He does a few things for the brand - replaces Blaze, offers a slim design and water resistance.  We offer an overview of the analogue of Apple Watch: </p><ol><li>  Water resistant up to 50 meters. </li><li>  Notifications from a smartphone. </li><li>  Battery life 4+ days. </li><li>  Music without a phone. </li><li>  NFC payments (in a special version). </li><li>  Application store. </li><li>  The model lacks a built-in GPS-receiver, but it is also offered at a starting price of less than $ 200.  However, it connects to GPS smartphones, and it has phone music. </li></ol><h2>  Samsung tradition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thefonestuff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung tradition" class="if uuid-2954632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954632.jpg"></div><p>  Samsung Gear Sport devices are an excellent analogue of the Apple Watch Series 3, along with the Gear S3 they received much more positive reviews than older models.  The difference between these two designs and style is that the Gear S3 has a classic look, while the Sport looks like a sports smart chat.  The Sport version is waterproof, offers the whole range of fitness, provides tracking activity, creates smart notifications and has the ability to respond to texts, compatible with Android and IOS. </p><p>  The Samsung Gear S3 offers similar functionality with a more traditional look: </p><ol><li>  Very nice ergonomic design and great screen. </li><li>  A huge number of belts to choose from. </li><li>  A fantastic set of opportunities for fitness and health. </li><li>  Good user motivation to activate sports. </li><li>  Great features including trouble-free display, GPS, LTE, Bluetooth, water resistance, swimming tracking and advanced heart rate tracking with ECG functionality. </li><li>  Display: Super AMOLED (360 x 360). </li><li>  Size: 42 mm / 46 mm. </li><li>  Battery: 4 days (42 mm), 7 days (46 mm). </li><li>  Water Resistance: 5 ATM. </li><li>  Heart Rate: Yes. </li><li>  Connectivity: GPS, NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth. </li><li>  Works with: iOS, Android. </li></ol><h2>  Intelligent Huawei </h2><div class="photo" data-original="techdissected.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Intelligent Huawei" class="if uuid-2954634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954634.jpg"></div><p>  The Chinese counterpart to Apple Watch - Huawei - has become a reliable and highly regarded brand of SmartWatch.  Huawei Watch 2 was launched earlier this year, as a result of which some of the long-awaited updates to the popular first-generation Huawei Watch have become real.  Both models are currently available for sale.  The first Huawei watches were highly rated, and Watch 2 received star reviews from technical experts. </p><p>  In terms of design, the second version is much more sporty, and traditional watches have a classic design.  The biggest differences between the models are that the traditional version does not have GPS, LTE, NFC and has a little more water resistance. </p><p>  Any watch that is not a product of Apple, Fitbit, or Garmin is an Android gadget.  Buyers need to know about the large number of really great options that SmartWatch has.  Apple strives to get all the glory, but there are other incredible brands that produce great products, in the first place, the latest Gear S3, which definitely deserves user attention, is one of them. </p><h2>  Minimalistic Motorola Design </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mashable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minimalistic Motorola Design" class="if uuid-2954636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954636.jpg"></div><p>  The original Moto 360, an analogue of the Apple Watch for Android, remains on the list of favorite smartwatches.  A recently released version that is more suitable for sports users.  The original Moto 360 is currently manufactured by Lenovo, which acquired Motorola several years ago.  The model is built for people who prefer to stay active and have a lot of fun.  The watch is welcomed by users due to the large number of functions, although the design is still rather weak.  The Moto 360 Sport is, above all, a screen with the amazing technology that Motorola brings to the AnyLight display. </p><p>  When the user looks at the watch under ordinary light, it looks like on a standard LCD screen.  However, as soon as the watch is idle or there is direct light on the front side, the screen turns into a transreflective display, similar to a Pebble Time watch.  This function ensures that the battery life is saved and the user can easily and simply find out the time and date. </p><p>  Speaking of batteries, they are not as good as expected.  Of course, SmartWatches use smaller batteries compared to other devices, they are efficient enough to power the watch for several days.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with the Motorola Moto 360 Sport.  At full charge, the Moto 360 Sport runs all day or a little more.  This is not suitable for many people, because they will have to charge their devices before bed every day. </p><h2>  Budget Xiaomi Amazfit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wccftech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Budget Xiaomi Amazfit" class="if uuid-2954641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954641.jpg"></div><p>  Xiaomi is one of the best companies on the market, it produces just fantastic budget products.  Their smartphones, as well as other accessories, have always been affordable.  Xiaomi develops its products, making them look at a high level.  For the most part, they use high contrast components and materials.  This removes any doubt as to whether the quality as a whole is good.  They have a nice design and build quality.  This is just the right amount of stylish elements with bright elements. </p><p>  A transparent display that is becoming more common in most smart card releases.  The display is easy to remove, bright enough, and looks good.  Another good feature of Xiaomi Amazfit is its battery life.  When fully charged, the battery can last 3-5 days.  This is undoubtedly one of the best battery timings that exist in SmartWatch. </p><p>  The good news about Xiaomi Amazfit is that it is inexpensive, so anyone looking for a cheap smartwatch will definitely be lucky with this model.  In addition, the buyer will also receive from Xiaomi such features as Bluetooth, GPS, many sensors and fitness trackers.  On paper, Amazfit really looks like a complete package, and almost like an ideal SmartWatch, however there are some things that are still not good enough. </p><p>  Firstly, the firmware is somewhat cumbersome.  Although now this problem can be fixed by updating.  Another thing you need to know about Amazfit is that the application that comes with it can be very simple and minimal.  And yet, there is no doubt that Xiaomi Amazfit is a wonderful SmartWatch that is suitable for many people. </p><h2>  Futuristic Movado Connect </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Futuristic Movado Connect" class="if uuid-2954642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954642.jpg"></div><p>  Movado Connect is a Wear OS smartphone with a stunning, bold design that eschews tradition in favor of a futuristic look.  There are several options for straps - black and gold.  Movado also developed more than 100 different design options, so the buyer can find the model to his liking.  Refreshing minimalism is created with a single button to control the hours and operation of applications. </p><p>  This gives you access to hundreds of applications, and you can easily use the Google Assistant on your own hand.  The model works well with notifications, it has a gyroscope and an accelerometer, so it can track steps, but it does not have a heart rate sensor.  It is waterproof, not waterproof.  There is support for Google Pay via NFC with a crazy list of features.  Operating time - up to 20 hours on a single charge, so you probably need a daily charge.  The model is quite comfortable, and the Movado Connect design is simple and elegant. </p><h2>  Mobvoi with Wear Operating System </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobvoi with Wear Operating System" class="if uuid-2954644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954644.jpg"></div><p>  Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro may not be a common brand, but Wear OS smart cards have quickly become one of 2018's favorite favorites.  Proof of this is battery life.  Pro offers up to 30 days of battery life per charge.  Of course, it all depends on how it is used.  Mobvoi's trick to increase battery life comes with the addition of a multi-level screen that acts like two displays.  One of them is intended for use when the watch is idle, it displays important information, such as charge time.  The standard OLED display ensures the full operation of the Wear operating system. </p><p>  In Smart Mode, the watch runs for up to 5 days on a single charge.  It will depend on whether the user has switched to Essential Mode, this is a pretty cool setting and works well.  In addition to its own display, Ticwatch Pro has software in Wear OS.  It is powered by the Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset, has a 400 √ó 400 OLED display, a size of 1.39 inches, and has a 45 mm case.  There is also a battery with a charge of 415 mAh, inside of which a magnetic charger is charged.  It has IP64 dust protection as well as NFC for use with Google Pay.  The price of the Ticwatch Pro is pretty good at $ 249. </p><h2>  Android Wear Operating System </h2><div class="photo" data-original="willem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Apple Watch counterparts" class="if uuid-2954606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2954606.jpg"></div><p> Android Wear has not had too many options available recently that would impress customers.  But the 200-dollar smartwatch, an analog of the Apple Watch - Misfit Vapor, has entered the market, and they have many advantages.  Misfit Vapor was originally launched with its own OS, but now it is Android.  The Vapor has a 1.39-inch display, a Snapdragon processor, 512 MB of RAM and a heart rate sensor.  These specifications are pretty standard for Android.  Vapor also includes 5 ATM water resistance, which is a huge plus, as well as an assortment of software features added by Misfit.  In terms of price, the Misfit Vapor is priced at a reasonable amount of $ 199.  This is a serious application, considering the fitness features and attractive circular design of this watch, similar to the Iwo 2 smart watch analogue of Apple Watch. </p><p>  Most modern Android Wear devices are not the most stylish, but the last two watch models from the fashion brand Michael Kors are striving to change this.  The Grayson and Sofie watches are designed to fit the style of men and women, and both start at around $ 350.  Grayson is designed for men who are inspired by a traditional watch.  It has a 47mm wide stainless steel case with a 1.39-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 454x454.  Sofie is a model designed for women with a delicate jewelry taste.  The watch has a small 1.9-inch display measuring 390 √ó 390 AMOLED and a smaller case by 42 mm. </p><p>  In today's world, SmartWatch is more than just a newfangled toy.  They help users with professional activities, open up a new world of applications for them and eliminate the need to remove the phone from their pocket every time a message arrives.  If it comes to choosing SmartWatch, the best option depends on a number of factors, including the smartphone used by the buyer, the budget and the aesthetic tastes of the future owner.  And yet, no matter what the buyer is looking for, the device should be of a high class and economy option, which in 2018 will be abundant in the market. </p>
