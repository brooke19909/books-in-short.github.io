And believe me, if the quality of beaches in our country, it should be recognized, is not always ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, there are plenty of places where you can enjoy the stunning beauty of Russia.  For this reason, spending a vacation without leaving the borders of your country is a perfectly reasonable, if not right, decision. </p>

    <p>  Do you want to see the truly unique picturesque paintings that nature itself created?  Go to Sochi's Agur Waterfalls!  This is truly a paradise of the globe, where thousands of tourists come, not only Russians but also foreigners.  It is located on the Black Sea coast - in the Khostinsky district of the capital of the "Olympic" games. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Back in 1911, Agursky waterfall became a popular tourist destination.  What caused this?  Everything is very simple.  One of the members of the mountain club at that time simply cut a path in the rocks, which opened up for all vacationers access to such an amazing natural wonder as Agursky waterfall.  A close examination and now you can consider the traces of picks and pits left by the "discoverer." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Agur Falls is a truly spectacular sight.  Here you can see everything: exotic plants, dizzying rocks, magnificent canyons. </p><h2>  Start of route </h2><p>  At the initial stage of the journey, tourists enjoy a view of a gloomy pond of small size, which is shrouded in high and steep cliffs.  This place is called the Devil's Font.  Here in one of the rocks you can see a slightly frightening hole in the Devil's Hole cave. </p>

    <h2>  Agura River </h2><p>  Agur Falls is the brainchild of the Agura River, which is vibrant and vibrant.  Its source originates ten kilometers from the Black Sea, from the southern borders of the Alec massif. </p><p>  One of the ancient legends says that once a beauty named Agura secretly brought water to her lover, who was chained to a rock.  In the end, her secret was revealed, and the young diva was thrown into a canyon as a punishment, where she, breaking on stones, turned into a winding mountain river. </p><p>  It should be noted that the river exudes a hydrogen sulfide smell, so it was nicknamed the ‚Äúrotten spring‚Äù. </p><p>  The river on rapids and mountain trails very quickly rushes down to the sea coast, passing the bottom of the gorge, forms a whole series of picturesque water cascades.  Believe me, they are just as amazing and beautiful as the famous waterfalls of the world, photos of which often adorn the covers of famous glossy nature magazines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that the above creation of nature is a certain combination of three water strips, alternately replacing each other. </p><h2>  Lower </h2><p>  The most spectacular and unusual in beauty is the lower waterfall.  It is formed by two cascades - upper and lower. </p><p>  The length of the first is 12 meters, and the bottom is 18 meters.  In the place where they intersect, you can observe just a unique sight when an incredible amount of splashes splashing out, shimmering in sunlight.  At the bottom of the lower waterfall is a lake with crystal clear but cold water. </p><h2>  Average </h2>

    <p>  The middle waterfall is about half a kilometer above the bottom, its height is 23 meters.  The water in it flows a whole arsenal of jets into a five-meter pool.  Here is such a picturesque Agursky waterfall.  Where is this "miracle" of nature?  The fact is that it is practically impossible to detect it visually, you need to specially go to it along a steep path. </p><h2>  Upper </h2><p>  The third unique Agursky waterfall is called upper.  The status ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù and ‚Äúroaring‚Äù was firmly entrenched behind him, since its waters flow from a height of 21 meters and are associated with a giant shower. </p>

    <p>  At the bottom of the waterfall, stones lie and rapids form, so the water quickly moves from one ledge to another, forming a colorful cascade.  Not far from the upper waterfall are the "Eagle" rocks, which offer a magnificent panorama of the urban surroundings and <span>Mount Akhun.</span> </p><p>  The final stage of the excursion route is a visit to a small but very deep lake sparkling in the sun, which is surrounded by sheer cliffs. </p><h2>  When is it best to go sightseeing? </h2><p>  Of course, Agursky waterfalls are magnificent at any time of the year.  However, they are full of water in winter, spring, and, naturally, in the rainy season.  When moisture is not supplied in sufficient quantities, the Agura River dries up, and waterfalls lose their energy and strength. </p><h2>  <strong>Waterfalls of the world</strong> </h2><p>  Of course, the waterfalls of the world can be considered the standard of natural beauty and grace, photos of which simply fascinate with their charm and grace.  Surely, there will not be a single person who did not admire this incredibly stunning spectacle, when rapidly rushing streams with a roar turn into millions of tiny particles of water, enriching the surrounding area with moisture.  And how amazing and wonderful is the rainbow, which is often formed on hot days over the waterfalls of the world?  So, in which countries can I go to enjoy this natural wonder? </p><p>  Be sure to look at the Kilt Falls waterfall in Scotland.  Its waters descend from the cliffs directly into the <span>Atlantic Ocean.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfalls of the world photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/475141.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Minibus No. 110 runs from the central district of the city, taking the train to the Sputnik stop.  From this stop, then the route runs along the bridge, then you should make a left, then you will see a fork, after which you need to turn left again.  We go up the highway, passing about one kilometer, you will see the restaurant "Caucasian aul", and after another hundred meters there will be a noticeable path leading directly to Agursky waterfalls.  After only 300 meters on the left side of the path, you will already be able to admire the first canyon, as well as the ‚ÄúDevil's Font‚Äù, turning to the right, you can see the ‚ÄúDevil's Hole‚Äù. </p><p>  It must be emphasized that after the "Eagle Rocks", which was mentioned above, natural attractions do not end there.  If you go a little further, you can observe the confluence of the Agura River with its tributary.  In the immediate vicinity of this place there is a huge colorful meadow, which was entrenched with the name "Glade of Gatherings."  To reach it, you need to cross the river.  The distance from the beginning of the path to the above attractions is about 2.5 km. </p><p>  You can get to Agursky waterfalls also from the Sputnik ITC, but for the right to go this way, every tourist will have to fork out for 80 rubles. </p>
