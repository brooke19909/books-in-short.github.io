Additional protocols for connecting with wearable equipment, such as smartphones and tablets, expand their capabilities and allow drivers not to be distracted while driving.  But what happens if you try to combine the radio and tablet in one device?  The result is the Mystery MDD-6270NV - an audio combine with wide functionality and an indispensable tool for both the driver and his passengers. </p><h2>  Briefly about the model </h2><p>  The manufacturer of the gadget tried to create a device that can replace a wide range of diverse automotive equipment.  I had to pay for this with space, because the resulting radio tape recorder takes two whole standard DIN connectors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tvoiotzyvy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdd 6270nv price" class="if uuid-2782429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2782429.jpg"></div><p>  A distinctive feature is the presence of a large touch screen with which you can control the basic functions.  Due to its presence, the radio was able to play videos from various media.  The developers did not stop there, adding to the Mystery MDD-6270NV a full-fledged television tuner that allows you to watch live TV channels.  We can say with confidence that such a device is a valuable find for those who are forced to stay in the car for a long time due to professional occupation, and possibly spend the night there on long trips. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Perhaps the main parameter for the radio is the quality and power of sound.  The built-in amplifier is responsible for it, capable of delivering 50 watts of power to 4 separate speakers.  They, in turn, must be connected using a standard quadraphonic scheme, that is, pairwise rear and front. </p><p>  A 6.2-inch color display is used to display information.  Menu items are displayed on it in the form of fairly large buttons, which allows you to easily use a not quite accurate sensor.  The Mystery MDD-6270NV firmware is intuitive, although some names are not completely translated into Russian.  Most of the controls are made in the form of virtual buttons displayed by the display, which made it possible to bring out a minimum of physical keys on the panel.  If it is inconvenient to tune the radio using the sensor, you can use the supplied remote control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thexart.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdd 6270nv" class="if uuid-2782427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2782427.jpg"></div><p>  In order to expand the functionality in the radio, several additional outputs are provided.  So, it can connect up to two displays mounted, for example, in the head restraints of the front seats for passengers who are seated on the rear sofa.  This can be useful for families with children, who just by the rules should ride in the back seat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another useful feature is the presence of a connector for connecting a video camera.  It can be positioned behind, then it will act as a rearview mirror.  This is especially useful when reversing, since the view in this case is much better than through a standard mirror. </p><h2>  Supported audio formats and sources </h2><p>  Nevertheless, this device is primarily intended for playing music in a car, and therefore support for modern formats is an important requirement for it.  So, the Mystery MDD-6270NV car radio is capable of playing music and video from various types of media.  An existing CD / DVD drive can be used to play CD recordings. </p><p>  The manufacturers did not forget about the slots for memory cards, moreover, both a standard USB-stick and a microSD-card can be installed in the radio tape recorder.  This allows you to collect your audio collection in one place and not worry that there will be nothing to listen to on the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": dorz23, "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdd 6270nv review" class="if uuid-2782432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2782432.jpg"></div><p>  The radio is standard, it is equipped with a function of automatic search and storage of available radio stations.  The reception is pretty clean, the sound is processed at the software level, so there are no problems with sound quality. </p><p>  Well, and finally, you can connect absolutely any device with a linear audio output to the radio via the existing AUX connector.  This makes it possible to use it as an amplifier for gadgets such as smartphones, navigators or game consoles. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  The device provides the ability to download additional maps.  Built-in GPS-module allows positioning on the ground.  The accuracy of the route laid depends on how relevant and high-quality maps will be loaded into the system.  It is most convenient to store them on a microSD card, since it does not protrude from the panel and is easily removed to update data on it. </p><p>  The Mystery MDD-6270NV radio tape recorder can not only lead according to a given route, but also warn about speeding and the presence of cameras and radars if you download the appropriate database to the memory card.  The audio system does not have its own memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery 2 din mdd 6270nv" class="if uuid-2782433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2782433.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive model reviews </h2><p>  In order to make sure of the quality and usability of this radio, you should familiarize yourself with the reviews left by ordinary drivers.  The following positive aspects of the device are noted in them: </p><ul><li>  Reasonable cost.  Price Mystery MDD-6270NV ranges from 11-12 thousand rubles, which is a good indicator for a device of this class. </li><li>  High speed.  When switching between modes, there are no delays, the interface works smoothly, which increases overall comfort from use. </li><li>  Multitasking.  When the navigation starts, there are no problems with playing music from a disk or memory card, as well as listening to the radio. </li><li>  The ability to connect a camera.  The Mystery 2-DIN MDD-6270NV radio tape recorder has an automatic mode, when activated, the image from the camera is transmitted to the display when reverse gear is engaged.  In order for it to work correctly, you must connect the corresponding wire to the reverse sensor. </li><li>  Good sound quality.  The manufacturer did not stint on a high-quality amplifier, which allows to reveal frequencies well, and fine tuning of the equalizer makes it possible to adjust the system to the installed speakers. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, this model has a good list of positive aspects.  However, before buying it will not hurt to get acquainted with its shortcomings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.olx.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdd 6270nv firmware" class="if uuid-2782430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2782430.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the radio </h2><p>  Among the main shortcomings, in the first place, many drivers call the impossibility of choosing the equalizer settings in all modes except the radio.  At the same time, the previously set setting continues to work.  You can change this parameter by returning to the radio mode or using the remote control that came with the Mystery MDD-6270NV. </p><p>  The second significant drawback is the lack of Bluetooth wireless connectivity.  It may not always be convenient for drivers to connect their smartphone using a standard AUX cable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": RedVivaro, "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdd 6270nv in car panel" class="if uuid-2782434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2782434.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This model may well be suitable for those who want to combine several devices in one.  Often the navigator simply interferes if you place it on a suction cup on the windshield.  As you can see from the Mystery MDD-6270NV review, in this case, the built-in navigation can be a good help and help get rid of excess items. </p><p>  The radio tape recorder fits well into the interior of most cars, and there are no problems with its installation, as it is as modern as possible. </p>
