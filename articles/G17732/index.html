Any poor or middle-class man can only dream of the benefits that he could afford if he was on the list of the richest people on the planet.  However, no one knows that it is quite difficult to keep the money received.  At the same time, it is not even possible to talk about increasing wealth.  All available funds must be kept at least. </p><h2>  Lists of wealthiest businessmen </h2><p>  Ratings are made very different.  Some of them reflect the degree of popularity of representatives of show business.  Others tell us about news in the field of cinema, etc. There is also a rating of the richest people on the planet.  It should be borne in mind that their condition is for the most part not cash in bank accounts.  Such people store their wealth in real estate, in objects of art, and also invest in promising companies.  In other words, it is in those objects that can always be easily sold or have significant value. <br>  The list, which includes the most affluent businessmen, does not differ in constancy.  Any of the billionaires overnight can lose a decent amount of money by moving down the steps of the rating. </p><p>  The richest people in the world in 2013 practically did not change their positions in relation to the previous rating.  In the lists of the <span>world's</span> first <span>billionaires,</span> however, as before, American businessmen dominate.  The second place is taken by rich people from Germany.  The Russians are on the third line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A rating compiled by the famous Bloomberg agency introduces us to the ten richest people on our planet. </p><h2>  Lee Ka-Shing </h2><p>  <span>The richest man</span> on the planet, ranking tenth, is a billionaire from Hong Kong.  Lee Ka-Shing's fortune is estimated at $ 29.4 billion.  He is the richest businessman in Asia.  He controls Cheung Kong.  This is a large conglomerate consisting of an extensive trading network, ports, energy companies, as well as mobile operators. </p><h2>  Bernard Arnault </h2><p>  The ninth step of the list, introducing us to the richest people in the world, confidently takes a billionaire from France.  The state of Bernard Arnault is also estimated at 29.4 billion. </p>
