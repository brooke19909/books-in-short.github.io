More recently, a novelty for everyone was the ability to receive funds in debt according to a simplified procedure - without a thorough check of the borrower's income, his credit history and property.  We are talking about so-called ‚Äúpayday loans‚Äù when a person takes a small amount for small household expenses until he receives the next salary.  After this, the loan is repaid, the debt (including interest) on it is repaid, and the borrower is increased the credit limit to be able to apply for a loan again. </p><h2>  SMS loans </h2><p>  An entirely new <span>loan processing</span> system can be called an SMS application.  Such an innovation is practiced by SMS Finance.  The reviews show that with the help of a message sent from a mobile phone that will contain your <span>passport data</span> and information about the loan, everyone can get a loan for the purposes he needs. </p>

    <p>  This gives you a lot of advantages right away.  Firstly, the whole process of obtaining a loan is simplified for the reason that the client does not need to defend queues in the organization‚Äôs branches, wait for a call from the lender and worry about whether his application will be approved or not.  Without being distracted by extraneous matters, anyone can send a message from a mobile phone and receive a response from an employee of the company in a few minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, this <span>form of communication</span> is much easier than long calls or live conversations with consultants.  Everything that you may be interested in on a loan is on the company's website, you can read it in a few minutes.  By sending SMS, you submit your profile, thus making it clear that you want to get a loan.  In addition, you will not be asked for contact details, since the message will contain all the necessary information. </p><p>  You must admit that such a model has certain advantages over traditional forms of registration of loans. </p><h2>  Company SMS Finance </h2><p>  As mentioned above, a typical representative of the market that accepts applications for a loan through SMS is SMS Finance.  The reviews that we studied during the preparation of the writing of the article allow us to find out what it represents in practice. </p>

    <p>  So, this is a service that helps people in the shortest possible time to get loan amounts of up to 30 thousand rubles.  The application process, as you already know, goes through SMS, and the company‚Äôs employee‚Äôs response arrives on the phone to the client in an average of 7 minutes.  The advantages of the company are flexibility and, at the same time, simplicity of conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, the borrower is given the opportunity to defer payment for 21 days in the event that he is unable to repay the debt on time.  To do this, it is enough to pay interest on the loan. </p>

    <p>  As for the methods of obtaining a loan, as well as its repayment, then in this regard, the bank ‚ÄúSMS-finance‚Äù is quite flexible.  The client can return the funds in the QIWI system, as well as using CONTACT or through the bank (by simple transfer).  In turn, you can get money in one of these ways. </p><h2>  Scheme of work </h2><p>  You already understood that to work with the company you need to send an SMS message with your data.  However, we clarify the situation a bit: you write the data in the application, which you leave on the company‚Äôs website.  In it you enter the full name, phone number and scan of the document.  When she arrives at the company‚Äôs employees, they will decide in a few minutes whether a loan can be issued or not.  After this period of time, you will receive a response in an SMS message. </p><p>  Next, the word is yours: do you want to apply for this loan or not.  If you are interested and would like to receive funds, you need to send a message to the number +7 (913) 913-50-20, which will contain ZAEM 10000 XXXX.  Where 10000 is, respectively, the amount of money you want to receive;  and XXXX is the password to enter your personal account.  In it, by the way, you can set up a way to receive funds and manage a loan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  There are two restrictions on the amounts and terms dictated by SMS-finance.  A loan can be taken in the amount of 1 to 15 thousand rubles for a period of 21 days and from 16 to 30 thousand for 9 months.  Accordingly, for these two tariffs you get completely different interest rates. </p><p>  On the first, making out 1000 rubles, you get 1.74% per day, and this rate drops to 0.90% per day for 15 thousand loans.  Then the second tariff switches, and you have to pay 0.5% per day of using funds from 15100 to 30000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  You can extend the loan for up to 21 days if you manage to pay off the interest debt.  As customer reviews about SMS Finance show, the company is quite flexible in communicating with borrowers, so they can agree to some simplifications that are beneficial to the client. </p><h2>  Bonuses </h2><p>  For the fact that you bring your friend who will use the services, SMS Finance bonuses are awarded.  Reviews indicate that for one guest they pay 300 rubles.  They will be displayed in your account if the user activates the loan, and this will happen, of course, on your recommendation. </p>

    <p>  It will be possible to spend the money received to pay the debt on your own loan.  In order to participate in the bonus program, the application "SMS-finance" is not submitted. </p><h2>  Credit denial </h2><p>  After you fill out a special form on the company's website, employees, as mentioned above, consider your candidacy as a potential borrower.  Of course, situations happen when at this stage a person is refused.  Many are interested in what could have been the reason and how not to get it the next time. </p><p>  So, the most common reasons when a client receives a refusal from SMS-finance (reviews, as well as information on the company‚Äôs website confirm this) are a damaged credit history of the client, active debt on another loan and an attempted fraudulent activity.  The first two points are very simple: if you have debt in the company, you will not be given a loan again.  As for <span>bad credit history,</span> it is checked by forming an appeal to a special bureau.  From there they send information about what kind of loans a person made, how regularly he paid them, and so on. </p>

    <p>  As for fraud, we are talking about trying to take a loan and hide from the company, somehow falsify documents, and so on. </p><p>  If the user is refused, he cannot use the system services for the next 4 months. </p><h2>  Reviews of borrowers </h2><p>  After reading the reviews of those who have already managed to get a loan at this company, you can understand that the organization works transparently and honestly.  No reports were found that someone was deceived.  Apparently, the company provides quality services, SMS Finance.  A loan (reviews confirm this) is easy enough to borrow.  The rejection ratio to the approved applications is small. </p><p>  As for the form of cooperation with the organization as a whole, for the most part there are positive reviews about it.  The thing is that communicating with the bank using SMS really gives the borrower less trouble.  Let us add to this the possibility of extending the term for repayment of the debt, as well as certain situations when company representatives meet the client, and we get a really cool service that you want to contact again. </p><h2>  If not to pay? </h2><p>  Finally, we answer the question of what will happen if you do not pay.  As the reviews of non-payers show about SMS-finance, nothing will happen.  People wrote their stories in the comments when they were not able to repay the loan, and company employees simply insisted on repayment and threatened to go to court.  Of course, during the time of non-payment of debts of the client begin to accrue large amounts of fines, interest and penalties.  Therefore, in the end, you will have to return the money several times more than the original loan.  Along with this, your credit history will be spoiled. </p>

    <p>  After the debt becomes large enough, the company will really go to court.
