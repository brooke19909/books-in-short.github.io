A large number of resort towns are located in the modern territory of Turkey.  Among the popular ones, you can name the small town of Alanya.  Not far from it is a very interesting hotel Aktas Hotel 3 *, Turkey.  Reviews of this three-star hotel can be found on many Internet sites.  Due to its remoteness, this hotel offers its settlers rooms at a lower price than in many other hotels in resort towns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aktas hotel 3 turkey reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580622.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  In order to find this hotel, you may need a map.  Turkey (Alanya in particular) is the place where you can buy a similar card with the name of all the hotels nearby.  The hotel is located in the city of Mahmutlar, which is located along the highway and on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Even though the sea here is very beautiful and the beaches are clean, the cost of rooms here is much lower than in similar hotels in other resorts.  This is due to the fact that the distance from the city of Mahmutlar to the nearest airport, which is located in Antalya, is about 200 kilometers.  However, the country's authorities say that it is planned to complete the construction of a new airport, which is only thirty kilometers from the resort town.  If we talk about the remoteness of the hotel from the center of Alanya, then it is quite large and is as much as 12 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aktas hotel" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580624.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The facade of the hotel building </h2><p>  Hotel Aktas Hotel 3 * (photo above) is a five-story building, which is practically no different from other hotels in this city in terms of style.  All of them have the shape of a hexagon, and on the edges of every second face are balconies with sea views.  The only difference between this hotel and some others is that it is painted yellow, while many others are beige.  All the buildings of modern hotels in the city of Mahmutlar were built in the 21st century in order to increase the attractiveness of tourism in this region. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  This Mahmutlar Alanya hotel is located near a highway.  Tours in the city are conducted quite often and mainly cover the <span>sights of Alanya.</span>  To get to this resort town, you need to go by plane to Antalya, since this city is the closest one, where there is an airport.  After the plane arrives at <span>Antalya Airport,</span> you need to go to the bus station and go to Mahmutlar by bus.  Driving on a freeway can take quite a while.  To be more precise, then from 3 to 3.5 hours.  If you discuss the conditions of your trip to Aktas Hotel (Alanya) in advance, you can use the airport transfer service to the hotel.  At the same time, the trip may take a little more than two hours.  But this is still a lot, especially when you consider that the transfer cost can be quite significant.  Perhaps this is why the Turkish authorities decided to build a new airport, which will be located only thirty kilometers from the city of Mahmutlar.  This will greatly simplify the process of traveling to Aktas Hotel 3 (Alanya, Mahmutlar). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya tours" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580626.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, each room has a new air conditioner that works properly and is able to maintain the temperature that was set.  As a "convenient" service, you can highlight a transfer from the airport to the hotel.  This service significantly facilitates the process of moving from Antalya to Mahmutlar, but at the same time due to the large distance it can be quite expensive.  If you need to put your precious things or important documents in a safe place, you can use the safe, which is located in the hotel room.  However, in order to access this safe, you must pay a certain amount of money. </p><p>  Another service provided by Aktas Hotel 3 *, <span>Turkey, reviews</span> of which are both positive and negative, is the ability to watch cable TV on a large TV screen.  If there is no cable TV, then for an additional fee you can always ask to set up satellite TV in your room.  As an additional service, you can highlight the presence of your own gift shop inside the hotel.  This greatly facilitates tourists the process of buying souvenirs to their loved ones.  You can also rent a car on site for the duration of your stay at the hotel.  This is a good sign when you consider that the hotel is twelve kilometers from the center of Alanya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Map Turkey Alanya" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Meals at the hotel are served twice a day.  For breakfast, visitors are invited to go down to the hotel restaurant and enjoy the buffet.  As a rule, sandwiches, cold appetizers, fresh fruits, and freshly squeezed juices can be found as breakfast dishes.  Dinner is held in a warmer atmosphere.  Those who want to have a full dinner can order the first, second, and dessert.  As a hot dish, fish dishes are especially popular.  In the restaurant of this hotel, the fish is always fresh, and the dishes are very tasty.  Also, for those who decided to have dinner at the hotel, an interesting evening show program was prepared, which was prepared by Turkish artists.  The location of the hotel is not very convenient for those who want to try dinner outside the hotel.  In this case, you will have to go closer to the center of Alanya, and this is about ten kilometers. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  This hotel is medium in size, as the number of rooms does not exceed 200. They can be divided into three main categories: standard rooms, deluxe rooms and deluxe rooms.  Standard rooms are smaller in comparison with the other two categories.  The living conditions in the luxury rooms, of course, are at a higher level.  However, absolutely every room has its own shower room, cable TV, free Wi-Fi and a telephone, which is necessary for communication with the reception. </p><h2>  Hotel room rates <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aktas hotel 3 alanya mahmutlar" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580629.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Room prices are notable for their democratic nature at Aktas Hotel 3 *, Turkey.  The reviews of many tourists who stayed here, indicate that under comparable conditions with other hotels in Turkey, the cost of rooms in this place is lower.  This is due primarily to the fact that the demand for rooms in the hotel is low due to the difficult path to it.  A standard room can cost a settler about $ 35.  A deluxe room will cost $ 46, and <span>a deluxe room</span> will cost a tourist just $ 65 per night.  It is also worth noting that the more people are accommodated in one room, the topic is the higher the price of one night.  If three people enter the standard room, the price will be already at the level of 45 US dollars. </p><h2>  Attractions near the hotel </h2><p>  In order to be able to see all the attractions of this resort, you need a map.  Turkey, Alanya - this is the place where you can find and purchase it.  The most important attraction that you should definitely visit if you travel to Alanya is the ancient Byzantine fortress Ich-Kale.  The fortress is located on a hilltop and is a large open-air museum.  On the territory of this fortress you can find the ruins of the church, the castle, which was built in the 13th century, as well as bathtubs that were intended to store water.  Today, on the territory of this fortress, you can also find villas that were rebuilt relatively later, namely in the 19th century.  In addition, tourists can be interested in a mosque, which was built in the 13th century.  What else is Alanya famous for?  Excursions can be carried out not only through the territory of ruins and ancient buildings, but also through amazing caves that have preserved all the beauty of wildlife and fascinate everyone who enters them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aktas hotel 3 pics" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Opinions about this hotel in Mahmutlar are very controversial.  Among the reviews you can find positive ones that indicate good service and staff, as well as the proximity of the beach to the hotel.  Some visitors were not very happy with their choice of hotel due to the fact that it is located in the immediate vicinity of the highway, so the endless noise prevented them from sleeping normally at night.  But the price at the same time absolutely suited everyone. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that the hotel is very budget and cheap, but getting to it is quite difficult.  Therefore, if you are ready for a long trip to a three-star hotel in Mahmutlar, then go for it!  Have a nice rest. </p>
