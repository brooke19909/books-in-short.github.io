    <h2>  Interest Ask </h2><p>  A question is circulating on the Web, which has a certain character of scandalousness: who owns the Pokrovskoye holiday home?  Users retell each other a story that happened back in 2011. </p><p>  In early October, with the participation of a security company, a raider seizure of Pokrovskoye Rest House CJSC was carried out.  According to media reports, professional guards did not limit themselves in the methods of action, physical force was used, what was happening resembled a picture from a Hollywood action movie.  The seizure became possible due to forgery of documents by a number of persons, including the general director of the enterprise and the wife of the owner of the company.  The cause of the conflict was the divorce proceedings of the owner of the holiday home, businessman D. Pogorelov, and his wife Pak N.V., who filed a lawsuit on the dissolution of the marriage and acquired the company using fake documents.  According to the statement of the shareholders of the company, a criminal case was opened on the fact of fraud. </p><p>  It would be interesting for potential vacationers to find out that at the moment justice has been restored, fraudsters have been convicted and property has been transferred to their rightful owner.  The largest recreation center Pokrovsky <span>in the Moscow Region</span> , which simultaneously hosts up to 1700 vacationers, belongs to D. Yu. Pogorelov, who has owned the company since the early 2000s. </p>
