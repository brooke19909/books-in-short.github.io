    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the high status possessed by the Vysotsky Hotel (Yekaterinburg), reviews about it also contain a number of negative comments: </p><ul><li>  since the rooms are located on the upper floors, there are some problems with the hot water supply - very low pressure; </li><li>  in some rooms designed for two guests, bath amenities and cosmetics are provided for only one; </li><li>  despite the fact that a visit to the spa is included in the price of the room, a preliminary appointment is needed, which the reception staff do not warn guests about; </li><li>  some rooms have insufficiently clean windows, which significantly spoils the impression, because a beautiful panoramic view is the main highlight of the hotel. </li></ul><p>  Beautiful cityscapes will be opened before you by the Vysotsky Hotel.  Yekaterinburg will be at your fingertips.  This is a posh hotel that will appeal to both tourists who want to get to know the city and business people who want to relax after work in a luxurious setting. </p>
