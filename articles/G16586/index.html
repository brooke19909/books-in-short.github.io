This is a highly developed and dynamic crossroads in Asia, which is also the gateway to mainland China. </p><p>  Hong Kong amazes everyone who arrives at first sight with an abundance of colors, the number of modern skyscrapers, luminous hieroglyphics on signs, an endless stream of cars, a huge number of people living on a rather modest plot of land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong beaches" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1337913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the largest financial center in Asia and the world, is located in southeastern China and borders the Guangdong Province, whose capital is <span>Guangzhou.</span>  Hong Kong is divided into three zones: the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong Island, as well as the New Territories, which include rural areas on the mainland north of Kowloon and south of the border with mainland China.  In addition, 260 small islands are included in Hong Kong. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Hong Kong has a monsoon, tropical climate with warm autumn, rainy and hot summers and spring, as well as dry and cool winters.  Critical temperature values ‚Äã‚Äãrange from 0 ¬∞ C to +38 ¬∞ C. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In January it is quite warm (+16 ¬∞ C), in July it is hot (+ 30 ¬∞ C).

At this time, you can relax on the beach and explore local attractions without suffering from unbearable heat. </p><h2>  Holidays in Hong Kong </h2><p>  The mixture of Asian and European cultures gives this amazing city a special appeal.  The modern and classical antiquity of buildings, the unhurriedness of oriental ceremonies and the crazy rhythm of the modern metropolis, the fun in countless nightclubs and the highest spirituality of temples - all this makes this area unique. </p><p>  The Chinese joke that Hong Kong is chasing two birds with one stone, and admit that it manages to catch both.  As a rule, tourists who arrived here for the first time love to walk along noisy streets, looking at skyscrapers, the tops of which are lost in the clouds.  You can admire the panorama of the city from the observation deck, take part in a tea ceremony, climb the mountains by tram, visit local fortune tellers and find out your fate, lie on the beach - Hong Kong offers various leisure options. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are so many interesting and memorable places on this earth that it is impossible to even quickly examine them in one trip.  Below we will present you only some of them, the most popular. </p><h2>  Big buddha </h2><p>  A giant of 34 meters in height is closely watching the Chinese people.  You can approach the bronze giant by breaking 268 steps.  Nearby is the Po Lin Monastery with its magnificent garden, which is filled with the fragrance of flowers and birdsong. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best beaches of hong kong" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1337910.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Golden Bauhinia Square </h2><p>  This is a symbol of Hong Kong, a reunion monument, a gift to the city from the Central Government.  In the evening, this "Hong Kong orchid" is very competently highlighted.  Nearby you can see a 20-meter stele, collected from 206 stone slabs, which symbolize the country's historical dates and future years.  Every day at 8 am the state flag flies on the square to the accompaniment of the national anthem. </p><h2>  Symphony of Lights </h2><p>  This amazing show is listed in the Guinness Book of Records.  Searchlights and laser beams against the background of the night sky create an amazing, fabulous performance.  For Christmas or New Year the show is accompanied by fireworks. </p><h2>  Beaches in Hong Kong </h2><p>  Hong Kong's coastline is indented with numerous bays and bays.  She stretched for several kilometers.  The beaches of <span>Hong Kong (photos</span> you can see in this article) are mostly reliably protected by the mountains from the wind.  There are no very large waves, so they are so loved by guests with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hong Kong beaches photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1337923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The best beaches in Hong Kong are municipal.  This means that everyone can sit for free in any place that they liked.  Today, on the island of Hong Kong, as well as in the southern part of the Coluon Peninsula, there are twelve municipal beaches, and in the New Territories another thirty-three.  Of course, there are private beaches in Hong Kong.  They can be visited by paying an admission ticket. </p><h2>  Hong Kong: Lo So Shing and Hung Shue Yeh beaches </h2><p>  These places of rest, despite their remoteness, are very popular.  They are located on the island of Lamma.  The question arises: "How to get to the beach in Hong Kong?"  To do this, you need to use the ferry, which departs from the city center.  The pier is located near the skyscraper, which houses the international financial center.  The trip is paid in cash or by card. </p><p>  A pleasant boat trip takes only thirty minutes.  Then from the pier you need to walk (following the signs) to the beach of Hung Shue Yeh.  There are no cars or buses on Lamma Island.  Locals move on foot or by bicycle. </p><p>  The beaches of Hong Kong (reviews of tourists confirm this) amaze with the purity of the water.  This fully applies to Hung Shue Yeh.  It is surrounded by picturesque hills and dense vegetation.  The bathing area is indicated by buoys, two rescuers are constantly working - one is always at sea on a catamaran, the second on a rescue tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong beaches reviews" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1337916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you prefer a more secluded vacation, then go through the beach of Hung Shue Yeh, then walk through the jungle (there are signs).  Thirty minutes later you will find yourself on the nearby Lo So Shing beach.  This is the most secluded place on the island of Lamma.  The white sand and warm sea are simply amazing.  The beach is well maintained and well equipped.  There are several bars on the shore that offer light snacks according to national recipes.  Rescuers and protective nets from sharks will help you feel completely safe. </p><h2>  Silvermine bay beach </h2><p>  This wonderful place is located on the island of Lantau, in the bay of Silvermine.  All guests arriving in Hong Kong try to come here.  Beaches of this level attract vacationers with their incredible cleanliness, luxurious landscapes, calm atmosphere.

He was awarded the first class for serving vacationers.  It is very small, but very clean and well maintained.  It has all the necessary infrastructure. </p><h2>  Repulse bay </h2><p>  One of the most famous and popular beaches of Hong Kong.  It is located in the beautiful bay of the city, in its expensive and prestigious area.
