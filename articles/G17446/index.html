    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Initially, the ancient Indian settlement of Conkerabia was located on this territory.  However, the arrival of the conquerors from Spain in the 16th century contributed to the founding of this city.  The name, which is now known to everyone, appeared already in 1797.  This happened after the entry of these islands into the British Empire.  Literally, the name of the city translates as "port of Spain."  And in the last century, in the 70s, the state ceased to be a colony and gained independence.  After that, Port of Spain became the capital of the republic.  In recent years, the city has been developing successfully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This small town is located on the <span>island of Trinidad</span> (northwestern part).  It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Paria (Caribbean Sea).  If you look to the north, then very close, just 10 km, is the coast of Venezuela, and to the south - the island of Grenada.  On the world map, the city can be found at the following coordinates: 10 ¬∞ 40‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ s.  w.  61 ¬∞ 31‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ s  d. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="port of spain trinidad tobago" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1314523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Natives of Africa and descendants of Arabs - the bulk of the inhabitants of the city of Port of Spain.  The capital has also become a home for immigrants from Europe and China, but there are not many of them.  The total population of the city is about 50 thousand people.  The official language, of course, is English, but some residents still communicate exclusively in Spanish or Creole. </p><h2>  Natural conditions and climate features </h2><p>  In Port of Spain, the climate is humid and hot.  Refers to subequatorial.  Almost all year in the city there is heat, which contributes to the development of tourism.  The average daily temperature in January is +26 ¬∞ C, in July - +28 ¬∞ C.  As in all corners of the Earth where the subequatorial climate reigns, rains with drought alternate in the city.  The latter falls on the period January - May, at which time the city is not so hot.  The trade winds contribute to lowering the temperature.  During rains in the city, heavy tropical showers often occur. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most common trees on the island are sandalwood, cypress, and bush.  From the animal world there is a wide variety of tropical birds that can be found in the city, turtles, snakes and lizards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="port of spain capital" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1314524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cultural significance </h2><p>  Three religions coexist quietly in Port of Spain: Christian, Muslim and Hindu.  Accordingly, in the capital there are many different temples, which are the national monuments of the islands.  The oldest of them is over 450 years old. </p><p>  The main attractions are two beautiful cathedrals - Anglican and Catholic.  Within the city is the National Museum, which houses more than 3,000 exhibits on the history of the island.  It is worth noting the art gallery, which presents about 500 paintings. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Port of Spain is actively developing tourism.  There will be no problems with housing.  The capital has many coastal hotels, mid-range hotels, as well as local residents are actively renting out apartments.  Cost depends on location and conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="port of spain time" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1314521.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are various eateries, cafes and restaurants throughout the city.  They can enjoy national cuisine.  Tourists most often prefer it to her.  Traditional treats are pigeon pi and palhun.  The city is also famous for its baked shark fins with spicy curry sauce, which locals love very much.  But if a tourist is accustomed to a particular cuisine, then there will be no problems with this either.  There are Chinese, European and other restaurants in the city.  Since tourism is developing more precisely in Port of Spain, the prices in such institutions are rather high.  In case of a limited budget, fast food will come to the rescue. </p><p>  The capital offers tourists a lot of entertainment: beaches with white sand, clean beautiful streets, parks with magnificent nature.  But the most important thing is, of course, the carnival, which in terms of scale is second only to the Brazilian one.  There is also an active holiday with boat trips, surfing, diving. </p><p>  Port of Spain is a wonderful city that is good both for living and for tourism.  Every year it is developing for the better, which is impossible not to notice. </p>
