Fishing on the Volga</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each person has a hobby: someone collects stamps, others collect coins, and someone cannot imagine their life without fishing.  And it is no secret that such a fiery hobby can occupy the lion's share of free time.  Sometimes close people suffer from this addiction, because often, instead of spending time with the family, an avid fisherman spends it on the banks of a river or lake.  And if you are in such a situation, then try to at least sometimes all go fishing together.  This will make your family even stronger and happier.  With children, of course, it is better to do this in the summer, because not everyone will appreciate all the charms of winter fishing.  And while the father of the family with enthusiasm will fish out the river inhabitants, the rest of the family members will be able to buy enough and sunbathe.  And if we are already talking about fishing, then, of course, it must be arranged on the Volga.  If you plan to leave for a few days, then it is better to take care of in advance what will be the rest on the Volga.  Recreation facilities will help you organize unforgettable leisure.  At your service will be not only fishing, but also many other kinds of various entertainments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the Volga recreation center" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/465097.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  The Volga River Flows </h2><p>  Volga is the central waterway of Russia.  And it is also one of the deepest rivers in the world.  The majestic lowland river is striking in its power and beauty.  Isn't that why so many songs are composed about her?  This river is divided into three zones: Upper Volga, Middle and Lower.  From the source to Nizhny Novgorod, the river (upper part) flows through the forest zone, the middle - along the forest-steppe, and the lower - along the steppe.  Therefore, each person will be able to find a place for himself.  The length of the river is 3350 kilometers.  The water temperature in the summer reaches 20-25 degrees, because you can sunbathe and swim up from the heart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation centers on the Volga Samara" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/465095.jpg" width="500"></div>
