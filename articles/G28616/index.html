  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Income tax - refund</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Taxes, which are the main type of direct payments that are levied on both legal entities and <span>individuals, are</span> determined as income tax.  Such taxes are deducted from the total income, that is, from total earnings for the past year.  Also, taxes can be deducted from current and monthly income.  This usually looks like a one-time payout. </p><p>  If the salary is less than the amount that is taxable, then no deductions are made.  In our country, a pension is not subject to taxation. </p><p>  Income subject to tax is determined by subtracting 13% of the total amount earned, taking into account all the benefits and discounts that have a legitimate basis. </p><p>  Citizens are taxable regardless of whether or not they have a permanent residence in Russia.  The main thing is that they stay on the territory of the Russian Federation for 13 days or more. </p><p>  Many are interested in how to return the income tax, if there is a benefit, but they do not know how to use it.  This is a rather complicated procedure, accompanied by bureaucratic delays.  It is necessary to present a <span>tax return, an application for the return of</span> tax funds, as well as a deduction.  If this is your first time in such a situation, it is better to entrust documents to a person legally competent in this field. </p><p>  To whom income tax can be returned, we learn below.  For the first time, a person buying a home has the full right to a refund of 260,000 rubles in the event that a <span>title</span> deed was received after January 1, 2008.  When registering a transaction earlier than the specified date, money up to 130,000 rubles can be returned.  Sometimes disputes regarding tax refunds are resolved in court.  This happens in cases where a citizen does not agree with the decision of the tax inspectorate.  Usually these are amounts in excess of official tax deductions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For mortgages, the borrower can return income tax in the amount of 13% of the deducted tax amount. </p><p>  Property sold that has been owned for more than three years does not imply property deductions.  That is, money received from the sale of, for example, an apartment is not taxed.  Such a rule is valid for precedents that arose in 2009. </p><p>  From what time is the countdown of three years.  Example: </p><p>  You were presented with an apartment, you exchanged it, or entered into an annuity contract, therefore, the beginning of the term will be considered the moment when the property was registered in the regal chamber.  In the event that you bought housing in a new building, the countdown begins from the moment when you received a certificate of ownership.  Transfer of real estate by inheritance - ownership of it from the moment of the death of the heir.  If your apartment was cooperative, then after all payments are made, the tenure begins to be calculated. </p><p>  What income tax exemptions do these days have?  As we know, the main tax is 13%.  Based on this, personal income tax is calculated and paid.  There are many cases where a person who has already paid a tax has the right to a refund if legal grounds for this have arisen. </p><p>  Refunds can be made in the following situations: </p><ol><li>  When your own house is being built; </li><li>  When purchasing a car, private house or apartment; </li><li>  Upon receipt of a loan or a mortgage loan; </li><li>  Teaching children or their own studies; </li><li>  When buying medicines or treatment; </li><li>  Upon purchase of VHI insurance; </li><li>  With <span>voluntary pension insurance</span> ; </li><li>  With donations from the church; </li><li>  When doing charity work. </li></ol><p>  If the income tax could not be returned in the near future, there is no need to despair.  There is an official period during which you can repeat the return procedure.  He is three years old. </p>
