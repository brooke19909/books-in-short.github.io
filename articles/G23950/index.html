You will also need to do several steps in advance, therefore it is better to do it now: synchronize the phone with the computer in order to have access to the smartphone and turn off the option ‚ÄúFind my iPhone‚Äù (but do this only in the most extreme case). </p><h2>  How to restore an iPhone if you forget your password? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="geekhacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unlocked phone" class="if uuid-2979169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2979169.jpg"></div><p>  If you do this through iTunes, then follow these steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Connect your devices to the PC or Macbook with which you usually sync.  Open iTunes. </li><li>  If your device does not respond or does not synchronize automatically, then manually synchronize the device with iTunes on the MacBook or PC. </li><li>  When the backup and synchronization are over, you will need to restore your iPhone and select ‚ÄúRestore iPhone‚Äù. </li><li>  The iOS debugging assistant will ask you to reconfigure the iPhone, so just click on the "Restore from iTunes backup" item. </li></ul><p>  Now know that at this stage all your information and even the password to access the smartphone will be deleted and replaced with backup files.  Now you have the opportunity to come up with a new password and use the device for your pleasure. </p><h2>  Password reset via iCloud and the option ‚ÄúFind my iPhone‚Äù </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.macster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apparatus recovery" class="if uuid-2979171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2979171.jpg"></div><p>  If the function ‚ÄúFind my iPhone‚Äù is active, then on your iPhone you can use the option to delete a forgotten access code.  This is easy to do, just follow the instructions in stages.  This solution already requires the ‚ÄúFind My iPhone‚Äù mode and full synchronization in the past. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Visit the icloud page and log in with your Apple ID. </li><li>  Click on "Find my iPhone." </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúAll devices‚Äù item, it is located in the upper area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour browser window. </li><li>  Choose an iPhone from the listed devices.

" </li><li>  The process of scanning all data on the device begins. </li><li>  Now all the data has been exported to the computer and a backup will be made. </li></ol><p>  Now feel free to do the full ‚ÄúRecovery‚Äù, while resetting the password from the iPhone, you will already have all the data, you will not lose anything. </p><h2>  What to do if you forgot your Apple ID password? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="e-wiki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Password reset occurred" class="if uuid-2979166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2979166.jpg"></div><p>  Many are worried about how to reset the ID password on an iPhone, because some people think that if the password is forgotten, then everything is impossible to use the device anymore.  This is not so, you can regain access to your Apple ID, the main thing is to know how. </p><p>  The easiest way to recover your account password is to send a special message to your inbox.  Follow the instructions below: </p><ol><li>  Visit iforgot.apple and enter your email id from your Apple ID.  Click on Continue. </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúReceive Email‚Äù, click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù again. </li><li>  A letter will come to your mail, where there will be a link to reset the password.

Do the following: </p><ol><li>  Go to the iforgot.apple page, enter your mail there, which was indicated as the Apple ID and click on "Continue". </li><li>  We select the column "Answer the control questions." </li><li>  Enter your date of birth (the one that was specified when registering Apple ID). </li><li>  Give the correct answers to two control questions. </li><li>  If the answers were correct, you can come up with a different password. </li></ol><p>  In such simple ways, you can reset the password from your smartphone or the password from your Apple ID account.  This knowledge may not be useful, but it is better to know and understand what to do than to be completely unprepared for failures.  The main thing is not to panic and immediately understand: you can unlock the device, you have all the data for this (if you are the owner of this iPhone, of course). </p>
