    <h2>  Nabeul, Tunisia </h2><p>  This city by the sea is called the capital of potters.  The resort itself is still not very popular, there are few hotels, and there are not many people in them.  Therefore, you have the opportunity to observe the authentic life of Tunisians if you come to Les Pyramides 3. Nabeul lives in the usual patriarchal rhythm: crafts, picking flowers of oranges, as well as their fruits - you can see all this yourself.  In addition, the markets here are not tourist ones, and the prices do not bite.  And to the famous entertainment of Hammamet - just a stone's throw: you can get on a minibus in a quarter of an hour.  The hotels here are cheap, although located a few meters from the wonderful beaches and the sound of the surf.  Here you can relax, but not be too far from civilization.  Take a walk around this beautiful city, enjoy citrus fruits, buy orange blossom, which is famous for the land, and also take pictures wherever you can!  Lovers of beautiful ceramics in oriental style, rejoice: this is your resort! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory Les Pyramides 3 Nabeul </h2><p>  The hotel consists of a main three-story white building, several cottages and bungalows with terraces.  The main building is right next to the sea.  Recently, repairs have been made here.  The territory is not very large, but well-groomed, comfortable and green.  Everywhere flowers, palm trees.  Tourists write that everything is very beautiful.  There is parking for cars, a spa center, as in most Tunisian beach hotels.  Many different shops where you can buy almost everything and at very cheap prices.  Nearby is a supermarket, a variety of cafes.  Two steps away is a good hotel “Cheops”, where you can go to the guests of the “Pyramids”, and not just go in, but use its territory, pool and slides.  Both hotels have one owner. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Les Pyramides 3 is all inclusive.  If you chose this <span>type of food,</span> then alcohol will be served to you from ten in the morning until midnight.  At other times, it is paid.  The main restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as snacks (by the hour).  The all-inclusive system is served in the lobby bar and poolside cafe.  There is a <span>Moorish-style</span> tavern and a disco.  But using them is only at an additional cost.  Tourists are very happy with the food, and the local chef is called a sorcerer.  Both national Tunisian and European cuisine is served.  Good reviews of meat and fish dishes, salads and side dishes, not to mention cakes, rolls, colorful halva and other confectionery products.  There are even seafood.  Alcohol is poured directly from the bottles, not diluted.  Good local Sedratin liquor.  In a restaurant you are often assigned a certain table, and then you do not have to look for a place. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Les pyramides 3 Tunisia" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/612820.jpg" width="350"></div></h2><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Les Pyramides 3 has its own fenced beach and two swimming pools (air and indoor, heated).  The coast here, as in most Tunisian resorts, is sandy.  Sun beds and umbrellas near the pool and on the beach are free.  If suddenly something is missing, then “scourge battles” will bring all the missing.  The sea is warm, transparent, almost no waves and windy weather in the season.  On the beach there are many water activities - parachutes, tablets and more.  Go to the sea for two minutes on the hotel grounds.  The beach is clean, it is constantly cleaned.  The Cheops Hotel, as already mentioned, allows the Pyramids to enter its territory.  This also applies to the beach and its services. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  To get to know the local sights, just leave the hotel Les Pyramides 3. Nabeul is a quarter of an hour from the hotel.  You need to go away from the sea, go to the Monopri supermarket, then the symbol of the city - a pine growing from a jug - and you find yourself in old quarters (Medina).  There is a large market almost every day, especially on Fridays.  In front of the market is a museum that tourists strongly recommend visiting.  You can also walk along the shopping streets and shops, get acquainted with the local life.  Tourists recommend a glimpse into the water park (in the neighboring Cheops hotel) with good slides - the children there really like it.  If you want to travel around the country, then the railway station in Nabeul will help you.  From there trains leave for Carthage, Sousse, Tunisia.  True, they are early: the first flights at six in the morning.  But there is an opportunity to really explore different cities.  The trains are fast, beautiful, comfortable and clean.  And since you can go to breakfast from five in the morning, you will have time to eat before the tour.  A shuttle bus takes you to the Korbus thermal springs.  Travel organized, and it doesn’t matter if you buy them at a hotel or from other tour operators - they are still very expensive. </p>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of many tourists, it was the price of the ticket that influenced the decision to come to Hotel Les Pyramides 3 (Tunisia).  And it is such that even during a crisis and rising prices for everything and everyone, people with an average income can afford to relax here.  Rooms are rented for two thousand rubles a day (for two).  Of course, some services are not included in the price of the permit.  For example, delicious donuts are fried on the territory of the hotel - two dinars each.  Children are delighted with them.  Rent a small safe in the lobby - one dinar per day, a large - three.  7 TND is worth using a minibar (no drinks).  Souvenirs are best bought in Nabeul - it is the cheapest of all Tunisian cities.  If you have half board and you have lunch in another place, then a large pizza with fish costs five dinars, and freshly squeezed juice - one.  Good prices in the supermarket "Karfur".  Dates there are one and a half dinars, and halva - 4-6.  The nearest cities can be reached by shuttle bus.  For this you will have to pay one and a half to two dinars per person.  4-5 TND costs a train ticket.  Taxis to the city and back - 3-4 dinars.  Nabeul is a great starting point for various trips, and many tourists have seen this. </p><h2>  Hotel Les Pyramides 3 Nabeul Holiday Reviews </h2><p>  Usually they don’t expect much from “treshki” and take vouchers exclusively for the sake of the sea and the sun.  But here you will get much more than you expected: excellent service, amazing food and exciting excursions.  This hotel does not have a lot of people - including in a restaurant, on the beach and in the sea.  This means that there are no queues, and everyone has enough sunbeds.  The hotel staff evokes only positive emotions.  The real home atmosphere reigns here - everyone smiles, greets, tries to help.  Although workers mostly speak French and English, you will always be understood, even if you do not speak these languages.  The hotel has many Europeans, so the atmosphere is very decent.  The locals also like to relax in the hotel, which indicates good quality and cheapness.  And the team of animators will always cheer you up and charge you positively in any weather.  Reviews from tourists make it clear that the "stardom" of the hotel is underestimated, in fact, it deserves a solid "four". </p>
