    <p>  The noise is a chaotic mix of different sounds.  The physical characteristic of its volume is decibels.  They indicate the degree of sound pressure. </p><p>  The noise level, which is within the natural limits for humans, ranges from twenty to thirty decibels.  Such a <span>sound volume is</span> not capable of causing any harm and is considered comfortable.  For example, such noise is made by rustling leaves on trees.  However, each person gives individual preferences to a certain level of ambient sounds.  There are <span>people whose performance</span> drops sharply if the surroundings are too quiet.  To eliminate discomfort, they can turn on background music.  Silence for others should be broken only by the tick of the clock. </p><p>  <span>The noise level,</span> which is measured at a distance of two meters from the housing, according to sanitary recommendations, should not be higher than fifty-five decibels.  These are sounds from a normal conversation between people or a kettle boiling on a stove (if you are half a meter away from it). </p><p>  In large cities, compliance with these standards is not possible.  Busy motorways and new construction contribute to this.  The noise level in decibels from a car passing near you will be about seventy.  The motorcycle, bus and truck cause us even more discomfort.  Their noise levels reach a limit of ninety decibels.  Thus, walking along the highway, a person picks up sounds that far exceed the sanitary norm. </p><p>  The noise level of stations and airports in our lives is the maximum.  Trains and planes are capable of making sounds whose volume reaches a limit of one hundred decibels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Increased noise levels are hazardous to human health.  If sounds exceeding eighty decibels are constantly affected by our <span>hearing organs</span> , then such an environment is considered harmful to the body.  Workers who work under such production conditions should be periodically given a referral for a medical examination. </p><p>  The noise level that reaches the border of one hundred and thirty decibels can cause physical pain.  A mark of one hundred and fifty causes a loss of consciousness.  One hundred and eighty decibels destroy the metal and are fatal.  Fortunately, in everyday reality this level of pressure is extremely rare. </p><p>  In order to understand how bad the environment is for your health, you need to decide how to measure the noise level.  There is a special device for this, available in various versions.  It is called a sound level meter.  In order to measure the volume readings in residential premises, there are domestic, and in industrial - industrial devices.  A wide range of sound level meters is also available that can detect the level of infra- and ultrasound. </p><p>  Tones that are in the range of low and high frequencies are perceived by us as quieter.  The sound level meter is equipped with a special electronic filter that modulates various indicators and normalizes measurements. </p><p>  Constant loud noises reduce our hearing.  Loud noise can cause acoustic injury.  This pathology may be acute or chronic.  The first type of injury can be obtained from sharp <span>sound signals</span> that sounded in the immediate vicinity of the hearing organs (the whistle of a passing train, the rumble of some installation).  The consequence of this kind of exposure can be: </p><p>  - pain in the auricle; </p><p>  - internal hemorrhage; </p><p>  - swelling and displacement of cells located in the inner ear. </p><p>  Over a period of time, it seems to a person that deafness has come.  Sometimes loud sounds can cause the eardrum to rupture. </p><p>  With a constant long-term stay in a noisy room there is an acoustic injury of a chronic type.  Its consequence is dullness of hearing. </p>
