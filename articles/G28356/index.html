    <h2>  Kitchen Area </h2><p>  About <span>Artemis Hotel</span> Apartments 3 * (Cyprus, Protaras) reviews are mostly positive.  You can begin to consider them with a description of the kitchen.  Its presence in each room is the main highlight of the hotel.  Everyone knows how expensive it is to eat in the Eurozone.  In addition, despite the abundance of restaurants and cafes, not everyone may like food and is not at all suitable for feeding young children.  Therefore, a room with a kitchen for a modest tourist is always a great choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Even if something is missing in the kitchen, at the front desk you can ask for everything you need.  There is simply no need to bring anything from home. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Artemis Hotel Apartments 3 * (Protaras) is located at a relative distance from the sea.  Many consider this a plus, since you can go to various beaches and choose the best one for yourself. </p><p>  If you turn left after leaving the hotel and follow the sign a bit down, you will find yourself on a beautiful and convenient beach in Fig Tree Bay - Sunrise Beach.  This is probably one of the best beaches on the east coast.  It is here that families with children prefer to relax.  The standard road to it takes about fifteen minutes at a calm pace.  But you can reduce the time to the beach a little if you turn off the main road and go to the sea through the field.  In the sweltering heat it will be very handy. </p>

    <p>  By cons include: </p><ul><li>  almost complete lack of understanding of the Russian language, even at the reception; </li><li>  poor-quality double-glazed windows, due to which the noise of a bar or road interferes with sleep in the evenings (depending on the location of the room); </li><li>  the distance from the airport is 67 km (however, for some it is a lot, but for someone it is not enough); </li><li>  rare public transport to the airport; </li><li>  paid network access plus poor Wi-Fi signal; </li><li>  remoteness from the beach (10-15 minutes walk). </li></ul><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  proximity to Ayia Napa; </li><li>  clean and beautiful pool; </li><li>  kitchen in the room; </li><li>  good air conditioning; </li><li>  free private parking; </li><li>  complete safety; </li><li>  good gym; </li><li>  the presence of a large number of beautiful beaches around; </li><li>  A large selection of shops and restaurants nearby for every taste. </li></ul><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  This hotel is mainly inhabited by foreigners (English), there are very few Russians.  Nevertheless, Artemis Hotel Apartments (Cyprus, Protaras) has already earned a high rating among Russian tour operators.  Experts believe that it is fully consistent with its stated three stars for all evaluation criteria.  Judge for yourself: according to the end of 2016, at Tripadvisor, it ranks 46th out of 67 Protaras hotels.  Reviews of Tophotels tourists rate it at 4.1 points out of 5, and Booking site visitors rated it at 6.9 points out of 10. </p><p>  For relatively little money (by European standards), tourists get good food from the hotel, spacious and clean rooms, a wonderful pool and relaxation areas, the ability to eat on their own without leaving their rooms, and complete freedom of movement.  After all, the small territory of the hotel always encourages tourists to get outside and see something interesting.  And Cyprus just belongs to those countries where there is always something to do. </p>
