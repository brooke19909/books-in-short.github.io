In accordance with the federal program, the metropolis is getting rid of morally and physically obsolete notorious Khrushchevs who have outlived their factory buildings and other industrial enterprises, and modern residential complexes are being built in their place.  <span>Moskovsky district</span> is located in the city center and is one of the oldest.  In this connection, his attention is paid to renovation.  Only those companies that have a truly transparent reputation in the real estate market can get permission to build new objects.  In addition, you still need to provide a professional project. </p>

    <p>  The Leader Group company succeeded.  And now she is engaged in the construction of a multi-storey residential complex ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù in the Moscow region of St. Petersburg.  The address of the complex is 13. Moskovskoye Shosse, 13. If you want to find it, you need to focus on the Zvezdnaya metro station.  From it to the complex can be reached in eight minutes. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  This project cannot be called large-scale, since only two buildings are under construction.  One of them will have 17 floors, the second - 23. In total, it is planned to put up for sale 576 residential premises.  The first floors of buildings will be given for commercial real estate.  Housing belongs to the comfort class.  Apartments are sold on the basis of an equity agreement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  RC "Sirius": the developer </h2><p>  Represents the project on the market of IC "Leader-Group".  The company has been operating since 1992, however, it mastered the construction of residential facilities in the UK only in 2002.  Due to the high competition in the real estate market, the management decided to carry out all work in an integrated manner, without involving third-party contractors.  At the moment, ‚ÄúLeader Group‚Äù has its own design bureau and a whole staff of specialists responsible for managing resources, optimizing costs, the process of building and preparing houses for sale, as well as the legal component of transactions and the execution of contracts. </p>

    <p>  The company currently has 25 completed projects, all the work of the SC is carried out exclusively in accordance with the schedule and strictly complies with the commissioning deadlines.  Leader Group has established itself in the market as an exclusively responsible developer. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Work on the construction of the complex began in the fall of 2015.  By the end of 2016, it is planned to complete the construction of the first phase of the Sirius residential complex.  ‚ÄúLeader-Group‚Äù provides on its official website full and absolutely transparent information regarding the progress of construction, so that every potential client who has already invested his money can easily get all the answers to his questions.

    <p>  Of course, each potential owner of an apartment in a particular new building first of all tries to find out all the minuses and advantages of the residential complex, as well as the main characteristics regarding the environment, the availability of infrastructure facilities, the transport component of the area in which this complex is being built.  That offers people "LCD" Sirius ", reviews of those who have already made a decision and purchased an apartment, - further. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Naturally, if we now begin to say that the environmental situation in the Moscow region is impeccable, not a single sane person will believe this.  This cannot be a priori, if only because it is one of the old regions in which pipes of large industrial enterprises have been smoking for several years, and in some places still continue to do so.  However, not everything is so bad.  Firstly, the complex is being built in the cleanest in terms of ecology area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe district - its southern part.  Secondly, next to it there are several large parks that positively affect the environmental situation.  Thirdly, the developer plans to carry out massive work on landscaping, which should also improve the situation. </p>

    <p>  In addition, as people say, who leave reviews about the Sirius residential complex, no one expected that the air would be filled with the aroma of <span>Pitsunda pines.</span>  But everyone hopes that after the completion of the renovation program, many industrial facilities will be removed from the district. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  And here is the complete order.  Almost all objects of retail, entertainment and <span>social infrastructure</span> are within walking distance.  Which, however, is also not surprising, because, as already mentioned, the Moskovsky district is one of the oldest in St. Petersburg, so here, literally at every step you can meet if not a huge supermarket, then a fairly large shopping center for sure.  Restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, clinics, schools, kindergartens, up to private - similar facilities near the LCD "Sirius" in abundance.  In addition, on the first floors of the buildings there will be numerous commercial services, which will make the lives of their inhabitants fully consistent with the declared comfort class. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  A little more than a kilometer to the Zvezdnaya metro station - this, by the scale of the metropolis, is not at all a distance.  You can get to it in eight minutes or drive by bus or minibus, since there are enough of them, and the stop is located next to the houses. </p><p>  Seven kilometers from the Sirius LCD there is a ramp to the roundabout; in addition, you can use the services of Moskovsky and Pulkovsky shosse.  In general, regarding transport support, even if one wants to, it is simply impossible to speak negatively. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  In the first building, it is proposed to purchase 134 residential premises, in the second - 442. Studios and 1-2-3-room apartments are offered for sale.  Moreover, the "treshki" will be only in the second building.  As for the layouts, they fully comply with the declared comfort class.  All living quarters are functional, the room layout is ergonomic, there are also Euroformat housing options (combined living room and kitchen).  Two bathrooms are equipped in three-room apartments, these rooms are separate in two-room apartments, combined in studios and one-room apartments.  The hallways are large, regardless of the format of the apartments, each of them is equipped with a glazed loggia. </p>

    <p>  As for the kitchens, they are also very spacious.  The smallest area is at least 11 square meters.  m, the largest - almost 23 square meters.  m. Ceiling height - 2 m 80 cm. Apartments are sold without decoration. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments, depending on the format, ranges from 27 to 89 square meters.  m. In this regard, the cost varies.  So, the studio will cost 2,400,000-3,245,000 rubles, ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù - 3,700,000-4,700,000, ‚Äúdvushka‚Äù - 5,600,000-6,900,000, and seven to eight million will have to be paid for the three rubles. </p><h2>  LCD "Sirius": feedback from real estate investors </h2><p>  What do people say about the complex?  By and large, at this stage it is too early to draw any conclusions.  Many people say that they hope that everything will be in order with the quality of housing, as they were interested in the opinions of those who already live in houses erected by the Leader-Group IC, to which they received only positive feedback.  While the complex is under construction, the only thing that can be checked at this stage is compliance with the work schedule.  Everything is in order with this issue.  The developer regularly holds promotions, so you can buy housing cheaper, which is certainly noted in their reviews by those who have already taken this opportunity.  Many people like the fact that the buildings will be equipped with elevators, which you can go down to the underground parking.  In addition, many praise both the layout of the apartments and their diversity - there is a choice.  The cost of housing, by the way, is considered by everyone to be quite acceptable, especially considering its comfortable class. </p>

    <p>  So, by and large, at this stage, the negative comes only in relation to the environment.  However, as already mentioned, no one said that the complex would be located in Pitsunda.  It is located in the center of St. Petersburg, so you can only put up with the environmental situation in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe metropolis.  Not so disgusting.  In addition, there are prerequisites that in the future the situation will become much more stable. </p>
