    <p>  The future Duchess Catherine was born in fact in an ordinary family in the British county of Berkshire.  Her ancestors belong to the working class, they were miners.  As for the parents themselves, the angels themselves favored their acquaintance, since it happened in the sky.  Kate's mother was a flight attendant, and her father was a dispatcher.  Five years after the birth of the baby, her parents realized that it was impossible to earn money by working alone in aviation in order to feed the family.  They open their own business, engaged in the delivery of holiday goods.  It was this once small company that made the Middleton family millionaires. </p>

    <p>  The wealth, which increased significantly in the Middleton family, contributed to the fact that the Duchess Catherine studied at Marlborough College, after which she successfully entered Saint Andrews - a prestigious university.  It was in him that she met her future husband - Prince William.  The first few years, a young couple studied art history at the relevant faculty, but then the young man from the <span>royal family</span> decided to change the direction of his education and transferred.  Now he was studying geographical knowledge.  However, the question of choosing a faculty was not a matter of principle for him, since he planned to quit his studies altogether.  However, it is rumored that it was the future Duchess Catherine who persuaded him not to make such a big mistake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After graduation, each of them went about his own business, and in 2007, fate scattered them on opposite sides of England.  Long separation caused the young people to officially announce their separation.  However, within a few months, the lovers were again seen together. </p><p>  In 2010, the engagement of Kate and the prince took place, and the next year the wedding was played.  At this point, society became interested in a new question: "Is the Duchess Catherine pregnant?"  The photos and information that was published in each newspaper kept proving or refuting rumors about pregnancy. </p>

    <p>  Despite his royal origin, the prince regularly serves.  In order for his work not to separate the spouses, they moved to the island of Anglesey, where William serves as a pilot.  And, undoubtedly, he is a vivid representative of those honest and valiant people who will never use their position for personal gain.  Both Kate and William have always believed that belonging to the royal family does not relieve them of work. </p><p>  At the moment, the girl born in the distant 1982 has an official title, from the day of the wedding she is Catherine the <span>Duchess of Cambridge.</span>  Unlike many other famous people, Kate still does not lose her popularity, despite the fact that the affair with the prince has long ended with a wedding.  And the birth of a child attracted the attention of journalists even more. </p>
