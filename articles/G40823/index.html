To get started, let's try to think logically about how you can secure your device, and so expensive.  The basis of security will be played not only by the bumper on the 6 "iPhone, but also by a careful, accurate attitude to the smartphone. But let's not forget that you won‚Äôt be fed up with this alone, but accuracy can not always save. </p><h2>  Does it make sense to buy a bumper on the 6 "iPhone"? </h2>

    <p>  Even the most accurate user will drop their device sooner or later.  But when it costs so much, the process of falling is visible like a slow motion.  It takes forever until the device falls to the surface.  It turns out that it is impossible to completely protect your device from this kind of situation with accuracy alone.  Here, as never before, the question of what needs to be done to <span>protect the phone</span> from damage as much as possible becomes relevant.  The bumper on the 6 iPhone can help with this.  There are a huge number of them on the market today, but today we‚Äôll talk about DracoDesign products or, as users call it, just Draco.  It should be noted that a similar bumper on the "iPhone 6 Plus" will be a good addition to the protective glass.  And such a combination will protect the device several times from causing external mechanical damage.  So, a little about the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Draco Devices </h2>

    <p>  Accessories and products of this company (and these are not only bumpers, but also all kinds of external batteries, styluses, phone stands) are sold in the territory of the Russian Federation by a separate distributor.  Major projects have been developed in Japan as well as in the United States, a similar trend is currently taking place.  Meanwhile, the headquarters of the company, it was decided to place in Taiwan.  It is interesting that the company was not limited to devices from ‚Äúapples‚Äù only, although initially it was aimed, apparently, directly at them.  Who do you think came to the attention of the company?  Of course, Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and South Korean Samsung. </p><h2>  Technical indicators of bumpers </h2>

    <p>  The silicone bumper on the iPhone 6 will be cheaper than the subject of our review today, since it is made of metal.  Nevertheless, the panel from Draco is many times more practical and reliable than silicone models.  Draco 6 and Draco 6 Plus were developed by Japanese designers, their mass is approximately equal to twenty grams.  They are made of aluminum.  Since the bumper has long ceased to play the role of an exclusively protective device, the developers paid a considerable share of their attention to providing several different colors that should have pleased all users, without exception. </p><h2>  Bumper on iPhone 6 Plus </h2><p>  If we talk about this device, then for him, Draco released an accessory called Tigris 6 Plus.  Its cost is 6 thousand rubles.  Nevertheless, the bumper, which is included in the delivery, is not its only component.  In the configuration you can also find a special screwdriver, the back cover itself (which, by the way, consists of two parts), four screws (only two are used, the remaining ones are spare) and rubber keys that are inserted into the frames and are used to press the power buttons and volume.  If you look closely, then in the lower part of our device we will see special holes.  They are needed for comfortable and unhindered use of the speaker, microphone, as well as jacks for connecting a wired stereo headset.  To maximize compatibility, engineers have made the Lightning connector as wide as possible.  However, the dimensions may not converge.  Therefore, before buying, you should clarify this issue so that you do not return the goods later and do not waste your time in vain. </p>
