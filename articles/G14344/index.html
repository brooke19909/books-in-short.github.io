This is a unique creation of the world <span>famous architect</span> Antonio Gaudi, which excites the imagination of visitors and casual passers-by for more than a century. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  In this place, as early as 1877, an ordinary house was built, in which there were living rooms and office rooms.  But the new owner, Joseph Ballo y Casanovas, decided to build a grandiose building on this site, different from the others.  For the construction, he attracted the already honored architect Antonio Gaudi, who by that time was 52 years old.  The customer did not limit the wizard in either form, content, or means.  Gaudi, examining the building, came to the conclusion that there was no need to demolish it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.barcelonaconnect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Batll√≥ reviews" class="if uuid-2478962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2478962.jpg"></div><p>  The new building was built on the basis of the obsolete, surpassing it not only in decoration, but also in area and height.  Gaudi completely changed the facade, the attic, the courtyard and the interior design of the house.  Historians claim that it was in this creation that Gaudi departed from all generally accepted norms of architecture and created an incomparable structure, and began a new creative stage in his life.  Subsequent buildings created by the master were never trivial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The reconstruction of Casa Batll√≥ was carried out from 1904 to 1906.  and touched every centimeter of the building, changing its external and internal appearance beyond recognition.  There was not a single straight line in the whole building, and the outlines acquired amazing bends, which were not so characteristic of classical buildings.  At the same time, everything looks harmonious and unusual.  It is thanks to this that the creation of Gaudi gained worldwide fame. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  It is impossible to walk past Casa Batll√≥ in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãeven by chance wandering into the Eixample district.  It attracts attention at a glance.  Someone sees a fairy-tale house of elves in these lines, others resemble a coral reef, but most agree that the structure looks like a defeated dragon.  This is reminded by the smooth bends of the roof similar to the ridge of a huge monster, and shingles shimmering in the sun, imitating scales. </p><p>  This fabulous dragon is defeated by the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.  The sword symbolizes the thin spire of the tower, crowned by the cross of St. George.  The house is a symbol of the triumph of good over the forces of evil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bcncatfilmcommission.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Batll√≥" class="if uuid-2478973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2478973.jpg"></div><p>  I must say that Gaudi was a deeply religious person and drew inspiration from the creations of nature, transferring its outlines into his works, and supplementing them with religious symbols.  Every inch of his creations is filled with amazing symbolism and secret meaning.  But at the same time, each element also carries a functional load, making buildings as convenient as possible for living. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  House without right angles </h2><p>  Surprisingly, in the Batll√≥ house inside and outside there are practically no right angles and lines.  All details smoothly flow into each other.  On the facade of the window are of various sizes: from large below to small on the upper tiers of the building.  This is done so that the lighting in the house is uniform. </p><p>  A cozy patio, which also improves ventilation and indoor air exchange.  The walls of the courtyard are tiled, the color of which smoothly changes from snow-white at the bottom of the building to azure at the very top.  This design technique allowed not only to ‚Äúrevive‚Äù the space, but also to make it as functional as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.spain-holiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Batll√≥ tickets" class="if uuid-2478950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2478950.jpg"></div><p>  Also at the Casa Batllo in <span>Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe architect</span> thought over numerous escape routes in case of fire. </p><h2>  Collaboration with great masters </h2><p>  Gaudi not only developed the drawings and worked on the interior and exterior of Casa Batll√≥, but also created unique furniture for this amazing space.  Some exhibits can now be seen in their places.  But most of it is on display at the Gaudi Museum House in Park Guell. </p><p>  To create such a luxurious and amazing mansion for one person, even as brilliant as Gaudi, can‚Äôt afford it.  The decorative elements that became the decoration of the house were created by the best masters of that time.  Forged products are the work of the Badiy brothers, famous blacksmiths.  Peerless stained glass - the creation of glassblower Jusepe Pelegri.  The creation of ceramic elements was done by father and son Pujol-i-Bausis and Sebastian-i-Ribot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1962, Casa Batll√≥, whose history began at the beginning of the century, was recognized as a monument of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãafter 7 years it received the status of a monument of national importance, and since 2005 it has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifetoreset.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Batll√≥ in Barcelona" class="if uuid-2478941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2478941.jpg"></div><h2>  House of Bones </h2><p>  The main facade of Casa Batll√≥ is very unusual, as if built from the remains of the unfortunate victims of a defeated dragon.  The bones are the pillars of the building, and the skulls are the balconies.  The facade and the roof outlines resemble a giant monster.  The building seemed to be melted in the flame of a fire-breathing monster, and the windows and walls "floated" from the heat.  No wonder it is popularly called the house of bones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alternative-barcelona.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Batll√≥ story" class="if uuid-2478954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2478954.jpg"></div><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  Admiring the Batll√≥ house from the outside is like looking at a candy wrapper.  Inside is even more interesting!  Amazing sun chandelier, which seems to peek out from the waves on the ceiling.  The main staircase, as if from nowhere, amazes with its appearance.  Furniture fascinates, as if molded from soft wood, and yet it is already more than a century old. </p><p>  Here you can see with what thoroughness and attention the architect worked out the details.  Each element of decoration complements each other, creating a single image of imperishable creation. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building is 4300 square meters.  The height of the structure reaches 32 meters.  The mansion has 8 floors and a basement.  Only a part of the building is given under the museum, and in the other part there are residential premises. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thepetitewanderess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Batll√≥ how to get" class="if uuid-2478948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2478948.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Casa Batll√≥ is Gaudi‚Äôs most grandiose creation, located on 43 Passeig de Gr√†cia (Passeig de Gr√†cia).  Nearby are two more famous buildings - the house of Ll√©o Morera and Amalie.  This trio did not fit into the generally accepted standards of architecture so much that the whole quarter was called the Quarrel of Discord. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.3916384" data-lng="2.164769799999931" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/3/7/1/3371.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  <span>There</span> are several ways to <span>get</span> to Casa Batll√≥.
