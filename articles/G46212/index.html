Insurance Company Payments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Russian market, hundreds of companies carry out financial activities in the field <span>of compulsory motor liability insurance</span> .  One of them is VSK Insurance (there are reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance).  This is a Russian insurance company, which has occupied its confident niche in the domestic insurance market.  It offers services in the field of life insurance, facilities, life and health, deposits, travel, compulsory motor liability insurance, hull insurance, etc. The company consists of a parent organization, which is located territorially in Moscow, and many divisions and branches in the regions of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  This article will review <span>reviews about</span> VSK <span>insurance company</span> for compulsory motor liability insurance. </p><h2>  About company </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vsk reviews on osago" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46695/1699826.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The company uses several trade names, such as VSK Insurance House and All-Russian Insurance Company. </p><p>  The company has been operating in the insurance market of the Russian Federation for more than 15 years.  Confidently calls himself one of the leaders in this field of activity.  As numerous reviews confirm, VSK in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance takes place among the ten best companies in our country in terms of insurance fees and payments. </p><p>  VSK has a valid license to conclude insurance contracts for more than 110 types of transactions.  Services are provided to legal entities and individuals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During 2016, VSK acquired a controlling stake in small insurance companies, and a number of mergers took place. </p><p>  VSK's activity as an insurance company at the moment can be described as large-scale and successful. </p><h2>  The procedure for the provision of services by an insurance company </h2><p>  As the reviews confirm, VSK for OSAGO is one of the leading insurance companies in the country. </p><p>  When rendering services to individuals and legal entities, the company enters into bilateral civil contracts on a reimbursable basis. </p><p>  The agreement has the following contents: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Data of the parties to the contract. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Description of the service. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Conditions of conclusion and termination. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Responsibility of the parties. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Validity. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ The procedure for obtaining insurance premiums. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Amount of insurance premium. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Conditions for the occurrence of an insured event. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Responsibility of the parties. </p><h2>  Key Documents </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VSK reviews on OSAGO" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46695/1699833.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  At VSK OSAGO (customer reviews confirm this) - a key product. </p><p>  The main documents involved in the transaction are the contract for the provision of insurance services, insurance policy and payment documents. </p><p>  The current legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of insurance allows you to apply the contract and the policy or one of these contracts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  That is, the insurance contract, which has an identification number and a date of conclusion, can be applied without issuing an insurance policy, if this is stipulated by the rules of the company. </p><p>  In another case, a numbered policy is issued on the basis of an insurance contract. </p><p>  The insurance policy may be individual or collective. </p><p>  In cases with compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and hull insurance, it is mandatory to have an insurance policy in accordance with the norms of the current legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The activities of insurance companies are regulated by the rules of the Federal Law of 11/27/1992 "On insurance business in the Russian Federation". </p><h2>  Features of the occurrence of the insured event </h2><p>  As the reviews confirm, VSK for OSAGO has been working for a long time and successfully.  The company has the following rules and regulations. </p><p>  During the validity period of the insurance contract and policy, the recipient of the service after the occurrence of the insured event has the right to receive a premium.  The amount and procedure for receiving the award are stipulated by the <span>terms of the contract.</span> </p><p>  After the occurrence of the insured event, the insured must submit a package of documents in the prescribed manner, after consideration of which the issue of payment of premium or refusal is accepted. </p><p>  The insurance company has the right to refuse partially or in full in the payment, if the insured has violated the procedure for notification, collection of documents, terms or other conditions. </p><p>  The legislation provides for a time limit for appealing against such decisions and a specific legal procedure. </p><p>  They appeal against decisions to partially or completely refuse to pay the insurance premium by filing a <span>claim with the insurance company</span> or by filing a lawsuit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The court has the right to cancel the decision of the insurance company on a partial payment or a complete refusal, declaring it illegal.  If the court decides to pay in full or increase the amount, this is stipulated in a judicial act, after which the insured has the right to demand the collection of funds. </p><h2>  VSK Insurance Company Reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vsk osago customer reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46695/1699827.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  As confirmed by numerous reviews, VSK OSAGO receives a large number of claims. </p><p>  There are downsides to the activities of branches.  Due to the location of the head office in Moscow, documents are received at branches with further redirection to the central unit.  The final decision on the material takes a long time.  In addition, all claims for an insured event are accepted at the branches, but are considered at the central office.  Clients may not always be able to get an exhaustive question about the movement of the insurance business, as information is found out through a lengthy correspondence of the branch insurance agent with the administration of the head office. </p><p>  The second problem is the queues in almost every branch for acquiring an insurance policy and applying for the due payment.  In the regime of active city life, Russian citizens are accustomed to save their own time. </p><p>  All departments of the insurance company communicate with each other through online correspondence.  In this mode, the client does not have the opportunity to get comprehensive information.  There is a need to apply for each direction separately. </p><h2>  Cons of service in the central office of VSK </h2><p>  VSK company (OSAGO reviews confirm this) does not differ in special quality of service. </p><p>  Due to the reception of documents from many branches and divisions, the main office is busy.  In this regard, local service suffers. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, service workers do not provide specific information on the date the issue was resolved. </p><p>  There was a systematic violation of the terms for consideration of material on an insured event, crediting of payments, consideration of applications and petitions.  A very long time insurance is paid OSAGO VSK (reviews on this account are available). </p><p>  Appraisers need to be recorded in advance, stringent requirements for vehicle inspection. </p><p>  Many appeals of citizens to the loss settlement department end with empty and formal unsubscribes, without substantial content. </p><h2>  Positive points </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="osago insurance vsk reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46695/1699829.jpg" width="540"></div></h2><p>  There are a sufficient number of positive reviews on the work of VSK insurance company.  According to available statistics, about 70 insured events are resolved with the result of satisfaction of both parties, the insurance company and the insured. </p><p>  When calculating payments, the company practically does not underestimate the cost of repairs and parts for policies.  This is confirmed by VSK reviews.  CTP (Moscow is a big city, there are quite a few accidents) and CASCOs are paid regularly.  But this is not only in the capital, in other cities the situation is the same. </p><p>  After settling the matter in court in almost 100% of cases, the company voluntarily repays the amount due for recovery. </p><p>  The company has a fairly loyal staff of expert appraisers who perform vehicle inspection and settlement. </p><h2>  Negative points </h2><p>  OSAGO VSK policy (reviews confirm this) is one of the most popular products of the company.  Therefore, the number of negative reviews in this area is greater than under other contracts. </p><p>  But there are also many irregularities in work due to rather high amounts for payment on the basis of insurance policies. </p><p>  Initially, in many regions of Russia during 2016, the issue of selling policies was very acute.  People had to pre-register (for 2-3 weeks) or stand idle for days in lines to buy a CTP policy. </p><h2>  Payouts </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="OSAGO VSK payments reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46695/1699830.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Regular growth in the cost of the policy and the absence of an increase in the payout ratio are not always commensurate. </p><p>  The more popularity a company gains, the more often the cost of the services provided increases. </p><p>  On the Internet, there are many negative reviews on the work of the company when accepting documents for registration of an insured event.  Employees often make many mistakes and descriptions, which subsequently make payment difficult. </p><p>  Almost never payment occurs at the beginning of the period specified for the transfer of money.  Cash arrives on one of the extreme days. </p><p>  About VSK CTP reviews confirm that it is almost impossible to purchase a policy online.  They are either absent or difficulties with the operation of the system arise during design. </p><h2>  Life and health insurance </h2><p>  The minimum number of negative reviews in the field <span>of life and health insurance by</span> VSK.  This is due to comfortable insurance conditions, a high level of payments. </p><p>  Unlike other insurance companies, VSK, when making such payments, requires a minimum package of documents.  In addition, there is no need to wait for the end of the treatment period, if this does not complicate the calculation of payments.  If there are relevant medical documents confirming the existence of the insured event, the insured can file an application for receiving the money due. </p><p>  Another distinctive plus of the company's insurance activity in the settlement of losses is the ability to submit documents at any branch or division of the company. </p><p>  Despite the momentum gained, nevertheless, the quality of public services in the direction of selling CTP insurance policies and calculating insurance claims is not improving. </p><p>  VSK insurance (OSAGO reviews confirm this) is not a very popular company today. </p><h2>  What measures need to be taken to protect yourself when making an insured event? </h2><ul><li>  When concluding an agreement and purchasing an insurance policy, you must carefully read the documents. </li><li>  Keep policy and contract until expiration. </li><li>  At the conclusion of the contract, take a printout with the rules for receiving insurance payment. </li><li>  Timely notify the company representative of the occurrence of the insured event, keeping written evidence of such a notification. </li><li>  Carefully study the stipulated deadlines and the necessary package of documents for circulation. </li><li>  When submitting a package of documents for payment, get a copy of the application with a mark of admission. </li><li>  Keep all correspondence on the insured event with the agent of the company. </li><li>  In no case, until the full payment is made, do not carry out an independent car repair or its alienation in favor of third parties. </li><li>  If necessary, make an independent assessment and submit a report to the insurance company. </li><li>  If in doubt, consult a qualified lawyer in this area. </li></ul><h2>  What to do in case of violation of the payment procedure? </h2><p>  It is important to understand that Russian law stands for the protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens.  If you violate the payment procedure, you must go to court. </p><p>  As practice shows, when considering civil claims upon recovery from an insurance company in favor of legal entities and individuals, the court most often takes the side of the plaintiff if there are no significant violations on his part. </p><p>  Having appealed to the court, under the MTPL policy, the client of the insurance company collects not only the due payment, but also compensation, interest on borrowed money, penalties, legal expenses, etc. The law allows you to apply to the court not only regarding the amount of payment, but for violation of the deadlines. </p><p>  After amendments introduced in recent years, insurance legislation has been tightened, and insurance companies are subject to severe penalties for violation of its standards. </p><p>  According to statistics on the work of insurance companies in Russia for 2016, the total volume of insurance payments increased by forty percent.  This created a rather difficult situation in the insurance market.  Some companies were forced to stop their financial activities.  Others have undergone a transformation.  For example, Bean Insurance went through a merger with VSK.  After the merger procedure, registration of insured events, payment of OSAGO policies issued during 2016 at Bin-insurance offices was already carried out by VSK. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about insurance company vsc insurance" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46695/1699832.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  According to the results of the work of VSK insurance company in terms of OSAGO policies for 2014-2016, according to the reviews of the population, the organization was assigned 6th place in the top ten most popular insurers. </p><p>  However, according to the assessment made according to CTP payments by Sberbank of Russia, VSK's rating is slightly higher.  In this list, the company is in fourth place among ten popular. </p><p>  These figures, despite the feedback from the population, still speak of the reliability of VSK insurance company in terms of OSAGO payments. </p><p>  It is important to understand that after the peak of activity in the insurance market in 2010-2012, starting in 2014, it is working in crisis mode.  This cannot but affect the work of the central office in Moscow and the branches of the insurance company as a whole.  Compensation under CTP insurance of VSK (reviews are available on this account) suffer from this. </p>
