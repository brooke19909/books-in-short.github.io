A small village is located in the Novosibirsk region, on the shore of the Berdsky Gulf.  To Novosibirsk - only thirty-two kilometers. </p><p>  The history of the city begins in 1716, when a prison was built on the bay.  The village had a very favorable geographical location, so it quickly became a center of trade in the region.  A few decades later, deposits of gold were found on the Berd land.  Thanks to this, the settlement began to develop and in February 1944 received the status of a city. </p><p>  Berdsk is an industrial city.  There is an electromechanical plant, a bakery, a printing house, as well as several factories for the production of medicines. </p><p>  Berdsk's climate is temperate continental.  The average January temperature is -19 ¬∞ C, July + 18-19 ¬∞ C.

An amazing pine forest grows along the shores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sheverduk.livejournal.com" data-author=": Sheverduk, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird bay" class="if uuid-3056455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3056455.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Royal Marine </h2><p>  If you decide to go out of town in your own car, then modern gadgets will show you the shortest path to your destination, just enter the correct name for the final route. </p><p>  If you decide to get on your own, by route transport, you need to remember, or rather write down, the following address: Berdsk, Severny-1 microdistrict, building 1.

Guests note the well-groomed adjacent territory of the complex: everywhere is clean, there are bins.  Designated smoking areas.  The rooms are also equipped with modern technology. </p><p>  There are also disadvantages.  Many guests claim that sometimes it is very noisy.  However, the staff claims that all the noisy events end as expected, at 23.00, and give their own recommendation.  If you are going to a country club for a weekend to spend time quietly with your family, keep in mind that noisy events such as a wedding or a birthday banquet can be held in the complex during the same period.  Guests also note very high prices for renting swimming equipment, the inconvenience of the adjacent road, which is not at all equipped for arriving in a personal car, as well as the lack of a microwave oven, which would be useful to many guests for warming up food. </p>
