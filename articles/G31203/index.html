  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which blender is better: choose and compare.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><strong></strong>  Any housewife sooner or later faces the need to choose a convenient, compact, powerful and efficient apparatus for grinding and whipping products.  An ideal solution to this problem is a blender - a miniature analogue of a food processor.  The blender is especially useful in a family where there are children or pregnant women, as well as if you often prepare smoothies, fruit purees, diet food or other dishes that involve thoroughly grinding the ingredients.  Blender not only saves time, but also reduces labor costs for washing knives, <span>chopping boards,</span> bowls and so on.  Now on the home appliance market there are a huge number of modifications of such devices with a variety of functions.  The most important thing is to determine which blender is best for you. </p><p>  <strong>What are the types of blenders</strong> </p><p>  All high-quality factory models are manufactured in compliance with all standards, and therefore, when choosing the right device, you should pay attention only to the presence of those functions that you need.  But to <span>choose which blender is</span> better, you need to look at its technological features </p><p>  <em><span>Stationary blender.</span></em>  This is a great option for those who often need to prepare sauces, cocktails, mashed potatoes and smoothies.  In essence, it represents a large bowl on delivery with knives that are in its bottom.  Such a blender works independently, it can also be used for kneading dough, chopping ice (for cocktails or desserts) or grinding some foods.  In the lower bowl there is a very convenient nose with which you can easily pour its contents into glasses.  True, this type of blender has its drawbacks - it takes up a lot of space and is not too good for chopping and slicing vegetables. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em><span>Hand blender.</span></em>  It is suitable for shredding and <span>chopping vegetables,</span> great for those who like sauces and mashed potatoes.  Universal and very convenient model for preparing baby food.  It is quite compact and with its help it is possible to process even very small portions.  True, such a blender is not at all suitable for cocktails and it cannot be put to work on the table - you have to keep it in your hands all the time. </p><p>  <em>Combined blender.</em>  This is a hybrid of the two previous models, it includes additional nozzles, such as a whisk, a knife for chopping ice, a chopper and a vacuum pump.  Such a model is more expensive, but you will not have problems with performing any additional operations.  In general, if your financial situation allows and you are used to investing your money in good and high-quality equipment, then the best blender for you is just that. </p><p>  When <span>choosing a blender, it is</span> also very important to pay attention to the following details: </p><p>  <em>Bowl for cooking.</em>  There are plastic (do not get dirty so quickly, do not break and do not absorb smells), glass (easy to break, but difficult to scratch) and plastic (quickly become cloudy, but more durable).  Which <span>blender is better?</span>  Of course, the one with the thicket of plastic. </p><p>  <em>The power of the blender</em> can be from 200 to 700 watts.  The higher the power, the greater the ability of your device - with a low-power device you can whisk a cocktail at a maximum, and a more powerful one can shred and do many other operations. </p><p>  <em>Number of speeds</em> .  The simplest blender has only 2 speeds, while the more powerful one can have up to 5 (sometimes higher).  It is very good if the blender has all kinds of additional modes such as turbo, pulse mode.  The greater the number of speeds in the blender, the more varied and interesting dishes you can cook.  So the question ‚Äúwhich blender is better to buy‚Äù can be safely answered - the one that has more speeds and modes. </p><p>  Whatever blender you choose, we wish you a successful purchase. </p>
