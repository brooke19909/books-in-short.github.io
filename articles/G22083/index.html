And because developers are actively exploring the provinces, erecting multi-storey <span>residential complexes.</span>  One of them - LCD "Mosaic".  Vsevolozhsk, on the territory of which it is located, separates only 25 kilometers from the Northern capital, which by today's standards is not at all a distance.  Therefore, many residents of St. Petersburg are happy to purchase apartments here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mosaic" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1307022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Mosaic", whose address: G. Vsevolozhsk, st.  Shishkan, 14, is not a multi-scale project.  This is a seven-story building with 191 apartments for sale.  The construction of the complex began in 2014, at this stage almost all work has been completed, the deadline for completion is the second half of 2016.  Residential premises in it belong to the economy class, which, combined with the "provincial" prices in force in the region, allows you to purchase an apartment here at a fairly affordable price.  Construction is carried out using brick-monolithic technology.  As for apartments, then in ‚ÄúMosaic‚Äù all the most popular formats are presented - from studios to three rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD mosaic Vsevolozhsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1307023.jpg" width="600"></div>

SK has in its assets more than one successfully completed project in the field of housing construction, has a completely transparent reputation and enjoys well-deserved respect from both colleagues and clients.  A distinctive feature of SK is that it invests its projects on its own, as well as carries out all construction work on its own, without involving intermediaries.  In this connection, all objects are rented out in strict accordance with the established deadlines. </p><h2>  Ecology of the region </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district is generally considered one of the most prosperous in terms of environmental conditions.  There are no industrial enterprises, there are many forests and large reservoirs in the region.  Of course, the situation in the city itself is somewhat worse, nevertheless, the pipes under the windows do not fade, but in front of the house there is a large landscaped park, and immediately outside the city, a forest begins and there is a large lake.  The only thing that somewhat overshadows the situation is the Road of Life, which is passing near the LCD track. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mosaic reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1307026.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <h2>  Transport and trade infrastructure </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk is a rather large city, there is not only a mass of various restaurants, cafes and shops, but also shopping and entertainment complexes and hypermarkets (Magnit, Narodnaya Family, K-Ruoka, etc.).  Near the LCD there are two lyceums and a school, a kindergarten, a development center for kids.  As for medical institutions, everything is in order with them too - a large clinic of regional significance is located at a distance of several kilometers from the Mosaic residential complex.  In addition, all the first floors in the complex will also be given for commercial infrastructure.  In one of the premises it is planned to open its own d / s. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the house there is a stop from which minibuses and buses depart to the Ladozhskaya and Ploshchad Lenina metro stations.  Travel time takes no more than 25 minutes.  The city also has a railway station, from the platforms of which electric trains depart, following to <span>Finland Station.</span>  To help motorists - the already mentioned Road of Life. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  As already mentioned, LCD "Mosaic" refers to the economy segment.  The apartments in the complex are offered, of course, in accordance with the class, not very luxurious, nevertheless, all living spaces are distinguished by the functionality and ergonomics of the layouts.  Mostly studio apartments prevail.  The developer in the design process did everything possible to make it easier for people to choose, so there are a lot of planning solutions for residential premises of this format.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe studios is from 22 to 29 squares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mosaic builder" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1307028.jpg" width="566"></div>

    <p>  There are several large studio apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 65 square meters.  m, with separate bathrooms.  Two-room apartments do not differ in a particular variety of layouts, but in all apartments of this format there are very spacious rooms and separate bathrooms.  As for the three rubles, these living quarters can also claim the comfort class.  Kitchens in them are at least 15 square meters.  m, there are large hallways with dressing room, insulated loggia. </p><p>  All apartments are sold with a fine finish. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The studio will cost the buyer 1 400 000-1 890 000 rubles.  For a one-room one you will have to pay from two to four million, for a kopeck piece - from 2,800,000 to 4,300,000 rubles, treshki cost about five million. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mosaic address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1307024.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the moment, prices from the builder are in force, which is extremely beneficial and therefore many apartments have already been bought. </p><h2>  LCD "Mosaic": reviews </h2><p>  What do potential buyers say about the complex under construction?  Since the house has not yet been commissioned, it is too early to talk about the quality of housing, however, many people like the fact that all apartments will already be completely renovated - you can move in and celebrate a housewarming.  Some do not like the fact that not far from the complex there is a large highway - the Road of Life.  However, dissatisfaction is expressed only by those who are not going to travel outside Vsevolozhsk often, while people working in St. Petersburg see this as only a plus.  Without exception, everyone likes the fact that there is a park nearby, no one has expressed any negative about the lack of outlets.  In principle, by and large, so far there is nothing to complain about.  Construction is on schedule, the developer is reliable. </p><p>  As for prices, people find them quite acceptable.  This is also proved by the fact that at this stage in the Mosaic residential complex there are not so many free apartments left. </p>
