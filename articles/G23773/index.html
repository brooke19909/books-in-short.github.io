This article will discuss the beautiful women of Greek mythology, since the daughters of Zeus made no less contribution to the history of ancient man and Olympus.  It's no secret that the main god had many children, and some of them even differed in a somewhat non-standard way of being born. </p>

In general, in mythology, virtually all the daughters of Zeus are quite vengeful, but Adrastea, among others, also adhered to justice.

    <p>  Heba was born from the first wife of the supreme <span>god Olympus</span> - this daughter of Zeus had the gift of patronage over youth.  The eternally young goddess served the other gods, constantly adding nectar to them.  Later, she became the wife of Hercules, who was deified after the exploits. </p><p>  The other daughter of Zeus had the name Ilithia, and she was also born from the first wife of Hera.  She was the patroness of childbirth, often was a parturient woman for help, but sometimes she was also a hostile force.  For a long time, her assistance to humanity was not independent, since Ilithia was an assistant to Artemis or Hera, but after a while everything changed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

She was born from Demeter, but in her youth Zeus' brother, Hades, stole her.  He gave Persephone the opportunity to rule the kingdom of the dead, although initially she was only the <span>goddess of fertility.</span>  There is a belief that the daughter of Demeter was stolen in the winter, which is why in winter there is no fertile land, because the young girl could not do her direct duties while she was experiencing separation from her mother.  Then Hades took pity and allowed his lover to return to Demeter once a year for a while.

    <p>  The famous daughter of Zeus is the goddess of hunting Artemis.  She has a twin brother, which is why she also patronized all the sisters among the people.  When she was born, most of the gods began to fear the wrath of the legitimate wife of Zeus - Hera, because Artemis was born from the titanide Summer.  However, the father reassured his daughter, telling her that you should not be afraid of his wife's revenge.  Soon he gives his daughter all the gifts that she wished, and gives her the right to choose his patronage. </p>

    <p>  The most amazing birth story is the myth of the birth of Athens.  The fact is that she does not have a mother - she was born from the head of Zeus, which Hephaestus chopped with a powerful ax.  Moreover, this goddess of war, victory and wisdom did not have a childhood, she immediately came into the world fully equipped and with military weapons.  A distinctive feature of Athena‚Äôs character is that she helps not only mortals, but also the gods, who often come to her for advice. </p><p>  And finally, the most attractive daughter of Zeus is the <span>goddess of beauty</span> Aphrodite.  Her mother was Dion, born of sea foam, as a result of which she received her name.  Despite her marriage (Hephaestus was her husband), Aphrodite led a rather wild life, probably, the genes of her father ‚Äúaffected‚Äù her.  It should be noted that the image of this goddess is often used in various literary works, but in them it is more often called Venus (the goddess of beauty used the name from the Romans, who, in fact, borrowed the entire pantheon of gods from the Greeks). </p>
