This highway was designed "in a straight line" - without taking into account the features of the landscape.  The total length of the road at the time of its opening is 604 versts, while the shortest distance between cities is 598 versts.  For this reason, many bridges are included in the highway.

    <p>  Some of them were a real miracle of engineering for their time.  For example, the Mstinsky bridge was the first in our country built with a caisson method.  Its length is about 380 meters, and its height above water level is about 40 meters.  The bridge was built in the upper part of the bend of the deep-sea river Msta and due to this arrangement it looks even more impressive. </p><p>  At the end of the XIX century, the building was rebuilt.  The existing wooden bridge was replaced with an iron one, which we can observe today.  Today, this facility is operational and is included in the high-speed railway.  The bridge is guarded and tourists are not allowed to climb it.  But anyone can take pictures of an interesting building from a short distance or go down near it to the river. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Village near Mstinsky bridge </h2>

In the warmer months, locals bathe and swim here.  Not far from the bridge there are rapids that lovers of extreme relaxation are happy to overcome by kayaking.  Local residents and tourists fish on the river year-round.  In summer and autumn, in the vicinity of the village you can pick mushrooms, berries and herbs. </p><p>  As for the accommodation of vacationers, local residents willingly rent rooms and summer houses.  Also in the vicinity of the village there are several tourist recreation centers.  Many tourists prefer to stop by the Msta River with tents.  In the winter season, a ski resort operates on the left bank. </p><h2>  Sights and interesting objects </h2><p>  Mstinsky Bridge and the railway station of the same name, located on the side of St. Petersburg, are very popular among tourists.  Here the river makes a spectacular turn, and on both sides of its channel endless green meadows are spread.  The bridge itself looks unusual and majestic.  Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt go through this impressive building.  But no less spectacular photographs can be taken by going down to a ravine near the bridge. </p><p>  If you are relaxing on the banks of the Msta River, be sure to visit the church in the village of Bor.  This is a historic landmark of the XIX century, located near the Mstinsky Bridge.  Today the church is operational, an old cemetery has been preserved near it.  On weekends and church holidays, services are held here. </p><h2>  How to get to the Mstinsky Bridge? </h2>

There are no five-star hotels, and even local recreation centers offer fairly modest living conditions.  If you are used to maximum comfort, look for another option.  The Novgorod region is quite large, and it has modern hotel complexes and resorts.

    <p>  Malovishersky district is a place for a quiet contemplative relaxation and ecotourism.  Here you can enjoy the peace and fresh air.  Locals live here almost the same way as a hundred years ago.  There is no central water supply and gas supply in the village, instead of them there are wells and gas in bottles.  But during the rest you can try real milk, eggs, fresh vegetables and fruits.  The villagers gladly sell their own products for a nominal fee, and sometimes treat tourists for free. </p><p>  If you like this kind of rest, be sure to remember how to get to the station.  Mstinsky Bridge (Novgorod region). </p>
