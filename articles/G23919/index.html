Are you planning to stay in this sparkling fairytale world for a long time?  Welcome to the <span>best hotels in Pattaya!</span>  There is everything for an unforgettable vacation and the best experience - everything that a sophisticated tourist can wish for. </p><p>  The wondrous kingdom of Thailand </p><p>  This country of Southeast Asia is rightfully considered one of the most unpredictable, colorful and exotic.  Thanks to the developed tourism infrastructure, Thailand has the opportunity to diversify the vacation of visiting tourists so much that it is even hard to imagine.  Perhaps in this kingdom (and its main tourist city - Pattaya) there is no such tourist who would not get what he wanted. </p><p>  It is best to come to Thailand for a few weeks - numerous Pattaya hotels at any time of the year are ready to offer tourists from all over the world their hospitality, high and quality level of service and reasonably affordable prices.  The time spent in this city will not be wasted, because it is an amazing fusion of modern trends and traditional Buddhist culture, the latest inventions of tourist science and the pristine nature of wildlife, ultramodern nightlife and the purity of golden beaches. </p><p>  What is a vacation in Thailand </p><p>  Holidays in Thailand include living in the most beautiful picturesque corners of the country (Pattaya hotels take care of this), walking along the magnificent hot beaches and swimming in the transparent <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves,</span> as well as immersing yourself in all kinds of amusements and entertainments that give the city an enduring atmosphere of celebration and unbridled fun.  Living in this world is always bright and fun - why not stay longer in Thailand longer? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can choose Pattaya hotels both for convenience and taking care of your budget.  There are luxury five-star hotels, and there are small family pensions or hotels.  The most popular hotels are the Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort 5 *, located in the northern part of the city, an hour's drive from Bangkok International Airport.  The hotel on one of the best Thai beaches opened its doors to guests from all over the world for the first time in August 2009, and immediately struck everyone with its original design in the style of ‚ÄúThe Lost World‚Äù by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Even the most capricious and demanding tourists will surely find here something useful and interesting.  The hotel provides everything for a quality stay - swimming pools, saunas, playrooms for children, billiards, tennis court and SPA center. </p><p>  Many tourists visiting various hotels in Pattaya constantly return to the place called ‚ÄúDusit Thani Pattaya 5 *‚Äù, which is located in a cozy bay, which creates excellent conditions for leisurely swimming and diving.  From this hotel you can quickly get to the city center, or you can go to an amazing beach, rich in beautiful green vegetation and extraordinary clean white sand.  On the territory of the hotel itself there is the opportunity to live in one of the spacious comfortable rooms, visit local restaurants with marvelous traditional <span>Thai cuisine,</span> and also go in for sports in swimming pools, sports and gymnasiums, on tennis courts, basketball and aerobics classes.  Residents of the hotel can enjoy the visit of beauty salons, beauty parlors and SPA salons. </p><p>  Many of those who visited Pattaya hotels leave the most positive reviews.  But if you don‚Äôt want to follow the beaten track, you should consider visiting some places and form your own opinion about them. </p>
