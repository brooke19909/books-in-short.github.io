Megafon: disabling paid services</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It seems that the calls were made no more than usual, the account was replenished recently, but the money on the phone is running out quickly.  Common situation?  This can only mean one thing: the mobile operator, without the knowledge of the subscriber, connected to it some paid services that it does not need.  Often this happens during the activation phase of the just purchased SIM card.  It‚Äôs time to go to a showroom or try to solve the problem yourself.  How to find out connected services at Megafon?  There are several ways. </p><h2>  Paid and free services </h2>

    <p>  The company provides a large number of services, among which there are paid and free.  The latter include, for example, melodic dialing tones, checking the balance of the phone, receiving incoming calls, etc. But another thing is obvious: there are much more paid services, including those not authorized by the subscriber.  Of the standard paid services - calls from a mobile phone, roaming, sending SMS.  There are a number of other services that the subscriber subscribes to, for example, weather reports. </p><p>  Spam is another issue for the subscriber.  It is worth making some purchase on the Internet or registering on the forum - the phone number is at the disposal of third parties.  And nothing can be done about it.  The only consolation is that newsletters from chain stores are most often free.  Further - in detail about how to find out connected services at Megafon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Service guide" to help the subscriber </h2>

    <p>  The useful function ‚ÄúService Guide‚Äù can be downloaded on the operator‚Äôs website and downloaded the application on a mobile phone.  To use the service, you need to register in it, then activate the request by pressing the key combination: * 105 # and ‚ÄúCall‚Äù.  Thus, you can access the Unified Information Center of the system.  Here you can find all the information about connected paid services.  Megafon on its website posts a list of services, operator numbers and short numbers by which you can disable unnecessary services - by calling the operator or sending SMS.  In the same service, you can not only check and disconnect services, but also connect the necessary ones and change the tariff plan.  USDD requests for * 105 # are free. </p><h2>  Another service is Kaleidoscope </h2><p>  This is another application that can be downloaded from the resource of the Megafon company.  Disabling paid services here can also be done only after registration.  You need to open the MegaFonPro page and go to the "Settings" tab.  Open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù option, with which you can easily disable or activate any service from the proposed list. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Visit to the communication salon "Megaphone" </h2><p>  You can find out which paid services are connected on the phone in any salon of a mobile operator.  Those who at least once turned to managers with a similar problem can confirm that such a request does not cause any surprise, although it is also a special joy.  After all, they will have to help the client disable a number of paid services, and this is not in the interests of the company.  Nevertheless, he who asked the question how to find out the connected services on Megafon will give out all the information without words, and then immediately remove everything unnecessary from the phone.  You can find a short number from the same office staff, from which you can occasionally check your phone for new connections.  When contacting the salon, the operator may be asked to present a passport. </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  This is another opportunity to find out what services are connected on Megafon and turn off unwanted ones.  There is a single number 0505, by which you can directly contact the network operator.  After dialing, press the 0 key and wait for an answer.  The operator will answer all questions and advise on how to disable a particular service.  It is useful in this case to prepare paper and pencil in advance for recording numbers: as a rule, each service has its own number in the Megafon system. </p><h2>  Disabling Paid Services: Some Tips </h2>

    <p>  The managers of mobile communication offices are trying to convince dissatisfied visitors that the connection of ‚Äúleft‚Äù services occurs without the knowledge of the company.  But there are a number of services, the belonging of which to this mobile operator is beyond doubt, moreover, most often it is advisable to disconnect them forever.  So, on each phone there is a function "Voice Mail".  It turns on automatically if the called party does not answer.  Few people use this service, but money for it is withdrawn from the account regularly - the monthly fee is 51 rubles per month. </p><p>  Another ‚Äúamateur‚Äù service - ‚ÄúChange the beep‚Äù - costs 60 rubles a month.  At the same time, the operator, at his discretion, changes the beeps.  For most subscribers, this service does not give anything but an extra cost.  Even more expensive - at 150 rubles a month - evaluates the service for lovers of anonymous calls - ‚ÄúCaller ID‚Äù - Megafon.  Disabling paid services of this kind really saves the subscriber‚Äôs money, so from time to time it makes sense to check your phone and ‚Äúclean‚Äù it from unused, but not at all free features. </p>

    <h2>  Once and for all will fail </h2><p>  It seems that all problems have been resolved, they have unsubscribed from unnecessary services.  But it only seems.  After some time, the same services can be activated again on the phone, and again without the knowledge of the subscriber.  And again you have to go in the same circle.  It‚Äôs not easy to get rid of mailings from stores, even putting them on the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù.  Unfortunately, today mobile operators impose (or even secretly) impose their paid services with impunity.  In addition, there is a practice of selling short numbers, which allows random owners to establish a whole industry of paid spam in the form of games, quizzes, or other incorrect and even fraudulent mailings.  To numerous complaints of subscribers and attempts to once again see what services are connected, Megafon replies something like this: these short numbers belong to private individuals or companies, and the telecom operator is not responsible for them. </p><p>  And what to do?  Refuse the services of a mobile operator?  Of course no.  You just need to carefully monitor your balance and, at the first suspicion, turn off unnecessary services.  As for spam, you will have to fight by yourself: add numbers to the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù, never respond to requests from unfamiliar short numbers inviting you to win large sums or cars in quizzes or lotteries.  As rarely as possible leave a phone number on different resources on the Internet.  This is the only way to minimize <span>unforeseen expenses</span> on mobile communications. </p>
