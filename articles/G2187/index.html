The article will discuss what a hostel is and how to book places to stay in the cheapest hostels in Moscow. </p><h2>  What is a hostel? </h2><p>  The name Hostel is of English origin, and translates as a <span>hostel.</span>  <span>These</span> were once, in fact, dormitories with cheap rooms in which students lived.  Currently, the hostel is considered a comfortable, with a good reputation economy class hotel.  The hostel has all the basic services.  The main difference from rooms in ordinary hotels is the lack of a shower and toilet in the rooms for living.  These amenities are located on the floor, as, in principle, this was in student dormitories. </p><p>  The hostels have the opportunity to rent a room for one and two guests.  To significantly save on accommodation, it is possible to rent a bed in a dormitory room designed for people of the same sex.  Many travelers, sometimes, are looking for a room in the cheapest hostel in Moscow, not only for living, but also for the sake of an atmosphere of communication and new acquaintances with the same travelers as themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.zagranitsa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow hostels" class="if uuid-2634112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2634112.jpg"></div><h2>  Hostel Standards </h2><p>  In world practice, there are hostels of various standards, ranging from rooms without special amenities, where there are only beds, to boutique hostels where there are not so Spartan conditions.  Services that are considered mandatory include a hot shower, clean bed and breakfast (not always, sometimes by appointment).  Breakfast is included in the price.  There is a laundry room, which, in addition to washing linens, serves, if necessary, customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a new type of housing - capsule hostel on the Arbat.  Such a convenience has already been appreciated by many travelers in their reviews.  What it is?  These are designed sleeping places in dormitory rooms.  They are somewhat similar to mini cabins in which neighboring snoring is not heard.  Comfort is created through the organization of personal space.  The capsule is convenient for rest, sleep, exercise and work.  It has individual lighting, sockets and Wi-FI.  And all this is blocked off by a dense curtain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capsule Hostel in Moscow" class="if uuid-2634070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2634070.jpg"></div><p>  When looking for the cheapest hostel in Moscow for the long term, you should take into account the strict rules of accommodation that apply in it and the services that are provided in it: </p><ul><li>  regulation of check-in registration time and check-out time - estimated hour; </li><li>  closing at night at a specific time (does not apply everywhere and not for everyone); </li><li>  daily cleaning of all rooms; </li><li>  Internet access and Wi-Fi; </li><li>  DVD collection </li></ul><p>  Some hostels have lockers for storing things, lockers and <span>safe boxes.</span>  More and more hostels organize co- <em>working</em> zones <em>(Eng. Co-working</em> - <em>collaboration, work on the Internet),</em> equipped with computers.  Time requires having it in the arsenal of services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>In Moscow hostels, in</span> contrast to European <span>hostels,</span> customers are given linen for a bed and towels.  This is noted in their reviews by tourists.  There is no additional charge, this is included in the price.  The availability of breakfast in each hostel is negotiated.  Either it is included in the payment for accommodation, and this is a cup of coffee with a sandwich, or not included, and for an additional fee, it can be prepared. </p><h2>  Rent hostel for family </h2><p>  Quite often, a search is made for the cheapest hostel in Moscow for a long period for a family.  Typically, this option is looking for young people who come to Moscow for preparatory classes for admission to the university and for exams.  It can be a tourist family who wants to go to historical places and visit the sights of the capital on their own.  A hostel is the best option for this.  All day goes on excursions, and the night - to relax.  An option that involves renting a room for a predetermined period is the best suited for a family vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sutochno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel reception at st. metro Skhodnenskaya" class="if uuid-2633772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2633772.jpg"></div><h2>  How to book a room? </h2><p>  You can book a room in the hostel without leaving your home, or even while on the go, with a smartphone with the Internet.  Now there is no such hostel and hotel that would not have its own website or email.  That is, you can order a room through the search and booking form on the website indicating the date of arrival and the number of days of stay.  You can make an order by e-mail, or by phone, if known. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The best option, of course, is the search for suitable housing on the sites of Moscow hostels.  You have the opportunity to independently find a hostel in Moscow that is convenient for you, for example, inexpensively near the metro and rent it if your stay in the capital will be connected with travel by this type of transport. </p><h2>  Hostel at the Pervomaiskaya metro station </h2><p>  Consider the option of living in a hostel located at: Moscow, st.  Verkhnyaya Pervomayskaya, d. 36, p. 1. It is located next to the subway of the same name.  There are rooms for two, four, six and eight beds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--1--7kcv4acqyj1a2i.xn--80adxhks" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel at the metro station Pervomayskaya" class="if uuid-2633480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2633480.jpg"></div><p>  The quadruple room (pictured left) has a TV, Wi-Fi, lockers with a lock, electronic room keys.  In a double room everything is the same as in a quadruple room, only there is a double bed and a separate bathroom with a shower.  Real hotel room.  The cost of living for two per day is 2000 rubles.  In a quadruple room per person per day 600 rubles.  And this is a good cost option - inexpensive and close to the metro.  You can rent a hostel in Moscow near many metro stations.  According to tourists, it is very convenient for travel. </p><h2>  Hostel options near the metro </h2><p>  For example, the map shown in the photo below shows the best hostels located in close proximity to the metro and the historical center of the capital.  From the hostel you can walk to the Arbat, the Tretyakov Gallery, Red Square, and relax at the Patriarchal and Chistye Prudy. </p><p>  Next to Chistye Prudy metro station is 7 Sky Hostel.  This is a small, cozy hostel with an equipped kitchen, which can accommodate up to 30 people.  There are rooms for two, four, six and eight people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gdehostel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostels near the metro in Moscow" class="if uuid-2633587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2633587.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from Red Square is a small hostel "Polyanka - Chistye Prudy".  It is designed for a maximum of 26 people, has rooms for 1, 2, 3 and 6 people.  The rooms have air conditioning.  On the common corridor are a common shower and toilet rooms.  There is a parking place.  In their reviews, visitors note the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. </p><p>  Near Pushkin Square, in Degtyarny Lane, building 15, there is a small hostel "Chocolate".  It has only 4 rooms for 2, 3, 6 and 10 people.  Facilities are located on the floor, equipped kitchen. </p><h2>  Hostel - an economical option in every way </h2><p>  In all hostels located in Moscow near the metro, renting cheap for a long term accommodation is not a problem.  The main thing is to book places in advance, and the problem of accommodation will be solved for the entire stay in Moscow.  Lean tourists save not only on accommodation, but also on transport and food.  You can choose a hostel from which you can walk to all interesting historical places.  Meals can also be prepared in the hostel's kitchen.  Usually there is always a microwave, where you can not only warm dishes, but also cook. </p><p>  The reviews say that for family travelers and a group of friends it is more profitable to rent a large room in a hostel than to pay for a hotel room, which is two, or maybe three times more expensive. </p><h2>  The cheapest hostel in Moscow </h2><p>  For a day you can cheaply rent a bed in almost every hostel in the capital.  We are talking about spending the night in cultural conditions (sleeping place), and, waking up, take a shower, etc. If you only need to spend the night, then checking in after 22:00, the client receives a discount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Double Room" class="if uuid-2634022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2634022.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, a night stay will cost 200 rubles.  The cheapest room for one person in a double room will cost 400 rubles, and the most expensive room for one person in a hostel will cost 4800 rubles.  And it‚Äôs cheaper than in any hotel in Moscow. </p><h2>  Discounts and promotions for accommodation in hostels of the capital </h2><p>  In some hostels of the capital, promotions or discounts on payment for accommodation are carried out.  In this case, the cheapest hostel in Moscow will be the one with promotions and discounts.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, it is very profitable. </p><p>  For example, several times when staying in rooms at YumYumHostel hostel on Baumanskaya the following campaign was held: coupons are sold in unlimited quantities, which entitle you to stay in a hostel with a discount included in the coupon.  The coupon is limited to the time of the promotion, and is valid on any day, subject to availability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lhotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel &quot;ARMEN FURMAN&quot; Moscow" class="if uuid-2634157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2634157.jpg"></div><p>  What is the action?  For a stay at the hostel for 2 days and one night in a room with a double bed, the discount on the offer is 40%, in a single room the cost of living will be reduced by 41%.  Accommodation in multi-bed rooms, regardless of their occupancy, during the campaign, the discount reaches 45%.  Promotions are held for certain events.  For example, when conducting workshops on culinary skills. </p><p>  In addition to promotions, hostels are given discounts if they are corporate clients.  If a tourist group arrives or settles for a long stay at the hostel, the calculation is at a special rate. </p><p>  Moscow hostels for tourists, travelers and youth are a good alternative to expensive apartments in the capital's hotels. </p>
