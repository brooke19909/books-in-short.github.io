Its location allows you to relax there all year round.  A lot of historical, natural and cultural attractions around diversify pastime on the beach.  In addition, in Nha Trang there is Vinpearl - the "island of pleasures", known throughout Vietnam.  So this resort attracts both lovers of a relaxing beach holiday, and connoisseurs of excursions.  Here families with small children, romance and youth who are hungry for entertainment will feel equally good. </p><p>  And where better to stay in Nha Trang?  Finding accommodation in this booming resort is easy.  It is much more difficult to find a decent hotel with the perfect balance of price and quality.  And that's why in this article we present to your attention the hotel Majestic Nha Trang 3 *.  We built the description of the hotel not on brochures.  The information base for us was exclusively the reviews of those tourists who have already managed to visit there.  Summarizing them, we can briefly note the following.  This hotel is very well located relative to the city infrastructure of Nha Trang.  It is close to the sea, literally across the road.  This hotel is brand new and provides modern comfort options.  The hotel includes breakfast in the price, which, according to Slavic standards, is more like hearty dinners.  Reviews have repeatedly mentioned the perfect balance of price and quality of service.  And the most common point: a gorgeous view of the bay, opening from the relaxation area on the roof of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic nha trang 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1436704.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is Majestic Nha Trang 3 * located (Vietnam) </h2><p>  Nha Trang is pronounced in Russian as Nha Trang.  ‚ÄúMajestic‚Äù is translated from English as ‚Äúmajestic‚Äù, ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù.  The name justifies itself.  The hotel rises on the most beautiful street of the resort.  All infrastructure of the city of Nha Trang is within walking distance.  Shops, bazaars, souvenir stalls, restaurants and cafes of various price segments surround the hotel on three sides.  On the fourth is the road.  But not the autobahn!  Going through it is not difficult and will not cause shock due to the driving style of Vietnamese drivers.  Behind the road is a sandy beach.  And beyond the strip of water, you can see the island of Vinpearl.  Hotel Majestic Nha Trang Hotel 3 * is located two kilometers from the train station Strain.  Of course, most of the guests arrive by plane.  Kam Ran International Airport is thirty-two kilometers from the hotel.  Those tourists who arrived in Vietnam not on a package tour, but on their own, can, upon booking, arrange with the administration to meet at the Nha Trang air harbor and transfer.  But this service is paid.  Only ten minutes drive from the hotel - and you are in the port of Nha Trang.  This place, according to reviews, is key on the city map.  After all, boats and boats depart from here to the islands and to the famous Jinguen Aquarium.  There are two ways to get to Wingerle Island: by ferry and by cable car.  The last station is a fifteen minute drive from the hotel.  Reviews warn: not far from the hotel we are describing is another, with a similar name - Majestic Star Hotel 3 * Nha Trang. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic Nha Trang Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1436707.jpg" width="600"></div>

You are clearly not here.  Majestic Nha Trang is a typical Vietnamese city hotel.  He does not have territory as such, except for a small parking lot.  The hotel is a single building without balconies.  But it is high-rise, and tourists see a big plus in this.  Fifteen floors elevate the relaxation zone with a small pool above the bustle of this world.  Despite the location in the city center, the air at this altitude is fresh, the sounds from below do not interfere with complete relaxation.  And what kinds of views from the upper floors of the building!  Just awesome.  True, the upper floors are occupied by rooms of a higher price category.  You will also have to pay extra for a sea view.  But, as reviews say, it's worth it.  By the way, the restaurant of the Majestic Nha Trang 3 * hotel, where buffet breakfast is served every morning, is also located on the fourteenth floor.  Therefore, even if you happen to live in the cheapest room with a window facing the ventilation shaft, you will eat while admiring the panorama of Nha Trang Bay.  Across the road is the so-called Gorky Park with swimming pools and entertainment, and the beach.  Despite the fact that Nha Trang is a developing resort, there is no construction around the hotel.  It is surrounded by already functioning hotels (Dendro Gold 4 and Ruby 3).  The bus stop, from where you can quickly get to the key places of the resort, is located a little to the right of the entrance to Majestic Nha Trang.  And if you turn left, you can quickly walk to the city center on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic Nha Trang 3 (Vietnam) Nha Trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1436705.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Categories of rooms and rooms for guests </h2><p>  As in all hotels, the Majestic <span>Nha Trang Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang)</span> has different facilities for the price and, accordingly, the facilities for guests.  There are a hundred rooms in total.  Thirty-seven of them belong to the lowest price category, which is called "superior".  These rooms have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty-four square meters and are designed for two people.  Some of them have windows to the ventilation shaft, others to the city.  Reviews say that even if you booked a superior, you can pay a hundred thousand dong per day for a deluxe room.  This category of rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty eight square meters has windows overlooking the city.  The rooms are elegantly decorated and have either one king bed or two single beds.  A higher category is "executive si."  As the name implies, the windows of these rooms face the sea.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch rooms is thirty-two square meters.  There are two more "suites" (58 sq.m.).  The most popular category of tourists are family rooms, equipped with a wide matrimonial bed and two separate beds in one bedroom.  These rooms are located on the upper floors and also have sea views.  There are also so-called executive rooms.  They impress with their vast area and luxurious amenities.  The whole family can relax and regally.  For this, in the Majestic Nha Trang 3 * hotel there are improved "family rooms".  They are located on the highest of the residential floors of the building and consist of two bedrooms and a spacious bathroom. </p><h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Majestic <span>Nha Trang 3 * (Nha Trang,</span> Vietnam) was built in two thousand and twelve.  The young age of the building determines that the interiors of guest rooms shine with novelty.  And the equipment there, as the reviews notice, is ultramodern.  If the TV, then with a thirty-four inch LCD screen.  If the air conditioner is sure to have a split climate control system.  Each room, even the cheapest, has an electronic safe where you can put a netbook.  Satellite television with a hundred channels allows you to find Russian speakers.  There is also an IDD phone in the room.  The contents of the minibar are paid, but daily a bottle of drinking water is brought to the guest.  All rooms are great for wi-fi.  There is no need to go to the reception desk to access the Internet.  Each floor has its own router.  The bathroom comes with slippers and a hairdryer.  What surprised tourists was the presence of both an electric kettle and a coffee maker.  Every day they bring you everything you need for your own preparation of hot drinks.  Also regularly replenish hygiene items.  Superior rooms have a bathtub, while superior rooms have a shower.  Reviews note that the furniture in the rooms is new, solid.  Tourists liked the presence of a desk and blackout curtains for complete dimming (the latter were very useful in those rooms whose windows face the street). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Majestic Nha Trang 3 photos" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1436708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Majestic Nha Trang 3 * has a small parking lot, which is absolutely free for guests.  A pre-order in order to park the car is not needed.  This service is important because many tourists prefer to rent a motorbike in Vietnam.  If it‚Äôs difficult for you to drive fuel, you can rent bicycles for free at the hotel.  Reviews note extremely low prices for local laundry services.  There you will not only be washed clothes, but also ironed.  Reception at the hotel is open around the clock.  But, reviews warn, its employees are by no means polyglot.  They know only two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Vietnamese and English.  There is a tour desk at the hotel, but tourists say its prices are somewhat overpriced.  For business meetings, the hotel is equipped with a special room with audio and visual equipment.  You can make photocopies, send a fax.  The bar on the territory of the Majestic Nha Trang 3 * hotel has karaoke.  The relaxation area features massage services and a Finnish sauna.  Tourists appreciated the fact that you can, having vacated a room, put luggage in a storage room.  This service, as well as the storage of valuables in the left-luggage office at the reception, is absolutely free.  The girls at the front desk will help you buy tickets.  There is a currency exchange at the hotel.  You can book a transfer to or from <span>Kam Ran Airport.</span> </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in the hotel Majestic Nha Trang 3 *, as in most of these Vietnamese hotels, includes breakfast.  They are served every morning at a time convenient for guests.  Breakfast is buffet style in the restaurant on the fifteenth floor with panoramic views of Nha Trang Bay.  At other times, you can also have lunch and dinner there, but for a fee and with √† la carte service.  The hotel's restaurant specializes in Vietnamese cuisine.  But, according to reviews, if Asian food seems too spicy, you can order European dishes at the hotel.  The hotel bar offers a wide selection of drinks, including cocktails, as well as snacks and desserts.  But rest in Vietnam has its own specifics.  In this country, you can eat in cafes for locals and, unlike India, you can not catch a gastrointestinal upset.  Therefore, many hotels in Vietnam offer their guests only breakfast.  But the morning meal at the Majestic Nha Trang Hotel 3 * surprised tourists.  Their reviews show that for breakfast they gave soup, meat dishes, a lot of vegetables and fruits.  For fans of the traditional morning meal there were eggs in all kinds: fried eggs, scrambled eggs, hard boiled and soft-boiled eggs.  The kids really liked the pancakes.  Most tourists had lunch and dinner at a nearby cafe.  Many praised the Indian restaurant (it is located almost next to the hotel) and ‚ÄúLouisiana‚Äù three hundred meters from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic Star Hotel 3 Nha Trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1436714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Facilities for children </h2><p>  Hotel Majestic Nha Trang 3 * tourist reviews are not called family.  There are no mini-clubs and discos for kids here.  But still for children there is a small playground, which is located in the relaxation area on the roof of the building.  Also, upon reservation, a small cot for a child under two years old will be installed in your room.  But what discounts does the hotel offer to lure families with small children!  If the child is under the age of six, he can stay at the hotel absolutely free.  If family members make room, there will be substantial savings.  If you book an extra bed in a double room, then this third guest, regardless of age, will have to pay only eighteen US dollars per night.  And if it will be placed on the beds already in the room, then this service will cost him ten dollars at all.  But that‚Äôs all, reviews warn, should be agreed with the hotel in advance when booking a room.  It is also necessary to clarify the possibility of obtaining breakfast for such additional guests.  Tourists definitely recommend taking children to Vietnam.  There were no problems at the hotel than to feed the child for breakfast.  There was always noodles, mild meatballs, scrambled eggs, rice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic Star Hotel 3 (Vietnam Nha Trang)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1436715.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Just across the road from the coast is the Majestic Nha Trang 3 * hotel (Vietnam).  Nha Trang (Nha Trang resort) has a long municipal beach covered with golden sand.  To him from the gate of the hotel to go exactly two minutes.  Beach ammunition is paid there.  Tourists call a different price for sunbeds - from thirty to one hundred thousand dongs.  Sunset at sea is convenient for both children and those who do not like to wander for a long time to the depths.  The sea pleased most vacationers with a comfortable temperature and purity of water.  Most often, the Majestic Nha Trang 3 * photo depicts the city from the background of the beautiful Nha Trang Bay.  This peerless view can be admired from the hotel‚Äôs upper terrace, which houses a small but clean freshwater pool.  There are sunbeds, sunshades.  And if you want water entertainment, a hundred meters from the hotel, in the Gorky Park, there is a water park Fu Dong.  And if this doesn‚Äôt seem enough to you, welcome to Winpearl.  There is a water park, an amusement park, shows of singing fountains and much more. </p><h2>  Excursions in Nha Trang: what to see in the vicinity? </h2><p>  Majestic Nha Trang 3 * reviews are called a convenient starting point for small independent travels.  First you should see the sights of Nha Trang.  There are several of them at the resort.  The main one is Po Nagar.  These towers were erected during the Cham civilization (seventh to twelfth century).  A huge statue of Buddha sitting on a lotus is amazing.  Tourists did not expect to see a Gothic-style Catholic cathedral in Vietnam.  All this you can explore yourself or go around the sights of the resort during a sightseeing tour.  Reviews recommend an additional visit to the residence of the former ruler of Vietnam, Bao Dai.  These are five very beautiful buildings surrounded by exotic gardens.  The interiors and interior decoration of the rooms of that time have been preserved.  Of the city‚Äôs museums, tourists are advised to visit the local history museum, where you can see artifacts of the nationalities of the Khanh Hoa province.  For lovers of attractions created by nature itself, reviews are recommended to go to the ‚ÄúMagic Spring‚Äù waterfalls, Ba Ho and Young Bay.  And at sunset you should visit the Hong Chong rock garden located in the north of the city.  Hotel Majestic Nha Trang 3 * (Nha Trang) has its own tour desk.  You can contact him if you want to ride on the islands.  The most famous in Nha Trang is Hong Che, on which the Vinpearl amusement park is located.

    <h2>  Majestic Star Hotel 3 * Vietnam Nha Trang </h2><p>  In fairness, a few words should be said about the namesake of the hotel described by us in this article.  It is also located across from the sea.  This hotel is located on the coastal avenue of Chang Fu.  The hotel building is slightly higher than the Majestic Nha Trang.  But the pool is located not on the roof, but next to the building.  There are two restaurants in Majestic Star.  One is located on the fifteenth floor, and the other - "Star" - on the eighteenth.  Breakfast there is served as a buffet, while lunches and dinners are served √† la carte.  Restaurants specialize in Asian and European cuisines.  At the very top, the nineteenth floor of the building, is a bar.  The Majestic Star Hotel 3 * Nha Trang has one hundred and two rooms.  These are double and triple ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù and ‚ÄúExclusive‚Äù.  The equipment of these rooms is not much different from the decoration of rooms in Majestic Nha Trang.  Bathrooms have shower only.  But a hairdryer and toiletries are offered.  Superior rooms include slippers and bathrobes.  Sets and equipment for self-preparation of coffee and tea is a traditional service of hotels in Vietnam.  And Nha Trang is known for the fact that any hotel in the resort offers free Wi-Fi.  Majestic Star also has parking available to all comers.  But the territory of this hotel is a bit larger.  It has a swimming pool and a mini market.  The services of Majestic Star fully coincide with those offered in the hotel described by us.  Only there they do not give bicycles for free use.  Discounts on accommodation apply only to those children who are not yet five years old. </p>
