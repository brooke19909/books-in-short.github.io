  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The currency of Macedonia, where it can be purchased and what is its approximate rate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Euro is not used in all countries of the European Union.  Some countries still use national currencies to pay for purchases.  One such country is Macedonia.  On the territory of this small European state, the national currency is used - denar. </p><h2>  Macedonia </h2><p>  The country is located on the Balkan Peninsula and used to be part of Yugoslavia.  It has a rich and eventful history.  However, tourists should not confuse the state of Macedonia and the region in northern Greece, which is also called Macedonia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Macedonian denar" class="if uuid-2974242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2974242.jpg"></div><p>  The country at one time was part of the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Russian empires, each of which left a rich inheritance on its territory.  Various ancient monuments are located on it: castles, cathedrals, statues.  The country is also famous for resorts and medical institutions.  Especially a lot of mountain resorts are located on its territory.  The tourist will have something to see and do. </p><p>  The currency of Macedonia - denar - was introduced in 1992.  As already mentioned, unlike many other EU countries, the Macedonians did not abandon their national currency in favor of the euro.  Therefore, the tourist, in order to pay for all purchases, will need to purchase Macedonian denars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where can I get it? </h2><p>  Macedonian currency can be purchased at any bank in Macedonia.  Also, the country has many exchangers and ATMs.  You can buy local money for dollars and euros.  When buying, it should be borne in mind that denar is used only on the territory of Macedonia, and outside the state it will be problematic to exchange it for another currency.  Therefore, before leaving the country, you need to change the balances of denars back to dollars or euros, unless, of course, there is a desire to leave the notes as a souvenir. </p><p>  Banknotes really have an unusual design.  For example, on a banknote of 1000 denarii an icon of the Mother of God is depicted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="denar to ruble" class="if uuid-2974260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2974260.jpg"></div><p>  When exchanging Macedonia's currency for the euro and the dollar, problems are also possible.  Large banks do not exchange the national currency for the euro and the dollar is not for the citizens of the republic, and in small offices the exchange rate is often simply not profitable. </p><h2>  Approximate course </h2><p>  The exchange rate of the Macedonian currency to the ruble is 1.16.  However, it should be borne in mind that denar is not tied to the ruble, dollar or euro, so the exchange rate can vary by several cents and even rubles.  You can clarify if you use the special Yandex service or Google.  It can also be done on any website of a currency broker or bank.  The ISO currency number is 4217, the official abbreviation for denarius is MKD.  There is no direct exchange for rubles.  First, you will have to exchange rubles for dollars and euros in order to be able to purchase denars in the future. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be borne in mind that the bank will take a percentage from each euro both when exchanging rubles for euros or dollars, and when exchanging euros or dollars for denarii.  That is, if the dollar exchange rate is 65 denarii, then the bank can exchange it for 60-63.  The exchange rate of the Macedonian denar to the dollar is, at the time of writing, about 65-66 denarii, to the euro - 75-76. </p><div class="photo" data-original="macedonia-mk.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="currency of Macedonia" class="if uuid-2974266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2974266.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I use a credit card to pay? </h2><p>  More and more people are using credit cards to pay for purchases.  Naturally, a tourist has a question: is it possible to pay by credit card or will I have to bring money with me?  You can pay by credit card, and it can be obtained at any bank outside Macedonia.  The main thing is that the card should be currency, and the card account should have enough money to buy in dollars or euros.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which bank issued the card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="seenews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Macedonian denar to the dollar" class="if uuid-2974298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/2974298.jpg"></div><p>  Currency exchange for Macedonia is carried out automatically.  That is, euros or dollars are exchanged by the bank for denari immediately.  The system automatically recognizes and exchanges one currency for another at the current rate plus the commission for the operation.  However, bank cards are accepted only in large stores, cafes and restaurants.  If a tourist wants to buy something in the market, he needs cash. </p><h2>  Are rubles accepted for payment or exchange, is it possible to exchange rubles for Macedonian denars </h2><p>  One who thinks that in this country he will be able to exchange Russian money for denars will be disappointed.  Local banks do not exchange rubles for the currency of Macedonia.  This is because the trade turnover between Russia and Macedonia is insignificant (only 1.5%), therefore it is simply unprofitable for banks to accept rubles, as they will not be able to exchange them.  This applies not only to cash, but also to electronic money or funds in a ruble bank card account.  Therefore, when traveling on a trip to Europe, you need to stock up with euros and dollars, and rubles can be left at home. </p>
