The sights of this city and its history are described below in the article. </p><h2>  Baltiysk city: history </h2><p>  In the 13th century, a small fishing village called Pillau (‚Äúfortress‚Äù) was located on the site of the city.  The village belonged to the Prussians.  In the XVI century, the village became an important port of the duchy, which contributed to its upset.  With the opening of the shipping harbor, the first fortifications and warehouses began to appear here. </p><p>  In the XVII century, the Swedes settled in the harbor.  They began updating the old fortifications of the village and built a fleet resembling a star in their shape.  Now this place is the main attraction of Baltiysk.  In 1635, the village was transferred under the control of Brandenburg, after paying the ransom by the locals. </p><p>  Pillau is gradually expanding.  At the end of the 17th century, a lighthouse and a stone church appeared, and in 1725 it received the status of a city.  In the war with the French, Russian troops and Napoleon's troops conquered the city in turn.  Napoleon was the last in 1807, but he had to retreat, since peace was concluded with Russia. </p><p>  The city of Baltiysk appeared after the end of World War II, when the entire territory of the Kaliningrad region passed to Russia, and the name Pillau remained only in history.  At present, it is a port city, which is the westernmost point of the country.  Baltiysk is also the naval base of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <h2>  Baltiysk: architectural sights </h2><p>  The first significant attraction is the lighthouse.  He is considered a symbol of the city.  It was built by Jacob Shinkel in place of a wooden one.  The previous lighthouse was not clearly visible to the ships, but the new one was visible for 15 miles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The building of the old Gothic church is now the Cathedral of the Baltic Navy.  St. George's Cathedral was opened in 1991.  In 2001, the relics of General Ushakov were brought here, who were counted among the saints. </p><p>  What else can impress Baltiysk?  The sights of the city are ancient architecture.  The oldest buildings are the Western and Eastern forts, as well as the ruins of Lochstedt Castle.  The castle was built by the inhabitants of the village of Pillau.  At first it was made of wood, but later it was replaced by a stone version.  The western fort was built at the same time as the eastern one, however, it was preserved much better.  Little is left of the East Fort. </p>

    <h2>  Museum </h2><p>  When the city of Baltiysk <span>(Kaliningrad Oblast)</span> was ruled by the Swedes, a citadel was built here on the orders of the King of Sweden.  The construction was not completed and the locals themselves were building the citadel.  It was repeatedly rebuilt and reconstructed. </p><p>  Now the citadel, according to the original plan, has the appearance of a pentagonal star.  Each side of it is 80 meters and has its own bastion: Prussia, Albrecht, Kronprinz, Koenig, Koenigen. </p><p>  Since 2000, the Museum of the Baltic Fleet has been opened in the citadel.  Visitors can see scuba gears of various years, models of warships and their real details.  The museum also stores details of military aircraft and missiles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monuments </h2><p>  Many historical events survived Baltiysk.  The sights of the city speak eloquently about this.  There are many interesting monuments, for example, the monument to Peter I. It is amazing to see such a monument in a city that became Russian only after the Second World War.  But Peter I fell in love with Pillau and came here several times.  In 1998, on the 300th anniversary of the Baltic Fleet, a monument was erected to the emperor. </p><p>  In 2004, a monument to Empress Elizabeth was erected in Baltiysk in honor of the victories of the Russian troops during her reign.  The empress in the form of a colonel proudly sits on a galloping horse. </p>

    <p>  In Baltiysk there is also a monument to the famous hydro-builder and academician who lived in the city in the 19th century.  <span>The honorary citizen of the city of</span> Gottild Hagen is the author of most of the fortifications, the southern pier and the harbor.  The monument to the academician was erected in 1887. </p><p>  The city is a port since ancient times, so the sculpture of a woman waiting for her husband to return from swimming is considered one of the main symbols of the city.  A woman holds a child in her arms and looks into the sea, embodying the fate of the <span>wives of sailors</span> and their joy from the husbands returning home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the Baltic Fleet" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/1285007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  On the shores of the Baltic Strait is the westernmost city of Russia - Baltiysk.  Sights testify to the interesting and turbulent history of the village: the remains of the fortress walls, castle ruins, urban architecture and interesting monuments, the Museum of the Baltic Fleet - all this is worth seeing at least once. </p>
