For failure to comply with the conditions provided for liability. </p><p>  The insurers for this service are: </p><ul><li>  Company </li><li>  non-governmental funds. </li></ul><p>  NPFs are non-profit enterprises that organize voluntary insurance (Article 2 of the Federal Law No. 75).  The client of the organization may be an individual.  The investor in this transaction will be the policyholder.  It is he who transfers the funds. </p><p>  An agreement is concluded between the parties.  This is an agreement on which the payment of additional funds for formed contributions is due.  If the beneficiary is an individual, then the following payments may be made: </p><ul><li>  pension; </li><li>  lump sum benefits; </li><li>  redemption amounts. </li></ul><p>  Upon termination of the contract, third parties cannot apply for a fee.  Liabilities arise with the first insured event.  The contract will be terminated if the obligations of both parties are fulfilled. </p><p>  There are several differences between DPS and compulsory insurance: </p><ul><li>  the former is guaranteed by agreement, and the latter by the state; </li><li>  in the first case, desire is necessary, and the second is necessary; </li><li>  in case of voluntary service, it is possible to choose tariffs and the procedure for payments, and tariffs and the tax base for the general taxation system are established by law; </li><li>  with DPS, you can choose your own company, and in the second case, funds are transferred to extra-budgetary funds; </li><li>  NPF budget is created from investments and deposits, and in state funds is created thanks to contributions from employers; </li><li>  in a voluntary service, the scheme of work is important, and in a compulsory service, the tariff and rate. </li></ul><p>  The state provides compulsory insurance.  It is necessary to compensate for the treatment of people, the payment of pensions, benefits.  And voluntary is chosen at will, and it can relate only to specific cases.  Both services are important, therefore, when you design them, you need to carefully consider all the details. </p>
