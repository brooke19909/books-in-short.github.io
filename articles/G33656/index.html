However, not only the wedding day should be special for the newlyweds, but also the first wedding night.  To preserve the solemnity of the moment, an ideal option would be a beautiful hotel room, rented specifically for this night.  And today, many <span>hotels in Moscow</span> provide one designed specifically for young people. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing a honeymoon suite </h2><p>  First of all, we recommend booking a room in advance.  Most hotels, as a rule, have only one for newlyweds and one or two suites suitable for these purposes.  And in the hottest wedding season, your ideal honeymoon room in Moscow can be booked long. </p>

    <p>  A good room will be, firstly, very beautiful - with a wide bed, a chic bath, large windows and a beautiful view.  It will also be specially decorated.  These are usually flowers or rose petals.  When booking, ask what is included in the price.  Often there is included a compliment from the hotel, for example, fruits and champagne in the room. </p><p>  A good bonus is the possibility of round-the-clock ordering of food in the room, suddenly the newlyweds are hungry, because at a wedding party they often do not manage to have a bite.  And, of course, an important detail is the possibility of free late eviction, because no one wants to leave the room at 12 noon after a difficult day and a long sleepless night. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most chic options </h2><p>  The five-star luxury hotel The Ritz-Carlton is located in the heart of Moscow.  The rooms have French windows with views of Red Square.  Here you can feel like real noblemen in pre-revolutionary Russia - this is facilitated by the classic Russian style in the design of rooms, decoration with cherry wood and marble. </p><p>  Spend no money and rent the Ritz Carlton Suite, over two hundred square meters with a chic marble bathtub.  A piano standing in the living room will allow you to invite a musician and dance alone to beautiful melodies.  The cost of such a tale for one night is about one hundred thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel options in the country </h2><p>  These options are for those who want to retire and relax from the bustle of the wedding.  For this, a rural resort and a beautiful room in a bridal hotel are best suited. </p><p>  <span>The Moscow Country</span> Club is a country hotel where you can relax and unwind, play golf or tennis, sit in a restaurant on the beach, <span>ride horses</span> or swim in the pool.  But the most important thing is that here you can rent a wedding suite for your wedding night. </p><p>  For the amount of 21 thousand rubles you will receive a spacious room with a chic four-poster bed in the shape of a heart, impeccable service for 24 hours, the possibility of a free late check-out and a compliment from the hotel especially for your celebration. </p><p>  And if you want both an unusual atmosphere and a special flavor, reviews recommend the Russian Forest suburban hotel complex, where there is a special glade of brides, banquet rooms and unusual rooms - real huts with a Russian stove.  To relieve fatigue, the newlyweds can visit a Russian bathhouse.  With such a national color in the lap of nature, not a single chic bridal suite in Moscow can be compared. </p><h2>  Hotels with banquet facilities </h2><p>  The most popular option among pragmatic people - if a banquet is held at the hotel, then a room for young people is usually provided as a gift.  And you don‚Äôt need to go anywhere - after spending the guests after the holiday, the newlyweds will simply go upstairs to their room. </p><p>  So, Borodino hotel attracts good reviews.  When ordering a wedding banquet in a restaurant, a bridal suite is provided free of charge. </p>
