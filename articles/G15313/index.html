    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of the city begins during the Great Patriotic War.  Initially, the village was built specifically in order to supply the troops participating in the Battle of Stalingrad.  The town received its name thanks to the Petrov Val water bridge.  He was nearby.  The shipping channel, which was supposed to connect the Volga and the Don, was ordered to be built by Peter I. However, after the Russian Empire waged war with Turkey and the Crimea, this idea had to be postponed.  And after the start of the Northern War with Sweden, they completely abandoned it, in view of the cessation of funding.  Now the city of Petrov Val has only pits and ravines, reminiscent of the construction that has begun.  Already in our days, the channel was given the status of a historical monument.  And in the city they installed a stele.  Until the 50s, all residential buildings of the town were located in sheltered dugouts.  And only in the middle of the twentieth century did the first brick buildings and houses appear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Development </h2><p>  During the war, the Petrov Val railway station was built, and in 1947 a locomotive depot.  The city is a junction station.  It connects such settlements as Kamyshin and Balashov. </p><p>  The city received the status of a city only in 1988. In 2005, according to a referendum, it was decided to create a municipality, which, in addition to the city, also includes the village of Avilovsky.  The entire economy is currently firmly based on the operation of the railway station and the maintenance of the locomotive depot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrov Val of the Volgograd Region" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1318512.jpg" width="600"></div>
