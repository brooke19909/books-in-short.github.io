Liquid rating for electronic cigarettes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Relatively recently, electronic cigarettes have become popular.  This is a great way to get rid of addiction - smoking.  What is the best quality liquid for electronic cigarettes?  Which company is better?  How to make the right choice?  We will analyze not only how to choose a liquid, but also its types, calculation of strength, varieties of aromas and a lot of interesting facts. </p><h2>  General information about e-liquid.  Composition </h2><p>  Filler for electronic cigarettes is sold in specialized bottles ranging in size from ten to thirty milliliters.  It has a variety of tastes: nicotine (with the smell of famous tobacco products), tonic (the aroma of drinks and confectionery products) and fruit and berry.  Recommended storage requirements for the fluid are coolness and no direct sunlight.  Usually, after opening the bottle, the contents become cloudy.  This occurs due to air ingress and is considered optimal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liquid for electronic cigarettes which company is better" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1137370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Basically, all liquids for electronic cigarettes have the same composition, regardless of the manufacturer's firm and pricing policy.  Most often, the product consists of five ingredients: </p><ul><li>  Water.  Regarding the quality of this element, one does not need to speak thoroughly, since it is he who fills our body with more than half.  On average, water for cigarettes contains up to 12%. </li><li>  Propylene glycol involves a viscous mixture with a lack of color, with a weak aroma and a sweetish flavor.  In addition to liquid for electronic cigarettes, propylene glycol is rapidly used in medicine (for the purpose of disinfection, it is present in the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations taken orally, as well as in the form of a substitute for blood plasma).  It is considered a valid food supplement (T1520) since it is completely free of toxins.  Propylene glycol has been repeatedly tested in laboratories.  Scientists tried to find out how a substance affects a person.  It was confirmed that this element has absolutely no negative effect on the body, apart from individual intolerance. </li><li>  Glycerin is used more often as a food supplement (E422).  It does not allow the test, in which it is located, to stick together during the cooking process.  Glycerin is harmless to the body in moderation. </li><li>  Flavoring.  For the purpose of <span>producing electronic cigarette</span> liquids, Joyetech, Dekang, Hangsen and many others use only acceptable or completely similar food flavorings of natural origin. </li><li>  Nicotine.  It is not always found in liquid for electronic cigarettes, since there are also nicotine-free options.  Of course, we will not assure you that this element is completely safe, but the percentage of nicotine in the gas station is small.  Its content in liquid for electronic cigarettes is five times less than in conventional tobacco products. </li></ul><h2>  How to choose a fortress? </h2><p>  Many people buy electronic cigarettes to quit smoking.  Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to decide on what taste to stop, but do everyone know how to choose the strength of a liquid for electronic cigarettes?  Sure no.  Let's talk about this in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  First of all, when choosing, you need to pay attention to the percentage of nicotine content.  In order to find out what level you like, you need to increase the strength indicated on the packaging of your tobacco products twenty times.  For example, if 0.7 mg of nicotine is indicated on cigarettes, then the appropriate rate for you will be 14 mg / ml.  Feel free to choose a gas station with such a nicotine content or close to it.  To calculate the amount of filler you need, remember: 1.5 ml is about 20-25 cigarettes. </p><p>  It‚Äôs hard enough to choose a liquid for electronic cigarettes.  The tips described in our article will help you in this matter. </p><h2>  Best fluid </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, everyone wants to get a quality and suitable product.  The best e-cigarette refill liquid is the one that appeals to you.  Regardless of the price, as we found out earlier, such products have an almost identical composition.  Moreover, according to the effect on the human body, all fillers for electronic cigarettes also converge.  There are fairly well-known companies that produce them.  In the products of popular manufacturers there is an excellent ratio of price and quality, but we will talk about them later. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Aromatization </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, to figure out how to choose a liquid for electronic cigarettes, it is not enough to know only about their contents.  Fragrance also plays an important role.  First of all, you need to consider personal preference.  If you have an allergic reaction to a certain smell, then, accordingly, you should not choose this taste. </p>

    <p>  Most often, the filling of electronic cigarettes is divided into three taste categories - fruit, coffee and nicotine.  Often manufacturers, in order to promote their goods, create their own "cocktails" in which they combine two, and sometimes three, flavors or produce completely new ones.  The variety of tastes is quite large.  In order not to make a mistake, it is better to focus on your preferences.  Now you know exactly how to choose the e-liquid you like. </p><h2>  Quality liquid for electronic cigarettes.  Which company is better? </h2><p>  Despite the same composition, there is one important difference - the quality of the raw materials.  If we compare liquid for cigarettes, then it is worth remembering that the more popular the company, the more opportunities it has to carry out verification of raw materials at all stages of manufacture.  In addition, eminent companies often use independent research proving a high-quality and safe composition. </p>

However, the quality of the fluid is on top. </p><h2>  Intriguing scents </h2><p>  Third place is VARDEX.  This is a Russian company that produces quite exclusive aromas such as linden honey, <span>lemon sorbet</span> and many other incredible tastes.  This liquid, like the previous one, has a high viscosity, which is bad for the electronic cigarette itself.  On average, its price is 15 rubles per milliliter. </p><h2>  Value for money </h2><p>  In fourth place in our ranking are liquids from RED SMOKERS.  This is a Russian company that is known for its products and its impeccable quality.  Buyers note that such fillers are distinguished by delicious additives.  Pleased with the price in relation to high quality.  The only nuance in liquids for electronic cigarettes from RED SMOKERS is that the vaporizer is quickly contaminated from them. </p><h2>  Italian company </h2><p>  In fifth place are liquids for electronic cigarettes from the company FLAVOURART.  This is an Italian company that has a large selection of flavors.  However, buyers believe that cigarette flavors are not like tobacco.  The best option before buying such a product would be tasting it. </p><p>  After reviewing our rating, you can easily choose a liquid for electronic cigarettes.  Which company is better, can be seen in our TOP-5. </p><h2>  The incredible tastes of liquid for electronic cigarettes </h2><p>  We have already figured out that all the flavors are divided into three categories.  Each of them is interesting in its own way.  Do you know what incredible aromas exist today? </p><p>  In pursuit of popularity, many companies began to create tastes that at least surprise.  Incredibly, there are liquids for electronic cigarettes with the taste of chips, Coca-Cola, espresso, cheese, ketchup, candy and even a birthday cake and pumpkin pie. </p><p>  If you miss summer and refreshing drinks, then you can easily get a liquid with the aromas of mojito and pinacolada.  In addition to cocktails, you can also try wine and champagne flavors.  If you follow your diet and limit yourself to sweets, then you will like the aroma of ice cream, cheesecake and other goodies.  Even the most fastidious smoker can find e-liquid for his taste. </p><h2>  The history of the creation of electronic cigarettes </h2><p>  Each of us knows what an electronic cigarette is.  Does everyone know who created it in what year?  Incredibly, an e-cigarette was designed by a Chinese pharmacist 16 years ago.  He was ill with lung cancer, but could not give up addiction and therefore came up with an alternative. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to choose a liquid strength for electronic cigarettes" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1136265.jpg" width="600"></div>
