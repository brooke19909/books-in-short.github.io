    <h2>  About the specifics of hotels in Pattaya </h2><p>  Pattaya is the main tourist center of Thailand.  In season, there is an incredible number of vacationers from various corners of the globe.  Nevertheless, there are no problems with accommodation due to the huge number of hotels and hotels of various categories.  All beaches of the coast are municipal, which is why it is foolish to expect that you will find an option on the coast here, at least you have to cross the road.  In Pattaya, the coastline, that is, the beach, is separated from the city by the roadway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are practically no all-inclusive hotels, most often breakfast is included in the price.  These are small subtleties that allow you to objectively look at local hotels. </p>

    <p>  Many vacationers are interested in the availability of a safe in the room, where without any fears and fears one could leave valuables, documents and money.  Unfortunately, the rooms do not have a safe, but all tourists can use the safe at the reception for free. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel are bright and spacious, in many respects the effect is ensured by panoramic windows and panoramic sliding doors leading to the balcony.  In the bathroom, in addition to towels for the face, legs and shower, tourists are offered cosmetic products.  Unfortunately, there is no hairdryer in the bathroom, and if necessary it can be ordered at the reception.  I want to say a few words about the minibar: it is paid.  Any drink you take from there will have to be paid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a tile on the floor, there are no rugs, even in the bedside zone.  Tourists should be extremely cautious, including with equipment: when the phone hits the tile, it shatters.  If you like warmth and homeliness, it is better to bring slippers with you.  Speaking about the shortcomings, I want to mention the sockets - there are only three of them in the room.  Given the huge arsenal of equipment in the baggage of every tourist, three outlets may simply not be enough - be sure to bring an extension cord with you. </p>
