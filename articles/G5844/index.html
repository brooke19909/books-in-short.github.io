  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Svyaznoy Bank, reviews of grateful customers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you start working with a bank, first of all, pay attention to the reviews.  They should be not only positive, but also as informative as possible.  Svyaznoy Bank has such reviews. </p><p>  Before entrusting the bank with their savings or taking a loan, or maybe just connecting additional services, prudent <span>bank customers</span> determine its reliability.  Of course, after reading negative reviews about any bank, you will not want to resort to its services.  And only when the customer reviews are as positive and promising as possible, does the desire to start working with this particular bank appear.  Like any financial institution, Svyaznoy <span>Bank</span> justifies its <span>reviews</span> .  It is very difficult to find customers who would be happy with everything, but they are there, and they respond with gratitude to his work. </p><p>  Almost every client pays attention to the reliability of the bank.  It can be judged by the stability of its development, the level of public confidence, the financial stability rating and many other indicators.  Having received a license to carry out its activities in September 2010, in just a year, Svyaznoy Bank increased its assets by more than 200%.  During 2012, Svyaznoy <span>Bank</span> fully justified the <span>reviews of</span> its customers, as it entered the top twenty leaders of Russian banks and took a worthy 16th place.  First of all, such growth is explained by the fact that Promtorgbank, founded in 1992, is at its origins.  Therefore, the staff of the bank employs employees who have specialized in providing banking services for many years and are well aware of what their customers need. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the main services that Svyaznoy Bank offers its customers, the most popular are <span>salary projects,</span> lending, deposit funds, Internet banking, collection, trade financing, customs cards, factoring and cash management services. </p><p>  One of the most popular services, for which Svyaznoy Bank receives extremely positive reviews, has become a universal <span>bank card.</span>  It is designed for retail customers and they can use both debit and credit accounts.  Interest is accrued on cash balance in the client‚Äôs current account.  Issuing this card is quite simple, as you can contact not only the bank branch, but submit documents to one of Svyaznoy‚Äôs mobile communication centers.  For the convenience of customers, convenient Internet banking is also provided, which allows you to send an application by e-mail and wait for confirmation and processing of the application. </p><p>  Among the main advantages of the bank can be noted and constant monitoring in the market of banking services.  About Svyaznoy Bank negative reviews can only be left by customers who do not understand the policy of improving the provision of additional services or the elimination of old banking products that do not have sufficient competitiveness in the market.  So, from March 13, 2013 new interest rates and service tariffs are introduced.  After getting acquainted with them, it becomes clear that, like other banks, this bank tries to achieve maximum benefits for itself, but it does not forget about its customers.  The accumulative bonus program is justified in many respects, and the convenience of replenishing a bank account is at the highest level. </p><p>  You can hear reviews about Svyaznoy Bank about excellent service both in branches and in the Internet bank.  Very convenient and quick withdrawal of money via Webmoney: requests are processed competently and without delay. </p><p>  If you want to use the services of the bank, it is necessary to take into account not only reviews about it, but also its financial condition today.  For two years, the financial products offered by Svyaznoy Bank have justified themselves not only in the market for providing <span>banking products,</span> but also in the eyes of customers resorting to its services again. </p>
