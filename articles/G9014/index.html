There are reasons for this, among which is a fashion for technological devices and operational shortcomings.  However, they are covered by practical benefits.  The mere appearance of such a mechanism can scare away a poorly trained attacker.  In addition, mechanical means of protection against <span>car theft</span> are cheaper and more affordable to install.  But there are serious drawbacks to such devices, which are expressed in the weaknesses of mechanics as such.  There is no need to talk about absolute protection in this case, since, if desired and having a certain margin of time, the offender will be able to cope with a simple blocker.  Nevertheless, as an additional security measure, this protection option is justified. </p>

    <h2>  Features of mechanical anti-theft protection </h2><p>  The main difference between such devices is independence from the alarm.  The reliability of the device depends entirely on the strength of the materials and the configuration of the lock.  This also implies another advantage that mechanical protection against car theft in all versions possesses - this is the exclusion of energy costs.  This advantage is not so much associated with savings, as with the lack of risk of ‚Äúlanding" the battery at the wrong time.  True, there are negative nuances of the operation of mechanical devices.  So, if you need a key fob with several buttons to control the electronic alarm, some types of locks require physical manipulations.  Moreover, these actions are not always limited to simply opening the lock.  To understand the nuances of operating such systems, it is worth considering the most common types of mechanical protection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Steering lock </h2>

    <p>  This device prevents unauthorized manipulations with a steering wheel, protecting it from turns.  Fixation ensures the immobility of the "donut" so that it becomes physically impossible to change its position.  Even if the attacker starts the engine, the steering wheel will maintain its position, which is likely to prevent the attacker from hijacking.  There are several types of such mechanisms.  In simple modifications, the mechanical protection against stealing the steering wheel does not involve other machine components, but there are also combined devices that also attach to the pedal.  A special locking mechanism provides for the integration of a special coupling into the steering shaft, which ensures immobility. </p><h2>  Stopper pedals </h2>

    <p>  Quite popular are special devices that are mounted only on the pedal.  They are a metal rack with divisions, on which the lock is mounted.  The latter fixes the position of the pedal in such a way that it is stationary.  Such systems can be attributed to the cheapest representatives of mechanical devices to protect the machine, but they have significant disadvantages.  Firstly, the pedal lock is inconvenient to use, since the driver must spend 10-15 minutes each time installing it.  Secondly, mechanical anti-theft protection by locking the pedal does not work with cars that have an <span>automatic transmission.</span>  In other cases, this option may be useful if an electronic security system is also provided as the main one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gear lock </h2><p>  Such devices are represented by different designs, so the principle of operation is different for them.  The most common system in which the gear lever is installed in a certain position and is fixed in it.  On the market, mechanical protection against theft of this type is presented in arc and pin versions.  It is advisable to immediately focus on the first option, since this mechanism provides a more reliable locking of the switch lever with the help of a special bracket that presses the handle to the lock.  There are also internal blockers that are hidden under the casing of the tunnel.  To control such a mechanism, only a <span>lock cylinder is</span> provided <span>.</span>  Opening it, the driver provides the ability to shift the transmission. </p>

    <h2>  Door blockers </h2><p>  If a convenient and inexpensive device for additional protection is required, then it is worth paying attention to the door blocker.  It is a pin that integrates into the door leaf of a car.  It is important to note that this device has nothing in common and does not communicate with the main lock.  However, its function also comes down to preventing access to the salon.  By the principle of <span>operation,</span> this type of <span>mechanical</span> anti-theft protection resembles a conventional gate valve.  To eliminate the possibility of tampering with metal master keys, modern blockers are equipped with special protection.  However, such a mechanism can not save from a hijacker, ready to break the glass. </p><h2>  Brake lock </h2><p>  The action of systems of this type is expressed in limiting the movement of the car after performing one braking.  By design, such a blocker resembles a conventional check valve.  It is integrated into the brake system by specialists, so the owner of the car does not have to bother with the installation every time to start the movement.  In some versions, mechanical protection against theft of this type also provides starter lock.  In terms of reliability, such devices are considered the most effective, but they also cost significantly more than a steering lock or door latch. </p><h2>  Installation Instructions </h2>

    <p>  Each device has its own installation features.  There are two categories of mechanical means according to the type of installation.  The former are integrated into the design of the machine through special screws, brackets and clamps in the workshop.  Systems of the second category can be installed by the driver himself.  For example, mechanical anti-theft tools for a steering wheel or pedal only require the device to be correctly adjusted and then secured with a pin and lock.  In this regard, the greatest difficulty is the mechanisms that cover the steering wheel and pedal at the same time.  Having correctly fixed the position of all units, you can count on a high level of reliability. </p><h2>  Reviews on mechanical theft protection </h2>

    <p>  Mechanical devices are the oldest form of car theft protection.  Russian motorists are well acquainted with the pros and cons of such devices and for the most part respond positively about them.  Today, mechanical protection against auto theft is practically not used as the only security measure.  As a rule, it is combined with electronic devices.  If we talk about the shortcomings, then they are mainly expressed in operational nuances.  Daily installation and installation take a lot of time, so more and more often motorists make a choice in favor of fixed mechanisms.  By the way, such systems are best manifested in terms of reliability. </p>
