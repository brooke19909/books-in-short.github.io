    <p>  “Shrek” is a fabulous story in which fans will not be able to see the actress, but they will enjoy the opportunity to listen to her pleasant voice.

    <p>  The heroine Cameron must make a difficult choice.  Duty tells the girl to serve criminal authority, but she suddenly falls in love with a guy who is trying to kill her boss.  Interestingly, the events take place in 1863, the center of action is New York at that time, whose inhabitants obey only the law of power.  Leonardo DiCaprio in this picture got the role of a son who wants to pay for his father, who died in a fierce skirmish many years ago. </p><h2>  Work with Tom Cruise </h2><p>  Hollywood "cutie" often have to meet on the set with other stars.  Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in the film "Vanilla Sky" composed a spectacular duet.  The actress got the role of a deceived rich playboy lover.  Cruz acts as a playboy, his character has absolutely everything from a thriving business to a huge bank account.  His life completely changes when a mysterious girl, performed by Penelope Cruz, bursts into it. </p><p>  The drama became a remake, the original version was shot at the time by Alejandro Amenabara.  All critics insist that the remake has become much worse than the original.  However, the role of the tragically deceived girl Diaz played brilliantly, laid out one hundred percent. </p>

    <p>  Vanilla Sky is not the only film in which Tom and Cameron starred together.  Already in 2010 saw the light of the tape "Knight of the Day", again uniting the stars.  Hardly a comedy action movie can be called a breakthrough of the year, but the constant alterations in which the heroes Diaz and Cruz found themselves impressed the public. </p><h2>  The most romantic stories </h2><p>  Many films with Cameron Diaz can be called romantic.  A striking example of such a picture is the work of 2006 "Vacation on the exchange."  Two ladies, one of whom is played by an actress, are disappointed in their own boyfriends.  They come up with an original decision - to swap houses for the Christmas holidays and how to relax.  An unusual vacation will give them not only fresh impressions, but also long-awaited love. </p>

    <p>  Noteworthy is the comedy Once Upon a Time in Vegas, in which handsome Ashton Kutcher became Cameron's partner.  Two young people find themselves in the same bed after spending a fun night in Las Vegas.  The memories of yesterday's adventures are both very vague.  It turns out that they hit the jackpot at the casino and got married.  Now each of them wants to take possession of a huge amount of money, leaving the newly minted “second half” with his nose. </p><p>  It is worth looking at the picture “The Wedding of a Best Friend”, in which Diaz starred with Julia Roberts.  The heroine of the blonde is Kimberly, who is going to get married.  Suddenly, an old friend arrives to her fiance, who suddenly realized that she had been in love with him all her life.  But Kimberly does not believe that her rival will be able to upset the upcoming wedding. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  Gambit is a criminally adventurous story presented to the public in 2012, which has become a remake of the 1966 work.  A swindler, a rodeo participant, a resident of Texas - this is another heroine Cameron Diaz.  Comedy films are brilliantly successful for the actress, and Gambit was no exception. </p><p>  The film “Away from You”, released in 2005, introduces viewers to the story of sisters who are unlike each other.  Diaz plays reckless Maggie, whose life consists of going to night clubs and meaningless novels.  Once she is forced to move to her sister - an educated, serious girl lawyer.  The relations of relatives do not add up from early childhood, they reach maximum stress when Rose discovers Maggie in bed with her own boyfriend.  How will events develop after that, will the sisters part forever? </p><p>  The most recent films with Cameron Diaz were released in 2014: Another Woman, Emmy.  Fans can only hope for new bright projects with her participation. </p>
