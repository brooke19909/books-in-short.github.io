  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rest on the Dead Sea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rest on the Dead Sea is not just about enjoying freedom from work and everyday life.  It is also a unique opportunity to improve your body and soul, to recharge with pure energy, energy and even youth.  This is a real health resort that copes with its tasks at the highest level.  Rest on the Dead Sea will allow you to feel the vivacity and fresh forces, which are enough for more fruitful activities and solving life problems after returning from vacation to the familiar atmosphere of everyday life. </p><p>  <strong>The Dead Sea</strong> </p><p>  This sea is known to be the most saline in the world.  The amount of salts dissolved in its water exceeds all limits allowed by physics.  Because of such increased salinity in the water, you can really lie and read the newspaper.  Water simply pushes all objects immersed in it. </p><p>  It is located on the territory of two states: Jordan and Israel.  The sea is located 417 meters below sea level, and its waters contain almost all the elements found on Earth. </p><p>  The healing mud of the sea is saturated with magnesium, which tightens the skin well and increases its inner tone.  Iodine and bromine have a beneficial effect on the endocrine system.  The general effect of minerals leads to the disappearance of irritability and eliminates the effects of urban stress.  Rest on the Dead Sea becomes a real savior for those who often face stressful situations. </p><p>  Here skin diseases, problems of the respiratory tract and musculoskeletal system are successfully treated. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that due to the low location of the sea above it, a peculiar air lens formed, which creates a natural barrier to the harmful rays of the solar spectrum.  Therefore, you can sunbathe here all day without harm to the skin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Tours to the Dead Sea</strong> </p><p>  Those who have once been here tend to book tours again.  You can buy tours in advance or sign up for last-minute tours of the <span>Dead Sea.</span>  The last option will help you save on a ticket.  Such offers are beneficial for travel companies, because they allow you to fill in empty seats on airplanes, and for tourists - because they leave free funds for the rest.  This is especially true if you want to spend there not several days, but several weeks, which significantly increases the cost of rest.  You can book last-minute trips to the Dead Sea at travel agency offices or via the Internet through an online application. </p><p>  <strong>Health Benefits</strong> </p><p>  Rest on the Dead Sea allows you to touch the stunningly unique nature. </p><p>  It is good to come here with children, because it is useful for their well-being and the prevention of frequent colds, and because it is very calm and quiet.  The superbly developed infrastructure will not let anyone get bored, and the proposed leisure programs can make your vacation interesting and active. </p><p>  Treatment at the Dead Sea has become the hallmark of Israel and Jordan, because only here you can find such unique combinations of natural phenomena that have a healing effect.  An endless chain of sanatoriums, health centers and clinics stretches along the seashores, which are crowded at almost any time of the year. </p><p>  At your discretion, you can choose an institution of either medical or cosmetological profile, which offer a wide range of medical and wellness procedures: mud and hydrotherapy, SPA, thalassotherapy, massages, etc.  A treatment tour requires at least seven days, but, of course, it is better that the course lasts at least two weeks. </p><p>  You can visit the national parks "Qumran", "Masada", "Ein Gedi" and others to enjoy the untouched nature of these places. </p><p>  <strong>The Tale of Living Water</strong> </p><p>  Probably, this fairy tale was born somewhere on the shores of the Dead Sea.  Local drinking water is very healthy.  It is able to inhibit the growth of cancer cells.  This is due to the presence in it of a high level of selenium and other chemicals with a similar effect.  And the air here is very useful because it does not contain any allergens, so breathe deeply. </p>
