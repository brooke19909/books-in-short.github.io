Many tourists try to <span>conquer this</span> peak.  After all, the one who does this can consider himself a particle of history.  However, not everyone knows where Everest is.  This peak is located on the border of Nepal and Tibet and is the highest point of our planet.  Its height reaches 8850 meters.  It should be noted that the mountain has other names.  For example, in Tibet it is called Chomolungma, and in Naples - Sagarmatha.  Translation of these names has almost the same meaning.  In the first case, it sounds like ‚ÄúThe Divine Mother of Life,‚Äù and in the latter, ‚ÄúMother of the Gods.‚Äù </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Everest" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/80609.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now that it is already known where Everest is, it's time to familiarize yourself with some historical facts.  The modern name of the mountain appeared in the middle of the 19th century after the first measurement of its height by R. Sikdar.  It was named after George Everest, a teacher and mentor of the British Surveying Service of the period.  According to the first data, the height of the mountain was slightly less than in the last measurements.  She was 8840 meters.  But even then it was clear to everyone that Everest was the highest point in the world.  According to historical records, the peak was measured more than once until the Americans using GPS established the final value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is everest" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/80606.jpg" width="600"></div>

More than 500 people flock to conquer this peak annually.  Today, their total number reaches 4000 people, however, only 660 climbers were able to reach the summit.  Among the conquerors of this mountain, there are 150 dead, and this number is increasing every year.  The youngest climber to climb was Jordan Romero.  This happened in 2010, and at that time he was only 13 years old.  An incredible record of being at the top was set by the meditation master and yogi Bhakti Kumari Rai (32 hours). </p><p>  It should be noted that in order to conquer the peak, it is not enough to know where Everest is located.  To survive this climb, you must be a climber and have the proper training.  For a person not involved in mountaineering, this is an impossible wish, and you can only dream about it.  However, many travel companies offer various tours that allow you to climb to the highest possible height that does not pose a danger to a person, for example from Nepal.  To climb Mount Everest, you must adhere to certain tactics.  When organizing an expedition, in most cases a classic continuous climb is used, which begins from the foot to the top.  When climbing more than 8000 m, special parking lots are necessary for lifting <span>oxygen tanks.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount everest photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/80605.jpg" width="600"></div>

The most popular is the tour starting in the village of Lukla, which is located at an altitude of 2800m.  A small airplane brings guests here.  Ascent begins from the side of Nepal.  On average, it lasts 15 days.  The path lies along the very path along which the first expeditions passed.  Initially, he reaches Pakdin (2650 m) or the village of Manjo (2800 m).  It all depends on the preparation of the group.  Next - go to Nachme Bazar (3440 m).  The trail lies in a narrow valley of the Dadh Kosi river, which is called dairy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Everest Tours" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/80604.jpg" width="333"></div>  In several places, the river will have to be crossed over suspension bridges.

    <p>  After raising - a short break and acclimatization.  As you gain height, there is a lack of oxygen, <span>mountain diseases</span> associated with it <span>.</span>  Headache, shortness of breath, lethargy and lack of appetite may appear.  It is impossible to describe the reaction unequivocally, since it manifests itself differently in everyone depending on the organism.  Next is the transition to Tiagnoboche, and then to Dingboche, where again time is given for acclimatization.  The final stage is the transition to the village of Herak Shep and to the top of Kala Pattar, from where a stunning view of Everest opens.  Here, all groups take photos as a keepsake. </p><p>  When climbing a mountain, you need to take care of a sufficient amount of warm clothing, since the trip is accompanied by sharp temperature drops and squally winds. </p>
