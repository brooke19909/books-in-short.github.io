It is very convenient when in one place there is everything you need for modern life.  You just need to understand that for such a property of your dreams you need appropriate financial resources.  <span>The</span> Seliger City <span>residential complex</span> is a grandiose project whose goal is to create a unique living space.  A large plot of land in West Degunino (SAO Moscow) was allocated for development.  The houses are being built by the construction company MR Group.  The idea and concept of the architecture of the residential complex belongs to the Dutch bureau MLA Plus.  At present, you can find enough information about the Seleger City residential complex, reviews of future homeowners and equity holders.  In this review we will try to figure out how objective they are. </p><h2>  General project </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroykin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of a residential complex" class="if uuid-2977270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977270.jpg"></div><p>  On the official website of the Seliger City Residential Complex, chic plans of the complex are presented with a description of all its advantages.  But is everything as beautiful as painted on the site?  The best source of information in order to get an idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSeliger City is customer reviews.  For some reason, the official sites of the developer do not have an approved master plan for the complex.  Only descriptions of individual houses under construction are presented here.  Master plans are sought and shared by equity holders at thematic forums to discuss the housing estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Land plot </h2><p>  Many just because of the location are eyeing Seliger City.  Reviews of the West Degunino area are mostly positive.  In addition, if the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developer is fully implemented, then a full-fledged residential quarter of 11 houses with its own social and commercial infrastructure will appear here.  But is everything clean?  An independent investigation of interest holders showed that some of the areas on which construction is supposed to be are still not leased and not acquired by the developer.  The investigations of curious real estate investors are confirmed by a random check of the indicated cadastral numbers.  Moreover, it turns out that the selected territories are not suitable for the construction of residential buildings. </p><p>  The issue of land allocation was first raised at the end of 2017, but to this day it remains unresolved.  A lease agreement has been drawn up for part of the plots until 2023, that is, until the completion of construction.  After that, the developer plans to re-register the land into ownership or conclude long-term lease agreements for tenants with the subsequent right of privatization. </p><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="advantages of lcd seliger" class="if uuid-2977251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977251.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  "Seliger City" consists of 11 houses built using the technology of monolithic construction.  Floors are different - from 5 to 39 floors.  Near the residential complex is a school and two kindergartens.  There is also a huge parking lot under the buildings.  On the territory it is planned to create a park with its own pond and recreation areas.  When developing a residential complex, the concept of "yard without cars" was used.  As planned by the developer, the territory of the complex should be completely safe and equipped with video surveillance cameras.  The entrances to the entrances will be located on the same level with the ground, which will be convenient for people with disabilities, as well as for young mothers with strollers.  Entrance groups of entrances are planned to be divided into functional zones - a workplace for the administrator of the building, a resting place and a waiting area with upholstered furniture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What do apartment buyers in Seliger City residential complex complain about?  Reviews of real estate investors often emphasize such a drawback as the proximity of houses.  Buildings K and B are located at a distance of 20-30 meters from sections of house A. Future residents believe that this will not be too comfortable. </p><h2>  Club houses and anthills </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex architecture" class="if uuid-2977259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977259.jpg"></div><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  The design of buildings and the architecture of the houses in the Seliger City residential complex are unique.  Each building has its own name and author's design.  The names of the houses were given in honor of the famous Dutch and Russian painters.  The houses have different architecture, height and length, differ in class.  There are also giant "anthills" of 30-39 floors with 10 apartments per floor, there are also buildings of varying number of storeys, where there are only 5 apartments on the staircase.  In the second case, they talk about housing of an improved class. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  What is it and what is its feature?  On the website of this complex apartments are presented very clearly.  Here you can not only see the floor plan, but also correlate the location of the living space with the yard and adjacent streets.  On average, there are 8-10 apartments on the floor.  The developer offers studios, one-, two- and three-room options.  There are three elevators on the floor - one freight and two freight and passenger.  The houses are equipped with elevators from the best European manufacturers - Schindler and Otis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments ranges from 25 to 95 square meters.  The cost per square meter of housing in the complex is from 170 to 190 thousand rubles.  Most apartments have standard layouts, but there are exceptions.  The features of the premises include the absence of balconies, the availability of adjacent bathrooms and a room with two windows. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd seliger city" class="if uuid-2977238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977238.jpg"></div><p>  What are the advantages of apartments in the Seliger City residential complex?  Reviews of interest holders allow you to identify the following advantages of this residential complex: </p><ul><li>  spacious apartments - comfortable housing; </li><li>  the windows are larger than standard - the living space is very bright; </li><li>  the presence of separate dressing rooms; </li><li>  isolated rooms. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to such plans, the complex under consideration has become a very attractive option for families with children. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  What you need to know about this?  Today you can buy apartments with decoration in the residential complex "Seliger City".  Customer reviews confirm that the developer offers three finishes: </p><ul><li>  draft: concrete box and communications; </li><li>  pre-treatment: requires cosmetic repairs; </li><li>  fair: you can live. </li></ul><p>  The latter type of decoration is represented by several types of decoration.  Light colors prevail in each of them.  During the repair, only high-quality finishing materials are used.  The main question that usually interests potential buyers is the cost of repairs.  The owners of apartments on the forums voiced the figure of 500 thousand rubles for the repair of an apartment of 50 square meters. </p><h2>  Information on the official website </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="terms of completion of the residential complex" class="if uuid-2977267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977267.jpg"></div><p>  To date, you can find at least three sites about the housing in question, as well as the site of the developer.  When choosing a living space, you should be guided by the website of the residential complex itself, since information on other sources is not published in full.  There are also forums for future residents, where apartment buyers discuss all issues related to construction.  You can monitor the pace of construction using video from cameras presented on the official website.  Many interest holders note the insane speed of construction of the Seliger City residential complex.  The deadlines are unlikely to be violated. </p><p>  The developer plans to complete the construction of buildings in the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  1st stage (Rubens, Barents, Rembrandt) - 2nd quarter of 2019. </li><li>  2nd stage (Bering, Repin, Bryullov) - the deadline is unknown. </li><li>  3rd stage ("Kandinsky", "Van Gogh", "Lomonosov", "Levenguk") - the deadline is unknown. </li><li>  4th stage ("New Holland") - deadline unknown. </li></ul><h2>  How to buy an apartment in the complex? </h2><p>  Let's look at this aspect in more detail.  Many, having evaluated all the reviews and opinions on the Seliger City residential complex, make an important decision about buying an apartment.  The developer also offers storage rooms and parking spaces.  The purchase of housing is made out under an equity agreement.  For the calculation, personal funds or a mortgage loan can be used.  There is no information on the site about the possibility of using subsidies, maternity capital or installments.  The cost of pantries and parking spaces depends on the selected site and ranges from: </p><ul><li>  800-900 thousand per parking place; </li><li>  70-80 thousand per square meter of utility room area. </li></ul><p>  The developer has planned 789 parking spaces for 1249 apartments.  Therefore, the parking situation looks very attractive.  However, it should be borne in mind that the documentation, including the general development plan, is updated.  On some sites you can already find information about 550 parking spaces. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="infrastructure lcd seliger" class="if uuid-2977255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977255.jpg"></div><p>  Housing in a good area is always a good investment.  Residents can use the entire infrastructure without waiting for the commissioning of the entire complex.  Western Degunino is no exception in this matter.  Future residents of the comfortable complex will be able to attend schools, clinics, shopping centers, banks, sports and entertainment centers, which are located near their home.  When the improvement of the complex is completed, residents will be able to enjoy: </p><ul><li>  Own park area. </li><li>  Cozy courtyards without cars. </li><li>  Sports grounds. </li><li>  Kindergartens and school. </li><li>  Commercial, financial and social institutions located on the first floors of the residential complex. </li></ul><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Are there any obvious disadvantages of Seliger City?  Reviews are usually the same as those characteristic of the whole of Moscow.  Not far from the built-up area are the industrial areas Aviamotornaya, Degunino-Likhobory, which worsen the environment.  However, it should be borne in mind that not far from the buildings there is an extended forest, as well as the natural zone of Deguninsky Pond.  This makes the situation a little smoother.  It should also be noted that gradually industrial zones in Moscow are being reorganized.  A more serious cause for concern is the active construction of buildings in the area.  A large residential complex from the PIK developer is being built not far from the complex under discussion. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  As a rule, they are interested in this aspect in the first place.  What attracts future residents of the Seliger City residential complex?  Feedback from equity holders suggests that the most important advantage of this complex is its good transport accessibility.  In March 2018, the Seligerskaya metro station was opened.  From it to the houses of "Seliger City" just 8 minutes on foot.  It is also planned to build an international bus station next to the metro.  It also attracts many residents of the area.  Motorists positively assess the transport accessibility of the area.  Provided that there are no traffic jams, the center of Moscow can be reached in just 20 minutes.  You can also leave Degunino by train.  The transport hub is located near the residential complex.  From here you can get to the Leningrad station, as well as drive to the cities of Solnechnogorsk, Klin and Tver. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Should I buy apartments in the Seliger City residential complex?  Reviews from real estate investors indicate that the area is quite suitable for a comfortable stay.  The complex is being built quite quickly and, most likely, will be built on time.  The area has excellent infrastructure and is located close to Moscow.  As for the apartments themselves, the developer offers comfortable modern layouts, as well as the possibility of finishing. </p><p>  So, are there any downsides to Seliger City?  Reviews can be found as follows: </p><ul><li>  incomprehensible situation with the design of the land allotted for the construction of the complex; </li><li>  the actual number of parking spaces; </li><li>  significant population growth after the construction of all planned housing estates; </li><li>  the proximity of industrial zones. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features LCD Seliger" class="if uuid-2977245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2977245.jpg"></div><p>  In this review, we examined in detail information about the Seliger City residential complex.  Customer reviews and the information provided on the official website of the builder diverge somewhat, and for many this causes concern.  However, the location of the complex was chosen quite well.  The area has all the necessary infrastructure and at the same time has good transport accessibility. </p>
