Sights here have appeared for several centuries, starting from 862 AD.  It was then that the settlement was founded. </p><p>  For example, the first mention of even Moscow is in the annals of only 1147.  It was Rostov the Great who managed to maintain the original integrity of the natural landscape and architecture; therefore, the status of the Great is forever fixed to the city. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The city is located on the shores of Lake Nero.  Scientists are sure that these places were inhabited 20 thousand years ago.  Once upon a time, Fatyanovites disappeared without a trace, then Meria tribes.  Not far from the city found Sarskoye fortification. </p><p>  Already in 991, as soon as Russia converted to Christianity, the Rostov diocese was founded here.  Several times the city passed from one county to another.  After the residence of the Metropolitan was moved to Yaroslavl, the city lost its former grandeur and became an ordinary county town.  Among the total mass of such settlements, the city singled out a huge number of monasteries and temples, as well as the annual Rostov Fair.  But already at the end of the XIX century it ceased to exist.  By the second half of the last century, the city has become a tourist center of our state. </p><h2>  Kremlin </h2><p>  When it comes to a trip to this city, there is no question that it is necessary to see the attraction of Rostov the Great - the Kremlin.  It is located in the central part of the city, has several entrances, located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2 hectares.  The Kremlin wall has loopholes and battlements.  You can get to any part of the building through the wall passages, passing through which there is an opportunity to admire Lake Nero and the surrounding beautiful vegetation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although in the usual sense, the <span>Rostov Kremlin is</span> not a fortress.  They began to build it in <span>1589,</span> when the Rostov-Yaroslavl Metropolitan lived in the city.  At that time, there was a need for the placement of the diocese, the reception of officials and other state activities.  For this reason, they began to build chambers near the existing Assumption Cathedral.  Over time, an area appeared near the stone chambers, churches, a garden and a vegetable garden. </p><p>  Only in 1670, with the advent of Jonah Sysoevich, a real residence began to form.  The whole territory was surrounded by high walls, with battlements and loopholes.  Only in the XIX century the complex began to be called the Kremlin.  Today it is a museum-reserve, with the main attraction of Great Rostov - the Assumption Cathedral, which is a vivid example of true Russian architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="politikus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov the Great" class="if uuid-2446765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446765.jpg"></div><h2>  Earthen shafts </h2><p>  Around the Kremlin, on the opposite side of the lake, the complex is surrounded by a rampart.  It began to be built before Jonah Sysoevich, around 1633.  The design of the building was done by the Dutchman Rodenburg.  The shaft is clearly visible from a bird's eye view, as it has a star shape with 9 ends, which is traditional for all fortified European settlements.  Although it‚Äôs not clear why the rampart was built in this century, because there was no need to protect the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, such constructions were not built anywhere before Peter I.  In any case, the construction of ramparts and the Kremlin itself formed the basis for the regular development of the entire settlement.  A visit to the ramparts is included in the sightseeing of the Golden Ring (Rostov Veliky). </p><p>  To date, most of the fortification has been preserved as a foundation.  Only moats and ramparts remained almost untouched. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.playcast.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earthen shafts" class="if uuid-2446776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446776.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Ascension of the Lord or St. Isidore on the ramparts </h2><p>  This <span>landmark of Great Rostov is</span> one of the oldest, erected in 1566 on the site of a wooden church (1474). </p><p>  By the way, according to legend, Isidor Tverdoslovok came on foot from German lands to Rostov in the 15th century.  Arriving in the city, he converted to Orthodoxy and began to live in a swamp in a small hut.  His fame spread when he began to work miracles.  Isidore also became famous for asceticism.  At the place of the hut, where the holy fool lived, a wooden church was built, then a stone church. </p><p>  Another interesting story is connected with the church.  The stone structure was erected by Andrei Maly, who was executed by Ivan the Terrible, at the end of the work, as the former wooden church was much more erected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Externally, the structure resembles Moscow Posad churches, which were built in those days.  In the 19th century, a narthex, a bell tower and an aisle were added to the temple.  Like most religious buildings in Soviet times, this church was closed and a museum was opened in it.  Divine services resumed in 2002. </p><h2>  Epiphany Avraamiev Monastery </h2><p>  First mentioned in the annals of the XIII century.  It is believed that in ancient times on this place the idol of God Veles rose.  When the hermit Abraham appeared in this area, he began to pray intensely for the locals to adopt Christianity.  As a result, John the Theologian appeared before him and handed the hermit the rod with which he destroyed the pagan idol.  By the way, later, when Ivan the Terrible went on a campaign to Kazan, he took a rod from the monastery, thanks to which he won the battles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="svtihon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Epiphany Avraamiev Monastery" class="if uuid-2446827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446827.jpg"></div><h2>  Shopping arcade </h2><p>  Another attraction of Rostov the Great (photo below) is the shopping arcade.  Located at the northern part of the Kremlin wall.  Lined up gradually.  The oldest are near the wall (end of the 17th century).  After some time, the territory turned into an entire trading quarter.  Therefore, you can notice completely different in style rows.  Today this place is used for its intended purpose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifeisphoto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shopping arcade" class="if uuid-2446778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446778.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Savior on Bargain </h2><p>  Another one included in the list of tourist programs: ‚ÄúSights of Rostov the Great in one day‚Äù is the Church of the Savior of the Holy Face to the Bargain or the Ruzhnaya Church.  It was erected in 5 years, from 1685 to 1690.  It is assumed that there was no own parish, but merchants used it.  This church is part of the Kremlin complex. </p><p>  It is located on a high basement, the walls are artfully decorated.  The church does not have an iconostasis; everything is painted on the wall.  Although later, some craftsmen made salaries and it is practically not visible that these are fake icons, but just drawings on the wall. </p><p>  The bell tower appeared only in the XIX century.  The church itself is a five-domed church built on the donations of citizens on a wooden site that had previously been burned down.  In the 70s of the last century, they tried to restore the temple to its former appearance, because in Soviet times the church was badly damaged.  Many of the faces of the saints were painted over, the bell tower was dismantled, and the library was placed inside. </p><p>  Only in 2009, large-scale work was carried out and now divine services are held on a regular basis. </p><h2>  Spaso-Yakovlevsky Dimitriev Monastery </h2><p>  On the west side of the Kremlin (2 km) there is another unique attraction of Rostov the Great - a fortified monastery on the shores of Lake Nero.  It was founded in 1389, which, after being expelled from the episcopal department, settled here.  Although this man after death was counted as a saint. </p><p>  Saints Dmitry and Abraham of Rostov are buried in the complex.  The delighted eyes always stop at the sights of Rostov the Great (photo below), at the Zachatievsky Cathedral.  This is a five-domed structure, decorated externally by a patterne.  The interior is made in blue tones, as in the Kremlin, absolutely all the walls are painted.  The names of the masters are not preserved in history. </p><p>  On the territory of the monastery there are two more unique buildings: </p><ul><li>  Dmitrievsky Cathedral, dating from 1795-1801, having an unusual shape. </li><li>  Yakovlevskaya Church, also erected in the style of classicism, with a three-tier bell tower. </li></ul><p>  Against the background of all this traditional Russian beauty, the gates and the tower in a pseudo-Gothic style look unique. </p><p>  According to reviews, visitors to the monastery are quite friendly, they allow secular walks to tourists and visits to the observation deck, but for women without a headscarf on their heads, the road is closed.  However, handkerchiefs can be taken from the gatekeeper at the entrance. </p><p>  On the territory there is a chapel in which there is a source with holy water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rostovru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spaso-Yakovlevsky Dimitriev Monastery" class="if uuid-2446781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446781.jpg"></div><h2>  Kekin Grammar School </h2><p>  Description of the <span>sights of Rostov the</span> Great - Kekin Gymnasium - can be found in many tourist catalogs.  Although this is a fairly new structure, which opened the doors to gymnasium students only in 1907.  And the gymnasium received its name in honor of the patron, at whose expense it was erected.  Kekin made such a wide gesture for the city after the death of his son.  At that time, students received 8 classes of education.  The gymnasium had an in-depth study of mathematical sciences and languages.  Today it is one of the oldest educational institutions in the whole city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kekin Grammar School" class="if uuid-2446784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446784.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums of the city </h2><p>  Not only the architectural sights of Veliky Rostov is famous.  The city has many museums.  It is clear that the most important thing is the Kremlin.  Along Leninskaya Street, there is the Museum of Rostov Merchants, where you can learn a lot of interesting things about how merchants lived and see a magnificent collection of porcelain. </p><p>  Another museum equipped at the hotel is the Rostov Compound.  On the territory of the completely reconstructed peasant huts, Rostov fair and tavern.  There is a department with traditional lay homes.  These people inhabited these territories until the founding of the city. </p><p>  Another interesting exhibition called Russian Vertograd.  At its core, this is a museum of ancient junk, these are chests, samovars, irons and other household items of different times.  Also exhibited here are the works of the artist Mikhail Selishchev, who paints not only enamel, but also creates creations from glass, rope and wood, while being the founder of the complex. </p><h2>  Attractions for children </h2><p>  Rostov the Great can even strike a child‚Äôs imagination.  To do this, first of all, go to the Museum of the Frog Princess.  It is located in the hotel of the same name and is fully designed for children.  Here they will see their favorite fairy-tale characters and will be able to participate in theatrical performances. </p><p>  And on the square near the bus and train stations is "Shchuchy Dvor", where the play "By the pike command" is shown.  Along with the fairy tale story, children learn about the history of the city.  In walking distance is another interesting place "Lukova Sloboda."  No performances are shown here, but they conduct fascinating master classes.  The most popular course is weaving onion braids. </p><h2>  What else to see and what to bring from the trip </h2><p>  In addition to architectural attractions, the city of Rostov Veliky boasts the magnificent Nero Lake, which was formed in the preglacial period.  According to scientists, the reservoir has existed for more than 500 thousand years.  Even now you can go fishing here.  And outside the city limits, there are <span>recreation centers</span> on the banks where a lot of entertainment will be offered.  There are several islands on the lake, the largest and has the name Lesnoy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmystery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nero lake" class="if uuid-2446794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446794.jpg"></div><p>  A traditional souvenir from the city of Rostov Veliky is enamel (the technique of applying enamel on metal) and black-glazed ceramics.  A whole factory is engaged in metal painting, producing from small plates to whole canvases and jewelry.  By the way, the factory has a museum and a shop where you can buy unique products. </p><p>  And if you are a fan of non-traditional art, then be sure to purchase one of the works of Mikhail Selishchev. </p>
