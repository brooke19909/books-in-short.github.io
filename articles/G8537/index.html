    <p>  The only drawback the Russians consider the lack of an elevator, which is especially felt at the entrance and exit.  Nevertheless, many believe that in Mirenza 3 in Montenegro you can relax perfectly for a small cost. </p><p>  For example, in May, for seven nights in a double standard room with breakfast, alcohol-free and leaving Moscow for two, you will need to pay a little more than seventy thousand rubles.  At the same time, prices vary depending on the season and the availability of a flight operating charter flights. </p>
