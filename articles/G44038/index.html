Excursions to Mount Moses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the northern part of Egypt is one of the holy places for Jews and Christians - Sinai (the mountain of the prophet Moses).  This peak is revered by believers of most world faiths.  It is mentioned in the biblical story, according to which it was there that God gave Moses 10 commandments, talking to him from the burning bush (burning thorn bush). </p><h2>  The history of the shrine </h2><p>  Jewish culture has no knowledge of the exact position of the mountain.  The biblical Sinai was associated with Mount Har Karh, located in <span>the Negev desert.</span>  The remains of ancient shrines were discovered there.  The location of the shrine was lost during the reign of the kings.  This fact is the reason that the worship of the holy place among Muslims and Christians is in no way connected with the tradition of the Jews. </p>

    <p>  Christian hermits have traveled in the southern part of the peninsula since the beginning of the second century.  They tried to find the places mentioned in the Bible by the events of the Exodus.  Including the point where the holy Mount Sinai is located.  According to history, the first empress of Byzantium, Elena, was the first to visit these places.  She wanted to find the bush that, according to legend, flared up under Moses.  By her order, a chapel was erected here, which under the emperor Justinian was transformed into a monastery named after the Christian martyr St. Catherine.  This monastery is one of the oldest in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3750 steps stretch to the top of the mountain, which the monks of antiquity knocked out in the rocks.  Making a climb to the top, a person carries faith in a miracle and hope for the remission of sins.  The Camel Trail is a path for the weakened and the elderly, who can climb to the top by horseback.  Since ancient times, believers from around the world went on a pilgrimage to the Sinai.  Mount Moses and now does not remain one of the most important sites for pilgrims and tourists. </p><h2>  Description of the object of the tour </h2><p>  From the monastery to the top you can climb two paths that vary in length.  These paths merge into one almost at the very top.  The short trail is steeper and therefore more difficult to climb.  It is usually chosen by pilgrims and monks.  The path is about 3100 steps.  It is possible to overcome this path only in the daytime and only on foot.  The long trail is more gentle, it is possible to ride it on a camel.  Tourist groups often climb it.  There are tents along the way, in which there are places for recreation.  Hot drinks and traditional sweets are also available.  Chapels and temples on the mountain are not accessible.  Special permission and an accompanying person from the monastery are required.  The highest point is located at the level of 2285 meters. </p>

    <p>  The most favorable time for climbing is considered to be winter.  But it‚Äôs wiser to plan climbing in spring or fall.  However, in any case, you need to take into account cold nights and take warm clothes with you.  It can snow in the mountains.  Heavy clothing and cold will make climbing even harder.  Mount Sinai on the map is located closest to the resorts of Taba, Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Excursion from Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  The tour starts at 21:30, immediately after dinner.  Tourists take buses to the base of the mountain.  Detailed on-site instruction is provided.  The plan of the tour, the places of possible stops are described.  Each tourist is given a flashlight.  Experienced pilgrims take with them a spare in case of failure of the first.  A flashlight is an absolutely necessary thing to climb, the path has no lighting, in the dark the movement will be more difficult. </p>

    <p>  Around midnight, climbing to the Sinai begins.  The mountain is a difficult test, short stops for rest are made every kilometer of the way.  Tourist groups move along the route one after another.  If you are behind your group, join another.  Before dawn, the group rises to the top.  Upstairs they meet the sunrise, which symbolizes the appearance of God.  Tourists are given the tablets of stone on which the Commandments are applied, absolution takes place.  After a short rest, the group advances on the return trip.  Do not think that the descent from the mountain is easier.  Walking long and hard.  At the foot there is an opportunity to sit in a cafe, have breakfast.  But it is better to take <span>packed lunch</span> from the hotel. </p><h2>  Visit to the monastery of St. Catherine </h2><p>  After descending from the mountain, as well as for those who could not climb, an excursion to the monastery of St. Catherine is organized.  Before him, a group is taken by bus.  In the monastery you will see ancient icons, relics of St. Catherine.  The atmosphere of the place allows you to feel peace and tranquility.  The monastery is located at an altitude of 1570 meters.  It is surrounded by Mount Safsaf, Mount Moses (Sinai), Mount Catherine.  Then you will be shown Burning Kupina.  In his flame God first appeared to Moses.  The next item in the tour program of the monastery is the Well of Moses.  The Bible mentions the event according to which the <span>prophet Moses</span> met 7 girls, daughters of the Midian priest Raguel, who drank water from the sheep.  The well continues to this day to supply water to the monastery. </p>

    <p>  - Clothing and shoes should be comfortable and warm.  It is especially worthwhile to approach the choice of shoes, since the road is stony and rather slippery. </p><p>  - To visit the temple, you must have the appropriate outfits.  Men and women should have clothing covering their legs and arms. </p><p>  - If you chose winter for climbing, then a hat, gloves and a scarf will not be superfluous. </p><p>  - Take breakfast and a supply of drinking water at the hotel. </p><p>  - Be sure to bring a camera with you.  Your main souvenir, which will be presented by Mount Sinai - photo. </p><p>  - Have with you a small amount of money that you can spend on tea, coffee, and the purchase of souvenirs.  Also, money will be needed for tickets to museums and tips for the guide. </p><p>  - If you plan to climb a camel, it is better to have a few tens of dollars with you. </p><h2>  Excursion from Taba </h2><p>  There are no special differences in the tour program.  You will also be taken to the foot of the mountain by bus.  The only difference is travel time.  Moving from Taba to Mount Sinai will last three hours longer.  The cost of the tour does not differ from Sharm El Sheikh. </p><h2>  Excursion from Hurghada </h2><p>  Due to the high cost of transfer to the place, an excursion is not offered.  You can make an individual trip, having agreed with the representative of the excursion company. </p><h2>  Some subtleties to keep in mind </h2><p>  It is important to understand that the tour is not entertaining in nature.  This is one of the most difficult programs.  True, the specifics of the tour are such that it is precisely those who seek healing who want to get to the shrine.  Usually these are elderly, weak, sick people, small children.  To facilitate the journey, the local Bedouins will offer them a camel rental (cost about $ 15). </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the monastery there is an opportunity to put a candle for free.  Donations can also be made.  In the shop near the church you can buy rings and medallions with the symbols of the monastery, souvenirs.  It is not recommended to purchase jewelry made of precious metals.  There is a big risk that you will be deceived and sold by a fake. </p><p>  Those who went on such a route as Mount Sinai (in Egypt), if desired, can buy a video for memory from the guide.  A recorded disc will be brought to your hotel. </p><p>  When spending your holidays in Egypt, plan to visit a tourist attraction like Mount Sinai.  Photos taken during dawn on the top will give you pleasure for a long time. </p>
