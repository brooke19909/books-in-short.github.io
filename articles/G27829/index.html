Kharkov can be proud!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For most of our fellow citizens, charity is either an attempt to evade taxes, or PR in anticipation of an early election, or the desire to cash in on tenders of expensive and rare medicines.  Even large elementary school students do not believe in large-scale charity (kindergarteners are still quite naive, but they also believe in Santa Claus).  However, there is evidence that selfless endeavors exist.  One of them may be the Feldman Ecopark.  Kharkov is not in vain proud of both its citizen and the result of its activities.  It is difficult to even imagine a more comfortable, equipped, friendly and ‚Äúlow-cost‚Äù place for family vacations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecopark Feldman Kharkiv" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/464987.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who is he, a modern hero? </h2><p>  The organizer and the ‚Äúsupplier‚Äù, thanks to whom he got the opportunity to implement the Feldman Ecopark (Kharkov), whose name was given to the unique object, is itself a unique person.  To begin with, his first professions were the driver and the engineer of the boiler room - almost the most outsider of all possible, except for the janitor and watchman.  And now, Alexander Feldman is one of <span>the richest people in Ukraine,</span> having at the same time an outstanding business.  He is also characterized by an active political and social position.  In particular, Feldman is a Jewish political leader in Ukraine;  protects the <span>cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãof</span> different nationalities;  founded an international center designed not only to protect human rights, but also to fight xenophobia, radicalism in politics, anti-Semitism and extremism.  For two consecutive years - in 2008 and 2009 - he was in third place for philanthropists in Ukraine, and in 10 - he became the best in the category of ‚ÄúHelp to the Unprotected‚Äù.  He organized the International charity fund ‚ÄúAlexander Feldman‚Äôs Fund‚Äù, which grew out of the AVEC Fund, and financed the project that became known as the Feldman Ecopark (Kharkov).  Many people think that this miracle is located right in the city.  However, it is not.  The family recreation area has a slightly different address.  The Feldman Ecopark (Kharkov) is located five kilometers from the regional center, in the village with the name "Forest", along Kievsky highway, 12. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feldman Ecopark Kharkiv how to get there" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/464986.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why and for whom was the park created? </h2><p>  The primary task is to create an environment in which all its visitors will begin to feel themselves with the world as a whole, in which there is harmony, there is no aggressiveness, but there is a willingness to understand, accept and help.  More practical tasks follow from this: the Feldman Ecopark (Kharkov) is ready to assist children with special needs, help save the flora and fauna of the region, and contribute to the development of environmental education and science in the country.  A longer time is the infusion of the Kharkov region into environmental protection measures of an international level. </p><h2>  A zoo that is bigger than a zoo </h2><p>  The initial emphasis in creating this zone was on animals.  However, unlike most zoos, where animals cannot be looked at without tears, here the inhabitants of the cells feel quite comfortable.  First of all, they are allocated quite spacious enclosures, and the caretakers keep them in perfect cleanliness.  At the same time, it is strictly forbidden to feed animals (read - throwing scraps of them through the rods in them).  This is followed by polite and vigilant employees, who are famous for the Feldman Ecopark (Kharkov).  The photo shows the results of the efforts well - the animals are well-groomed, and the territory is clean.  However, communication with non-dangerous animals is very welcome: they can be stroked and fed at the contact area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park - but only with what the employees offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecopark Feldman Kharkiv photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/464985.jpg" width="600"></div>

A lot of forged elements organically fit into the overall interior.  Quiet ponds where turtles swim leisurely attract attention.  For those who are tired, the Feldman Ecopark (Kharkov) has equipped arbors, moreover, they are also harmoniously integrated into the landscape and are located in convenient and cozy corners.  Active visitors are offered pony rides, trampolines and rides - for free, as well as the entrance to the ecopark. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Address Ecopark Feldman Kharkiv" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/464983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Future plans </h2><p>  It is assumed that the eco-zone will not be limited to those functions that are currently performed.  They are going to build a rehabilitation center aimed at restoring those who have mental disorders and impaired motor functions, including patients with cerebral palsy.  It is supposed to use the whole range of effects: from traditional massages, physiotherapy and balneotherapy to innovative bobat, animal and voit therapy, without missing out on the possibilities of auxiliary techniques (music, aesthetic therapy and the impact of art technologies). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecopark Feldman Kharkiv arbors" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/464982.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <h2>  Additional voluntary workloads </h2><p>  Probably, this direction is not a priority, but Feldman‚Äôs Ecopark took over it.  Kharkov is generally one of the first cities in Ukraine to take part in this program.  There is an animal assistance point right in the recreation area.  Its purpose was the salvation of wild animals, faced with the manifestations of civilization.  Any person, for example, picking up or seeing a wounded animal, can inform the service that will provide veterinary help or help find a new shelter for the victim. </p><h2>  Routes and Tips </h2><p>  It remains to describe the ways in which you can get to the Feldman-Ecopark (Kharkov).  How to get to it depends on what kind of transport you use.  If public - from the metro with the name "Heroes of Labor" goes minibus number 1656 to the stop "Dalnoboy".  Even easier, more convenient and free - from the Lesopark bus station.  Starting at half past nine in the morning the bus runs straight to the place every hour. </p><p>  The automobile route is also popular: many just get to the Feldman-Ecopark (Kharkov).  How to get on your wheels?  Drive in the direction of Dergachevo to the TatNeft gas station;  as you saw her, turn right in front of her and almost immediately run into a signboard with the name.  If the flow of cars is intense, you will have to drive a little further, but do not ‚Äúslip through‚Äù by now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecopark Feldman Kharkiv" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/464984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who have already felt the unity with the Feldman Ecopark advise to go there by 10. After one o'clock in the afternoon, neither parking, nor taking a quiet walk, nor drinking a seagull - there are a lot of people.  Have a nice rest and vivid impressions! </p>
