For a long time, various farming systems have been used.  In Russia, a plowman, who is also called a walker after a plow, an ancient field worker or a plowman, used subsection, fallow and three-field. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plowman in Russia" class="if uuid-2605863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/2605863.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of agriculture in Ancient Russia </h2><p>  In the forest zones, a subsection was widespread, according to which a plot of forest was cleared and in its place the soil was cultivated for several years in a row.  This period was approximately two to three years, until the soil was completely depleted.  Then this land was no longer used for a sufficiently long time, up to forty years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.readmoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who is a plowman in ancient Russia" class="if uuid-2605905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/2605905.jpg"></div><p>  Fallow was considered a more intensive <span>system of agriculture</span> .  Allocate forest fallow and steppe.  After deforestation, a plowman in Ancient Russia cultivated arable land for three to four years, followed by a break of ten to twelve years.  Field work lasted longer in the steppes, and less land rest.  While the arable land was resting, it was used as a pasture for livestock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another type of agriculture, which subsequently became the most preferred, is the triple field.  According to this system, alternating crops of different crops - spring and winter.  For a year, one of the fields was left under steam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="szkola.szaflary.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plowman in ancient Russia" class="if uuid-2605993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/2605993.jpg"></div><h2>  In Russia - a plowman, and in folk poetry - a peasant </h2><p>  The values ‚Äã‚Äãwere different.  For the word "plowman" in Russia, you can choose a lot of synonyms, which is successfully used by the compilers of crosswords.  This is both yell, and a farmer, and even a plow.  And if he does not just plow the land, but is also a warrior and owns a measured share of the land, then this free community member was called stink. </p><p>  Izornik was a small tenant who paid a certain part of the crop in the form of a rent to the landowner.  Oratai - the so-called digger, farmer, peasant, plowman, army man and arable farmer.  A plowman is one who went after a plow, a plowman, he was also called a hard worker or a hard worker. </p><p>  In Slavic mythology, the plowman was a real cultural hero, who, in accordance with a widespread folklore plot, managed to expel primitive giants from the land, embodying the wild, unbridled forces of mother nature.  And the first plowman is considered Adam, the ancestor of the entire human race. </p>
