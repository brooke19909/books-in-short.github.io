So, all the best ideas about modern housing are embodied in one project - LCD "Marine Facade".  The business class project attracts attention primarily due to the prestige of the area in which it is being built, as well as the impeccable reputation of the developer, clearly observing all the standards, as well as the construction time.  Our task is to evaluate the project from all sides, revealing not only the advantages, but also the disadvantages, which the developer of the Marine Facade residential complex is silent about.  Responses of residents - an excellent information base.  They will provide the necessary objectivity. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  LCD "Marine Fa√ßade" (St. Petersburg) - a project in which the developer tried to provide for everything that is necessary for a comfortable life in a modern metropolis.  In fact, the task is not an easy one, but thanks to professionalism and many years of experience in this field, the impossible has been achieved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifedeluxe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD marine facade St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-3149486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149486.jpg"></div><p>  According to the project, the complex is represented by six buildings.  Buildings of various configurations and variable storeys (from 7 to 15 floors) are united by a single concept.  All of them are built using monolithic-brick technology, providing unsurpassed strength, durability, excellent heat and sound insulation properties, as well as excellent aesthetic characteristics.  High-speed modern and almost noiseless elevators are installed in all cases of the Marine Facade residential complex; underground parking is provided that isolates the courtyards from traffic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of the Marine Facade residential complex is the fairly well-known Etalon company in St. Petersburg.  The project is being implemented with financial support from the Federal Government and the Administration of St. Petersburg; it has strategic importance for the city.  In the prescribed manner, the layout of the territory and apartments that meet all the requirements is approved. </p><p>  If you visit the forums dedicated to the project, you can find enough positive reviews.  Many are attracted by state control, which ensures the quality of construction and compliance with all agreed deadlines.  The prosecutor's office about the Marine Facade residential complex - this is exactly the kind of request that can be found on the forums.  It is associated with state financing of the project and its construction in the coastal zone.  You need not worry: all legal subtleties are observed, the history of the project is clean and impeccable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Marine facade" class="if uuid-3149483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149483.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The prestigious Vasileostrovsky district of St. Petersburg, the historical place of the northern capital, was chosen for the construction of the Marine Facade residential complex (St. Petersburg).  The unique location on the one hand gives residents a stunning view of the pride of the city - the Gulf of Finland, and on the other - the Peter and Paul Fortress and St. Isaac's Cathedral. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, the developer managed the impossible - to isolate the complex from the noise coming from the busy streets of the northern capital.  If you are looking for an apartment in the historical center of the city, hoping to purchase housing that meets modern requirements, LCD ‚ÄúMarine Fa√ßade‚Äù should definitely be on the list of suitable options. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The residential complex "Marine Facade" provides excellent transport accessibility to all its residents.  Nearby is the WHSD, connecting various parts of the city and allowing traffic to reach any point without traffic jams.  Even if your family does not have a personal car, you can use public transport: within walking distance are bus stops and the Primorskaya metro station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Marine facade" class="if uuid-3149509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149509.jpg"></div><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  House territory is landscaped and landscaped.  There are walking areas, benches, gazebos, equipped playgrounds and sports grounds.  There is a fairly spacious parking lot for guests. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Buying an apartment in the center of a metropolis, it is difficult to count on fresh mountain air.  Nevertheless, the Marine Facade residential complex offers good conditions, an environmentally friendly environment, primarily due to its proximity to the Gulf of Finland and the improvement of the territory adjacent to the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer made a lot of efforts in order to provide comfort to every resident.  Within walking distance from new buildings are all the necessary objects of social infrastructure: kindergartens, schools, clinics.  This diversity is again provided with a favorable location.  The first floors of residential buildings are reserved for the organization of the service sector: today there are bank branches, laundries, cafes, beauty salons, consumer goods stores and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vipflat.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd marine facade reviews" class="if uuid-3149493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149493.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  The usable area of ‚Äã‚Äãall six buildings is 300,000 square meters.  They managed to place 2,000 apartments of various layouts, among which everyone will find an option to their liking.  Even a one-room apartment in the LCD is represented by 54 square meters, guaranteeing spaciousness and comfort.  Customers are offered one, two, three, four and even five and six-room options to choose from. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vipflat.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marine facade residential complex" class="if uuid-3149496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149496.jpg"></div><p>  Ceiling height - 2.75 m, which allows you to translate into reality any design idea, the balcony and loggias are glazed.  As for the layouts, they impress primarily with their variety.  The project was based on the European layouts so popular today, which are characterized by spacious kitchens combined with a living area, as well as isolated bedrooms and the presence of an additional bathroom. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  By default, all apartments in the complex are rented out with a rough finish, that is, they are completely ready for subsequent cosmetic repairs.  Buyers note that the work was carried out so qualitatively that it allowed to save on materials and the cost of the work of visiting teams.  The rooms are equipped with high-quality double-glazed windows of European manufacture, modern flat heating radiators equipped with temperature controllers, high-quality metal entrance doors, interior doors made of solid wood, electrical wiring is carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prosecutor's Office about the marine facade" class="if uuid-3149499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149499.jpg"></div><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  At the moment, all six buildings have been commissioned and are already fully populated.  This is what allows us to draw the first conclusions about how successful the project turned out to be.  I must admit that the level of construction is impressive: even after shrinkage, no defects were found, which is now a rarity. </p><h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  Modern residents of the metropolis pay great attention to the ecology of the area in which they live.  The project of the LCD Marine Facade was no exception.  So, the first residents emphasize that the proximity to the Gulf of Finland provides everyone with clean fresh air: the air here does not stagnate, there is no smog, it is easy to breathe.  Of course, the developer should take care of large-scale landscaping in order to improve this indicator. </p><p>  According to residents, the project can hardly be called unique, even recognizable: the architecture is quite simple, even primitive.  Nevertheless, this affected the cost per square meter of area, as did the location - apartments here are much more expensive than in other areas of the northern capital.  The project was put into operation, but there are still piles of construction waste on the territory, spoiling the appearance of new buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd marine facade" class="if uuid-3149503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3149503.jpg"></div><p>  The developer positioned the complex as a "city in a city", which is objectively quite far away.  To date, it has been possible to isolate the territory of new buildings, equip it with a security and access system and round-the-clock video surveillance.  But residents still have to use the infrastructure of the district, which is not always convenient and justified.  In the short term, the development of our own infrastructure, which will increase the level of comfort. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Residential complex "Marine facade" (St. Petersburg) - a project that attracts a lot of attention.  It is definitely worthy of it, since it stands out from the background of all new buildings in the city, primarily due to its unique location.  It was not easy to realize the concept of "city in a city" on such a limited and already populated territory of the historical center.  A stunning view from the windows, bright and spacious apartments, the impeccable quality of their execution - that is what all residents received.  At the moment, all square meters have been commissioned, but you still have the opportunity to get your dream home, paying attention to secondary options with fine finish and furniture. </p><p>  In any case, be sure to visit the territory of the complex in order to get to know it better, to personally evaluate all the advantages, possibly the disadvantages for you personally.  Remember that at the moment the cost of square meters here remains affordable, which cannot be exactly said in a few years, when the complex will be overgrown with objects of its own infrastructure. </p>
