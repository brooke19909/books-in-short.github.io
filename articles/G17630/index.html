    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Petrich is 23 kilometers from the famous resort of Sandanski.  Almost 190 kilometers are separated by Petrich and Sofia.  This Bulgarian city is located very close to the border point with Macedonia - between them 20 km.  But Petrich separates 13 kilometers from the border with Greece. </p><p>  Petrich field is the most fertile territory of the country.  A variety of vegetables and fruits grow here, in these places lemons and kiwi are grown. </p><h2>  Petrich (Bulgaria): photo and history of the city </h2><p>  The results of archaeological excavations say that Thracian settlements used to be in these places.  The first settlements on the territory of the present city appeared in the X-XI centuries, and after another two or three centuries a real regional center appeared here.  The ancient city of Heraclea Sintica is connected with the city of Petrich in Bulgaria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Petrich became part of the Bulgarian state during the reign of Prince Boris the First.  The city played an important defensive role in the wars of Tsar Samuel with the Byzantines.  The city managed to preserve its incredible Bulgarian character even in difficult times - during the Ottoman rule.  It is important to note that 90% of the population in the 16th century were Christians. </p>

    <p>  When the period began, called by scientists as the period of the national Bulgarian Renaissance, Petrich became the most important center of crafts and trade.  In the late 60s of the XIX century, the first Orthodox church dedicated to St. Nicholas appeared here.  At that time, the first Bulgarian school was opened in the city.  The city took an active part in the national liberation war.  The city was liberated from Turkish power during the Balkan War. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The city of Petrich in Bulgaria is not only fertile land, but also a large number of attractions.  Some of them are located within the city, some - outside.  We offer to consider the most interesting places! </p><h2>  Samuel Fortress </h2><p>  One of the most visited Petrich sights in Bulgaria is Samuel Fortress.  It is located 16 kilometers from the city.  The story goes: this fortress was built by the Bulgarian king Samuel, who wanted to repel the Byzantine invasion.  In 1014, the Bulgarian army was defeated: the troops of Basil II defeated.  Byzantine troops captured about fourteen thousand soldiers.  The emperor gave a truly monstrous order: all the captives were blinded.  For one hundred soldiers, there was only one person who had one eye left - so that he could take his co-workers home.  According to legend, King Samuel simply could not bear what he saw and died on the spot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Today, Samuilova Fortress is a park museum, included in the list of Hundred National Tourist Attractions of Bulgaria.  The museum includes 13 small dugouts, one large dugout and the ruins of the fortress observation tower.  Above the ruins, by the way, there is a panoramic platform with a memorial and a hall for exhibits. </p><h2>  Vanga House </h2><p>  What sights of the country do everyone know?  Of course, about Vanga‚Äôs house located in such a place as Petrich (Bulgaria).  Do not confuse Vanga's house with the place where she received visitors.  The latter is located seven kilometers from the city, but the house is located in the very center of Petrich!  Now it houses a museum.  Visitors note - here you can see personal items, photos and gifts from people whom the woman helped.  There are not many rooms in this pretty blue house.  There is a kitchen on the ground floor, and a prayer room is also located here.  The creators of the museum have preserved tapestries and icons in the Vanga chapel. </p><p>  True, Wang spent the last year of her life not far from Petrich.  In the small village of Rupite, she received people and rested.  Today, when this legendary woman is no longer there, the flow of tourists to these places does not stop: they strive here to get a boost of energy. </p>

    <p>  Vanga died in 1994, but had previously managed to build a church of St. Petka in the village, which, incidentally, contains a portrait of the soothsayer, made in the form of an icon.  Wang is buried next to this temple.  Tourists say that if you managed to visit Petrich in Bulgaria, it‚Äôs worth a trip to the village of Rupite. </p><h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  Those who have come to Rupita should pay attention to the sources of mineral water.  A sign with the inscription that says "Swimming is prohibited" is hardly needed here: the fact is that it is impossible to lower even a hand into the source - the water temperature is 75 degrees!  Therefore, it is not surprising that a curtain of steam is constantly standing over mineral springs. </p><p>  Researchers say: the main reason for the emergence of sources here is the ancient volcanic processes that still occur underground.  The village itself (and with it the springs) are located on a volcanic plateau, formerly a crater.  Due to the high temperature, heat-loving birds nest in these places, exotic plants grow. </p><h2>  City History Museum </h2><p>  Speaking about the sights of the city of Petrich in Bulgaria, one cannot but say about this museum.  Huge expositions, including about 18 thousand exhibits, will be transferred to the past and tell about the brave and courageous Bulgarians.  The museum, located in the city center, was originally a small museum collection, but four decades after its founding - in 2006 - it was transformed into the History Museum by decision of the municipal council. </p>

    <p>  Among the most interesting exhibits, visitors to the museum note a magnificent collection of theatrical masks of the 2nd century, tombstones dating from the third century BC, the decree of the emperor Galerius from 308.  It is advised to pay attention to the coins of Philip the Second and Alexander the Third. </p><h2>  Churches </h2><p>  In their reviews, tourists say: the city of Petrich (Bulgaria) is famous for its churches and temples.  In 1868, the church of St. Nicholas appeared in the city.  They erected it near the old cemetery.  Almost all the inhabitants of the city worked at a grand construction site.  They donated funds for the construction.  In 1924, a wooden belfry was added on the western side, while the women's chamber was enlarged.  In 1940, a new bell tower was erected here - more than the old one.  In 1955, the Church of St. Nicholas was seriously damaged during the fire, but it was repaired. </p><p>  The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin was erected in Petrich in 1857.  Initially, it was Greek, with it a Greek school worked.  In 1881, services began to be conducted in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Greek and Bulgarian.  In 1987, this temple was almost completely destroyed by fire: the iconostasis, frescoes, and the roof burned out.  Only external murals have been preserved.  Subsequently, the temple was overhauled. </p>
