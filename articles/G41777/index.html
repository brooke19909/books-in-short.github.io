As the name implies, the model is distinguished by the support of the simultaneous operation of two SIM cards, as well as by the presence of an LTE module, which allows the exchange of information at high speed in the fourth generation cellular network.  I remember that the predecessor <span>Sony Xperia E4G</span> LTE Dual (and it was a model, respectively, E3) justified the money that it cost.  The thing is that it combined a good display, as well as the ability to work on a fourth-generation mobile network.  With all this, the device cost less than ten thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  In general, Sony has always been famous for producing good, quality products.  Needless to say, the smartphones of the company are striking in their pleasant design, the quality with which they are assembled, smoothness and stability of work.  Well, and as a bonus - quite a good piece of hardware.  We can say that such production has already become a kind of trend for the company.  But will the subject of our today's review continue to honor traditions - the Sony Xperia <span>E4G Dual</span> smartphone <span>?</span>  This we will try to find out. </p>

    <h2>  Brief comparison </h2><p>  We can safely take the characteristics of two devices - Sony Xperia E4G Dual, reviews about which you can find at the end of the article, as well as E3.  After that, it remains only to combine them.  It will be easy to notice that the Xperia E4 is an actual and logical continuation of the previous model.  The only difference is that the device is adapted to the standards of this year.  This is manifested in a changed diagonal of the screen, increased resolution, a larger preset amount of short-term memory.  It turns out that one simple conclusion comes to mind: the budget segment of mobile devices also does not stand still, but continues to develop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Currently, Sony's smartphones are beginning to gradually change their appearance.  Previously, these were the most ‚Äúreal bricks‚Äù, as the Internet audience dubbed them (and not only).  Now they are devices that are streamlined.  Now these are smooth devices.  In the manufacture of smartphones, a technology called OmniBalance is used.  For the first time, changes began back in the Z product line. Over time, other devices of the company began to change.  And here it is unambiguous to say whether this is good, somehow it does not work out.  It is enough to compare any product from the Z line with the subject of our review today to see that the appearance has been greatly simplified. </p>

    <h2>  Dimensions and dimensions </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia E4G Dual E2033 smartphone, as mentioned earlier, has changed slightly compared to its predecessor.  This was manifested in an increase in the diagonal of the screen.  However, at the same time, the height of the hull was left the same as it was at E3.  What did the engineers do to make this happen?  They had to reduce the frames along the perimeter of the display.  It is interesting that this affected not only the sides, but also the upper end with the lower.  Nevertheless, it is noticeable that the width has become a little larger.  In any case, using the device with one hand is still possible.  And it will not cause any discomfort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The thickness of the device has also changed.  Now it is not 8.5, but as much as 10.5 millimeters.  In fact, the smartphone is quite chubby.  It is often called "pot-bellied."  But we see that there is every reason for this.  The mass of the device remained at the same level as the predecessor Sony Xperia E4G Dual, an overview of which is presented in this article.  Weight is about 144 grams. </p><h2>  Controls  Right side </h2><p>  On this side is the power button of the smartphone.  It allows you to turn the device on and off, as well as lock it or reboot.  Below this element is a volume rocker.  With its help, you can adjust the volume of the device or change its sound mode. </p>

    <h2>  Top end </h2><p>  There is an ordinary connector for connecting a wired stereo headset or <span>computer headphones</span> to a mobile phone <span>.</span>  This is nothing but a 3.5 millimeter standard port. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  There is nothing particularly interesting here.  There is only a MicroUSB standard connector designed to synchronize with a personal computer or laptop. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  One of the most successful variations was the smartphone Sony Xperia E4G Dual Black.  This refers to luck in terms of coloring.  Which, by the way, is confirmed by the official sales data of the company.  So, let's talk about the back panel.  It has a camera lens with a resolution of five megapixels.  Nearby, there is an LED flash for night photography or photography in low light conditions.  There is also an external sound speaker. </p><p>  The cover is made of frosted plastic.  It is rough to the touch.  But such a solution can be called successful, because in the process of using the phone, the panel will get dirty at least intensively.  With all this, there is another significant advantage: even from wet hands, the device does not strive to jump so much. </p><p>  However, plastic may seem tough enough.  Let's not forget that the cover of the Sony Xperia E4G Dual E2033 Black can be removed, as well as the back panel of the device in a different color scheme.  However, the choice of colors is very, very limited.  On the territory of the Russian Federation, there are only two classic designs of the device: black and white.  Other variations do not exist. </p><p>  So, if we remove the back cover from the device, we will find two slots there that are designed to be inserted into the smartphone SIM cards processed according to the MicroSIM standard.  There is also a slot for an external microSD drive.  In order to replace the battery if necessary, the device will have to be disassembled.  Direct access to the battery is not provided, and this can be called, although not too big, but still a significant drawback. </p>

    <h2>  Brief Specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone works in third and fourth generation cellular networks.  Actually, due to them (as well as using EDGE and GPRS technologies), access to the international network is possible.  At the same time, a modem is built into the phone, which will allow distributing Wi-Fi to other devices.  Other subscribers having smartphones, tablets, laptops will be able to connect to the newly created access point.  If a network card with a Wi-Fi module is built into the computer, then it can also join the AP. </p><p>  By the way, since we are talking about wireless technologies.  The subject of our review works in the ranges of Wi-Fi standard 802.11.  To transfer files from your phone to another device, you can use the ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù function version 4.1.  If you regularly use e-mail, you will be glad to have a built-in E-mail client with the appropriate software.  To synchronize with a personal computer or laptop, you will need to use a port and a MicroUSB standard cable - USB 2.0. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The matrix of the screen is made using IPS technology.  This means that the screen has good viewing angles.  In the sun, the display looks good, there is a good margin of brightness, designed just for such situations, so as not to burn out the picture and fonts in natural light.  Otherwise, it should be noted that due to the use of IPS technology, the image will be smoothed, and the load on the eyes of the owner will be reduced to a minimum value.  That, by the way, allows you to read comfortably even in a dark environment without serious damage to eyesight. </p><p>  The diagonal of the screen in this case is 4.7 inches, the resolution is 960 x 540 pixels.  With color rendering, everything is fine, the display displays up to sixteen million different colors and their shades.  The touch screen is a capacitive type.  Several touches of the screen can be processed at the same time, thanks to the presence of a function called ‚Äúmulti-touch‚Äù.  It provides comfortable scaling in just two quick tapas. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  So, what is the verdict made by Sony Xperia E4G LTE dual buyers?  Many phone owners noticed that, compared with its predecessor, the front camera module became better, the screen diagonal increased, there was more RAM, which cannot but affect the smooth operation of the operating system. </p><p>  Nevertheless, buyers noted shortcomings.  Significant differences in performance can not be called.  The battery life remained at the same level, and in comparison with its predecessor, the screen brightness decreased.  A significant disadvantage is the lack of oleophobic coating on the smartphone.  Well, and so, perhaps, nothing more to be said. </p><p>  The only thing that can motivate a potential buyer to purchase this particular model, and not E3, is the simultaneous presence of two SIM cards and the ability to work with them in fourth-generation cellular networks. </p>
