This is a modern state where tourism is developed with the popular all-inclusive system, oriental bazaars, mosques and beautiful sea resorts.  But everything is not so simple.  After all, Turkey is a country with an amazing history, many ancient monuments have been preserved on its territory.  One of the most interesting is the ancient ancient city of Side, located on the Mediterranean coast. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The city reached its heyday even during the existence of the Roman Empire.  It was here that seagoing ships were built, slave trade was established.  The remains of magnificent temples, fountains and squares are still preserved, because the Romans welcomed luxury in everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="side midnight sun hotel" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/528718.jpg" width="398"></div>  And the famous ancient theater, preserved to this day, amazes tourists with its gigantic size.  Vacationers may think that there is not enough entertainment.  But in fact, any construction in this part of Turkey is prohibited, because Side is a protected area and serves as an antique open-air museum.  The ancient city ceased to exist after the <span>fall of the Roman Empire</span> and was looted, but archaeological excavations here are still ongoing.

    <p>  The beach is sandy.  The entrance to the sea is flat and gentle, this is sure to be appreciated by people resting with children.  For additional water activities on the beach (diving, windsurfing, bananasailing) you need to pay separately.  However, many tourists just want to go to the beach, swim and sunbathe, without extreme sports.  Here, everyone decides for himself.  By the way, the beach is free, but only until 18.00.  Then the admission fee is $ 2. </p><h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><p>  Tourists who stayed at the Midnight Sun Hotel 3 (Side) will be interested in visiting the ruins of the old city of antiquity, which are two kilometers from the hotel.

    <h2>  Midnight Sun Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  We definitely advise you to visit the sauna, hammam and spa center, because real professionals and masters of their craft work here!  Services are offered at an additional cost, but they are worth it.  The rooms are quite decent, but sometimes you can run into a problem in the form of leaking plumbing.  Air conditioning works, decent furniture. </p><p>  Those who rested in Side, Midnight Sun Hotel, are well aware that the rest here is not diverse.  If possible, we advise you to purchase additional excursions from tour operators or at a local tour desk.  There are many interesting sights, and you should pay maximum attention to their visits, and the hotel has normal conditions for living, there is a clear food schedule. </p><p>  Repair was completed in the current (2014) year and some work was carried out at the beginning of the season.  Of course, many tourists were unhappy with this, comments were made.  We hope that in the future the administration will take into account the wishes and will plan the work schedule clearly. </p>
