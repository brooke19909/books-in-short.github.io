    <h2>  Private guest houses, budget option </h2><p>  There are a lot of such people around the city.  This is the well-known guest house "Julia", as well as many others, who, without having their own big name, are always happy to receive guests.  The usual set of services is a furnished room, a kitchen for cooking, or full board if you agree to the food prepared by the hostess.  The cost is very attractive, for one person you will give from 200 to 400 rubles per day.  There is an option to rent a bed, this is the most budgetary, but also the least comfortable option.
