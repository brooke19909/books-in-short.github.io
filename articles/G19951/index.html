Now these scientists are called the founders of biological sciences.  Let us recall who were the domestic biologists (and we briefly describe their discoveries), who influenced the development of biology as a science and laid the foundation for its new directions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="biologists and their discoveries" class="if uuid-1185953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31722/1185953.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Vavilov N.I.  (1887-1943) </h2><p>  Our biologists and their discoveries are world famous.  Among the most famous are Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, a Soviet botanist, geographer, breeder, and geneticist.  Born into a merchant family, educated at an agricultural institute.  For twenty years he led scientific expeditions studying the plant world.  He traveled almost the entire globe, with the exception of Australia and Antarctica.  Collected a unique collection of seeds of various plants. </p><p>  During his expeditions, the scientist identified foci of the emergence of cultivated plants.  He suggested that there are some centers of their origin.  He made a huge contribution to the study of plant immunity and revealed the <span>law of homologous series,</span> which made it possible to establish patterns in the evolution of the plant world.  In 1940, a nerd was arrested on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.  He died in prison, rehabilitated posthumously. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="domestic biologists and their discoveries" class="if uuid-1189217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28188/1189217.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Kovalevsky A.O.  (1840-1901) </h2><p>  Among the discoverers, a worthy place is occupied by domestic biologists.  And their discoveries influenced the development of world science.  Among the world-famous invertebrate researchers are Alexander Onufrievich Kovalevsky, an embryologist and biologist.  He was educated at St. Petersburg University.  He studied marine animals, undertook expeditions to the Red, Caspian, Mediterranean and Adriatic seas.  He created the Sevastopol Marine Biostation and for a long time was its director.  He made a huge contribution to the aquarium industry. </p><p>  Alexander Onufrievich studied embryology and physiology of invertebrates.  He was a supporter of Darwinism and studied the mechanisms of evolution.  Conducted research in the field of physiology, anatomy and histology of invertebrates.  He became one of the creators of evolutionary embryology and histology. </p><h2>  Mechnikov I.I.  (1845-1916) </h2><p>  Our biologists and their discoveries have been appreciated in the world.  Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov in 1908 became a laureate of the Nobel Prize in the field of physiology and medicine.  Mechnikov was born in the family of an officer; he was educated at Kharkov University.  He discovered intracellular digestion, cellular immunity, and proved using embryology methods the common origin of vertebrates and invertebrates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He worked on issues of evolutionary and comparative embryology and, together with Kovalevsky, became the founder of this scientific direction.  The works of Mechnikov were of great importance in the fight against infectious diseases, typhoid, tuberculosis, and cholera.  The scientist was occupied with the aging process.  He believed that premature death caused poisoning by microbial poisons and promoted hygienic methods of control, assigned a large role to the restoration of intestinal microflora using fermented milk products.  The scientist created the Russian school of immunology, microbiology, pathology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="famous biologists and their discoveries" class="if uuid-1185978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31722/1185978.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Pavlov I.P.  (1849-1936) </h2><p>  What contribution did domestic biologists and their discoveries make to the study of higher nervous activity?  The first Russian Nobel laureate in medicine was Pavlov Ivan Petrovich for his work on the physiology of digestion.  The great Russian biologist and physiologist became the creator of the science of higher nervous activity.  He introduced the concept of unconditioned and conditioned reflexes. </p><p>  The scientist came from a family of clergymen and he himself graduated from the Ryazan Theological Seminary.  But in the last year I read the book of I.M.Sechenov about the reflexes of the brain and became interested in biology and medicine.  He studied animal physiology at St. Petersburg University.  Pavlov, using surgical methods for 10 years, studied in detail the physiology of digestion and for these studies received the Nobel Prize.  The next area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest was higher nervous activity, the study of which he devoted 35 years.  He introduced the basic concepts of the science of behavior - conditioned and unconditioned reflexes, reinforcement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Russian biologists and their discoveries" class="if uuid-1185948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31722/1185948.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Koltsov N.K.  (1872-1940) </h2><p>  We continue the topic "Domestic biologists and their discoveries."  Nikolai Konstantinovich Koltsov - biologist, founder of the school of experimental biology.  Born in the family of an accountant.  He graduated from Moscow University, where he studied comparative anatomy and embryology, collected scientific material in European laboratories.  He organized a laboratory of experimental biology at the People's University named after Shanyavsky. </p><p>  He studied the biophysics of the cell, the factors that determine its shape.  These works entered into science called the Koltsov principle.  Koltsov is one of the <span>founders of genetics</span> in Russia, the organizer of the first laboratories and the department of experimental biology.  The scientist founded three biostations.  He became the first Russian scientist to use the physicochemical method in biological research. </p><h2>  Timiryazev K.A.  (1843-1920) </h2><p>  Domestic biologists and their discoveries in the field of plant physiology have contributed to the development of the scientific foundations of agronomy.  Timiryazev Kliment Arkadyevich was a natural scientist, researcher of photosynthesis and a propagandist of Darwin's ideas.  The scientist came from a noble family, he graduated from St. Petersburg University. </p><p>  Timiryazev studied plant nutrition, photosynthesis, drought tolerance.  The scientist was engaged not only in pure science, but also attached great importance to the practical application of research.  He was in charge of the experimental field, where he tested various fertilizers and recorded their effect on the crop.  Thanks to this study, agriculture has advanced significantly along the path of intensification. </p><h2>  Michurin I.V.  (1855-1935) </h2><p>  Russian biologists and their discoveries have significantly influenced agriculture and horticulture.  Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin is a <span>well</span> - <span>known biologist</span> and breeder.  His ancestors were small noblemen, from them the scientist took an interest in gardening.  In early childhood, he looked after a garden, many trees in which were planted by his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.  Michurin began breeding work in a rented neglected estate.  During the period of its activity, it bred more than 300 varieties of cultivated plants, including those adapted to the conditions of the central zone of Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Russian biologists and their discoveries" class="if uuid-1185979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31722/1185979.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Tikhomirov A.A.  (1850-1931) </h2><p>  Russian biologists and their discoveries helped develop new areas in agriculture.  Alexander Andreevich Tikhomirov - biologist, doctor of zoology and rector of Moscow University.  He received a law degree at St. Petersburg University, but became interested in biology and received a second degree at Moscow University at the Department of Natural Sciences.  The scientist discovered such a phenomenon as artificial parthenogenesis, one of the most important sections in individual development.  He made a great contribution to the development of sericulture. </p><h2>  Sechenov I.M.  (1829-1905) </h2><p>  The topic ‚ÄúFamous Scientists of Biologists and Their Discoveries‚Äù will be incomplete without mentioning Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov.  This is a famous Russian evolutionary biologist, physiologist and educator.  Born in the family of a landowner, he received his education at the Main Engineering School and Moscow University. </p><p>  The scientist examined the brain and found a center that causes inhibition of the central nervous system, proved the effect of the brain on muscle activity.  He wrote the classic work Reflexes of the Brain, where he formulated the idea that acts conscious and unconscious are performed in the form of reflexes.  Introduced the brain as a computer that controls all the processes of life.  He justified the respiratory function of the blood.  The scientist created a national school of physiology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="scientists biologists and their discoveries table" class="if uuid-1185947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31722/1185947.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Ivanovsky D.I.  (1864-1920) </h2><p>  The end of the XIX - the beginning of the XX century - the time when the great Russian biologists worked.  And their discoveries (a table of any size could not contain their list) contributed to the development of medicine and biology.  Among them, Dmitry Iosifovich Ivanovsky - a physiologist, microbiologist and the founder of virology.  He was educated at St. Petersburg University.  During his studies, he showed interest in plant diseases. </p><p>  The scientist suggested that diseases are caused by tiny bacteria or toxins.  The viruses themselves were seen with an electron microscope only after 50 years.  It is Ivanovsky who is considered the founder of virology as a science.  The scientist studied the process of alcoholic fermentation and the effect of chlorophyll and oxygen on it, <span>plant anatomy,</span> soil microbiology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="biologists and their discoveries briefly" class="if uuid-1188141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31722/1188141.jpg?1536488440"></div><h2>  Chetverikov S.S.  (1880-1959) </h2><p>  Russian biologists and their discoveries have made a great contribution to the development of genetics.  Chetverikov Sergey Sergeevich was born a scientist in the family of a manufacturer, received his education at Moscow University.  This is an outstanding evolutionary geneticist who organized the study of heredity in animal populations.  Thanks to these studies, the scientist is considered the founder of evolutionary genetics.  He laid the foundation for a new discipline - population genetics. </p><p>  You have read the article ‚ÄúFamous Russian biologists and their discoveries.‚Äù  A table of their achievements can be compiled on the basis of the proposed material. </p>
