This type of clothing is indispensable if you need to wear a light outfit in winter.  The sleeveless jacket is simply removed with a fur coat or a down jacket and left in the wardrobe.  Vests can be used instead of a cardigan when it is still too warm to get jackets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's knit vests with buttons" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1386110.jpg" width="397"></div>

    <p>  In addition, women's tank tops (knitting or crocheted) are simply irreplaceable for those girls and women who are forced to work in cool rooms. </p><h2>  Caution, 100% wool! </h2><p>  It should be clarified that any knitted clothes will be warm only if made of natural material.  Of course, knitted vests for women with knitting needles from 100% wool will be the best thing to warm.  True, they may have some disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Pretty heavy weight.  If you use a thin thread, the product will turn out easier and still be warm. </li><li>  The tendency to shrink.  Therefore, such women's tank tops knitted with needles should be washed only by hand in warm (not hot) water. </li><li>  The appearance of spools.  This phenomenon is almost inevitable.  Inexpensive wool rolls stronger and faster than high-quality yarn, but in any case, sooner or later, hated balls and fluff will appear.  This usually happens in places where the vest comes in contact with other clothes (under the arms, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpockets and waistband, if any). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's tank top knitting scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1386111.jpg" width="388"></div></li></ul><p>  The extreme degree of rolling wool becomes its felting.  If you allow the machine to wash the product or often wear it under a sheepskin coat (with a pile inside), you can detect the appearance of areas resembling felt.  In fact, this is it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Secrets of a warm vest </h2><p>  What to choose for knitting tank tops?  Wool blended yarn, which contains at least 50% natural fiber, is best suited.  The recognized leaders are <span>merino wool</span> and alpaca.  Of the simpler types of yarn, sheep‚Äôs wool, as well as angora (rabbit fluff) and mohair (long and soft goat hair), became widespread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeveless women knitting" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1386109.jpg" width="260"></div>

    <p>  If necessary, women's tank tops knitted with needles can be insulated with a padding of synthetic winterizer or fleece (you don‚Äôt even need a machine to sew on the latter, you can gently attach it with a needle manually). </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Yarn should be selected taking into account the specifics of the future product.  Simple women's tank tops knitted with needles can be made from almost any material.  However, to form the patterns already have to work hard: </p><ul><li>  A smooth thread with tight torsion is suitable for lace.  Behind the fluff or long mohair, the pattern will not be visible. </li><li>  Harnesses look great if they are knitted from smooth yarn of medium thickness (250-400 m / 100 grams). </li><li>  For jacquards, it is necessary to use smooth multi-colored threads of the same thickness.  Ideally, this should be one type of yarn. </li></ul><h2>  Simple knitted sleeveless jacket for women with knitting needles: a scheme, pattern and description </h2><p>  The photo below shows one of the most basic sleeveless models you can imagine. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's knit vests" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1386107.jpg" width="399"></div>

For the manufacture of such a vest, about 400 grams of yarn of medium thickness will be required (for small or very large sizes, the consumption of yarn will be different). </p><p>  Since there are no decorations (no patterns, no embroidery, no beads), you should choose an interesting and attractive yarn.  In addition, you will need to pay attention to the quality of the main pattern - the front surface.  Rough, twisted, tightened or loose loops are not allowed here. </p><p>  It is interesting that this knitted tank top for women with knitting needles (pattern patterns confirm this) are two rectangles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vest female knitting pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1386108.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <h2>  Where to start knitting? </h2><p>  First of all, you should determine the density of knitting.  This is done by manufacturing and measuring a control sample.  As a result, it will be known how many loops and rows per 10 cm of canvas in height and width. </p><p>  Based on these data, you need to calculate how many loops you need to dial for knitting fabrics.  For example, let‚Äôs take the following numbers: 22 loops are 10 cm wide, and 18 rows are 10 cm high. </p><p>  So, to get started on a product of the 56th size, you need to dial 123 loops. </p><p>  The two extreme ones will be edge, and for the straps connected with a garter stitch, you need to take 7 loops on each side. </p><p>  The first 14 cm of the front and 21 cm of the back should be knitted with a 2 x 2 elastic band. The sequence will be as follows: 8 loops of <span>garter</span> stitch <span>,</span> 107 loops of elastic, 8 loops of the scarf pattern. </p><p>  Next, you need to proceed to knitting the main fabric of parts.  We get the following algorithm: 8 loops of garter stitch, 107 face stitches, again 8 loops of garter. </p><p>  Two parts are knitted separately, stitching shoulder seams at the end of the work and tying the neck. </p><h2>  Attention!  Buttonhole </h2><p>  Slots for button fastening are performed only on the front canvas.  Their size is calculated based on what diameter the hardware has. </p><p>  After 2 cm from the end of the gum in the manufacture of strips perform the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  Edge, knit 2 loops, 3 close, 2 knit. </li><li>  Work on a pattern of 107 loops. </li><li>  The bar at the end of the row: 2 to knit, 3 to close, 3 to knit. </li><li>  In the next row: hem, 2 knit, 3 yarn, 2 knit. </li><li>  Work on a pattern of 107 loops. </li><li>  The bar at the end of the row: 2 knit, 3 yarn, 3 knit. </li></ul><p>  Next, the yarn (which is dialed in the same way as the loops at the beginning of the very first row) are knitted like regular loops in a pattern.  As a result, the same number of loops should be obtained as at the beginning of the row. </p><p>  After 7-10 cm repeat the algorithm. </p><p>  In the same way women‚Äôs sleeveless jackets are knitted with buttons on buttons with two shelves. </p><h2>  How to make shoulder bevels and neck? </h2><p>  If the width of the canvas is 56 cm, the width of the neck is 16 cm (35 loops), then 20 cm will remain on each shoulder (for example 44 loops). </p><p>  When the part is knitted to a sufficient height, the central 23 loops should be closed.  Next, each shoulder is performed separately: </p><ul><li>  Close 2 loops from the center of the fabric, knit 98 loops. </li><li>  Close 10 stitches, knit 88 stitches. </li><li>  Close 2 loops, perform 86. </li><li>  In the same way, close 2 more loops from the center, and from the edge 3 more times 10 loops and 4 loops once. </li></ul><p>  The second shoulder is performed similarly. </p><p>  Finished parts should be sewn, focusing on the drawing.  For closed neck loops, you need to dial the loops (using a hook or knitting needle).  They are put on circular knitting needles and a neck is knitted (from 2 to 18 cm). </p><p>  If the craftswoman desires, she can use some kind of pattern instead of the front surface.  Such a knitted tank top for women with knitting needles (a scheme can be absolutely any) will be useful to women of various complexions. </p>
