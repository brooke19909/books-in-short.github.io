After all, everyone wants to be one and only, and most importantly, beautiful.  And if at the same time you have to spend a very small amount of money - this would be an ideal option. </p><p>  It will not be difficult for craftswomen to master needlework techniques to create unmatched boots for themselves, and those who still do not knit this may have a desire to learn this. </p><p>  As they say, our hands are not for boredom, but in order to create magnificent and one-of-a-kind things.  And <span>knitted boots</span> with your own hands are a great way to show your skills. </p><p>  There are many techniques for creating such boots.  The sole for the product can be purchased at the store, or you can use your shoes that have lost their appearance, but have kept a good bottom.  The frame may be soft or hard. </p><p>  Knitted boots can be roughly divided into three groups: summer light boots, glamorous romantic and warm winter version. </p><p>  Consider how to tie boots in the summer version. </p><p>  They will require: </p><ul><li>  small hook or knitting needles </li><li>  durable yarn: linen, cotton, silk </li><li>  solid base - outsole </li><li>  fishing line </li><li>  durable thread and shoe awl, glue (depending on the method of fastening the knitted part).  The knitted part with the base can be connected in several ways: <ol><li>  connection to the moving part of the base.  Attach a new canvas to a small amount of the old. </li><li>  connection directly to the sole.  Awl and durable thread are used. </li><li>  bonding with glue. </li></ol></li></ul><p>  DIY knitted boots require careful preparation.  Before starting work, it is necessary to very carefully take measurements from the leg: circle the foot, measure the leg lift, and best of all make a template for the pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, you need to decide how your boots will be made: knitting or crocheting? </p><p>  Let's say you are interested in the question: how to crochet boots? </p><p>  Choose a color, yarn and a suitable hook for it. </p><p>  The next step will be to decide which pattern should be on your boots, and how long they will be. </p><p>  Having decided on the pattern for the boots, you need to connect several parts of the pattern in order to determine the density of the pattern. </p><p>  Coming to the upper part of the shoe, pay attention to the fact that the top should be two centimeters larger than the circumference of the sole, and at the same time, make sure that wrinkles do not occur.  The template will help again. </p><p>  In order to strengthen the toe and heel of the boot while knitting, add fishing line to the main thread. </p><p>  If desired, you can starch the shoes after finishing work. </p><p>  Other options for knitted boots, of course, also deserve attention. </p><p>  Winter boots can be made of woolen and acrylic threads.  Novice craftswomen can decorate them with simple pom-poms, and professional knitters use complex ornaments. </p><p>  Glamorous ladies will like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating high-heeled boots with many different shades of yarn, using rhinestones, buckles, buttons and various accessories. </p><p>  In addition, it is not necessary to knit new boots: you can just update the old ones!  To do this, you just need to make a ‚Äúcover‚Äù, which you will put on over your boots! </p><p>  Tie several options for ‚Äúclothes‚Äù for your favorite boots, and you will be different and unique every day! </p><p>  Knitted boots with your own hands - and any, even the most unpretentious, a cat in boots will envy you! </p>
