Crimea, reviews of which today can be found mainly admired only, is a wonderful region.  The village is also called the royal place, because the imperial persons of the Russian state lived here.  So, Nicholas II was the last of those who used the summer residence for its intended purpose.  Those who have already been here, note the extraordinary beauty of these places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea livadia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/458329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Livadia is located three kilometers west of Yalta, on the slope of Mogabi.  Among the dense forests, initially on the site of today's Livadia there were huge glades.  Many people think that the name of the village happened in this way, since ‚Äúlivadion‚Äù translates as ‚Äúlawn, meadow‚Äù.  Here is the sanatorium of the same name - one of the largest medical cardiological institutions on the South Coast.  Accordingly, annually a huge number of people with cardiovascular diseases choose a unique institution ‚ÄúLivadia‚Äù (sanatorium, Crimea) for treatment.  Patients note the high quality of the medical services provided both in this medical institution, and in other Crimean health resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate and nature of Livadia </h2><p>  The climate in Livadia is the same as in Yalta.  Although due to its geographical location (large forest, slope of Mount Mogabi, proximity to the sea), it has a huge advantage: this place has a lot of sun, vegetation and fresh air.  You can often hear words from people who have come from here about how mild and healthy the local climate is. </p><p>  Many today choose to <span>rest in the Crimea.</span>  Livadia attracts them with its unique climate.  The sea and mountains have a direct impact on him.  Mountains reliably protect from cold air streams from the northwest, northeast and north.  The sea, being a powerful regulator of heat in winter, warms you with warm breath, while in the hot summer days the heat dies.  In the daytime in summer, the breezes blow from the sea, and in the evening - towards the sea from the mountains.  The warm coastal breeze from the mountains brings a light aroma of needles.  Due to this, the air here is always very clean, saturated with forest aroma and sea salts.  The sea heated during the summer retains a rather high water temperature for a long time, while ‚Äúwarming‚Äù the air of the coast. </p>

    <h2>  Livadia Infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure here is quite well developed: a telegraph, a post office, a long-distance telephone line, 7 shops, a bank branch, 3 restaurants, about a dozen cafes and bars work in this place.  To accommodate holidaymakers, the Livadia (sanatorium) is intended.  Crimea offers tourists daily buses between the village and Yalta.  Travelers note that all this greatly facilitates their life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crimea, Livadia: the history of the village </h2><p>  The area on which Livadia is located has been inhabited by people for a long time.  In the eighteenth century, on the site of today's Livadia was a small Greek settlement Ai-Yang.  Its inhabitants in 1778, by order of the government, moved to the Azov province.  When Crimea was annexed to Russia, part of the land of the South Bank was donated to the Greeks of the Balaklava battalion (the Crimean border guard of those years).  Almost thirty years, Livadia was owned by Count Potocki.  At the same time, by 1859, it was already inhabited and landscaped, becoming a typical southern estate of those years.  By this moment, there were thirty yards in which 140 people lived. </p>

    <p>  A year later, Livadia was acquired by a specific department for the king‚Äôs family.  Under the leadership of Hippolytus Monighetti, a court architect, the Potocki Palace was built.  Also, the Small Palace, numerous services, greenhouses were erected for the heir.  At the location of the Old Palace in 1910-1911.  designed by N.P. Krasnov, an academician, the Great Livadia Palace was built in the spirit of the Renaissance.  It became the summer residence of Nicholas II. </p><p>  In the period 1941-1944.  The village was occupied by German troops.  During the occupation, the Small Palace and the corps of Soviet health resorts were destroyed here, while the White Livadia Palace was able to survive.  In Livadia, after major restoration work in the White Palace, a conference of the heads of 3 states was held - the USA, Great Britain and the USSR. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For everyone who chooses the village of Livadia (Crimea) for relaxation, the official website will tell you where to stay.  Here you can read the detailed history of the resort and more.  Many regular vacationers note that the site (livadia.crimea.ua) always provides relevant and truthful information. </p><h2>  Swimming season </h2><p>  It is worth considering to everyone who chooses Crimea for relaxation: Livadia for tourists opens the beach season in May, and ends at the end of October.  Many people think that the beaches here are the cleanest on the entire southern coast of Crimea, so it‚Äôs clear why there was <span>Brezhnev‚Äôs cottage</span> here (namely, in Oreanda) <span>.</span>  Vacationers and tourists from all over the world go to admire the Livadia Palace and enjoy the silence of the parks, treatment in the sanatoriums and walks along the famous Royal Trail.  Every day, more than 25,000 people are here on vacation and treatment.  At the same time, buses Livadia - Yalta run daily.  Crimea offers vacationers silence and relative solitude.  At the same time, Yalta with all its entertainment is in close proximity. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation in Livadia </h2><p>  There are a lot of sanatoriums and hotels, as in every resort village or city of the Republic of Crimea.  Livadia offers to settle in any of them and, in addition, in the private sector.  It is possible to rent an inexpensive room or apartment.  But the most famous accommodation is the hotel "Livadia" (Crimea).  This is one of the largest medical institutions of the southern coast of Crimea. </p><p>  Visitors like the Druzhba boarding house, famous for the fact that it is equipped with a unique heat supply system that operates due to the heat of the Black Sea.  They note the relaxing and comfortable living conditions in the sanatoriums "Mountain Health Resort", "Lower Oreanda", "Black Sea" and some others. </p><h2>  White Palace (Grand Livadia Palace) </h2><p>  It was built in 1911.  This is the former summer residence of Nicholas II, the last emperor of Russia.  He is also famous for the fact that in February 1945 in his White (Big) Hall the Yalta (Crimean) conference of the heads of government of 3 countries of the anti-Hitler coalition - Great Britain, the USA and the USSR was held, where it was decided to form the UN, the declaration on the liberation of Europe and other documents.

    <p>  Around this time, part of the buildings became the Livadia sanatorium, while it itself is located on the territory of the one and a half century Livadia park.  There is always a great opportunity for relaxation - at any time of the year you can stay with young children as a family for treatment and rest, having previously booked places.  There is a year-round swimming pool with sea heated water, tennis courts, playgrounds for round-the-clock volleyball and badminton games, saunas, sports and gymnasiums.  You can often hear from vacationers here that they will return to the sanatorium again. </p><h2>  Livadia park </h2><p>  In their reviews, tourists say many admiring words about the huge Livadia Park, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout forty hectares.  It is created in a landscape style.  There are many rare plants here - Atlas silver cedars, centennial sequoias, yews, Italian pines, etc. Elegant rose flower beds and flower beds are located near the buildings.  In different directions, the park diverges trails and paved roads for walking.  There are several fabulously executed fountains.  Each of the strollers is stopped by the Livadia fountain with Arabic script: real spring water flows from the lamb‚Äôs mouth in a continuous trickle, where every hiker can quench his thirst with pleasure.  An eighty-meter pergola stretches from the palace towards the sea - this is a gazebo generously twined with grapes, wisteria and roses. </p>

    <h2>  Royal (Solar) trail </h2><p>  This is the famous horizontal Crimean trail from Livadia Park to Gaspra.  It got its name, because it was on her that the majestic royal family preferred to walk.  It is also known as the <span>Sun Trail.</span>  It is located at an altitude of 140 meters above sea level.  Vacationers note that there are no ups and downs that are difficult to overcome, due to which all 6.7 kilometers that the trail occupies can be walked quite easily.  In this place, even in the hot heat it‚Äôs cool.  It is interesting that doctors recommend people to walk along this trail for healing, since the healing factors of the nature and climate of this place work flawlessly.  Therefore, the sun trail is also called the Health Road. </p>

    <h2>  Red port "Livadia" </h2><p>  Vintage strong high-quality red wine is one of the oldest brands of the Massandra drink.  Its pomegranate color is striking in its velvety and depth.  The noble Cabernet grape variety presented the drink with an original strong bouquet with a soft enveloping morocco.  The taste is full, harmonious, with a delicate aroma of cherry pits, with a pleasant long finish.  It is worth considering that in the old wine its amazing qualities are strengthened many times, confirming the uniqueness of this creation of winemakers "Massandra".  Like other red wines, this port has a bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect on various pathogenic microorganisms. </p>
