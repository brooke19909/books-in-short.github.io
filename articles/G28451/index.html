But few people think that Essentuki is not only the name of water, but also a resort town.  It is located in the south of our state, in the Stavropol Territory, at the northern slope of the Caucasus Range.  The healing waters were discovered by the <span>Volga Cossacks</span> in the 19th century.  It was not quite a pleasant taste and smell liquid, so the Cossacks did not drink it, but the horses consumed it with greed. </p><h2>  Climate and ecology </h2><p>  The climate in the city has a bright seasonal severity and is characterized as continental.  In summer it is very hot and dry, and winter is snowy and quite cool.  The offseason is short. </p><p>  From an environmental point of view, the city is clean, since there are no enterprises that can pollute the air and the environment.  Although there are certain problems with car exhaust, radiation from rocks, natural dumps, but in general, not everything is so bad when compared with other cities in Russia. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Essentuki is a resort where people go to improve their health, drink healing mineral water.  Along with this, the city has many interesting sights, ancient and unique buildings, holy places that are worth seeing.  And for those who came to the resort not only for treatment, there are many night clubs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="review-planet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City fountain" class="if uuid-2446474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446474.jpg"></div><h2>  Mud clinic named after  Semashko </h2><p>  This is one of the most important sights of the Essentuki.  The building began to be built in 1911, and the doors of the establishment opened in 1915.  The structure was erected from the local dolomite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hospital resembles the ancient Roman baths, and stone lions are installed near the entrance.  There is a fountain in the courtyard.  Inside the building there are antique figures, the walls are decorated with bas-reliefs with the faces of the Greek gods. </p><p>  The hospital has 2 parts, for men and for women.  After all, that was exactly what was established in the Roman terms. </p><p>  The treatment is based on the use of hydrogen sulfide mud from <span>Lake Tambukan.</span>  It is recommended to visit the hospital, even if there is no indication for treatment with mud.  After all, this is a real museum of pseudo-antique architectural style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mud clinic named after Semashko" class="if uuid-2446424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446424.jpg"></div><h2>  Treatment park </h2><p>  This green zone in the city was defeated in 1848.  Then the governor of the Caucasus was <span>Count Vorontsov,</span> who issued a decree on the landscaping of the settlement.  60 hectares of land were allocated for the park zone, planting began already in 1849.  Two companies of soldiers were employed at the works, which planted more than 7 thousand seedlings. </p><p>  Due to geographical features, the park is conditionally divided into Lower and Upper.  Then they arranged the main entrance, laid out paths for pedestrians. </p><p>  With the advent of Soviet power, landscaping work continued.  They built baths and an inhalation.  However, in 1942 the city was occupied, and the park was badly damaged.  Many medical buildings were destroyed.  At the end of the war, restoration work began. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now on the central avenue is the main pavilion with the water source "Essentuki No. 4" (Upper Park).  Next is the Health Road, along which you can get to the Lower Park and other sources. </p><p>  In the park there is a pavilion of physiotherapy exercises, an aerosolary, an inhalation and a pavilion of mechanotherapy.  There are also catering establishments with healthy meals, a dance floor and table tennis tables. </p><p>  The park has many cascading slopes, fountains and gazebos, a natural abundance of vegetation.  And there is also the beautiful Theater-Park building in Essentuki.  It was erected in 1901 and attached to the drinking gallery No. 17. Once upon a time there were concerts here.  In fact, it was the only concert hall in the city for 100 years.  Mayakovsky spoke here and Komissarzhevskaya Vera shone.  In 1980, the concert hall ceased to function, and after reconstruction, a hotel, shops and a restaurant were opened in the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://autotravel.ru/town.php/307?type="><img itemprop="image" alt="Treatment park" class="if uuid-2446443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446443.jpg"></div><h2>  Victory Park </h2><p>  Another green zone of the city, which was founded in 1903 on a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 hectares.  Although his fate is not as rosy as that of the Medical Park. </p><p>  In the years when it was rebuilt, it was called "English".  Created it according to all the canons of English landscape parks.  This is the maximum naturalness of all natural lines in composition with man-made creations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Victory Park in Essentuki survived difficult times, for a long time was in an abandoned state.  In the last years of its existence, the park began to slowly be revived, because here unique plants grow even for the Caucasus. </p><p>  The main pride of the park is the drinking gallery.  It is a rounded building with columns and stalactite d√©cor.  Terrankurs are laid throughout the territory.  In the central part, the Eternal Flame is installed.  Not so long ago an amusement park and a 25-meter ferris wheel opened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park" class="if uuid-2446450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446450.jpg"></div><h2>  Hydroelectric Power Station on the Podkumok River </h2><p>  Another attraction of the Essentuki.  At first glance it seems that there might be interesting things in the hydroelectric power station?  However, this is the first construction of this type, erected not to provide the industry with electric energy.  The main purpose of the station is to supply energy for trams and pump mineral water. </p><p>  They built it in a few months and called it ‚ÄúWhite Coal‚Äù.  After 10 years, it has already been included in the common system with the Pyatigorsk diesel system. </p><p>  In 1943, when the Germans retreated, the hydroelectric power station was completely destroyed.  After that, she was restored in 4 years. </p><p>  In the 70s of the last century, the station again suffered from river floods, and it wasn‚Äôt restored so, only half was preserved.  In 2000, floods again overtook the station. </p><p>  Today this place is of interest to people who like to walk through the ruins.  The preserved part has a museum.  Even UNESCO has taken this object under its ‚Äúguardianship‚Äù. </p><h2>  Museum of Local History  V.P. Shpakovsky </h2><p>  Within the walls of this institution you can learn about the history of the city, how the resort developed.  In some rooms, exhibits of flora and fauna of the region will be of interest.  There are objects found during archaeological excavations and which are the best way to tell about the ancient settlements in this area. </p><p>  The Yessentuki Museum of Local Lore opened its doors to visitors in 1963, for a long time it was a folk museum and after winning a museum review in 1978, it became a state museum. </p><p>  The building itself is a monument of Russian architecture. </p><h2>  St. George's Convent </h2><p>  This is a fairly young attraction of the Essentuki and the surrounding area, but truly magnificent.  It is located 35 kilometers from the resort (Mineralnye Vody - Kislovodsk highway).  You can also get here by train, get off at the Beliy Ugol station.  The shrine is located on Mount Dubrovka, at the very top there is an observation deck from where a magnificent view of Elbrus, Beshtau and Mashuk opens. </p><p>  People come here to pray and simply admire the local beauties.  The pastries of the nuns living here are very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adm-essentuki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. George's Convent" class="if uuid-2446439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446439.jpg"></div><h2>  The sculptural complex of Christ the Risen </h2><p>  Another temple complex is listed in the list of attractions and monuments of the city of Essentuki.  The dominant structure is the sculptural image of Christ, whose height is 22 meters.  This is the highest sculpture in the whole country.  For example, the sculpture of the Savior in Rio de Janeiro rises 38 meters, and the highest such building is in Poland - 52 meters. </p><p>  The complex was built in 2013, it includes not only sculpture, there are chapels and temples, a playground, parking.  The doors of a small zoo are also open for visitors.  You can get to the complex by public bus number 10, which departs from the train station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stav.kp.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.stav.kp.ru/online/news/3075863/"><img itemprop="image" alt="The sculptural complex of Christ the Risen" class="if uuid-2446463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446463.jpg"></div><h2>  Pergolas of the city </h2><p>  There are many places to relax in the city.  The most beautiful gazebos of Essentuki are located mainly in park areas.  One of them is located in the Medical Park and is called "Musical".  It was erected in 1879, and from that time small concerts were held in it.  For many years this tradition was forgotten, but not so long ago the brass band again began to perform for vacationers.  The event is held every Saturday from 16 to 18 days.  In the old days there was a source number 18, but its resources were limited, and it soon ran out. </p><p>  A cast-iron gazebo is located in the Upper Medical Park.  In the old days, water "Essentuki No. 17" was sold here. </p><p>  And not far from the upper baths is the gazebo ‚ÄúRandom Encounters‚Äù.  Once upon a time, representatives of the pre-revolutionary ‚Äúwater society‚Äù came to meet and communicate here.  At the foot of the structure are impressive floral clocks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="globalsib.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="arbor &quot;Random meetings&quot;" class="if uuid-2446434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2446434.jpg"></div><p>  In the center of the park there is an Oreanda gazebo, although it looks more like a colonnade.  At this place, a wooden gazebo called ‚ÄúAyle Harp‚Äù used to be flaunted.  At the top of the wooden structure was a harp and a weather vane, the wind from which was sent to the vein strings of a musical instrument.  However, the harp did not work long and the Oreanda arbor was erected in its place, which today is in a state of neglect. </p><p>  In any case, Essentuki and mineral springs in this context are synonymous.  They go to this resort, first of all, for health and restoration of strength.  According to vacationers, the city is much smaller than Kislovodsk, it‚Äôs nice that you do not need to buy a ticket to the sanatorium, you can walk around the city parks and drink mineral water.  Although in winter and late autumn the city is rather damp and unpleasant.  The county seems dull and uninteresting. </p>
