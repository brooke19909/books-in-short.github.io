Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkarian Republic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our article today, one of the most beautiful cities in Kabardino-Balkaria, Nalchik (Russia), will be presented for review.  It is small in area, but unique in historical, natural and cultural characteristics.  Like any other city, it has its own biography, its own appearance.  Seeing the sights of Nalchik, you will truly fall in love with the pearl of Kabardino-Balkaria.  So here we go. </p><h2>  Elbrus </h2><p>  This two-headed handsome volcano is considered one of the largest extinct volcanoes on our planet.  The height of the western peak is 5642 m, 5621 m - eastern.  A saddle separates them (5200 m).  The distance between the peaks is about 3 km.  In size, Elbrus is second only to the volcano Aconcagua and the fire-breathing mountain Ljulyayljako (6960 m and 6723 m, respectively).  Once Elbrus had tremendous power.  Its ashes lie at the foot of Mount Mashuk - almost 100 km from the eruption site.  The conquest of Elbrus is very difficult due to the low temperature (-1.4 ¬∞ C even in summer), insane winds and a rather noticeable smell of hydrogen sulfide.  True, this does not bother all tourists and climbers.  Climbing this volcano is annually done by dozens of brave men.  It is better to climb from the southern slope, where the infrastructure is concentrated: <span>cable car,</span> hotels, restaurants.  The two-headed giant silently keeps priceless wealth in the bowels.  At its foot is the ‚ÄúValley of Narzans‚Äù famous healing springs.  Elbrus is visible from all corners of the region. </p>

    <h2>  "Atazhukinsky garden" </h2><p>  This is the name of the city park.  Revealing the sights of Nalchik, one can not help but pay attention to it.  The park is the real pride of the locals.  And visitors who come to the city of Nalchik call it a ‚Äúgreen miracle‚Äù.  This is an impressive green massif in the very center of the city, which merges with the resort area.  This is a kind of museum and reserve.  There are more than fifty species of trees and shrubs that grow only in Kabardino-Balkaria.  In addition, a huge number of plantings imported from Korea, Japan, America, China, Siberia, Northern Europe, Asia.  The scope of the article will not allow listing and at least briefly describing each species.  Let us just say that even those plants that are no longer found in the homeland (for example, ginkgo from Korea and China, pavlons from Japan, etc.) grow in the park.  Today, only the city of <span>Nalchik</span> <span>(Kabardino-Balkarian Republic)</span> can boast of this beauty <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><strong></strong>  Palace of Celebrations and Green Theater </h2>

    <p>  Graceful <strong> </strong>  The architectural building, immersed in the greenery of a cozy park, was built in 1957 in honor of the 400th anniversary of the republic's accession to Russia.  This is one of the most picturesque corners of Nalchik.  The Palace of Celebrations is located near a mountain river and a lake.  The project architect (Georgy Mosulishvili) managed to fit the structure into the ensemble of the park so harmoniously that it not only does not seem alien, but literally merges with the kingdom of linden, ash, hornbeam, elm, beech, hazel.  And in the spring, when the slope of the mountain is covered with a snow-white boiling of wild fruit trees, the Palace of Celebrations looks especially gentle. </p><p>  Many have bright memories associated with the Green Theater.  By the way, it was built along with the Palace of Celebrations.  Then it was a restaurant.  In 2002 it was reconstructed, but architectural unique solutions and a unique general appearance were left.  Now, even world-class artists can be invited here: the total amphitheater area is 1050 square meters.  m. In the basement there is a cafe with a banquet hall.  The first and upper floors are reserved for rehearsal rooms, a spacious lobby, dressing rooms.  The design of the stands (2560 seats) is a monolithic team, designed for several decades.  The new stage of the theater can accommodate a large orchestra </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Museum them.

    <p>  Undoubtedly included in the sights of Nalchik.  Moreover, residents consider it a symbol of the city.  It was built on Kizilovka (a mountain 600 meters high) and is visible from any corner of Nalchik.  The restaurant is an unusual architectural structure made in the form of the head of a mighty hero with an outstretched hand with a torch.  ‚ÄúSosruko‚Äù has repeatedly won awards and prizes for originality.  The restaurant serves national dishes.  The authors of the project were F. Kalmykov (sculptor), Z. Ozov (sculptor), Palagashvili (architect).  After the overhaul carried out in 2004, two halls appeared - a hunting room and a youth room (two-tier), a decorative waterfall with birds and a faucet from which poured into the cup of the makhsym. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The restaurant became the main link in the Malaya Kizilovka center (excursion center).  You can climb the mountain by car, but most people prefer the chairlift.  The latter also leads to the amusement town. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral Mosque </h2><p>  It is located on the site of a former cinema (Shogentsukova St.).  The national and regional character is read here in everything: in the image itself, in the materials, in the decoration.  This is a very colorful and bright building - a blue dome, walls glazed with reflective golden stained-glass windows, and trim from "wild" stones.  The mosque itself is located on a small circular platform.  Around - paved tiles with a pattern oriented to Mecca and a decorative fence.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mosque is 1700 square meters.  m. It can simultaneously accommodate about 1000 parishioners. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nalchik Cathedral Mosque" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/472783.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Friendship Arch </h2><p>  The opening of this memorial was timed to coincide with the 450th anniversary of the friendly alliance between Kabardino-Balkaria and Russia.  The building was designed by Muzarib Bzhakhov, and built at the expense of personal funds of President Arsen Kanokov. </p><p>  Initially, they planned to decorate the arch with bas-reliefs depicting scenes from Adyghe history and the Nart epic.  On the pedestals, it was planned to establish bronze figures of people who made a significant contribution to the development of the country.  There were many candidates - from Prince Kanokov to Tsar of Grozny.  Another name was also planned (‚ÄúTriumphal‚Äù).  However, all of these proposals were rejected by the Public Advisory Board.  The debate lasted a long time.  As a result, they decided to install bronze statues without personifying them.  Changed the name. </p><p>  Friendship Memorial Arch was kept in a simple style.  Now, blended into the general ensemble, she considers one of several of her business cards the city of <span>Nalchik (Kabardino-Balkarian Republic).</span> </p>

    <h2>  Temple </h2><p>  Built in honor of Mary Magdalene.  The Church especially honors those who first learned of the risen Christ.  Among the few was Mary of Magdala (the name of the city).  This name was given at the baptism of the daughter of Temryuk Idarov (daughter of the Kabardian prince).  Subsequently, she became the wife of Ivan the Terrible.  A dynastic marriage further sealed the union of Kabarda and Russia (1557). </p><p>  The temple holds a thousand worshipers.  This is a five-domed church built in the Byzantine style, taking into account all the Orthodox canons.  The first stone was laid in September 2004. At the same time, consecration took place.  Now it is a beautiful two-story building.  The first level was assigned to the baptismal room, workshops, utility rooms, the second - for worshipers.  Most are dedicated to the choir.  From here you can also get to the bell tower.  The first level is the porch, the covered porch.  The entire plot occupies 7 thousand square meters.  m, 800 sq. m.  m </p><p>  In 2010, on April 18, the first service was held - the Divine Liturgy.  This temple is not just the sights of Nalchik, it is the dignity of the Orthodox and all residents of the CBD. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nalchik Church of Mary Magdalene" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/472779.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Hippodrome </h2><p>  Highlanders' horses were always held in high esteem.  Kabardian breeds always differed from many others.  They are unpretentious, hardy, beautiful and graceful.  Inside the breed, the subspecies Bekan, Shagdiy, Sholokh are especially appreciated.  Horse breeding was encouraged by tsarist Russia.  For cavalry, tens of thousands of animals were purchased, mainly of the Kabardian breed. </p><p>  Racing trials of horses in smooth racecourse races are a kind of exams that give marks to horse breeding.  They decided to build a hippodrome in 1939. However, the war inflicted huge numbers of livestock.  Only dozens of thoroughbred horses remained in the country's tribal fund.  The decline was so huge that the population was restored only by the 60s, and even then partially.  The perestroika period almost brought all efforts to naught.  Horse breeding seemed to be dead.  Breeding work was practically stopped; no tests were carried out.  The Nalchik racecourse was collapsing ... The impetus for the development of a "half-dead" race infrastructure was given only in 2006, when authorities began to realize that the well-known brand called the "Nalchik racecourse" should be taken with the utmost seriousness.  The first who invested part of personal funds in horse breeding (50 million rubles) was A. Kanokov <span>(president of the republic).</span>  The idea was supported by many horse owners.  Today, the complex is truly thriving.  Moreover, it meets the highest international standards and is fixed by experts. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  And here is Nalchik on the map: </p>
