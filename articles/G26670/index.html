Indeed, most of the reviews that can be found in the media are based on comparisons of the technical characteristics of the new product with previous modifications of professional FX cameras.  Yes, after studying the parameters, you may suspect that the manufacturer deviated from the basic settings and succumbed to the temptation to provide its product with simplified functionality.  But potential buyers should not forget that in the courtyard of the XXI century, and the processes performed "the old fashioned way" with hands have long been replaced by a system with artificial intelligence. </p>

    <h2>  Global Positioning </h2><p>  The manufacturer presented its product in several variations, which, like <span>budget devices,</span> are equipped with popular lenses.  So, on the market you can find a <span>Nikon</span> SLR <span>camera</span> with Nikkor 24-120mm optics, Nikkor 24-70mm optics and Body equipment (without a lens).  The latter option is considered the most popular, since most photographers who purchase a new product already have an arsenal of optics and there is no need to overpay for another lens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Oddly enough, but a full-size SLR camera is positioned on the market as a digital device for creativity with great capabilities and unique functionality.  This does not mean that the gadget is not suitable for professionals, the ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù will satisfy even the most demanding user, because even the kit contains only professional lenses for Nikon.  However, the innovations that affected the control, functionality and convenience of the camera are aimed at beginners. </p><h2>  Amenities &amp; Multimedia </h2><p>  Many professionals, accustomed to photographing the old-fashioned way with their hands through the optical viewfinder, will immediately reject the rotary liquid crystal display that the camera is equipped with.  It is logical to assume that the Nikon D750 Body does not need such funds, but experts of the manufacturer believe otherwise.  The rotary screen in a digital camera is considered the best innovation that has occurred on the market for photographic equipment in the last decade.  Macro shooting, video recording, conducting sessions in extreme conditions - this is only part of the amenities that appeared to users, thanks to the rotary screen. </p>

    <p>  The lightweight case of the gadget is also criticized by many users, because the manufacturer changed the material for manufacturing the front and bottom of the device from <span>magnesium alloy</span> to carbon and plastic.  As practice shows, the strength of the camera did not suffer, and its weight became slightly less, however, such a virtue was criticized by people who are poorly versed in this matter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Build quality and equipment </h2><p>  The new Nikon SLR camera, like its predecessors in the niche of SLR cameras, comes fully equipped, which, in addition to the device itself, the battery, power supply and instructions, contains a proprietary strap for transporting the gadget and several interface cables for connecting the camera to a TV or computer .  The kit also contains software discs and plugs for the viewfinder from the lenses. </p>

    <p>  As for the quality of the assembly, here the owner can be calm, because it is produced at the highest level.  Bevels, crevices, creaks during deformation and other defects are simply absent in a professional SLR camera.  Even the battery compartment and built-in interfaces are equipped with a rubberized plug, which not only fits snugly, but also does not break with frequent use. </p><h2>  Controls </h2><p>  There are many buttons on the body of the digital device, and the new owner of the <span>Nikon D750</span> Body Black camera will have to study all their functionality for a long time.  It‚Äôs probably better to start with the switch of shooting modes, it is made in the form of a wheel, as in previous professional devices, but is equipped with additional functionality.  As in the "entry-level" mirrors, the user is now available in the "Auto" and "Scene Selection" modes.  By the way, on the same wheel, the user is invited to create two of their own modes U1 and U2 - many professionals prefer to configure them for nature and for portraits. </p>

    <p>  Pleased many users of the <span>Nikon D750</span> Body and the ability to configure the OK button.  As in old professional cameras, you can assign the function "Crop 100%" to it.  It is very convenient to use such functionality when viewing photos and selecting a frame with the best sharpness.  The joystick for managing autofocus areas has also undergone changes.  It is made in the form of an eight-position button and it takes some time to get used to it. </p><h2>  Ports and Interfaces </h2><p>  Attracts buyers and the presence of many rubber plugs throughout the body of the Nikon D750 Body.  User reviews in a positive way mention that the manufacturer did not refuse the simultaneous use of two memory cards, making a fully functional card reader on the right side.  On the left side of the case there are 2 audio ports (for microphone and headphones), a connector for the remote control, HDMI and USB interfaces. </p>

    <p>  At the bottom of the camera, the owner will find a compartment for installing a removable battery.  Although its lid looks flimsy, the mechanism itself is quite reliable.  Also, the lower edge hides a contact under the plug for connecting a reinforced battery.  The built-in Wi-Fi module cannot be detected under the plugs, but it is present in this camera.  True, many professionals, accustomed to using memory cards in the old fashioned way, attributed this innovation to the amateur class. </p><h2>  Lens operation </h2><p>  It has become a tradition for the manufacturer to equip full-frame digital cameras with a ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù, allowing the owner to use old FX lenses for Nikon, in which there is no ultrasonic motor.  The camera accepts almost all lenses (with the same mount as the camera).  True, there are questions to old telescopes, autofocus on them often misses, but this problem is easily solved in the service centers of the company. </p>

    <p>  The owner of the Nikon D750 Body no longer needs to choose <span>fast lenses</span> and try to illuminate the subject, the camera very quickly detects objects in range even without autofocus highlighting.  Now you can take pictures safely in a dark room, without even aiming - the camera itself will find objects and faces.  As for the Kit lens that comes with the device, it is quite enough for creativity and home use, there are no complaints from the owners. </p><h2>  Perfect photos </h2><p>  When reviewing the Nikon D750 Body camera, many experts forget to mention one interesting innovation.  This is a virtual horizon.  It is in this model of the device that the horizon is displayed in two planes - the tilt is displayed not only to the sides, but also forward (backward).  In addition, this functionality can be displayed not only on the LCD screen, but also displayed on the eyepiece.  The horizon scale will not be shown instead of exposure, but on top of the image. </p>

    <p>  Some potential buyers did not like the fact that the manufacturer increased the minimum exposure setting (from 1/8000 to 1/4000).  However, judging by expert reviews, even this mode is enough to shoot decent material with dynamic objects.  A resolution of 24 megapixels is good, but it is in demand only when printing images on huge posters, and 8-10 megapixels will be enough for all beginners to take pictures. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As a result of the review, we can conclude that even the most demanding buyer is unlikely to find flaws in the new Nikon D750 Body digital camera.  Price is the only parameter that can stop the user before buying.  After all, 120,000 rubles is an impressive amount for many users.  But, judging by the reviews of the owners, the full-size camera fully justifies all the financial costs not only with the quality of the photos, but also with the convenience, functionality and creative capabilities of the device. </p>
