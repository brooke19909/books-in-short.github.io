    <ol><li>  When paying in TSP (trade and service enterprises), the cashier may require a passport. </li><li>  And when paying at the pay point (cash points), the client must provide a passport. </li></ol><p>  It turns out that in the store the cashier as may require a document, but not.  The opinion of the acquiring bank (terminal organization) should be taken into account.  The contract often indicates the minimum above which a passport is required.  There may be points where the seller may request a document if there is suspicion. </p><p>  Checking the passport is often carried out at the initiative of the cashier, because in a controversial situation, he is liable for damages.  But a TSP employee may refuse service if the client does not provide a document.  A passport is usually not required to be shown in case of entering a PIN code. </p><h2>  Receipt </h2><p>  If you need to sign the check after payment, then check the amount, date, plastic number.  This document confirms the operation.  The receipt must be kept.  The storage period is approximately the same for banks (for example, for OTP Bank and Sberbank it is 6 months). </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Although modern cards are protected, users still need to follow some safety rules: </p><ol><li>  It is advisable to use cards with a chip.  Not all ATMs used to work with such plastic, but now this is not a problem. </li><li>  If there are a lot of funds in the account, then you can set a daily limit for withdrawal.  This will help save at least part of the funds. </li><li>  If the card is stuck in an ATM or terminal, you should block it. </li><li>  You should not leave your data to store employees. </li><li>  It is advisable to activate the SMS-informing service about each operation. </li><li>  After receiving the card, you should put a sample of your signature. </li><li>  Do not include data on unverified sites. </li></ol>
