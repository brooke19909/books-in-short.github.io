The address of the institution is as follows: Internatsionalnaya street, 23. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kota Museum in Minsk: address" class="if uuid-3214208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3214208.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting pastime </h2><p>  "House for the cat" - this is also called this museum in Minsk.  It provides great opportunities for families.  Any child and even an adult can try their hand at creativity and paint a picture.  Of course, all the necessary tools for this will be provided.  If you comply with all the requirements and the creation will be on the cat theme, then it will also be exhibited in the museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, children like to play koto-checkers, put koto-puzzles, try themselves in the role of a Cat in Boots and read informative books about ... them. </p><p>  In a small but cozy “Koto-cafe”, which is located here, parents can drink some coffee, and children can enjoy some sweets and drink all this with fragrant cat-tea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.koshkimira.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House for cat" class="if uuid-3214204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3214204.jpg"></div><h2>  Curious Facts About the Museum </h2><p>  Often visitors are concerned about where the "live exhibits" come from.  According to employees, most of the animals in the past were homeless, they were simply taken from the street.  Moreover, many were in such a deplorable position that they would undoubtedly die.  All cats were examined by a veterinarian, were vaccinated and only after that they had access to the museum. </p><p>  Do not think that the institution is a shelter for animals.  This is far from the case.  Today, 15 cats live here.  Moreover, each of them with its own character, interesting external data and, of course, a nickname.  The most interesting are: </p><ul><li>  Marshmallows; </li><li>  Timosha </li><li>  Michelle </li><li>  Cream; </li><li>  Mr. Red. </li></ul><p>  All inhabitants eat according to the menu developed by veterinarians.  Of course, they do not receive delicacies, but the food used here contains all the necessary minerals and vitamins. </p><p>  Sometimes people who want to visit the Kota Museum for the first time are frightened and think that a rather unpleasant smell will be felt there.  This opinion is due to the fact that in the usual menageries this usually happens.  However, cats are very intelligent animals and only go to the tray.  To cope with natural needs, a modern filler is used, which completely absorbs the entire smell.  In addition, the ventilation system works and copes with its functions perfectly in the museum. </p><p>  Do not worry about the hygiene component.  To protect animals, all visitors in front of the entrance must step on the antibacterial rug and, only after that, wear shoe covers.  Hands should be washed with soap and a disinfectant.  It is not forbidden to pet animals and it is completely safe.  They are vaccinated and regularly examined by a veterinarian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="animals.howstuffworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum &quot;Kota&quot; (Minsk), reviews" class="if uuid-3214220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3214220.jpg"></div><h2>  How do animals feel? </h2><p>  Sometimes lovers of domestic animals worry that cats can tire from a large crowd of visitors.  But it is known that these cute pets are able to adapt to excessive attention from adults and children.
