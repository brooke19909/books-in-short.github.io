    <p>  Cossack Bay (Sevastopol) is located fifteen kilometers from the city center.  Finding it is quite simple - you need to drive a little northwest of Cape Fiolent, at Cape Chersonese.  The uniqueness of the Cossack Bay is that it is surrounded on three sides by the sea. </p><p>  Of course, due to its location, this recreation area cannot please visitors with warm water.  Even in the hot season, the water here gives life-giving coolness.  This is due to the fact that Sevastopol already belongs to the South Coast of Crimea, or, as it is called in abbreviated form, to the South Coast. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The name of this place originated in the eighteenth century.  This can be established by the fact that Sumarokov, the author of many books about travels to Taurida, mentioned this name in his works.  However, in Sevastopol he was only once, in 1801. </p><p>  According to historians, the name of the area Cossack Bay arose during the war with Turkey in the seventeenth century.  Cossack pickets were placed along the coast, one of them was in this bay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Cape Chersonesus</span> witnessed many sad events during the war of 1941-1945, as well as the Cossack Bay located at it.  Sevastopol was not spared a wave of battles.  In the 42nd year, it was in this bay that the numerous defenders of the city departed.  In a narrow strip were several tens of thousands of people, most of whom were injured. </p><p>  Left without their leadership, many fighters threw into the sea and sailed in an unknown direction.  However, many defenders continued to fight to the last with their enemy.  It was from this cape that all the defenders of Sevastopol left their city. </p><p>  At the end of the war, German units were dropped from this cape into the raging Black Sea.  It was a kind of judgment day, which happened on Cossack Bay.  Sevastopol was liberated from the invaders.  In honor of this event, the Victory Monument was erected on the cape. </p><p>  The entire area around the Cossack Bay was previously occupied by various military facilities.  Now at military training grounds are cozy summer cottages and mini-pensions for vacationers. </p><h2>  Bay Attractions </h2>
