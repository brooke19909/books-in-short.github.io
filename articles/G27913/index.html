    <h2>  Church and folk calendars </h2><p>  From the foregoing, it can be seen that the arrival dates of autumn according to ancient calendars coincide with <span>church holidays.</span>  The Nativity of the Virgin, which is celebrated for six days, falls on the Slavic festival of Autumn, which is celebrated for a whole week. </p><p>  The calendar among the Slavs was rather agricultural, this is reflected in the name of the months, customs, signs.  The latter are often associated with the seasons, terrain and climate.  So there was some disagreement about the date of the fall.  According to ancient calendars, the same months were called differently by different peoples: for example, both November and October were called deciduous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dates of the arrival of autumn according to the ancient calendars of the peoples of Tatarstan" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2629/1069986.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autumn holidays in Tatarstan </h2><p>  The dates of autumn according to the ancient calendars of the peoples of Tatarstan do not have clear boundaries, as they are not tied to the national agricultural calendar.  But nevertheless, several holidays associated with the arrival of autumn can be distinguished. </p><p>  Sembele is a holiday of labor among the Tatars, rooted in antiquity.  On this day, harvesting from the fields was celebrated, people rested after hard work.  Boys and girls looked closely at each other - it was believed that Sambela was preceded by a wedding time.  On this day, tables were laid, dances were performed and songs were sung. </p><p>  The Salamat festival is very similar to it, it was also timed to the harvest.  Unlike Sembele, on this day they did not hold festivities, but celebrated in the family circle.  The main dish is pastries made from wheat flour, fried in milk - salamat, which may be the name of the holiday. </p>
