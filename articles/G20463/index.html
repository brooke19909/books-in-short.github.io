    <p>  In accounting, there is such a thing as synthetic accounting.  What is its essence? </p><p>  Synthetic accounts include those that reflect only generalized indicators about all accounting objects.  Accounting in this system of accounts is called ‚Äúsynthetic accounting‚Äù.  All data here is only in monetary terms. </p><p>  Analytical accounts include those that are opened for the development of synthetic accounts and the accumulation of certain data.  Such accounting in this system of accounts is called "analytical".  In this system, calculations are carried out both in terms of value and in labor and physical meters.  Recording of <span>business transactions is</span> made only on the basis of <span>primary documentation.</span>  The data of this accounting are the basis for specifying the data on which the synthetic accounting is based.  Information is accumulated on <span>accounting</span> cards <span>(materials,</span> fixed assets, creditors, debtors), in <span>statements (payment,</span> settlement, materials, balance sheets), in barn books.  All information is grouped, accumulated, and the results are reflected in the generalizing magazines, orders, machinegrams, General Ledger, necessary for conducting synthetic accounting. </p><p>  Analytical accounts reflecting the movement of funds are recorded in value and physical terms.  On the same accounts, which reflect the movement of sources of any household assets, only cash is recorded. </p><p>  Analytical and synthetic accounting are closely related.  So, the sum of the initial and final balance, debit and credit turnover of any of the analytical accounts is equal to the sum of the initial and final balance, debit and credit turnover of any synthetic account. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no analytical accounting for cash.  Several complex synthetic accounts without intermediate groups are directly related to analytical ones.  Such a system for constructing accounting does not always allow obtaining the necessary indicators, since among synthetic accounts there are those that consist of a whole group of analytical accounts. </p><p>  Among the many data necessary for accounting, one of the most important is information about fixed assets.  The most common form of information carrier about them are inventory cards.  Synthetic and analytical <span>accounting of fixed assets is</span> performed by persons who are responsible for their safety at the location (materially responsible persons). </p><p>  Analytical accounting at enterprises is carried out on various inventory objects.  On the front side of the inventory card indicate: number;  year of issue or construction of the facility;  number and date of the act of admission;  location;  initial cost;  rate and amount of depreciation;  information about internal movements;  reason for disposal.  On the reverse side, information is presented on the costs and the date of completion, additional equipment, modernization, reconstruction, repair work, a brief description of this object. </p><p>  Inventory cards are often used for group accounting of the same type of items that have the same characteristics, cost, purpose, and also entered into operation at the same time. </p><p>  Synthetic accounting is carried out on account 01, which is called "Fixed assets".  It is intended to reflect generalized data.  This account reflects information on all objects that are in operation, rent, stock, trust management, for conservation.  In addition to this <span>account, synthetic</span> accounting is conducted on such: </p><p>  - 02 ‚ÄúDepreciation‚Äù. </p><p>  - 08 ‚ÄúInvestments in non-current assets‚Äù. </p><p>  The debit of account 01 reflects the balance at the reporting date and acquired fixed assets.  Their disposal at historical cost is recognized on credit. </p>
