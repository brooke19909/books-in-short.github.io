  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Land Rover a9: description, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, not just smart phones have come into fashion, but devices designed for those who lead an active restless lifestyle, who consider extreme and constant attacks on nature to be the norm.  For such people, the Land Rover a9 smartphone was released, preserving the best technical and design traditions of its predecessor, the eighth model, and using a more modern filling than the eight.  This is a new, improved model that we will consider today. </p><h2>  Design and performance of the new model </h2><p>  We will provide information about the Land Rover a9 in comparison with its predecessor.  The first thing worth noting is the desire to keep up with the trends of modern fashion.  For this reason, the display diagonal has been increased to 4.3 inches.  Although this value is far from the most outstanding, but not far behind.  Looking at the declared characteristics, we can state a very important fact: by doubling the number of cores (from two to four) and the amount of RAM up to 1 GB, the phone‚Äôs performance was doubled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover a9" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/606123.jpg" width="600"></div>  Developing a secure Land Rover a9 smartphone, the designers slightly changed the design of the front panel.  The mechanical buttons used to navigate the menu were removed from it.  On the one hand, it turned out to be a more pleasant design for visual perception, on the other - an annoying omission.  But the appearance has become more attractive from this decision.

So the capacity of 3000 mAh remained.  There is a specific, albeit so far not very relevant change: Land Rover a9 smartphones have NFC, a modern short-range communication module that allows you to open doors and pay for travel by public transport using your phone.  It is clear that for the module to function fully, it is necessary to have a mate - terminals that would understand NFC, as well as doors with electronic locks and built-in NFC tags. </p>

    <p>  Nothing special can be said about the camera.  The quality of the images is consistent with current market conditions and satisfies most users.  The resolution of the module is 8 megapixels.  The GPS function, which has become standard for all modern devices, is fully implemented and can work independently even in those places where high-quality Internet and communication cannot be provided. </p><h2>  Phone Protection Level </h2><p>  The protection level of the Land Rover a9 we are considering is high (IP-68) and helps to cope well with exposure to water and dust.  This device behaves quite worthy even in water, calmly withstands immersion in it to a depth of one meter and lasting up to 30 minutes.  But these clear and precise designations of time and depth must be strictly adhered to, which is caused by very fragile materials that protect microphones and speakers from moisture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone land rover a9" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/606124.jpg" width="600"></div>  The thinnest membranes stretch under prolonged exposure to water overpressure and can break, while flooding and spoiling the device‚Äôs electronic circuits.  In all other places where moisture can enter, double special gaskets are installed.  It turns out that the plug for charging sockets and headphones, a battery cover, half of the case are provided for reliability with two gaskets at once.  In principle, the consumer receives an updated smartphone, which is a hit in the market of phones with protection.
