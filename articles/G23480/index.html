  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the car: the question remains open</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although it is generally accepted that the history of the car is associated with the names of Karl Benz and <span>Gottlieb Daimler,</span> they are not pioneers.  Even if you do not take into account those designers and inventors who, long before the first horseless carriage made a lot of efforts to create such a mechanism, there are still a number of people who are undeservedly oblivious, but who are directly related to the fact that cars have now become an integral part human life.  Let's try to pay tribute to the justice of their memory and open the secret veil, which envelops the history of the creation of the car. </p><p>  And the first story of the creation of the car belongs to the famous <span>Isaac Newton.</span>  It was he who in 1680 in his works on mechanics described the first steam crew.  Today's designers are surprised that in his model there are practically no inaccuracies or errors.  The only problem, apparently, was the requirement of a high pressure of steam in order for the machine to move. </p><p>  In the XVII century, he was a contemporary of the brilliant Newton and was in the service of one of the <span>Chinese emperors, a</span> physicist and astronomer of Belgian origin Ferdinand Ferbist.  So he was the one who owned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a cart on four wheels, which was driven by a steam boiler.  The first prototype of the car was only 60 centimeters long and was made as a toy for the little son of the Chinese ruler.  And most importantly - he successfully moved. </p><p>  The history of the car is replete with its discoverers.  And among them are such famous personalities who lived in the XVIII century, like James Watt - the author of the first stationary steam engine, his successor and student William Murdoch, who made a piston <span>steam engine,</span> Symington, who designed the passenger steam engine, which has the right to be called a real car, Trevitik, whose the steam engine reached speeds of up to 8 km / h, the creators of the all-wheel drive steam engine Burstall and Hill.  It was at these discoveries that <span>Karl Benz</span> and Henry Daimler were able to create their <span>first car</span> on a gasoline engine.  Making a digression, we can say that it was at this time that the story of the creation of the Chrysler Firepower car, one of the most modern types of passenger cars, was laid. </p><p>  The history of mechanical engineering in Russia also begins in the 19th century.  The founders of engineering plants we also had foreigners.  The first of them was built in St. Petersburg, then in Moscow.  By the middle of the century, more than 25 engineering plants had already begun to operate in Russia.  Their growth stimulated the development of rail and water links.  The Baltic states and the central regions of Russia were added to the main centers of mechanical engineering. </p><p>  The history of mechanical engineering in Russia has many glorious pages that we can rightfully be proud of.  Such engineering giants as Nevsky and Putilovsky, Bryansky and Kolomensky, Sormovsky and Lugansky, Kharkov and Botkinsky factories provided machines not only domestic but also foreign technology needs.  Developed agricultural, military, machine tool and automotive engineering.  So the <span>industrial revolution</span> was also committed within our country. </p><p>  Modern engineering, of course, cannot be compared with the period described above.  This is evidenced by the amazing story of the creation of the Chrysler Firepower car, which is the representative of the best line of American models that exist today.  This is the machine of the future, which I want to say right away, at a glance at it.  It is an impeccable option, starting with painting with the inclusion of polished aluminum elements and ending with surface modeling using an innovative computer program. </p>
