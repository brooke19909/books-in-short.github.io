Doge's Palace Plan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the distant past, there was no stronger state in the entire Mediterranean than Venice.  Many years have passed, and now this city attracts to these places not various merchants and invaders, but a huge number of tourists from all over the world who want to enjoy the amazing splendor of the Venetian sights. </p><p>  One of them is a masterpiece of architecture, presented in the Gothic style - the Doge's Palace.  For many hundreds of years, it served as a residence for the city government and even managed to visit the role of the premises where republican councils had previously held meetings.  We learn about this world famous building from this article. </p><h2>  Foundation and reconstruction </h2><p>  Doge's Palace (Italy) began its existence in the X century, but the structure was periodically subjected to devastating fires.  Therefore, the structure in our time has a completely different look than the one that he had over a millennium ago. </p>

A large moat was built around it, and huge watchtowers towered everywhere.  Over time, it was all destroyed to the ground by a strong fire.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the middle of the XIV century, construction began on the most recognizable southern part of the building, which offers a wonderful panorama.  Then the Government of Venice decided that all city power should be in a luxurious and presentable place, so the choice fell on the Doge's Palace.  The history of this building suggests that for some time there was a secret police and chancellery. </p><p>  At the end of the 16th century, this building suffered from a new fire that completely wiped out its entire southern wing.  After Italian architects, it was decided to create a palace that would inspire reverence and awe to all foreign ambassadors.  Thanks to this, it becomes clear why this Venetian landmark has such luxurious decoration and impresses with its splendor. </p><h2>  The appearance of the structure </h2><p>  When you look at the Doge‚Äôs palace, it seems that its facade consists of various elements of architecture that have absolutely no connection with each other.  But at the same time, the building looks amazing, attracting the attention of any visitor. </p><p>  All finishing work of the building was carried out mainly at the end of the 15th century.  At this time, just the Gothic style was gradually replaced by the era of harmonious Renaissance.  Therefore, the facade is dominated by architectural rounded shapes, shimmering in sunlight with various shades of marble. </p>

In the 19th century, the unification of <span>the Republic of Venice</span> and Italy was announced from this place. </p><h2>  Palace Description </h2><p>  The style of the Doge's Palace is presented in different architectural directions.  The first tier of the structure is specially designed to give the building a certain lightness, but this is only at first glance.  Doge's Palace is held by 36 huge columns.  And on the second tier of the building there are much more of them, but they are smaller in diameter.  The front part of the structure remotely resembles an inverted ship.  In its courtyard there are several floors of beautiful galleries.  You can go there through different gates, some of them are called Paper.  They are so called because the local authorities once hung their decrees here. </p><p>  In the north wing there are many statues of various famous philosophers, and it was this part of the building that used to be the doge's apartment in the old days.  Here in the corners are the archangels, symbolizing war, trade and peace. </p>

    <h2>  Council of Ten Hall, Armory </h2><p>  The Council of Ten Hall hosted meetings of powerful representatives of the city government, which touched on issues of state security.  In this room, the ceiling is decorated with two magnificent Veronese paintings. </p><p>  In the next room - the Armory, there is a mailbox, which at one time served for anonymous denunciations.  From there, a large wooden door leads to the Hall of State Inquisitors, and immediately after it there is a room where torture was carried out, as well as prison cells. </p><h2>  Great Council Hall </h2><p>  The length of this room is 54 meters, so this room is considered the largest not only in the city, but throughout the country.

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It turns out that next to the palace is the largest prison in the whole city, which is separated from this magnificent structure by only a narrow canal with a covered bridge. </p><p>  This building is considered to be one of a kind, during the construction of which no rules of architecture were used at all. </p><p>  Interestingly, for many centuries, escaping from prison in the palace was considered simply impossible.  Everyone was sure of this, until Giacomo Casanova was there.  Together with his friend, he managed on the second attempt to be free.  He described this incident in his memoirs. </p><p>  This palace is depicted in the picture of the famous artist Francesco Guardi, which is currently in the National Gallery of London. </p><p>  After visiting the palace, only bright and warm memories remain.  This is undoubtedly a very beautiful building.  A tour of this building resembles a walk through medieval Venice, so thousands of tourists come here every year.  I would like to believe that in our difficult time every inhabitant of the planet will find the opportunity to visit this magical place and enjoy the grandeur and grandeur of the Doge's Venetian palace. </p>
