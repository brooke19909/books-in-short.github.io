Schoolchildren are especially happy about this time of year.  Indeed, during the holidays, many guys go to camps.  It can be school health centers, or it can be suburban, and the latter are organized in many regions of the country.  Especially a lot of them on the coast of the Black and Azov Seas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the name of the units in the camp" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10527/243530.jpg" width="350"></div>  In summer camps, children play, swim in the sea, go on excursions and go hiking, and also participate in various contests and quizzes.  Wherever the camp is located and whatever it is, there is something in common for all children's health centers - the presence of units.  All children are divided into such groups (most often by age criterion), as in school, into classes.  It is necessary to come up with the name of the units.  <span>In the camp, children</span> take part in contests, representing exactly their team.

    <p>  <strong>How to name the squad?</strong> </p><p>  The popular cartoon character Captain Vrungel was not in vain thinking that as you call a boat, it will sail.  This opinion applies to detachment groups.  A competently selected name of the units in the camp, taking into account the characteristics of this collective of children, can largely determine their mood and success throughout the entire shift.  What should be the name?  Of course, it must meet certain criteria: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  match the age of the children in the unit; </li><li>  carry semantic load; </li><li>  be easy to pronounce so that it can be clearly chanted by the choir; </li><li>  reflect the common interests of children, their aspirations. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes thematic shifts are held in health centers.  In this case, the name of the units in the camp should overlap with the chosen topic.  For example, in shifts of historical orientation, units with the following names would be appropriate: ‚ÄúKnights‚Äù, ‚ÄúVikings‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpartans‚Äù, etc.  If the direction associated with fairy tales is chosen, then the names of the units must be fabulous.  In the event that the topic is not defined, you just need to include your imagination, imagination.  Of course, the leader needs to come up with the children with the names of the units in the camp.  But at the same time, it is necessary to "keep up" several ready-made names, guiding the guys to the choice of a beautiful name.  This is especially true for younger groups, in which children due to their age are unlikely to offer an interesting option.  The skillful tactful help of the counselor is very important here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camp squad name motto" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/246276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>The motto of the squad is also important!</strong> </p><p>  So, the name of the squads in the camp was invented, but the children's team also needs its own motto - the rechka, which explains the name of the squad and gives its brief description.  For instance: </p><ol><li>  Worms.  Break the hooks - we are all super-worms! </li><li>  "Sun".  We shine at night and during the day, we never get tired! </li><li>  Energizer.  Movement is life! </li><li>  "Constellation".  We are all stars! </li><li>  "Ducklings."  On a clear day and in slush, we like to quack loudly! </li><li>  "Champions".  For victory ahead - let no one lag behind! </li></ol>

    <p>  All children love summer camp.  The name of the detachment, the motto, its own detachment song - all these attributes help to <span>unite the team,</span> designed not only to organize the guys, but also to include them in one exciting general game. </p><p>  It is necessary to tune the children in the right way: read books with them, sing songs on the chosen topic.  Then the inspired guys themselves will be able to offer the correct name for the units in the summer camp, compose a chanting motto and even pick up their own squad song.  And then the children will spend the summer in the camp just as merrily and amicably, with a good squad name and a soulful song. </p>
