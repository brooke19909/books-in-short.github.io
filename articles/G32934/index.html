This price category is the most optimal for those who do not pursue fashion and prestige, but dream of a high-quality and powerful smartphone.  Smart technology manufacturers have something to offer their customers. </p><h2>  Smartphone Acer Liquid Z630 </h2><p>  Acer is better known for producing quality computer hardware.  Fans of the Taiwanese manufacturer should be pleased with the Liquid Z630 smartphone.  The gadget is large enough, due to the impressive size of the screen (5.5 inches), which occupies almost the entire front panel.  16 GB of internal, of course, is not the most solid indicator, but the possibility of using a flash card will solve the problem.  But the 4000 mAh battery looks very attractive.  When operating in moderate mode, you can count on 2-3 days of operation without charging. </p><p>  Of particular interest are the cameras.  Both the front and the main have 8 megapixels.  Of course, for the main optics this is a very mediocre indicator.  But if you need phones up to 15 thousand with a good selfie camera, you will like this option.  Fans of the brand will be pleased with a large number of branded applications that come out of the box. </p><p>  The main complaints are related to design.  The device looks a little bulky.  The speaker has an unusual round shape that cannot be called stylish.  The lower frame is almost completely occupied by the company logo, although it would be more reasonable to place control keys on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone LG G4s H736 </h2><p>  LG G4s H736 is a pretty good phone up to 15 thousand.  This device has 2 main advantages - an interesting "space" design and a powerful processor for as many as 8 cores.  A high-quality screen shows a juicy picture.  The main camera gives good quality photos.  Nevertheless, it does not reach other devices in its price category. <br><br>  If you plan to purchase this unit, you should be aware of its shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  the amount of RAM is only 1.5 GB; </li><li>  the internal volume is sorely lacking, and the device supports flash cards of no more than 32 GB, which will not be enough for an advanced user who likes to take photos, listen to music and watch videos; </li><li>  a 2300 mAh battery cannot provide long battery life without being connected to a charger; </li><li>  When installing updates to the operating system, the phone starts to noticeably "slow down". </li></ul><h2>  <span>Smartphone ASUS</span> ZenFone 3 Max </h2><p>  Considering phones up to 15 thousand with a good camera, you can not get past ASUS ZenFone 3 Max.  Another Taiwanese manufacturer of computer technology is confidently conquering the smartphone market.  The device is running the 6th version of the Android OS and is equipped with a large 5.2-inch screen.  With these parameters, the battery capacity of 4130 mAh promises decent autonomy. <br><br>  The main 13-megapixel camera makes pretty good shots.  The color reproduction is good, the results are decent even in low light.  But you should not expect miracles from the 5-megapixel front camera.  An additional advantage will be the presence of a fingerprint scanner. <br><br>  As for the design, it is concise and sophisticated.  But it is worth noting the irrational use of the front panel.  Instead of placing the control buttons on the bottom, they were brought to the screen.  But it can not but rejoice at the location of the volume control key on the side, unlike many smartphones of this manufacturer, in which this element is located on the rear panel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone Huawei Ascend P6 </h2><p>  Phones up to 15 thousand with a good camera and stylish design are released by Huawei.  Ascend P6 is a great gadget for fans of minimalism, because its screen is quite small (4.7 inches).  Despite the fact that the main camera has 8 megapixels, it takes quite decent pictures.  The 2000 mAh battery looks a little modest. <br><br>  The manufacturer has focused on stylish design.  The metal case looks elegant and expensive.  However, this is not the most productive gadget in its price category.  If you are looking for a powerful and functional smartphone, for the same price you can find more attractive options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone Lenovo Vibe X2 </h2><p>  Good phones within 15 thousand offers customers <span>Lenovo.</span>  <span>Vibe X2</span> has a bright attractive design, but its main advantage is, of course, the "filling".  The processor on 8 cores provides fast and smooth operation.  The main 13-megapixel camera takes luxurious pictures that you can view on a high-quality 5-inch display.  The internal memory of 13 GB can not but rejoice. <br><br>  But not without flaws.  The battery capacity of 2300 mAh is hardly enough for 1.5 days of moderate use.  In addition, the device starts to get very hot even with a small load.  The stylish bright case is assembled very poorly, and therefore begins to creak after a couple of months of operation. </p><h2>  Smartphone Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) </h2><p>  Good phones up to 15 thousand offers its loyal fans of <span>Samsung.</span>  <span>Galaxy J5</span> (2016) is one of the most popular models of the past year.  Speaking about the advantages of the device, users note the following points: </p><ul><li>  elegant design, not inferior to flagship devices; </li><li>  metal frame; </li><li>  main 13 megapixel camera; </li><li>  LED illumination of the front camera; </li><li>  separate slot for flash cards; </li><li>  powerful battery at 3100 mAh; </li><li>  the ability to set the maximum brightness level with one click for good visibility in sunny weather; </li><li>  The latest version of the Android OS. </li></ul><p>  Of course, not without flaws.  So, the manufacturer decided to equip the updated version of the smartphone with an old processor.  This affects the speed of work.  The absence of a light sensor forces the user to adjust the brightness level independently.  Missing event indicator is missing.  Another unpleasant moment for photo lovers will be the lack of the ability to voice control the camera. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best camera phone up to 15 thousand 2016" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1680768.jpg" width="511"></div>  Smartphone ZTE Blade X9 LTE </h2><p>  Excellent phones within 15 thousand are offered by ZTE.  Blade X9 LTE ‚Äã‚Äãbelongs to the category of tablet phones.  The huge screen has FullHD resolution, which provides a lively and juicy picture.  The modern processor provides excellent video playback quality and makes it possible to install "heavy" games.  Both the main and front cameras (respectively, 13 and 5 megapixels) give excellent images at the output. </p><h2>  Smartphone Apple iPhone 4S (8 GB) </h2><p>  Many mistakenly believe that among the "apple" gadgets you can not find phones with a good camera up to 15 thousand.  The only model that has already migrated to the budget category is the Apple iPhone 4S (8 GB).  Of course, by today's standards, this device has a too small screen (3.5 inches) and 512 MB of RAM looks unconvincing. <br><br>  Given the fact that the device was released in 2011, 8 GB of memory is pretty good.  A camera with 8 megapixels gives wonderful pictures at the output. But this option is suitable only for those for whom it is fundamentally important to have the coveted apple logo on your smartphone.  In general, paying 13-14 thousand for a device with similar indicators is extremely unreasonable. </p>

    <h2>  Smartphone Sony Xperia Z </h2><p>  What phone to buy for 15 thousand?  It is worth paying attention to the flagship models of past years.  So, in 2013, the Sony <span>Xperia Z</span> <span>smartphone</span> was especially <span>popular</span> <span>.</span> The device is equipped with an excellent 5-inch screen with a pixel density of 441 per inch.  This is even better than the iPhone 5S (326 dpi).  A high-quality housing is designed so that neither dust nor water penetrates inside and does not interfere with the operation of the device. <br><br>  The main advantage of the device is, of course, a 13-megapixel camera, which today is one of the best on the market.  16x zoom allows you to shoot distant objects with high quality.  A 4-core processor and 2 GB of RAM in the complex provide good performance.  The amount of internal memory is 16 GB.  The device supports flash cards, but no more than 64 GB, which may seem insufficient for an advanced user. <br><br>  For 3 years, the price of the gadget dropped from 30 to 14-15 thousand.  And this is not surprising, because a battery of 3200 mAh will not hit anyone.  In addition, the device comes with an outdated version of the OS ("Android 4.2.1").  The manufacturer promises to update the software to version 4.4, but this does not allow to "fill the price" for this smartphone. </p><h2>  Smartphone Samsung Galaxy Note II </h2><p>  Which phone is better for 15 thousand?  Many experienced users recommend looking at the models of past years.  So, another worthy representative of the "old guard" is the Samsung Galaxy Note II.  It was released back in 2012 and immediately became mega-popular.  Then it cost 30 thousand, and now its price ranges from 15 thousand. <br><br>  It was one of the first "shovels" with a large 5.5-inch display.  The main feature of the model is the presence of a stylus, which allows you to create handwritten notes and drawings.  A 4-core processor and 2 GB of RAM are fully consistent with modern requirements.  And the 3100 mAh battery provides quite a long battery life. </p>

The display, made using Super AMOLED technology, despite its modest resolution (960 by 540), shows a colorful and rich picture.  Only the battery failed.  A full charge of a 1900 mAh battery is hardly enough for a day of moderate work. </p><h2>  Smartphone Lenovo Vibe P1m </h2><p>  Lenovo Vibe P1m, despite the low price, provides users with a lot of opportunities for work and entertainment.  So, the elegant case has a coating that protects the device from moisture.  Build quality, using durable plastic.

But too high-quality selfies from the front 5-megapixel camera should not be expected.  If 16 GB of internal memory is not enough for you, you can expand it with a flash card. </p>
