  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ulyanovsk: Lenin Square, the connection of times</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The middle of the 17th century was troubled for the Russian Empire, the reigning emperor Alexei Mikhailovich was forced to simultaneously conduct military operations on several fronts.  From the west, the troubled Rzeczpospolita annoyed, hostilities were fought with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a struggle was waged with the Swedes over Livonia.  Not everything remained calm in the East.  The raids of nomadic tribes continued.  By decree of the tsar in 1648, on the high Volga coast, 846 kilometers from Moscow, a new fortress Sinbirsk was laid.  It was necessary to strengthen the eastern borders. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  A wooden Kremlin shaped like a regular quadrangle was laid on top of the Sinbir Mountain.  The center designated, as was the norm in the Orthodox kingdom, a temple.  Some researchers claim that the word "Sinbir" itself has Turkic roots - it means a sacred mountain, on which stands an idol, a pagan temple.  It was he who was replaced by the Orthodox Cathedral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ulpressa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral in Simbirsk" class="if uuid-2506190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506190.jpg"></div><p>  Later the city was renamed, began to be called Simbirsk, which remained until 1924.  After the death of the leader of the October Revolution, it was decided to call his hometown Ulyanovsk.  The temples were demolished, Lenin Square arose.  Ulyanovsk on the site of the historical center received a rectangle with a monument to the great fellow countryman and the building of the regional administration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Walk around the city </h2><p>  For many decades, the city kept faithfully the memory of its fellow countryman.  Everything here is saturated with the name of Lenin.  During the heyday of the Soviet Union, numerous pilgrim tourists flocked to see where the childhood of the leader of the revolution passed.  The entire city center was transformed, became a monument named after one person.  So Ulyanovsk developed.  Lenin Square became its center.  The government building of the Ulyanovsk region with its magnificent facade, from the west looks at the rectangle of the square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guidesearcher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin monument" class="if uuid-2506174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506174.jpg"></div><p>  A monument to the Revolution Leader is looking at her from the east.  In the north, it is limited by the P. A. Stolypin Agricultural Academy, in the south - by the Ulyanovsk Regional Clinical Hospital for Veterans and the Church of the Introduction of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the temple in Simbirsk. </p><p>  A smile of history.  For more than two hundred years, the holy cathedral stood on the site of ancient idols.  It was destroyed, and the idol returned to its place.  In less than a hundred years, the Lenin Square of Ulyanovsk began to transform again. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.313669" data-lng="48.40250839999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/7/2/8/3728.png"></div><h2>  Ongoing activities </h2><p>  In the name of Lenin, everything is saturated here.  Many more chieftain fans visit this city.  Each resident of the city will tell you how to get to Lenin Square in Ulyanovsk.  This place remains a favorite recreation area and citywide events.  Moreover, wonderful parks adjoin the square from the Volga side: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Friendship between nations; </li><li>  Lenin Hills; </li><li>  Vladimir Garden. </li></ul><p>  Here Ulyanovsk holds all its city-wide events, City Day, people celebrate New Year, celebrates Shrovetide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eparhia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Parade in Ulyanovsk" class="if uuid-2506179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506179.jpg"></div><p>  The celebration of the great Victory Day with a parade and salute remains unchanged. </p><p>  But the shoots of the new Ulyanovsk make their way.  The spirit of the people is reborn.  A dead stone gains life.  The address disappeared from the city map - Ulyanovsk, Lenin Square.  The old name has returned - Cathedral Square. </p><h2>  Centenary Square since the birth of V.I. Lenin </h2><p>  Along with civil events in the city, where almost all the churches were destroyed at the beginning of the last century, funeral services for victims of the Great Patriotic War are held.  The former Lenin Square of Ulyanovsk, and now the Cathedral Square, in 2018 for the first time connected the past and the present.  It is symbolic that the Victory Day is the first event held after renaming.  It is expected that after the parade, festivities will begin.  Ulyanovsk Cathedral Square will become a large cinema hall, concert venues will begin to work, and the Derzhavin brass band will play. </p><p>  The main thing is that the merits of fathers and grandfathers should not be forgotten.  It is impossible to break the connection of times.  History must be kept.  The city still has many places associated with the memory of the great leader.  We can hope that a new address will appear on the city map - Lenin Square, Ulyanovsk.  Moreover, there is a suitable candidate for this role for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="73region.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square named after the 100th anniversary of V.I. Lenin" class="if uuid-2506177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2506177.jpg"></div><p>  It is difficult to pronounce the Centenary Square from the birthday of V.I. Lenin.  Everything breathes here in the name of the leader, a huge memorial complex was built - the apartment-museum of V.I. Lenin.  Well, if he becomes the center of memory of a great country, unreasonably destroyed by the descendants of the genius of the revolution.  It is here that the broken chains of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Soviet Union and the new era will unite. </p>
