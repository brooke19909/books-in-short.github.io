    <p>  The US currency is today the world's reserve and is the most common.  Nevertheless, few know about its origin, but it is quite interesting.  The history of the dollar dates back more than one century, and its very name is much older than the <span>United States of America.</span> </p><p>  According to the official version, the word ‚Äúdollar‚Äù comes from the Joachimtaler - coins that were minted in the Czech town of Joachimstal.  This city was in the kingdom belonging to <span>the Habsburg dynasty.</span>  Later, Joachimtaler began to be called simply thaler.  These coins were circulated in many European countries and gradually migrated to the New World. </p><p>  It should be noted that the word meaning now the American currency is mentioned even before the first settlers reached the shores of the American continent.  For example, in several Shakespeare's plays, heroes are paid in dollars, so there is no complete certainty about the appearance of this currency in America. </p><p>  The history of the dollar is so confused that scientists are still puzzling over the resolution of this historical paradox.  For a long time, German thalers, <span>British pounds,</span> Spanish silver reals were in use in America.  It was <span>silver coins that</span> began to be called dollars.  After the North American States became an independent state, a new monetary unit was required, which was completely different from the currency of other states, especially those that prevented the declaration of independence. </p><p>  During the Continental Congress of the United States, held on June 6, 1785, a decision was made and approved on a new monetary currency - the dollar.  This proposal was submitted by Thomas Jefferson, who actually becomes the father of this national currency.  From this moment begins the history of the US dollar, which will soon be 230 years old.  In 1792, a <span>mint was</span> created in the city of Philadelphia <span>,</span> which began minting the first American coins in 1794.  Only in 1863 did paper money begin to print. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interesting Facts: </p><p>  The United States issued the first banknotes, which were denominated in 5, 10, and 20 dollars.  The following year, one-dollar bills appeared.  They began to call them "greenbacks" or "green backs", since on the back they were green.  To this day, the word "bucks" is often used in popular speech.  In Russia, the slang term ‚Äúgreens‚Äù, also taken from the same expression, has also taken root. </p><p>  The history of the dollar is of great interest to counterfeiters, who fake this currency with enviable regularity.  The US government spends a lot of money every year to fight these ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù </p><p>  American paper money owes its appearance to a native of Russia, the artist Sergey Makronovsky, who proposed the design of these notes. </p><p>  Until now, most banknotes have their original appearance.  Only in 1996, this design was slightly changed in order to best protect against fakes. </p><p>  The history of the US dollar is the history of America, depicted on banknotes of various denominations.  The images of the White House, the Capitol, <span>the Lincoln Memorial</span> and the Philadelphia Independence Hall, located on them, are the buildings in which the most important events in the history of this country took place.  Americans have been familiar with the history of the dollar since childhood, since their life depends entirely on the thickness of the bundle of these banknotes, since making money is the main task of a 100% American. </p><p>  We give below no less interesting facts.  The United States prints all its currency in only two factories.  A total of 35 million banknotes of various denominations are produced annually on them.  The cost of each bill is about 6 cents.  In the United States, only one third of all cash dollars is on hand. </p>
