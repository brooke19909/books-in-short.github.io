The village is very quiet, clean and calm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiakurort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cozy houses for living" class="if uuid-2245145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2245145.jpg"></div><p>  At 40-50 m from the sea lies a beautiful street.

Vacationers complained about the unsightly and old wallpaper, broken furniture.  In addition, the rooms were poorly ventilated, there was a heavy and musty smell that spoiled the rest and mood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.otpusk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ​​view from the complex" class="if uuid-2245150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2245150.jpg"></div><p>  Another negative characteristic of b / o was pricing.

They note that they have not tried such delicious and satisfying cooking for a long time.  All dishes are very fresh, cooked in excellent sanitary conditions. </p><p>  The main positive aspect that can be summarized is that places in the complex must be booked in advance.  High demand can not appear on the second-hand, if the living conditions there are poor quality. </p>
