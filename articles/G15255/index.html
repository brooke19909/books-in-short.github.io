There was talk: a <span>sculpture of stone</span> or metal would take its place.  On August 3, 2016, on the occasion of the 450th anniversary of the city, an expressive bronze king of the sky “settled” at the railway station, striving to take off from a ball - a symbol of planet Earth.  The new eagle monument in Orel reaches four meters in height. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eagle statue in eagle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42684/1782155.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  Vasily, where was the Muse? </h2><p>  The previous visiting card of the settlement was perceived by the audience differently.  The large-headed bird from the <span>willow twigs,</span> as if descended to human fuss, delighted some with greatness, resented others with a strange guise.  The latter could not understand: why are the crows of a terrible appearance ranked among the proud family of hawks?  Is she supposed to meet and escort the guests fanned by the military and labor glory of the land?  Whatever they say, but of unusual appearance, the symbol was a success. </p><p>  An ambiguous <span>monument to the eagle in Orel was</span> created by the master of topiary sculpture Vasily Antropov, who at one time moved here from the capital of Khakassia.  Abakanets is the “parent” of another city attraction - elephants in the city park.  The kids are delighted with the green giants.  The institution’s management even intended to issue them “passports” (to establish nameplates). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People sounded wishes instead of vulnerable lawn grass to cover the surrounding area with decorative pebbles.  So far, in an impulse to approach the figures, the boys and girls trample on a living carpet. </p><h2>  I'm sorry for the bird </h2><p>  However, let us return to the topic “Monuments to the Eagle” (the description of which by local guides is fantastic).  The bronze flyer on a ball near the station was designed by the sculptor from Kursk, Yuri Kireev.  Now - this is the pride of the city.  It was as if there were no months when black clouds of danger hung over the willow "old man", and the inhabitants of the region stirred up in a single wave of protest. </p>

    <p>  I remember that the old <span>monument to the eagle in Orel</span> caused a flurry of discussions on social networks.  Excited people beat the alarm: “The feathered Central Russian handsome man is very popular among tourists!  By fame, he is ahead of the only monument in Russia dedicated to the writer Nikolai Leskov, a native of the <span>Oryol province</span> !  And suddenly remove ?!  Never!" </p><h2>  Do not disappear, legend! </h2><p>  And gift products, which are based on an unforgettable image?  And photographs in which a proud hero, even if not of a very elegant appearance, is captured in a variety of perspectives?  And the circles with the talking image?  And the myriad of magnets, decorative plates that the formidable predator looks from? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Local designers objected: all this can not be compared with the shortcomings of the statue.  The eagle statue in Oryol - this unforgettable crown of “straw creativity” - not only spoils the view of the square, but interferes with the view: it is impossible to admire the Palace of Culture of the railway workers because of it.  A miracle just needs to be "deported"!  Among the opponents were those who argued: a more aesthetic sign would not fit into the architectural appearance of the place where the flower bed was originally envisaged. </p><h2>  Eagle - hero of the day </h2><p>  The public failed to turn the tide: the newcomer “flew”.  The former (from the rods) was installed where “everyone entering” sees it in the 909th quarter.  It is believed that displacement almost deprived the figure of greatness and glory.  It is quiet, peaceful.  A kind of sweet heart retro. </p>

    <p>  Most of the townspeople and visitors consider: having retained the zest, the authorities acted wisely.  Recycling the past is easy, but is it always necessary?  Respect for the past, as a rule, is much better than "sweeping" innovations.  Breaking - not building. </p><p>  Being in the topic of “topiary” collisions, some travelers are not in the know: there is another monument “Eagle”.  In Orel, his address is known to many: Kromskoye Shosse, 4, Shopping Center of the GRINN Megacomplex.  The sculpture group is installed near the Boyarskoye cafe. </p><h2>  Founding Eagle </h2><p>  This monument to the <span>eagle in Orel</span> is five meters high.  The author is the same - Yuri Kireev (the inspirer of "eagle undertakings" - businessman Nikolai Greshilov).  The construction was installed on April 28, 2016, on the eve of the 450th anniversary of the ancient fortress (the date of the founding of Orel is 1566, the city’s birthday is celebrated on August 5). </p><p>  According to legend, Ivan the Terrible traveled around the borders of the state and made a stop at the confluence of the Oka and Orlik rivers.  The place was liked by the Grand Duke.  An eagle flew up from the oak tree intended for the citadel.  So the name of the famous settlement of Russia was born.  History formed the basis of the composition "Founder Eagle": the master of heaven holds a letter in his claws, next to him are two serving people of the king (archers).  An impressive sight. </p>

    <p>  However, many tourists prefer the "Eagle-anniversary".  On the wave of comparisons, they assure: the station building itself looks like a bird, ready to take off in high blue.  And what, romantic!  Nearby is a clean square, where necessary, a brand new tile floor.  The modern city is being improved.  New sights to his face! </p>
