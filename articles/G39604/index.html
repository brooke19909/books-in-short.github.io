Guests find the hotel a good location - in the center of St. Petersburg, within walking distance of Palace Square, St. Isaac's Cathedral and other attractions.  You can go for a walk along the Promenade des Anglais at night: to watch how bridges are being built. </p><p>  Many are also interested in its interior, like spacious, clean rooms, which are very different, but each is quite cozy in its own way.  All numbers, the authors of reviews assure, with their own theme, are not the same.  Residents argue that all the furniture in the rooms is solid, reliable.  Many people like large windows and high ceilings; the rooms are very spacious and comfortable.  They note the presence of comfortable double beds, good furniture with many shelves, and a minibar, which is replenished daily.  Guests also like the fact that the bathroom has underfloor heating, and not every hotel in St. Petersburg differs in this feature.  Fans of exotic note the presence of a working fireplace and firewood. </p><p>  Guests also praise breakfast (buffet): cereal, spring rolls, side dishes, fish, vegetables, fruits, pastries, jams and preserves.  According to guest reviews, everything is very tasty prepared and originally served.  They note that in the hotel restaurant you can have lunch and dinner (or order food in your room). </p>

    <p>  Separately, the authors of the reviews note that the hotel staff is polite, attentive, friendly. </p><p>  An unpleasant impression among some guests was left from the specific smell of tap water.  But it, according to the guests, to the minuses of the institution can be attributed only with a stretch. </p><p>  Guests consider the scheme of the hotel itself very funny: it consists of two separate buildings located on neighboring streets and connected by a passage through the courtyard.  Part of the hotel is with windows that offer magnificent views of the Promenade des Anglais and the river, while the other part (overlooking Galernaya street) has a view that the windows are ‚Äúcompletely absent‚Äù (in fact, guests are looking through the windows of a nearby building) .  The hotel is called "clean and comfortable" with a touch of antiquity.  Reviewers note that the hotel staff is very well trained. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Some reviewers believe that the hotel is not as magnificent as the creations of the great poet. </p><p>  Some guests find the standard rooms rather cramped.  The superior room with a fireplace, a <span>canopy over the bed</span> and furnished "antique", in general, some also left a double impression.  In their opinion, this beauty has elements of kitsch. </p><p>  The reviewers also say that they have left a rather mixed impression of staying at the hotel.  On the one hand, spacious rooms, proximity to the center, friendly staff.  On the other hand, there is some inconvenience of location: there aren‚Äôt a lot of restaurants and cafes nearby, and the restaurant in the hotel closes at ten in the evening.  Those who work until late will no longer be offered a cup of tea. </p><p>  Public transport in the immediate vicinity is also absent.  Reception is located in the building with access to the promenade, guest rooms are in another.  Before him, the porter can guide the guest through the back door along narrow courtyards.  In the rain it is quite uncomfortable. </p><p>  Guests are surprised by the number of cats in the courtyard of the hotel.  Some guests note a specific "cat" smell in the corridors of the hotel.  Others argue with them, assuring that there is no smell.  Someone jokes that Sharikov and Shvonder obviously did not live here.  At the same time, the authors of the reviews stipulate that the last comment makes the hotel only an honor.  As, however, the desire of owners and staff to support stray animals.  Someone connect this fact with the special mentality of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg - their legendary intelligence.  For the sake of acquaintance with this unique phenomenon, many guests are ready to forgive some minor disadvantages of accommodation. </p><p>  In the rooms of Happy Pushkin, according to guests, there is everything that is needed.  But it is noticeable that the situation is somewhat dilapidated, the former gloss should be updated. </p><p>  Of the undoubted advantages, it is noted that the hotel is quiet and not crowded.  Ghosts did not meet guests, but many felt the illusion of being in the past quite strongly.  Some reviewers report that they have no desire to repeat these feelings.  Among the mini-hotels in St. Petersburg, they share, there are more interesting places. </p><p>  But most guests are highly recommended to visit.  Many reviewers promise that on their next visit to St. Petersburg they will definitely stay in Happy Pushkin. </p>
