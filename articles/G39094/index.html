  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Easy weaving from a cord for beginners - schemes and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Weaving from a cord or macrame is an ancient type of craft, which consists in tying different knots.  Invented such textile art in China.  But macrame has gained popularity in all countries of the world, we will also get acquainted with simple weaving patterns, thanks to which you can craft interesting crafts, wall decorations or window and door designs.  You can make earrings and bracelets, key chains and pendants for bags from thin silk laces. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several patterns for weaving from a cord, how to make patterns in macram step by step, how to connect the main threads with workers.  We will also introduce the reader who wants to do macram√© for the first time, what materials are needed for this craft, so that weaving is not only comfortable, but also looks neat and durable. </p><h2>  The main material for weaving </h2><p>  For those who are just starting to weave macrame, you need to know how to choose the right thread for weaving.  You do not need to buy products with a pile, since the fluffy pattern is poorly visible and the work will look blurry.  Silk laces are suitable for more experienced craftsmen, since working with them is not very convenient.  They slide in the hands, and to weave a strong and strong knot, you need to make considerable efforts. </p><p>  Therefore, when weaving macram√© for beginners, it is best to take cotton cords.  They do not slip, the nodes tighten easily, and the products are neat, with a distinct pattern.  Pick two types of ropes: the first for the main thread, which should have a maximum length, and the second for the worker.  At the beginning of work, the main cord is fixed on the base.  If it is a fabric, then use pins, and if it is wooden sticks or rings, then just the thread is fixed with knots.  You will also need a flexible centimeter and scissors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basis for weaving from cords must be strong and stable.  First, try small crafts, as a basis for them you can use a dense pillow and pins. </p><h2>  Simple pattern </h2><p>  Use thick cotton cords to teach weaving.  Weaving macram√© begins with fixing the base.  Since it is represented by a straight line, it is most convenient to tie it two ends to the back of the chair.  This is the main thread, three ropes are already fastening on it, placing them as shown in the diagram under the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For this, they are folded in half, and both ends are inserted into the loop in the middle.  It remains only to tighten it tight - and weaving can begin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="macrame weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2868273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2868273.jpg"></div><p>  Work is carried out only by the middle two threads, indicated by numbers 3 and 4. When the required length of the work is reached, the edges of the main thread from the bottom and top are connected to one another and fixed with their nodes.  The ends should hang down.  Such a macrame for beginners to learn the basics of this art is quite suitable, you can make a belt or handles on a bag in this way.  If you take thin ropes, then you can arrange a bracelet on your hand with such double loops. </p><h2>  Wall panel weaving pattern </h2><p>  The beginning of weaving from cords is similar to the previous sample, only the main thread is strengthened not on a rope, but on a wooden stick.  The knots in the product are woven from 4 threads, first at the same level, and then staggered a few centimeters below.  Be sure to ensure that all the nodes in the row are on the same level, then the work will look neat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wall panel macrame" class="if uuid-2868294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2868294.jpg"></div><p>  Step-by-step instructions are given in the photo above.  When several levels are connected, the work ends, and the rest of the cords are cut with scissors so that all ends are the same size.  You can do it another way: starting from the middle to the edges, make a gradual decrease in size to make a triangle. </p><h2>  Knot "Diamond" </h2><p>  A node called "Diamond" looks very impressive.  To create it, you need to fold the rope in half and put the threads in three different directions, as shown in the figure under No. 1. Then wrap each end with a loop.  Tighten the edges of all three segments into the previous loop, and only from the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knot &quot;Diamond&quot;" class="if uuid-2868311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2868311.jpg"></div><p>  Do not tighten the knots immediately, otherwise the structure may fall apart.  Slowly tighten each knot, gradually reducing the distance to the middle.  With the last row of movements, fix it already tightly.  Such a triple knot looks beautiful on the belt from two sides. </p><h2>  Cord weaving </h2><p>  To make a bracelet, take cords of two contrasting colors.  In our sample, it is yellow and red.  The first folds in half and is fixed at the center point with a mace with a bead at the end on the pillow.  Red is wrapped around a bead and knotted around two yellow strings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cord weaving" class="if uuid-2868257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2868257.jpg"></div><p>  Further weaving takes place alternately: first they make tightenings with a yellow thread on both sides, and then again fix the middle with a red cord.  It turns out a pattern in a circle.  In a similar way, they work further until the bracelet reaches the desired size.  At the end, all the cords are tied together, and this tight knot is inserted into the initial red loop.  It turns out a kind of clasp. </p><h2>  Dense pattern for the handle on the bag </h2><p>  If you sewed a bag yourself, then such a tight handle made of ropes will definitely come in handy.  To make it simple, you need to act on the proposed scheme, following the order of numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving handles for bags" class="if uuid-2868252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2868252.jpg"></div><p>  The article gives simple patterns and tips for beginners to weave from cords.  Carefully consider the weaving patterns and act slowly, tightening each knot tightly.  You will definitely succeed, good luck! </p>
