It is located on the shore, but at the same time very close to the center of the resort village.  It is quiet, calm, very green area, clear sea and its own beach.  To get to it is not difficult, especially in season.  The main thing is to get to the city of Kherson.  This is the regional center, where many trains go.  In summer, a lot of buses, including private carriers, depart from the railway station along the route Kherson - Iron Port.  The recreation center "Mriya", as already mentioned, is located near the center, and therefore go to a stop not far.  The location of this guesthouse is extremely successful.  Nearby is a bazaar and several shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron port recreation center mriya" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1895530.jpg" width="466"></div>

    <h2>  iron Port </h2><p>  The recreation center "Mriya" is located in the resort village with a very interesting name.  It is said that there was an iron pier from which fish and grain were loaded onto ships.  Now there is no port, but the name remains.  This is an ecologically clean area located on the border of the biosphere reserve.  Of course, there is a steppe zone, there are no picturesque mountains, but there is a warm sea, healing air, huge sandy beaches that stretch for several kilometers, and large parks of sanatoriums and boarding houses.  Today, about three hundred hotels, recreation centers and guest houses are welcomed here, not to mention the private sector.  The village is located at the base of the famous <span>Tendra Spit.</span>  The depth of the sea is not very large, and it warms up quickly.  Although the absence of bays leads to the fact that there are often storms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron Port Recreation Center" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1895528.jpg" width="600"></div>

But you can order food in the dining room, which is located on the territory.  There are also several cafes - ‚ÄúArina‚Äù and ‚ÄúShkvarochka‚Äù.  To put the car, you need to pay 20 hryvnia per day.  Complex lunches and dinners in the dining room will cost 25-28 hryvnia per person.  If you order food from the menu, then this, of course, is more expensive.  How much does it cost to stay at this recreation center in the Iron Port?  The price of a room per day varies from 400-800 hryvnias per room with amenities, to <span>200 hryvnias</span> per house only with a stove and refrigerator.  There is a system of discounts.  If you relax in a budget house, then the cost of using a shower and toilet is absolutely symbolic - 50 Ukrainian cents. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Mriya (recreation center, Iron Port) is the owner of its own coast.  It is twenty meters from the houses and cottages.  The beach is sandy, with sunshades, deck chairs and sun loungers.  There is a bar, changing cabins, as well as water activities - a rental point for jet skis and catamarans.  Along the beach is the promenade, which stretches parallel to the village.  Here, in the evenings, all vacationers gather and entertainment begins.  Many interesting games for children, there is an amusement park, dance floors and restaurants - all on the seashore.  But although the base houses are literally a few meters from all these noisy entertainments, nothing is heard on the territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kherson iron port recreation center" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1895534.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If you want to take a break from the bustle of the city, but do not live on the very outskirts of the village, go to the Iron Port, to the Mriya recreation center.  Tourists write that there is a huge green area, it's nice to relax, the sea is just around the corner.  The base staff is very helpful and welcoming.  Employees will always repair what breaks, replace a burned out lamp or gas cylinder.  Vacationers praise local cafes for good and tasty cuisine.  Fish dishes are especially noted.  True, residents of budget houses complain that in public showers and toilets may not always be clean, but in the rooms themselves a little old furniture.  Often you have to contact the administration due to the shortage of the kitchen - there are not enough cutlery.  The walls are thin, especially in the case, and neighbors are audible.  If you get noisy, rest can be ruined.  But most tourists praise this base for the mass of positive emotions that it delivers to guests. </p>
