Ecostyle is incredibly popular today, so items created by your own hands are in such high demand.  Cute little things make the look fashionable, stylish and unique.  A knitted phone case emphasizes the desire for environmental friendliness, and also indicates a kind of non-conformism - a desire to go beyond the standards, become unique.  The main thing is that the accessory for a mobile phone is convenient and pleasant to the touch, protects the device from scratches and maintains a beautiful appearance for a long time. </p><h2>  Design ideas </h2><p>  The design of a knitted case for a mobile phone should correspond to the style and lifestyle of its owner.  For office employees, laconic models without extra decor, made from dark-colored yarn, are best suited.  For pupils and students who are not burdened with strict dress codes, the choice of design is much wider.  It can be styles of rich colors, with bright stripes, inserts, appliqu√©s and embroideries in the form of flowers, bows, hearts, snowflakes.  It‚Äôs a good idea to embroider your own name on the case.  Knitted phone cases in the form of funny animals or cartoon characters, books or TV shows are popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fox case" class="if uuid-2492349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2492349.jpg"></div><p>  All sorts of foxes, hares, mice, everyone‚Äôs favorite minions, smeshariki and other characters are especially relevant.  You can also make covers of different colors and change them depending on the palette of the outfit, season, mood. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Matching yarn </h2><p>  To make a quality knitted <span>phone case with your own hands,</span> it is important to choose the right yarn.  It should be strong enough, not roll up in spools, reliably protect the phone from scratches.  The best choice is natural threads made of wool or cotton: they are pleasant to the touch, look beautiful and are durable.  Acrylic yarn belongs to more budget materials, but it is short-lived: it is quickly covered with unaesthetic spools.  The problem can be solved if you regularly treat the product with a safety razor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crafthubs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful do-it-yourself case" class="if uuid-2492351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2492351.jpg"></div><p>  Covers made of fluffy threads look beautiful, but they are also not too practical: the fluff quickly erases.  In this case, yarn called "grass" will come to the rescue, it looks cute, does not roll and does not come out. </p><h2>  Color palette </h2><p>  A mobile phone is constantly in use, so the cover should be practical.  Products of light pastel colors in this case get dirty and lose their beautiful appearance, so it is best to give preference to darker, non-marking shades: gray, blue, black.  You can also use melange yarn, pollution on it will be almost invisible.  However, do not completely abandon the light colors.  A handmade product belongs to the category of budget accessories, so you can make several pieces and change them at least every day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="argentinian-queen.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="case owl" class="if uuid-2493602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2493602.jpg"></div><p>  Striped multi-colored cases look incredibly interesting and are very practical.  The most stylish color combinations are black and white, navy blue and white, blue and red, pink and blue, orange and lilac.  Neutral shades, such as beige and gray, harmoniously combine with any other colors and can be used without restrictions.  You should also consider the color scheme of the main outfit, so that the cover is in harmony with the image of its owner as a whole. </p><h2>  Crochet Case </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vjazalochka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2493621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2493621.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to crochet a phone case.  First you need to choose a yarn and hook of a suitable size, and then tie a small sample to accurately determine the density of knitting.  Measure how many loops per 1 cm, then measure the width of your gadget, tie a strip of air loops of the desired length and start knitting in a circle.  The most preferred knitting method is crochet, in this case the product will turn out beautiful and dense enough to protect the device from scratches.  Crochet the phone case to the desired height, and the top can be decorated with a decorative flap with a button or a stylish loop.  The manufacture of such an accessory will require small needlework skills, as well as a minimum of time and materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsystudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Case with clasp" class="if uuid-2492358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2492358.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitted phone case </h2><p>  The knitted case looks stylish and neat.  To get started, determine the desired type of yarn and select two knitting needles of suitable diameter.  The knitting pattern for the phone case is simple.  Measure the length and width of the device.  Tie a small sample of 5-7 cm in size and calculate how many loops per 1 cm. Then dial the desired number of loops and start knitting an even fabric.  If the skills allow, you can use five knitting needles, in this case you get a beautiful seamless case.  The most popular is shawl and hosiery knitting, as well as "putanka".  It is undesirable to use openwork patterns, as the cover will not protect the device from scratches due to holes in the canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thegeekyknitter.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting cover" class="if uuid-2492360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2492360.jpg"></div><h2>  Stylish decor </h2><p>  The finished product can be left without decor or decorated to your liking.  From a yarn of contrasting color, knit small flowers, hearts or simple geometrical shapes: circles, squares, triangles.  Place the resulting decor in random order on the canvas sheet and sew with threads in tone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="softdark.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2494093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2494093.jpg"></div><p>  Embroidery is a wonderful decoration for knitted phone cases.  It looks interesting seasonal decor or dedicated to any holidays.  For winter, snowflakes, Christmas trees, red and white stylized Santa Claus outfit, cute hearts for Valentine's Day are suitable.  In spring and summer, flowers, leaves and other plant motifs, as well as a marine theme, will be appropriate.  In autumn, decorate cases with orange leaves, blue-gray clouds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="louiesloops.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Case with decorations" class="if uuid-2492361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2492361.jpg"></div><p>  Also, for the decor of the cover, you can use other materials: buttons, beads, sewn rhinestones, satin ribbons, lace. </p><h2>  Beads </h2><p>  To make a knitted phone case with beads, it is better to study the patterns and technology of the process in advance.  Of course, small beads can simply be sewn in random order, but knitting with beads looks much more interesting, moreover, this option is much stronger: beads will by no means fall off during operation.  Count the number of beads that need to be placed on the cover, then string them on a thread before knitting, and then start working on the selected pattern.  At regular intervals, move the bead to the knit loop so that it remains on the front side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting with beads" class="if uuid-2492444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2492444.jpg"></div><p>  Knitted phone case is a beautiful and stylish decoration, which is also useful and practical.  With it, the phone will not be scratched in a bag or pocket, so you can not worry about the safety of your gadget.  To please yourself with pleasant new things more often, make several different cases and change them depending on your mood and outfit. </p>
