In March and April, few people walk without a hat, but fur hats are no longer relevant.  So it's time to get a fashion beret. </p><p>  By the way, this headdress can very well be winter if you sew it from fur or other warm material.  In general, material plays an important role and determines the seasonality of a thing.  The fur beret pattern is no different from the summer model, but the canvas used sets the mood, style and seasonality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="takes a pattern" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1196729.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Tools for work </h2><p>  So, the main thing is to set a goal, choose the most suitable model, determine a work plan, and you can take on the tools.  The work will require a <span>centimeter tape,</span> scissors, fabric for the base, optionally and for lining, material for the strap, if the main fabric does not stretch, a slanting trim for seam processing and <span>sewing accessories.</span>  And then it's time to understand how it takes to sew.  The pattern of which model will be more understandable is worth taking for that model, especially for beginners.  And after mastering the simplest template, you can try the more difficult option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  For the summer, natural linens, such as linen, cambric, cotton, are perfect.  Such berets perfectly protect from the scorching sun, and they will not be too hot.  For autumn and spring, it is better to choose a denser fabric, for example, velor, velvet, angora and other warm knitted fabrics.  Winter beret can be made of artificial or natural short-cut fur, woolen cloth with a small pile.  Also, for such models, you can take <span>palm coat,</span> for example, cashmere.  Do not forget about such soft and warm materials as fleece or polar.  A scarf from the same canvas perfectly complements the <span>beret.</span>  <span>The beret</span> pattern determines its shape and fit, so you should consider all the possible models and choose the most acceptable one both in terms of complexity and <span>personal preference.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric beret pattern" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1196720.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Option One: Two Parts </h2><p>  The <span>simplest pattern</span> is a circle that is around the perimeter greater than the volume of the head by about 10-15 cm. The second part of such a beret is a strip of knitted fabric with a width of 7-8 cm and a length equal to the volume of the head.  Naturally, such a beret pattern from the fabric is built directly on the fabric, and during assembly there are no problems.  All you need to do is cut the circle evenly across the stitched strip. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Option Two: Three Details </h2><p>  The next model is also easy to implement, although it consists of three parts.  This beret pattern is built on the basis of the head circumference measure.  First of all, an even circle is drawn, equal to the perimeter of the taken measurement.  After, having departed from the figure of 6 cm, a circle is also drawn, strictly parallel to the first.  When cutting from a fabric, a circle is cut out along a larger border, after a circle without a middle according to the measurement line and a strip of fabric for the strap for the head volume (in the extended form, 8 cm wide). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fur beret pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1196728.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <p>  When assembling in the seam of the upper ‚Äúpancake‚Äù with beret fields, you can insert a piping that will hold its shape well and will produce beautiful waves during landing.  You can also cut out the lining for the main details to close the seam of the joining of the strap. </p><h2>  Third option: from wedges </h2><p>  The most difficult model to perform is the wedge beret.  The pattern of such a headgear has many details and requires careful adjustment of the seams during assembly.  To build a template, you need a sheet of paper on which an even circle with a perimeter equal to the volume of the head will be placed (indent from its borders of about 7 cm). </p><p>  First draw a circle, then backtrack from the 7 cm line and draw a parallel closed line.  The small circle is divided into the required number of equal wedges.  Further, from the intersection points of the dividing lines and the border, the part is output to the external line without expansion.  After that, the part is aligned along the edge, drawing a straight line at a right angle to the first and second lines (side edges of the wedge).  Thus, a ready-made beret pattern will be obtained from fur and other warm fabrics, when it is necessary to reduce the number of waves at the fold during landing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beret pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1196724.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that it is not necessary to finish all the wedges on the template, it will be enough to finalize one and cut the rest on it.  In this model, you can narrow the wedges to the edge so that the product does not need to be planted on an additional bar.  Just one such wedge - and the finished beret pattern comes out.  From fabric, this option also looks great, especially if it is light canvas.  Additional seams with stitching can be a real decoration for the headgear. </p><h2>  Assembly and processing </h2><p>  In order to get a neat product, beret should be properly treated.  Pattern is only half the battle.  Of course, ideally, all seams are best treated with an overlock, but if there is no such unit, then a sewing machine with a zigzag stitch will do.  Also, seams can be decorated with an <span>oblique inlay,</span> closing all sections in it.  Winter hats made of fur can be made on the lining.  It is also cut out according to the basic patterns and make the same allowances.  The seam of attaching the rubber band when sewing the lining fabric is hidden inside, leaving a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe unsealed seam, then the product is turned out and the slot is closed manually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself beret patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1196723.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  One has only to try to work on this piece of clothing, as soon it becomes clear that it is not difficult to sew berets with your own hands.  The patterns described above are very simple to execute.  Even the most inexperienced seamstress will cope with such a task.  A little zeal, and a fashionable new thing will be ready. </p>
