One of its most prominent representatives was the <span>Nikon Coolpix L810.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> many customers characterize this device as a camera with pretty good, though not the best quality pictures and a relatively large number of shooting modes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix L810 instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518730.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  This compact camera has dimensions of 111.1 x 76.3 x 83.1 millimeters in width, height and depth, respectively.  The weight of the device, taking into account the installed memory cards and batteries, is approximately 430 grams.  The case of the model is covered with textured, pleasant to the touch plastic.  <span>The Nikon</span> Coolpix L810 <span>camera is</span> conveniently in your hands, and the main <span>control buttons are</span> located in one group immediately after the shutter button.  During the shooting process, you can easily reach any of them with your index finger or thumb.  A rather unusual and at the same time convenient solution was the appearance of an additional zoom control button directly on the lens.  It is located on the left.  In the Nikon lineup, this device has the largest <span>focal length range,</span> which is 26. It should be noted that the predecessor (model L20) had this indicator 21. The camera is available in black, blue, brown and red colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix L810" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518733.jpg" width="600"></div>

The resolution of the matrix related to the type of CCD is 16.1 million pixels.  Quite unusual is such a feature as the power supply of the model due to the usual ‚ÄúAA‚Äù class batteries.  Moreover, both lithium and alkaline types are suitable for it.  This is very convenient for tourists who travel to places where it is difficult to find an outlet for connecting to the charger network. </p><p>  A few seconds after turning on, the camera is ready for use.  At the same time, it takes no more than two seconds to process each next image.  During shooting at the widest angle, very weak, but still signs of distortion, which are completely leveled when approaching, are usually manifested.  As for the image parameters taken with the Nikon Coolpix L810, the photos have a size of 4068 x 3456 pixels.  In other words, when printed in a format of 34 x 29 centimeters, their quality is not lost at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix L810 reviews" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518731.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Optics </h2><p>  Large zoom is far from the only advantage of the device.  The equivalent focus value at a short distance here is 22.5 millimeters, due to which beautiful landscape images can be obtained even without approximation.  In order to create a not very expensive model, the engineers of the manufacturer saved on the matrix, using in the camera not its most highly sensitive and high-speed version. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Photosensitivity, Modes, and Image Quality </h2><p>  Certain problems with the quality of images with a sensitivity range up to ISO 800 on the Nikon Coolpix L810 model does not arise.  However, as this indicator increases, digital noise begins to increase sharply.  Moreover, the resolution of the images falls so much that the small details of the photo merge.  The camera is more suitable for amateur photographers who will not interfere with the settings and trust in automation.  Only in this case can a reasonable compromise be reached in terms of image quality and convenience. </p><p>  All possible camera shooting modes are fully automatic.  At the same time, there is a whole set of so-called scenes that provide an opportunity to take a walk in the imagination of the owner of the Nikon Coolpix L810 camera.  Instructions for the device, which is included in the standard package, will tell you how to use such interesting modes as ‚ÄúNight landscape‚Äù, ‚ÄúPortrait‚Äù, ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù and others. </p><h2>  Continuous Shooting and Video </h2><p>  When the continuous shooting mode is activated, its speed is initially approximately 1.3 frames per second.  There is no point in continuing, since it drops to the level of one frame in four seconds due to the filling of the buffer.  The highest resolution for video recording with stereo sound is 1280 x 780. This indicator is not impressive at all, because even many modern so-called ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù support Full HD.  When recording, there is the possibility of optical zoom in and out.  Autofocus can both function continuously and be adjusted before starting work.  It should be noted that the activation of the video mode is done by pressing the button separately displayed on the case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix l810 photos" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518729.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The main disadvantage of the Nikon Coolpix L810 camera is experts and users of the device called the small <span>size of the matrix.</span>  This version of it is used here to reduce the cost and facilitate the model.  In addition, this solution allowed the use of a relatively small lens.  Images can only be saved in JPEG format.  A rather serious drawback is that focusing occurs only in the center of the frame, although the face recognition function is provided here.  The device has a fixed monitor, and there is no connector for installing an additional flash at all.  The developers also did not provide for the <span>panorama shooting</span> mode so popular in our time with the possibility of automatic gluing of frames.  There are no digital effects, filters, image conversion functions, as well as an orientation sensor, which is why you need to rotate the pictures manually to view them yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix L810 specifications" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  For the money you need to spend on this camera, you can buy many other compact modifications of cameras that have much better functionality.  The key advantage of the Nikon Coolpix L810 over them is its impressive 26x optical zoom.  In addition, the camera is quite convenient to operate.  In this regard, shooting is greatly facilitated by the lever of approximation and distance, which is located directly on the lens barrel.  That is why this device is considered to be the best option only for amateur photography or for those cases when a strong zoom function is required. </p>
