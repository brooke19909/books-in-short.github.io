    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The concept that is so popular these days is the harmonious combination of the comforts of metropolitan life and the charms of living outside the city that formed the basis of the Mitino Park complex (PIK).  Six monolithic buildings, its own kindergarten and school are what are in the project.  It will become the largest in the Krasnogorsk region and will provide a huge number of Muscovites with separate apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the <span>Mitino Park</span> residential complex, PIK GC chose the Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region, a piece of land that is only a 10-minute walk from the Mitino metro station.  In the north-west, a new residential neighborhood is bordered by Moscow, namely the Mitino district.  Thanks to the reconstruction of the Pyatnitsky highway, the emergence of new road junctions, the road from the complex to the center of the capital will take no more than 30 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Technology </h2><p>  Economy class buildings are being built using monolithic technology, which gives them the necessary quality and reliability.  For cladding of facades multi-colored hinged panels are used.  In addition to water, gas, electricity, a telephone and Internet are connected to the house, which is included in the list of requirements of modern buyers. </p><p>  Construction is carried out using high-quality materials and innovative technologies: two-chamber double-glazed windows of European manufacture are installed in the apartments, balconies and loggias are glazed, the entrances are equipped with high-speed passenger and freight elevators. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The complex is being built in an area with developed infrastructure.  In walking distance from the residential complex "Mitino Park" ("PIK") there is a kindergarten and a comprehensive school where residents of the micro-district can easily arrange their children.  By the way, this feature has largely affected the popularity of the Moscow region complex.  Judging by the reviews, he is preferred, including families with young children.  Kids will no longer have to travel a huge distance, get on public transport - they will be able to get the necessary knowledge not far from home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
