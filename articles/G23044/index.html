It is understandable, since the thing that is in trend today, after a couple of years, turns out to be hopelessly outdated.  However, she can be worn only two to three times and be distinguished by excellent quality of fabric and tailoring. </p><p>  If you know the value of money and have at least a little knowledge in the field of sewing and decoration, then you should learn the art of <span>remaking clothes</span> with your own hands from the old.  A new dress, blouse or shorts, created from things that have long become unnecessary, can decorate your wardrobe no worse than new clothes from branded stores. </p>

    <h2>  Skirts from old jeans </h2><p>  Denim clothing has been the most popular in the world for over 70 years.  That is why in every house, over time, a huge number of men's, women's and children's jeans trousers accumulate.  Instead of throwing them in a landfill, you can try to come up with a way to give such rubbish new life.  For example, any <span>men's jeans</span> easily turn into a women's skirt of the desired length.  To do this, you just need to open a few seams (do not touch the zipper, it is still useful to you) and make triangular inserts in front or behind from the bottom of the trousers or from any other fabric.  Then you will have to hem the hem and, if you wish, decorate the skirt, for example with metal rivets or spikes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you try, new jeans clothes can make you the queen of any party.  We offer such a maxi option for a party: one leg trouser is cut obliquely from jeans trousers, a seam from the inside is opened open from the other and a trapezoidal piece of fabric is sewn to them, highly gathered along the upper edge. </p>

    <h2>  What can you turn an old t-shirt into </h2><p>  Those who are interested in the question of whether it is easy to sew new clothes from old <span>clothes with their own hands</span> will be able to answer it themselves after they turn the T-shirt into a <span>fashionable blouse.</span>  There are several ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  On the back of the T-shirt in the center, many parallel cuts are made, the length of which grows from bottom to top.  Then they are intertwined with a long ribbon of contrasting color, its ends tied in a bow. </li><li>  In a T-shirt (preferably a larger size, for example, for men), the upper part is cut so that the cut is 15 cm below the neck.  The remains of the sleeves are stripped off and a drawstring is made along the upper edge.  They put the braid in it and, putting on the resulting blouse, tie a bow at the neck. </li></ul>

    <h2>  New clothes from old clothes for children </h2><p>  Do not be upset if you have a lot of things accumulated in your house from which your son or daughter has long grown up!  You can‚Äôt even imagine what super-fashionable and stylish things for a child can turn out by remaking clothes with your own hands from the old! </p><p>  A new baby board, coat, or pants are often not much cheaper than adult wardrobe items.  Therefore, spending a little time on the alteration, you will significantly save. </p><p>  Papa or mom‚Äôs wardrobe items may also work as a basis.  However, most often, new clothes from old clothes with their own hands for children are made to extend the life of new things that have become small. </p><p>  It is especially easy to redo things from the girl‚Äôs wardrobe.  For example, to the hem of the daughter‚Äôs dress from which she grew up, you can sew a shuttlecock from a fabric of contrasting color, cut off the upper part and, adding straps, turn it into a sundress. </p><p>  Your hand does not rise to throw out the skirt that your schoolgirl wore in the kindergarten?  Turn her into a fashionable blouse.  To do this, just loosen slightly the elastic band threaded into the girdle, and also sew the straps to the top and ruffles (possibly in 2-3 rows) to the hem. </p><h2>  Remaking a skirt </h2><p>  As already mentioned, women's clothing goes out of fashion very quickly.  However, there is a solution.  It just needs to be redone. </p><p>  The easiest way for you to do this when it comes to a long wide skirt.  To do this, you can: </p><ul><li>  cut a quarter circle out of it, as for a poluklesh skirt, tuck in the upper part, leave hand openings on the sides and sew an asymmetric bow collar; </li><li>  cut off the hem so that the front of this item of women's wardrobe is much shorter than the back; </li><li>  if the skirt is gathered at the waist, then you can put it on so that you get a sundress, having previously adjusted the width of the belt, and tie a leather belt under the chest. </li></ul>

    <h2>  A few options for the lazy </h2><p>  Many famous designers love to delve into junk.  To the question ‚Äúwhy‚Äù they answer: ‚ÄúWe remake the old clothes into new ones with our own hands in order to feel like creators who create something beautiful from the trash.‚Äù </p><p>  They even arrange a competition to find out who will offer a more creative idea for transforming a particular thing. </p><p>  For example, it turns out that by placing a T-shirt with a pattern or a vest half in a basin with textile paint, you will turn it into a ‚Äúnail‚Äù of a fashionable bow. </p><p>  And how do you like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpainting gray jeans with a marker?  Can't draw?  No problem!  Take a guipure, prick it with pins on the leg and use the holes in its dense areas as a stencil. </p><p>  You can create a creative look for an old <span>Chanel-style jacket</span> with a few boxes of <span>safety pins.</span>  Such new clothes from old clothes with their own hands are made very simply.  To do this, you just need to prick the pins along the hem, gates and cuffs at the same distance from each other.  With the help of metal fittings, you can also ‚Äúdepict‚Äù flowers on the chest or on the back of the jacket. </p><p>  Imagine a pile of unnecessary things in your wardrobe.  Do not immediately send them to a landfill.  Instead, from old clothes we make a new one with our own hands in one of the ways described above, or we come up with our own, original version. </p>
