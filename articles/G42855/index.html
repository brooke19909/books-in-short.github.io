Emblem of the SS Panzer Division "Dead Head"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Second World War, and for the Russian people the Patriotic War, left a mark in the history of all states - its participants.  Until today, these events amaze with their cruelty and greatness of the deed of many millions of people.  The contemporaries are very interested in historical facts, this can be judged by the constant new publications, many of which, intentionally or not, distort the initial meaning of documentary sources.  Therefore, the need to discuss the last world war is a relevant and controversial topic. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Among the most selfless adherents of Nazism, distinguished by bestial cruelty and lack of military prowess, are parts of the SS.  At the beginning of operations on the eastern front, the advancement of these divisions meant imminent death for all who were in their way.  Throughout the war, this reputation of troops of this kind was skillfully maintained.  The greatest atrocities in the massacres of civilians and prisoners of war became famous for the SS division "Dead Head".  It should be noted that for most Russian soldiers these elite units did not cause horror, but disgust.  According to the recollections of our fighters, the SS men were shot ‚Äúlike mad dogs,‚Äù and they treated them the same way.  But everyone recognizes the fact that, as a military unit, the Dead Head division was effective in attack and stable in defense.  To understand the motivation of these ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù, it is necessary to turn to the history of this compound. </p><h2>  Himmler </h2><p>  A key role in the formation of the SS divisions, which were directly involved in the hostilities, was played by one of the main political figures in Germany during the Nazism period - the SS Reichsfuhrer G. Himmler.  The figure is famous, his biographical data are standard for the military of that time.  Of greatest interest is his belief in various mystical rites, runes, the process of reincarnation, therefore, when creating the SS of the "black order", he intensively introduced medieval rites of knights, which partially took root. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  At the initial stage, the Reichsfuhrer planned to create these units as a "party army".  The composition of the SS divisions should include only Germans who are purely racial, who are fanatically loyal to the National Socialist Party.  The functions of the SS troops were initially defined as security intra-German, but the training was carried out at the level of functional combat units.  Himmler deliberately created his own army, which, in his opinion, should be radically different from the units of the Wehrmacht and personify a new type of troops.  The contradictions between the military personnel, officers of the highest echelon and the ideas of the SS Reichsfuhrer led to the fact that the formation of divisions was carried out parallel to the main call.  The SS division "Dead Head" was created from Himmler‚Äôs only available source of human reserves - the protection of concentration camps in Germany.  In this he was greatly helped and assisted by Theodor Eike, whose identity is unambiguously impossible to evaluate.  However, his absolute devotion to Hitler and Himmler does not need comments. </p><h2>  Division creation </h2><p>  The <span>Dachau</span> concentration <span>camp was</span> located near Munich.  It was on its basis that the future Dead Head division was created.  In 1934, on the appointment of Himmler, Eike became a brigadefuhrer of the SS and took control of a rather neglected camp economy, mired in corruption and terror.  By tough methods, he restores order in the Dachau camp in a very short time, so by 1935 he became an inspector of the entire punishment system in the territory of the Third Reich. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of the SS division "Dead Head" ("Totenkopf") begins in 1939, initially this unit carried only security functions.  The name itself comes from the badge that the soldiers wore on their buttonholes.  In addition to the double rune of Zig, the guards of the concentration camps used a skull with crossbones as an emblem.  Historically, this sign was not intimidating; it implied contempt for death and complete self-sacrifice.  Eike was an excellent performer of all Himmler's innovations, so the choice was made taking into account his mystical inclinations.  The emblem of the SS division "Dead Head" adorned the buttonholes of all camp guards until the end of the war and was present on the form of SS units.  To create a new type of troops, Dachau was chosen; on its territory they underwent training.  The selection was carried out on very strict principles, it was carried out by Eike personally.  The growth of the future soldier of the <span>Third Reich</span> should be from 178 cm, excellent health was also necessary, age from 17-18 to 22 years.  Moreover, more attention was paid to racial origin and political views.  Intellectual abilities were not evaluated. </p>

    <p>  According to Eike, the soldier should not think, he is obliged to carry out the order without analyzing its adequacy.  The training was based on lengthy hard physical training and political training based on hatred of the enemy.  Cruelty was cultivated by the founder himself, Eike.  The SS division "Dead Head" was created in conditions of strict discipline and complete submission to the leadership, all dissatisfied with the method ended up in the concentration camp as prisoners.  For a better understanding of the basics of creating this unit, it is necessary to turn to some facts from the life of Eike and his psychological portrait.  His fanatical devotion to Hitler and Himmler crossed all boundaries of the rational. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Theodore Eike </h2><p>  Career takeoff of the future commander of the SS unit occurred suddenly, it is associated with the victory of the Nazis in Germany and the beginning of Hitler's reign.  Participation in the world (first) war did not give Eike neither high ranks, nor great power.  His bestial instincts, generously seasoned with psychopathy, approached the Nazis, so Himmler made him a punitive tool against his own enemies.  <span>Theodore Eike,</span> according to contemporaries, was distinguished by cruelty and harshness, especially in relation to Jews, Communists, and all those who did not meet the definition of ‚Äútrue Aryan‚Äù.  These qualities were very useful to him when working in concentration camps, where strict discipline was introduced and intolerance to violations of the rules not only on the part of prisoners, but also on guard.  His efforts were appreciated, and the next promotion in rank coincided with a new position.  Having created a faultlessly functioning camp system, Eike gets the opportunity to fulfill Himmler‚Äôs dream of a ‚Äúnew army‚Äù, the embodiment of which is the SS Dead Head division.  The level of his education was quite low, he did not have command skills.  It was a simple soldier who built relationships with subordinates on their complete submission to any orders.  The soldiers, devoted to him, called Eike ‚Äúdad‚Äù and tried to match his ideas about the ideal warrior of the Third Reich.  Due to illiterate command, the future SS <span>Panzer Division</span> ‚ÄúDead Head‚Äù suffered heavy losses in equipment and people, but at the same time, the strength brought up by Eike in the soldiers allowed them to adequately withstand loads and engage in battles in areas that all other units left. </p><h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  The German "Dead Head" division, like all SS units under Himmler‚Äôs leadership, was created in a very rigid ideological space.  The unity of spirit, views, interests, common enemies and friends, a common goal and neglect of means during its achievement - on these principles, elite Nazi units were created.  The emblem of the SS division "Dead Head" was supposed to terrify the enemies and inspire respect for friends.  This sign partially coped with the task.  Using this emblem, the SS men were very simply calculated.  And, as a rule, they were immediately shot, Russian troops rarely captured frank, fanatical killers.  The ring of the Dead Head division has hardly reached our days.  It was awarded to the most distinguished officers and soldiers.  The ring was signed by Himmler, in front of the name of the soldier there was necessarily the appeal ‚Äúmy dear‚Äù.  His design was overloaded with runic symbols, the center of the composition was a skull with crossbones.  After the death of the owner of the ring, it was necessary to return it to the SS Reichsfuhrer, who kept all copies as a memory of the deceased comrades.  On the orders of Himmler, the entire collection was destroyed; it was buried under the provoked collapse of the rock. </p>

    <h2>  Anthem of the SS Division "Dead Head" </h2><p>  Fanatical devotion to Hitler and his immediate commander was often based on proper Nazi propaganda and suggestion.  The heads of most young people who were not literally adherents of Hitler's racial theory were hammered by propaganda, the maximum amount of information contained emblems and hymns of dedication to the F√ºhrer.  For example, the march of the SS division "Dead Head" does not contain any patriotic information, it is a song about the fact that we live together, die together and drink together, if we are lucky.  This "masterpiece" serves only the purpose of uniting the army and nurturing fraternal relations within the unit. </p><h2>  Western direction </h2><p>  The future German tank division "Dead Head" began its march through Europe with Poland.  Eike's troops had to cross the border after the passage of the Wehrmacht's regular army, they were assigned the role of police in the occupied territory.  The soldiers of the "Dead Head" did not participate in the hostilities, there were several skirmishes with units leaving the encirclement, but the unit was mainly at war with the civilian population.  At the same time, their cleaning activities were highly rated by Himmler. </p>

    <p>  To create a full-fledged unit of SS troops, the command decided to train the officers and Eike himself in the basics of battle strategy and tactics, but the result was negative.  Therefore, in May 1940, the Dead Head division still approaches the Franco-German border as part of the administrative corps, but this time with the possibility of participating in hostilities.  During the invasion, due to lack of supply, SS units engaged in outright robbery of the population.  Eike soldiers distinguished themselves in France in many battles, but their losses were very great.  This was a consequence of the illiterate leadership of the officers.  Subsequently, Himmler ‚Äúscolded‚Äù the not-so-educated, but most devoted commander, and then left the division in Bordeaux for reorganization. </p><h2>  Eastern campaign </h2><p>  In April 1940, the mass transfer of troops of fascist Germany to the borders of the Soviet Union began.  Himmler began reorganizing all SS standards.  This also affected the "Dead Head" divisions: they were equipped with additional infantry companies.  The first clash with the Soviet troops took place on July 6, 1941. According to Manstein, whose troops launched an offensive movement, the Dead Head soldiers had a very high level of discipline and attacked in a tough and effective manner.  But the inept command reduced all positive aspects to zero, as a result, all victories were achieved with "great blood."  By the winter of the 41st year, losses accounted for more than 50% of the initial number of units.  <span>The Soviet army</span> began to attack German troops on the northern front, the defense took several hundred soldiers every day, Eike had no reserves, those remaining in the ranks were too mentally and physically exhausted.  Nevertheless, clear discipline made the division a combat-ready unit even without a commander who was sent to the rear with a wound. </p><h2>  Demian boiler </h2><p>  At the beginning of January of the 42nd year, at the same time 4 Soviet armies attacked the 16th German division with the aim of encirclement and subsequent destruction.  The commander of the group of German armies "North" Loeb (Field Marshal) reported to Hitler about the situation at the front and the possibility of losing selected Wehrmacht units.  But there was no order to retreat, which helped the Russian troops, albeit with heavy losses, to complete the maneuver and close the encirclement in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDemyansk.  In fact, on February 10, the <span>German army</span> fought in the boiler.  Leeb resigned, in his place stood the former commander of the 18th Army, K√ºhler.  The SS division "Dead Head" in the Demian cauldron turned out to be with its commander Theodore Eike, where she began a long defense.  According to various sources, about 100 thousand German soldiers were surrounded, who continued to fiercely resist. </p>

    <p>  So, the vanguard formation, which was thrown to break through the encirclement in March 1942, was the SS Dead Head division.  The history of the third tank division of the SS troops could actually end in a demyansky cauldron.  Indeed, when creating the Ramushevsky corridor and removing the remnants of the army from the encirclement, less than 30% of the soldiers remained from Eike‚Äôs units.  Until October 1942, the division held its position on the Demian ledge, as a result, its remnants were sent to rest and replenish in France. </p><h2>  Reformation </h2><p>  SS Panzer Division "Dead Head" appears in this period.  By order of Hitler, the unit is formed as a tank-grenadier.  In southern France, Eike's soldiers participate in Operation Atilla, after which the division is transferred to Angouleme.  Its expanded composition and rested soldiers enable the commander to begin new grueling training, which turn the unit into a formidable weapon of Nazism.  Rest was short as the situation on the eastern front becomes threatening; in early February 1943 the division was transferred to Ukraine and was part of the South army. </p>

    <h2>  The death of Eike </h2><p>  Fierce battles for Kharkov led to heavy losses on both sides.  Eike tried as a division commander to show strategic initiative, for this he had to know exactly the location of his troops.  02/26/43, he last boarded his single-engine reconnaissance aircraft, which was shot down by Soviet troops from rifles.  Eike's body was recaptured and buried in the town of Orelka.  With the withdrawal of German troops, the ashes were exhumed and reburied in Zhitomir.  At the end of December 43, the city was completely liberated by Soviet troops, and the burial of Eike was razed to the ground.  At the time of the withdrawal of German troops from Zhytomyr, all SS units were in another place, so they could not be taken out of the commander's body. </p><h2>  Budapest </h2><p>  After Ukraine, the movement of German troops turned into a permanent retreat, sometimes they managed to gain a foothold in some positions and hold the defenses, but the Soviet army could no longer be stopped.  An allied army was unfolding on the western frontiers.  The defense of individual cities made it possible to counterattack due to the regrouping of forces, but the German troops could not go on the offensive.  With advancement, many SS standards were mixed, understaffed at the expense of each other.  The constant need for replenishment could not be repaid at the expense of the rear servicemen partially suitable for service.  To protect Budapest, all the nearby forces of the Wehrmacht were pulled together, which later accelerated the process of the capture of Berlin and Vienna by the Soviet troops.  From January to April, the battle for the Hungarian valley, the key to the German fuel supply, continued.  Historians have not confirmed, but probably in it met two legendary SS military units: the Edelweiss division and the Dead Head. </p><h2>  Awakening of Spring, surrender </h2>

    <p>  In March 1945, such a group of forces as the SS Dead Head division no longer existed.  Photos and film archives show that the extremely exhausted retreat and completely demoralized remnants of the German units in the Lake Balaton area were preparing for their last offensive.  For this, all possible reserves were tightened, Hitler called the operation "Spring Awakening".  It was this process that became an insurmountable obstacle for the troops of the Wehrmacht.  In the spring, the marshy soil liquefied, which led to a slowdown and, accordingly, a loss of initiative.  The failure of Hitler‚Äôs last operation led to the mass exodus of troops and their surrender.  On May 8, 1945, the remnants of the once elite Totenkopf (Dead Head) compound surrendered to the Americans, retreating to Linz and virtually ensuring unhindered passage of Soviet troops to Vienna.  The surrender was accepted, but at the request of the Soviet command the remainder of the division (about a thousand people) were transferred to the victorious country. </p>
