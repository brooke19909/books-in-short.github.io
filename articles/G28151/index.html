    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The city of Shuya, Ivanovo region is the administrative center.  It is spread between two rivers, which are Klyazma and Volga.  The map of the Ivanovo region clearly shows the location of the subject of the Russian Federation under consideration.  Through the settlement flows from north to south of the river.  Thesa  This is evidenced by the map presented below.  Shuya (Ivanovo region) is considered the third largest settlement in the region.  For 2014, there were more than 58.5 thousand inhabitants.  The village is located 32 km from Ivanovo.  Shuya has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 33 km <sup>2</sup> .  Next will be the history of the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  According to one version, in the place where Shuya now stands (Ivanovo region), in ancient times a settlement was formed.  It was formed by the Finno-Ugric peoples Meria and Chud.  The name of the settlement may come from the word "suo" (Finnish).  Translated, it means "marshland, swamp, lake".  There is another hypothesis.  According to her, the name comes from the ancient Slavic "oshu".  It is translated as ‚Äúon the left hand‚Äù, ‚Äúon the left‚Äù, and relative to the location of the settlement - on the left bank.  Not far from the city in the 20th century, the Semukhinsk burial mounds - ancient burials were discovered.  They belong to the Volga trade road of 10-11 centuries. </p><h2>  The Principality </h2><p>  The history of Russia has kept mention of the owners of the city.  The princes of Shuysky were his masters for almost 200 years.  Their kind originates from Vasily Kirdyapa.  He was one of the princes of Suzdal.  A famous representative of the genus was V.I. Shuisky.  This prince was the last king of the Rurikovich.  He ruled from 1606 to 1610.  After him, the Romanov dynasty began to rule the state.  According to historical information, Prince Shuisky often visited his estate.  The owner of these lands loved falconry.  His daughter, Princess Anne, was buried in with.  Mill.  Now this is a suburb of Shui.  In the local Kremlin (today it is the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãUnion Square) siege yards were located.  They belonged to Prince Shuisky, and Pozharsky, and some others. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of the reckoning </h2><p>  The settlement was officially mentioned for the first time in documents from 1539.  At that time, some cities of the Ivanovo region were ravaged.  The Nikon Chronicle testifies to the invasion of the Kazakh khan Safa-Girey into the territory.  Among the devastated was Shuya.  The Ivanovo region, as you know, is the place where a large number of monasteries and temples are located.  Before the invasion of the Kazakh Khan, the settlement was called Borisoglebskaya Sloboda.  Shuya was named after the church of St.  Boris and Gleb, located on the territory of the settlement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Crowned Persons </h2><p>  During a campaign in Kazan, Ivan the Terrible visited Shuya.  Soon she was annexed to the other 19 settlements that were part of the oprichnina.  This happened in 1565-72.  Shuya (Ivanovo region) became the property of the Russian Tsar.  In 1572, in accordance with a spiritual letter, the settlement was inherited by the son of Grozny - Fedor.  However, the city was soon ruined.  At first, in 1609, the Poles did this, and then the Lithuanians in 1619.  In 1722, Peter the Great visited the city.  He stopped here to venerate the shrine - the icon of the Mother of God (Shuisk-Smolensk).  It was written during the pestilence of 1654-55.  After the icon was completed, the epidemic in the city stopped, and people were healed of other ailments, applying to the image of the Mother of God.  Peter the Great also got rid of the disease.  The tsar wanted to take the shrine with him to St. Petersburg, but local residents urged him to leave the image in the Resurrection Church.  For some time, the daughter of Peter, Elizabeth, lived in Shuya.  She loved to go hunting in the local forests.  Another successor to the throne has also been here - Alexander II. </p>

    <h2>  Textile industry </h2><p>  Production of linen has been going on since ancient times.  Textile industry involved many residents of the city.  Linen canvases were produced in peasant huts, in rural houses using weaving wooden looms.  By the middle of the 18th century, manufactories began to appear.  The largest was discovered in 1755 by the merchant Yakov Igumnov.  But by the end of the century, flax was replaced by cotton.  The first entrepreneurs to arrange the supply of cotton yarn from England were the merchants of Kiselev.  In parallel, the factories of the Posylin brothers developed.  The products of their manufactories received a large gold medal at the First All-Russian Exhibition in St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Merchants </h2><p>  Trade and industry in Shuya developed rapidly.  This was facilitated by a convenient geographical position - the settlement was formed on a navigable river.  In the city was built Gostiny Dvor, which had a fairly large area.  Foreign and nonresident merchants came here to trade.  In Gostiny Dvor in 1654 there was a shop of the English-Arkhangelsk Trade Union.  The oldest industrial area in Shuya is soap making.  The first mention of plants is present in the scribe book of 1629.  By the 16th century, the industrial character of the village had practically formed.  Along with soap making, sheepskin-fur coat was an old craft.  He especially flourished in the 16-17th centuries.  That is why Prince Shuisky was popularly nicknamed the "fur coat." </p>

    <h2>  Coat of arms </h2><p>  Catherine the Great in 1781 issued a special Decree, according to which Vladimir governorate was formally established.  The coat of arms of Shui was also approved.  It was a shield divided into 2 parts.  At the top was the symbol of Vladimir (the provincial city) - a lion leopard standing on its hind legs, and below - a bar of soap on a red background, which glorified soap factories located in the city. </p><h2>  Architecture and museums </h2><p>  Shuya (a photo of the city is presented in the article) is a unique settlement.  An amazing atmosphere has been preserved here.  On the territory of this ancient merchant city there are various buildings - unique architectural monuments.  In particular, the estates of Pavlov and the merchant Nekrasov are of particular historical interest.  Kiselevskaya Hospital is located on Union Square.  Previously, the Kremlin stood at this place.  Not far from Soyuznaya is Lenin Square.  There are also quite interesting places here.  For example, it is worth visiting the mall.  The building in which they are located was erected at the beginning of the 19th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shuya photo of the city" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/486455.jpg" width="550"></div>  <span>Lenin Square</span> and Union <span>Square are</span> separated by a pond, through which you can cross the bridge.  Today, the territory of the shopping arcade is occupied by the Museum of Local Lore.  It contains a fairly extensive exposition.  Various exhibits are presented: household items, costumes, coins, furniture and more.  Visitors can get to know the history of the city and the region.  Most of the exposition tells about Konstantin Balmont.  The birthplace of this famous poet is precisely Shuya (Ivanovo region).  Also, history buffs will be interested in visiting the Frunze Art and Memorial Museum.  Today, the subjects of the presented expositions are quite wide.  The museum is a fairly large complex, which exhibited a collection of local artists, historical exhibits.  In addition, various festivals and competitions are regularly held here.  An extensive <span>research activity</span> is being carried out on the basis of the cultural institution <span>.</span>  The entire exhibition is located in ancient merchant buildings.  These mansions themselves are already architectural monuments.  Since 2010, the Museum of Military Glory has been operating in Shuya.  Another interesting attraction is the wooden gateways of the 19th century. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of Ivanovo region" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/486454.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Temples </h2><p>  In Shuya, as, indeed, in another ancient city, there are a lot of churches.  The Resurrection Cathedral is considered the most famous local attraction.  I must say that before the revolution in Shuya there were about 20 churches.  The Resurrection Cathedral is famous for its 106-meter bell tower.  I must say that it is in its size in second place in Russia.  The largest is the bell tower of the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.  The bell for the Resurrection Cathedral was cast in Moscow.  It was installed on the bell tower in 1891 in honor of the birthday of Emperor Nicholas II.  In 1922, they tried to remove church values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the church.  Local residents then went to the square to prevent this act.  But by order of the authorities, fire was opened on people, as a result of which several people died.  After that, mass repressions against representatives of the clergy began.  In honor of the injured clergy in 2007, a monument was unveiled.  In addition to Voskresensky, in Shuya there is the Cathedral of St.  Nicholas the Wonderworker.  There are also Ilyinskaya, Pokrovskaya, Holy Cross Churches. </p>
