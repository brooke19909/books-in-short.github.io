    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Not so long ago, in October 2015, the apple company published a patent application.  According to him, wireless charging for the iPhone will not be inferior in any way to the competitive charging for Android-devices, which buyers were already testing at the time.  And now we are talking about the ‚Äúpill‚Äù.  The one on which the device for recharging is installed.  Although there are other useful gadgets from this series. </p><h2>  Cases for recharging </h2><p>  Wireless charging for the iPhone 5 was previously presented in this form.  The advantage of the gadget is the fact that there is no need to carry a charger or look for a free outlet.  Simply put on a cover that will recharge the battery of the "apple" smartphone.  Apple made this decision a long time ago.  <span>True, this</span> did not save another problem: the case also needs to be charged in a timely manner.  Otherwise, all its usefulness is lost.  The first wireless charging for the iPhone appeared when the fourth smartphone model from Apple was released.  Of the shortcomings, a bulky look was noted.  Over time, the covers became more perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wireless charging for iphone 5" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1093055.jpg" width="550"></div>

Firstly, because its design was not an example better than the first case.  Secondly, the capacity of the charger is very solid, and the charging time from the network is only 4 hours.  That is, the cover can be used for a long time.  Once charged, it allows you to ‚Äúlight‚Äù the iPhone a couple of times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wireless charging for iphone 6" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1093054.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Charge pad </h2><p>  Perhaps this model can be called that way.  For the first time, wireless charging for the iPhone 5 appeared in this form.  A plug from the cover is inserted into the connector (lightning), which is placed under the cover.  Unfortunately for some iPhone owners, you cannot remove the charger under the cover of the smartphone itself - it is not removable.  The pad itself is very thin - no thicker than a credit card.  Therefore, putting it under the cover is not difficult.  There is wireless charging for the iPhone 5S, 6, 6S of the same plan.  However, manufacturers prefer to remind owners of "apple" smartphones that the more advanced their model is, the more high-quality and modern capacitive charger it requires.  For example, an overlay of 2500 mAh is quite capable of charging the iPhone 4, but later releases will require a larger supply of energy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wireless charging for iphone 5s" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1093056.jpg" width="475"></div>

Moreover, regardless of the model.  Today, many manufacturers sell covers with built-in charging.  And every time they become more and more stylish.  For example, some firms have relied on design without stinting on the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  So, many cases with wireless charging are almost invisible on the smartphone, adding to it beauty and style.  In terms of internal characteristics, they remain very high quality - 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000 mAh.  And even more than that.  Such a cover works quite simply - the plug of the cover is inserted into the charger connector.  In fact, you just need to put one gadget on another, securely locking.  When you turn on the charging mode, the cover will begin to charge the smartphone.  If this is not necessary, you can use charging as a simple, stylish and reliable accessory to protect your iPhone from shock, dust and pollution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I charge my iphone with wireless charging" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1093058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Qi Technology </h2><p>  Many people wonder whether it is possible to charge the iPhone with wireless charging.  Yes, that‚Äôs quite real.  And the latest version of the "apple" smartphone is even equipped with support for special technology - Qi.  It is she who allows you to charge the gadget without any wires, so to speak - "through the air."  In fact, this is still the same overlay, but somewhat modified.  Firstly, it is several times thinner than the first developments.  Secondly, a Dock station is attached to it, which distributes Qi technology to a smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Auradock </h2><p>  According to experts, this is the best wireless charging for iPhone 6 to date.  The principle of operation is simple - an overlay (an external receiver for signal transmission) is attached to the smartphone, and the Dock-station turns on.  You do not need to connect an "apple" phone to the station.  Just put a smartphone on it.  The situation does not play any role.  For example, at Nokia this idea was implemented worse - the device had to be placed on the docking station at a certain angle and degree.  AuraDock, like wireless charging for the iPhone 6, is somewhat more advanced.  You just need to put the "iPhone" on the station, and then the battery will recharge.  The capacity of such a charger is sufficient to conduct a couple of full cycles.  The Dock itself is charged for four hours. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  Over time, technology will most likely reach the point that you can charge your favorite gadget without any tricks.  But today, the fact remains - you need to have at hand a device that can charge a smartphone wirelessly.  And the Dock-station in this case is very good - it does not take up much space, is easy to operate, does not require cables.  On the other hand, the charging case is more mobile and in demand.  And picking up a beautiful and neat ‚Äúcase‚Äù is not difficult. </p>
