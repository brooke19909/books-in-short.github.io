    <p>  Once Andrei decided to play with weapons without demand.  And miraculously survived.  Father often told his sons about military service.  Andrei listened with rapture.  Perhaps in the future, these stories also played a role in choosing a life path. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Andrei Antonovich falls into the squadron </h2><p>  In 1919, the Bolsheviks launched an attack on Rostov.  Then Andrew for the first time saw the Red Army men who entered the village.  Local residents went out to meet them, and he looked with admiration and envy at the Budenovites.  Andrei saw that among them were his sixteen-year-old peers. </p><p>  The army needed an urgent delivery of ammunition.  Therefore, the Red Army borrowed all the horses in the village.  Andrei himself was carrying ammunition to Rostov on his horse.  And there he persuaded Stepan Vasilenko, the squadron commander, to take him into service.  So his dream came true.  He received uniforms, weapons and joined the army. </p><p>  After the release of Rostov, Andrei returned to the village to visit his family.  He announced to his family that he had become a military man.  Father approved his decision. </p><h2>  The beginning of a military career </h2><p>  Throughout the Civil War, the future Marshal Grechko, whose family supported him in a desire to make a military career, fought as an ordinary Red Army man.  He graduated from the courses of commanders in Krasnodar.  And in 1926 he began to study at the cavalry school.  Successfully graduated from it, and he was entrusted with commanding a platoon.  A little later - a squadron in the 1st Separate cavalry brigade. </p><p>  In 1938, Andrei Antonovich Grechko became chief of staff of the Special Cavalry Division of the BOVO.  And the very next year he defended Western Ukraine and Belarus from the Germans in order to deprive Germany of a chance to gain a foothold in these territories. </p>

    <h2>  The first days of World War II </h2><p>  When the Great Patriotic War began, Andrei Antonovich was still studying at the Academy of the General Staff.  Already passing the final exam in June 1941, Grechko understood that the USSR was in serious danger.  Three days after this, war broke out.  He immediately rushed to the front, in the thick of things, but only a few of his classmates were seconded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The future Marshal Grechko, whose biography is closely related to military service, was sent to the General Staff.  Andrei Antonovich was confused.  He understood that this was a responsible appointment, but really wanted to get on the battlefield.  He began to seek the opportunity to fulfill his desire.  As a result, he served in the General Staff only twelve days. </p><h2>  Work in the General Staff </h2><p>  The <span>staff of the General Staff</span> worked day and night.  If you could sleep, then only in the workplace.  At the front, the situation was changing rapidly and sometimes it was almost impossible to track the course of the struggle.  The information received by the General Staff was often fragmentary and sometimes even contradictory.  Grechko led a consolidated map of the operational situation. </p>

    <p>  At first, Andrei Antonovich was angry at staff work, wanting to get into the thick of things - to the front.  And only when he got there, he realized how difficult it was for the staff of the General Staff to navigate the situation, and what responsibility fell on their shoulders.  It was very difficult to report accurate data.  And they still had to pass "up". </p><h2>  BOB: Grechko again gets to the front </h2><p>  Andrei Antonovich, future <span>Marshal of the USSR</span> Grechko, whose biography is closely connected with military service from his youth, after much deliberation nevertheless turned to the addict Tymoshenko and asked to go to the front.  After a while, the answer came.  Grechko was appointed commander of the cavalry division.  He was heading to Kharkov, to the Southwestern Front.  In the city of Priluki, Grechko was to form the 34th cavalry division. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  World War II: at the front </h2><p>  The first days at the front for Andrei Antonovich were the most difficult.  The practice of military operations was very different from the theory taught in peacetime.  Grechko had to navigate and adapt to circumstances immediately on the spot and as soon as possible.  There was not enough ammunition.  There was nothing to stop even the infantry, not to mention the tanks.  And the authorities were silent about this and only gave orders to advance and defeat the Germans.  Grechko‚Äôs division, gritting her teeth, fought in these terrible conditions. </p>

    <p>  But already in 1941, the Red Army began to win victories.  This year, Grechko already headed the 5th cavalry corps, which in 1942 liberated Barvenkovo.  After many successful battles, a little later, Andrei Antonovich was handed over to the 12th Army defending the Voroshilovograd direction.  Then, in the autumn of 1942, Grechko began to command the 47th Army.  They defended the Black Sea coast.  A little later he became commander of the 18th army, operating in the direction of Tuapse. </p><p>  After the victory at Stalingrad in 1943, the future Marshal of the USSR Grechko began to command the 56th Army.  On October 9, he was the first to report to the General Staff about the liberation of the Caucasus.  Andrei Antonovich has proven himself in numerous battles and was appointed deputy commander of the 1st Ukrainian Front.  Thanks to the skillful regrouping of troops conducted by Grechko, the 3rd Panzer and 38th armies defeated the Germans in Kiev with a powerful offensive. </p><h2>  Liberation of Europe </h2><p>  In 1943, Grechko Andrei Antonovich (the years of the war brought him invaluable military experience) was already in the rank of colonel general.  He was appointed to command the 1st Guards Army, which was then under his command until the end of the war.  Grechko‚Äôs troops participated in the liberation of Zhytomyr, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.  Then Grechko‚Äôs army reached Prague. </p><h2>  Grechko's activities after the war </h2><p>  After the Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the future Marshal Grechko Andrey Antonovich led the troops of the Kiev district.  In 1953 he became Commander-in-Chief of all Soviet military units located in Germany.  In June of that year, he led the suppression of the uprising. </p>

    <p>  Grechko also visited his native village.  She was in a deplorable state, completely destroyed.  Andrei Antonovich helped all fellow countrymen to "get back on their feet" again after the war.  Thanks to his support, the village was quickly restored.  Helped by technology, manpower.  He took patronage over other villages and entire areas destroyed during the war.  New houses, office buildings, schools were erected. </p><p>  In early 1967, Rodion Malinovsky was the Minister of Defense.  But he did not welcome new directions (equipment, helicopters, space exploration, etc.).  It was just Andrei Grechko, Marshal of the USSR, who was engaged in this.  As a result, he was able to gather near him many talented and young personnel, ready for the further development of the country. </p><p>  Malinovsky did not finish to retirement.  He fell ill and ended up in a hospital, from which he no longer left.  In his place Brezhnev appointed Grechko Andrei Antonovich.  In the post of <span>Minister of Defense of the USSR,</span> he worked for 9 years.  He proved himself to be a demanding and principled leader.  I did not tolerate people who were "out of place".  He carefully selected the staff, paying attention to the track record. </p><p>  For example, General Joseph Gusakovsky decided to review the staff and rejuvenate him.  He put on the list for the dismissal of many high military leaders who had vast experience to replace them with younger ones.  Brought this document for approval by Grechko.  Andrei Antonovich, after reading the list, offered to head it to Gusakovsky.  Thus, the general lost his post.  Grechko highly appreciated the experience and achievements of war veterans. </p>

And later, in 1990, Grechko‚Äôs wife was buried.  Andrei Antonovich adopted his granddaughters, the twins Claudius and Irina, who were born to their only daughter.  Newly made "daughters" grew up, got married and gave birth to a girl.  And they, too, were adopted by Andrei Antonovich Grechko.  His children and granddaughters after the death of a parent subsequently received pensions from the state.  And from childhood, governesses looked after them. </p><h2>  The death of the great warlord </h2><p>  When Andropov took the post of Minister of Defense, he tried to strengthen the influence and expansion of the structures of the State Security.  But Grechko, Marshal of the USSR, reacted negatively to this and ‚Äúslowed down‚Äù the Secretary General.  The relationship between them was tense.  Historians believe that Andropov desired complete power and gradually ‚Äúremoved‚Äù those who were objectionable to him on the way to the ‚Äústate Olympus‚Äù. </p><p>  Very often, prominent figures died somehow very late.  Most often, a person went to bed completely healthy.  And in the morning the guards found a cold corpse in bed.  Oddly enough, but the earthly path of Andrei Antonovich ended just like that.  In 1976, on April 26, Grechko, Marshal of the USSR, returned from work to his country house in good health.  As always, went to bed calmly.  And in the morning his body was found in bed. </p><p>  Death overtook the Marshal suddenly.  Grechko died in a dream.  There were no traces of violent death, and the doctors were unable to establish the cause of the death of Andrei Antonovich.  On the contrary, they assured that Grechko was in excellent physical shape.  Therefore, his death was more than strange.  The urn with the ashes of Andrei Antonovich is located on Red Square, in the Kremlin wall. </p>
