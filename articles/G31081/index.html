Or maybe you just bought a blouse and immediately stained it with a pen?  Anything can happen, you should not be upset.  Clothes can be decorated.  Embroider a pattern on it, sew on beads or a decorative patch.  Look for creative clothing decor ideas below. </p><h2>  Embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocket decor" class="if uuid-2287008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287008.jpg"></div><p>  Needlework is in fashion today, and embroidery is the most popular female craft.  Most girls prefer to embroider paintings, but do not want to hang the whole house with their creations.  And it stops many from creativity.  There is a way, decorate <span>clothes.</span>  <span>The embroidery on</span> it looks great and not a bit old-fashioned.  Even "fashion houses" quite often decorate their models of clothing with a pattern of threads.  What to take as a motive?  Various animals look very cute.  Chanterelles, bunnies, chickens and cats looking out of their pockets or sleeping peacefully on their collars are in fashion today.  Embroidering them will not be difficult even for a novice craftswoman.  You need to draw a contour of the figure, and then fill it with threads.  You can embroider in the smooth surface technique, as well as apply threads with chaotic movements.  Both that and other style are actual today. </p><h2>  Applique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY clothing decor" class="if uuid-2287017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287017.jpg"></div><p>  Fabric patch can save any clothes.  No matter what the size of the stain or hole you put, it can always be patched.  To make the patch look harmonious, and not like a foreign decor, it should be organically included in the outfit.  For example, make some kind of composition.  The picture above shows the dress of the D&amp;G fashion house.  Funny mice walking around the dress look cute and creative.  You can build something similar.  Take any children's illustration and draw a small sketch from there.  Then cut out the pattern from the fabric and sew it on the clothes using the machine.  If you do not have a typewriter, then the application can be attached in two ways: either using a needle or using a hook. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not necessary to make decor for clothes that are torn.  You can buy a simple dress in the store and make it a masterpiece.  The thing will turn out author's and unique. </p><h2>  Beads </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes decoration elements" class="if uuid-2287027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287027.jpg"></div><p>  DIY clothing decor is easy to do.  It is only necessary to think up what and where to sew.  But how to do this, you can decide in the course of the work.  You can decorate delicate things with the help of beads.  And why only subtle?  Small circles in a woolen jacket will be lost, and you will not succeed in embroidering any pattern.  More precisely, it may work, but the picture will not be visible at all.  Another thing is the decor of clothes made of thin fabric.  The beads will not fall into the fabric and will remain lying on the surface.  For example, consider how to decorate the neckline of a blouse. </p><p>  First you need to make an embroidered backing.  Use a pencil to draw a pattern of twigs, and then embroider it with gold thread.  If you do not want to do this, then you can take long beads in the form of leaves and sew them.  On top of this decor, beads of different sizes and colors should be attached.  But of course, the color scheme must be sustained.  That is, use either warm or cold tones. </p><h2>  Lace </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes decoration elements" class="if uuid-2287031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287031.jpg"></div><p>  One of the easiest and most effective ways to decorate a hole is to insert a piece of lace into it.  This method is great for patches on jeans or sweatshirts.  And you can also use lace to increase the size of clothes.  How?  Make a cut on the back of the product and insert a triangular wedge into it.  This decor does not look like a patch, but it can organically complement both a light jacket and a warm sweater and even a jacket.  But you need to choose lace in accordance with the material.  If you are expanding a T-shirt or blouse, take a thin lace, but in order to make a sweater a couple of sizes larger, you will need crocheted lace.  And what else can be decorated in this way?  Outerwear.  The coat option looks interesting on the lapels and collar of which lace elements are sewn.  The image immediately becomes light and feminine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wallow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.clozette.co.id" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY clothing decor ideas" class="if uuid-2287036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287036.jpg"></div><p>  Decor of clothing items can be made of wool.  Today, many girls make toys and jewelry from her.  And you can dump patches for yourself.  They will especially look on the sleeves of the sweater.  What is needed for this?  You will need wool, a long needle and a sponge. </p><p>  To facilitate your task and not create unnecessary stencils, you can use baking tins.  Under the sleeve you need to put a sponge.  We put a mold on it and begin to fill it with wool.  After the first layer is tamped, you can begin to manufacture the next.  And so on until the form is clearly read.  If you roll not the first time, then you can make more complex figures.  You do not need to drive yourself into a screen frame.  Do as you like.  You can mix wool in different colors, decorate patches with beads, rhinestones or buttons. </p><h2>  Paint </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clothing decor ideas" class="if uuid-2287045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287045.jpg"></div><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãclothing decor can be quite simple.  Draw any shapes with acrylic paint.  So you can easily refresh old jeans or a plain T-shirt.  It will be very easy to apply the picture using a stencil.  Such cartons can be made independently, or can be purchased at the store.  The paint must be diluted in water, and then a piece of foam should be drawn on a stencil.  If it is inconvenient for you to hold foam, you can make an impromptu brush by putting a piece of soft material on a pencil.  Thus, you can draw not only primitive figures, but also whole artwork. </p><h2>  Mixed media </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded clothes decor" class="if uuid-2287048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2287048.jpg"></div><p>  One of the ideas for DIY clothing decor is to combine several technologies presented above into a single whole.  You can embroider stems with thread, and collect inflorescences from beads.  If this option seems trivial to you, then make legs of flowers from ribbons.  This way of decorating sweaters can be found infrequently.  Do not want to embroider, and nothing can be added from ribbons?  In this case, you can resort to the application.  Cut the leaves and legs of green felt and sew them to the fabric.  You can lay a secret line, or deliberately stitch along the outline of the entire figure.  In this case, the flowers can also be made from fabric or collected from large beads.  You can also use bugles or rhinestones.  And if you make an application in the form of an animal, you can use pompons.  Fluffy balls can consist of both threads and fur. </p>
