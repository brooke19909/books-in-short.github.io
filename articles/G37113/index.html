This is one of the very first settlements of the Black Sea Cossacks.  The village has a long history.  It developed, was occupied by the Germans and partially destroyed.  Like a phoenix, a settlement was reborn to be forgotten again. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  Starominskaya (Krasnodar Territory) <strong> </strong>  The village was founded in 1794.  The settlement became one of the first 40 smokers of the Cossack Black Sea army.  The village got its name from the village of Mena, located on <span>the Desna River.</span>  At first the settlement was called Mensky, then it was renamed Minsk.  Over time, in 1842, smokers acquired the status of villages.  So Starominskaya appeared. </p><h2>  Village development </h2><p>  In 1802, there were 15 yards in the village.  Gradually Cossacks came to their permanent place of residence.  In the period from 1821 to 1825, the settlement was replenished with immigrants from the Chernigov and Poltava provinces.  In 1861, there were already 700 yards and almost five thousand inhabitants in the village.  In 1863, the very first elementary school appeared in the settlement. </p>
