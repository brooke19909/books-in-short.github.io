History, hotels, sights and beaches</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Along the southern <span>coast of Spain, the</span> Costa del Sol Occidental, near Malaga, is the resort town of Torremolinos.  Once a fishing village has become a popular resort not so long ago.  This was facilitated by the rapid development of the tourism business in the middle of the last century.  Today, Torremolinos is inhabited by about 70,000 people.  Hundreds of tourists visit its famous beaches every year.  About the history of the city, its attractions, hotels and traditions, read the article. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The name of the city is symbolic.  During the reign of the Nasrid dynasty in 1497, the Phoenicians built a signal tower at the mills, or Torre de los Molinos.  The tower served as a defense for people who have lived since the founding of Saduce.  This town was inhabited mainly by the Romans, who at that time waged war with the Granada caliphate. </p>

    <p>  Throughout its existence, the tower has changed several names.  For example, before the liberation of Granada from the Arab yoke, it was named in honor of the Liberating Count Rodrigo Pimentel.  Today, the Torre de los Molinos tower is the historical symbol of the city in whose honor it is named.  Currently, the structure is severely destroyed, the outer walls have deep cracks.  The terraces previously located at a height of 12 meters and the loopholes located on the second floor cannot be restored.  In total, 14 mills and a weaving mill worked in the city over the past century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels Torremolinos </h2><p>  Spain is a tourist country, but it was not always like that.  For a long time, local residents were fishing.  Having survived difficult times, the city begins its development again in the middle of the 19th century.  The first resort, which received tourists from around the world, was the Costa del Sol.  By this time, the owner of the fortress of Santa Clara - Englishman George Langworthy, converted it into a presentable hotel.  To this day, hot Spain is famous for this resort. </p>

    <p>  Torremolinos continues to evolve, and after the Englishman, other neighbors pick up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtourists.  So, Carlota Alessandri (Carlota Alessandri) after the restoration of his estate in 1933, opens a new hotel "Parador Montemar" (Parador Montemar).  This cozy establishment has only seven rooms.  During her life, the hostess constantly watched the former estate, rebuilding the hotel several times.  With her death, he ceased to function, and a memorial plaque was erected in his place in honor of Carlota Alessandri.  Now the building is used as a residential complex, equipped with a beautiful garden and pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain torremonilos" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1946481.jpg" width="600"></div>
