  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When and why does Sberbank not work? Reasons, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  70 million Russians use the services of Sberbank, not counting customers abroad.  The bank is reliable and stable.  But even in his work, intermittent failures occur.  What should clients do if Sberbank does not work and how to understand the causes of problems? </p><h2>  Branch Difficulties </h2><p>  Faced with the inconvenience of additional offices have rarely.  But sometimes customers complain about the system.  Why do Sberbank offices not work?  There are several reasons for this: </p><ol><li>  Change the schedule or mode.  When a branch switches to a new format, changes the address or structure of work, schedule changes are possible.  Information for customers is usually located on the front door. </li><li>  The technical error.  The programs that Sberbank uses to work with clients are some of the best in Russia.  But they are periodically changed and supplemented, which can lead to rare system failures.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to wait 20-30 minutes for the manager to continue working.  But in exceptional cases, downtime can drag on for a day or more. </li><li>  Emergency.  A fire, an attempted robbery, or training anxiety - whatever the cause of a malfunction, Sberbank employees always try to notify customers about what happened. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.patentlyapple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank ATMs do not work" class="if uuid-3213221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3213221.jpg"></div><p>  If the office the client contacted does not work, it is better to choose the nearest branch and get the service there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sberbank Application Problems </h2><p>  The mobile application and Sberbank Online may periodically fail.  Most often this happens at night when administrators update services.  If Sberbank Online does not work in the regular version, you can use the mobile application.  Its functionality is almost completely consistent with the full version of the site. </p><p>  Cases when the Sberbank application does not work are extremely rare.  Sometimes the reason for the failure lies in the fact that the client changed the firmware on the phone or refused to install the update.  In case of a long failure (2-5 days), it is recommended to download and install the application again, to clear the phone‚Äôs memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphonews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank application does not work" class="if uuid-3213222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3213222.jpg"></div><p>  If Sberbank Online does not work after changing the phone number, you need to attach the new number to a bank card.  Then the codes from SMS will again come to the owner of the credit card. </p><h2>  Failures in the automatic payment service </h2><p>  Auto payments make life easier for Sberbank customers.  They allow you to reduce the time for payment transactions and transfers, save on commissions.  When Sberbank‚Äôs auto payments do not work, the client has to re-execute the operations on their own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank does not work" class="if uuid-3213224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3213224.jpg"></div><p>  The reasons for the failure of automatic payment may be: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Lack of funds in the account.  In this case, the service is suspended until the client replenishes the credit card. </li><li>  Suspension by SMS code.  Before the auto payment is debited for services, a notification with a cancellation code arrives.  Some customers mistakenly send a code voluntarily suspending the service. </li><li>  Exceeding payment limit.  To resume payment, you need to confirm the operation or edit the auto payment by deleting the limit. </li></ul><h2>  Mobile Banking Issues </h2><p>  The SMS informing service is very popular, as it allows you to control the balance on the card and accounts, use the Internet bank and make quick transfers.  But sometimes Sberbank‚Äôs mobile bank does not work, and customers cannot understand why this is happening. </p><p>  Problems may be related: </p><ul><li>  With a lack of funds in the account.  After replenishment, the full package of the mobile bank continues to work as before.  Payment is debited monthly. </li><li>  With a change of number or operator.  If a customer bought a new SIM card, it must be tied to a bank card.  Only after that, SMS from 900 will be sent to the owner of the credit card.  When changing the operator with saving the number, information operation may fail, therefore it is recommended to deactivate the service and re-link the card after switching to a new mobile operator. </li><li>  With full phone memory.  After cleaning the excess files, SMS will be sent again. </li><li>  With a bad cellular signal.  Away from the towers and in the lowlands, SMS can arrive belatedly.  If at the same time you manage to get through or send a regular message, you should report the problem to the bank support service. </li></ul><h2>  Problems with self-service devices </h2><p>  Clients can use ATMs and Sberbank terminals around the clock.  But sometimes the work of machines leaves much to be desired. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank does not work online" class="if uuid-3213219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3213219.jpg"></div><p>  For what reason do Sberbank ATMs not work? </p><ol><li>  Engineering works.  About this, as a rule, customers are notified by an inscription on the device screen.  Insert a card in this case is prohibited.  She will be swallowed by an ATM. </li><li>  Lack of funds.  If there is no cash, a message appears when you try to insert a card into an ATM. </li><li>  Reboot  When accepting bills or sorting, the client will also be unable to use the ATM. </li><li>  Power off  Without electricity, self-service is not possible. </li><li>  Problems reading cards.  In this case, the client will be able to perform the transaction in cash, but it will not be possible to withdraw from the credit card, deposit funds to it or pay. </li></ol>
