Surely many of us have heard of such a mobile communication format as 3G.  Maybe one of us now has a card of an operator providing third-generation communication services on his phone or tablet.  So, imagine, 3G technology is out of date.  In many ways, it is inferior to the new connection, which is several times faster - 4G LTE.  What is it, and why the transition to a new and improved communication format will not happen as fast as we would like, we will tell further. </p><h2>  4G connection - the best internet in the world </h2>

    <p>  So, let's start with the fact that today <span>communication</span> using fourth-generation technology (or LTE-Internet, as it is also called) is the most advanced format for remote <span>data transmission</span> in a mobile network.  It can be called the best in comparison with those formats that existed earlier (2G and 3G in particular).  The reason for this is simple - the high transmission speed of <span>4G LTE.</span>  <span>What this</span> means in practice is evident from the simplest example: if we can download a movie in a third-generation network in 40-50 minutes, then, working in LTE, downloading the same amount of data can be achieved in some 7-8 minutes.  Really impressive? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why are we still on 3G? </h2>

    <p>  However, do not rejoice at such a high speed <span>of information transfer</span> prematurely.  In fact, operators are experiencing a large number of problems associated with building a 4G network.  First of all, it is the high cost of equipment, which must be launched additionally in order to block the existing <span>mobile network.</span>  Roughly speaking, to provide the Internet in 4G LTE format, MTS (like any other operator) is forced to rebuild a huge number of towers.  All this is a big operational and financial cost. </p><h2>  How to find a device to work in LTE? </h2><p>  In addition to the problem associated with the construction of a network for the transmission of data of the fourth generation, there is another.  It lies in the device with which subscribers are connected. </p>

    <p>  Let's just say: in order to catch <span>4G Internet,</span> you must have one of the most advanced gadgets (since only the "top" models, as a rule, are able to work with this format).  Therefore, a logical question arises as to whether it is worth making such a quick transition to a 4G LTE network, for which a modem is not so easy to find.  The operators obviously proceed from the fact that it is not so expedient to do it very quickly.  Therefore, we continue to use mainly Internet services in the 3G network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Yota 4G Modem (LTE) </h2><p>  Of course, some attempts are being made to popularize communication in the fourth generation network by individual operators.  Recall a modem that supports communication in LTE, which is actively promoted by Yota.  On their website several models of various modems are presented at once, which are suitable for working with all devices.  Their cost varies between 1900 and 6900 rubles, and as a bonus when buying some devices the user can get a free unlimited Internet connection for a month. </p>

    <p>  Thus, buying a 4G LTE router, you can also get a certain period of free use of services, which is beneficial for those who would like to try working with Yota.  In general, this operator is answered in a good way, because, judging by the main tariffs, its prices are quite adequate.  This fact attracts many users. </p><h2>  Yota Rates </h2><p>  We will present detailed information regarding operation in the LTE network through this operator.  Yota has all the tariffs, which are called as follows: ‚Äúfor smartphone‚Äù, ‚Äúfor tablet‚Äù and ‚Äúfor computer‚Äù, have different speeds, but all of them are unlimited.  For 390 rubles per month, you can purchase a package with a data transfer rate of 1 Mbit / s;  for 590 rubles, the speed increases to 3 Mbit / s, and for 790 rubles, an unlimited speed package is offered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  This is beneficial given that the size of the packets is unlimited.  Let's just say which tariff to choose, depends on why you want to connect LTE (4G).  Testimonials indicate that even with a minimal package, you can comfortably view your mail, chat on social networks and find out the weather.  At the maximum rate, respectively, the user can watch videos and movies online.  Convenient, isn't it? </p><h2>  MTS tariffs </h2><p>  True, not all mobile operators have such comfortable and affordable tariffs as Yota.  From another major operator - MTS, buying a 4G (LTE) WiFi router, you can also get a month of Internet as a gift.  Prices here start from a lower mark - 1350 rubles per device.  True, with the tariffs themselves the operator is not so smooth.  See for yourself. </p>

    <p>  MTS offers in addition to the outdated Connect tariff 4G LTE plans of a new type: Mini, Maxi, VIP.  The cost varies between 350 and 1200 rubles.  per month of use.  True, even the maximum tariff here does not imply unlimited access to the network - the packet size is limited to thirty gigabytes.  Unless, as a bonus, a user can activate the unlimited night use of the Internet.  But, you understand, even if you do not take into account the promotion for which a Yota 4G LTE modem is provided as a gift when ordering a certain number of months of using the service, this operator has more favorable conditions than MTS. </p><h2>  Tariffs Beeline and Megafon </h2><p>  As for other mobile Internet service providers in Russia, the situation there is not too different.  Yes, both Beeline and Megafon are ready to offer the user unlimited tariffs at the maximum fee.  Again, if you buy their 4G LTE mobile router (each operator has a company store where it can be purchased cheaper), you can access the bonus in the form of a free month of using the service.  But they, when compared with the operator Yota, prices are higher. </p><h2>  Service Quality Reviews </h2><p>  Still it is necessary to take into account the feedback that subscribers leave about a particular operator.  In particular, many talk about such minor problems as the sharp loss of a network signal while on the Internet.  Users even provide snapshots of the download logs, where you can see the dips in the time line of the speed tracking.  The cause of such troubles and whether they can somehow be avoided is unknown.  Probably, the Yota 4G LTE modem has nothing to do with it, and the problem is the provider. </p><p>  In general, as users note, the signal quality and its level depend largely on the place where the device is located.  Of course, there are maps on the operators website that mark the entire zone of the Moscow Region as the territory to which the 4G network signal extends.  However, this is a myth.  There are practically ‚Äúdead‚Äù zones even in Moscow itself, not to mention the terrain beyond its borders.  They said that building an LTE connection is expensive.  Here is the policy of the providers and there is confirmation of this: they therefore do not build new 4G LTE towers, because it is unprofitable and expensive. </p><h2>  How to choose an operator? </h2><p>  However, if you would like to try to connect a service such as 4G Internet, you should think about the operator you would like to contact.  If you already have a SIM card (starter pack) of one of them, you can connect the service to it.  Thus, you can save money on buying a new card.  In addition, it is possible that you will receive more loyal conditions as a regular customer. </p><p>  If it‚Äôs clear that your operator‚Äôs tariff plans are less profitable than those of another provider, we recommend that you learn more about them in order to switch to it. </p><p>  In this article, we note that many call the optimal operator Yota.  With it, you can best feel all the delights of 4G LTE (what it is, we examined above) and experience the benefits of a fourth-generation network. </p><h2>  How to go? </h2><p>  If you already have a device that supports 4G network, you can safely switch to this communication format.  Of course, you need to have a SIM card of the tariff plan that involves high-speed Internet services.  By the way, these are no different from ordinary ones.  And finding out whether your phone or tablet supports this format or not is very simple: its name indicates this.  For example, Samsung 4G LTE Galaxy S5.  Etc. </p>

    <p>  For the most part, the newest models of the middle and upper price classes, as a rule, support work in this network.  If you have a flagship gadget in your line at all, you can be sure of one hundred percent compatibility with 4G!  Here is another example.  One of the best phablets of the Korean company - Samsung Note 4G LTE - format supports.  And so with any other brand. </p><h2>  4G disadvantages in Russia </h2><p>  Of course, in Russia, the culture of using high-speed mobile Internet has not yet reached the scale that can be observed in the West.  In the USA, for example, many operators are trying to transfer subscribers to LTE format as soon as possible, offering smartphones that support this network and more favorable conditions for those who thought and switched to such a tariff. </p><p>  As for Russia, here everything is sadder in terms of technology.  Despite the huge number of tablets and smartphones, most of them belong to the budget class, and therefore work in LTE is not supported.  Operators see low activity on the high-speed Internet network, and therefore are not in a hurry to increase coverage.  In turn, users complain about failures in signal reception and lack of coverage in most regions in general.  It turns out a kind of vicious circle, get out of which will be possible, given the economic situation, soon. </p><p>  However, do not despair.  Residents of the capital, at least now, can use the services of operators, instantly downloading pages, downloading music in a couple of seconds and downloading the full version of their favorite movie in minutes.  Perhaps, having felt the delights of LTE communication, users will spread the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãswitching to such a communication format that will allow operators to invest more in the development of this area.  In addition, very soon even cheap mobile devices will support 4G.  And this will mean only one thing: 4G will become more accessible for us, and this process is inevitable. </p>
