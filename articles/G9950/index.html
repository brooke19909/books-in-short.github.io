    <p>  Almost everyone knows who is depicted on dollars in denominations of 50 units.  This is the 18th <span>president of America,</span> Willis Grant.  He is familiar to many as a hero of the US Civil War.  Grant was a military and political leader, commander of the northerners, <span>army general.</span> </p><h2>  Who is depicted in dollars, on which there are no portraits of presidents </h2><p>  On a $ 10 bill, you can see a portrait of the first US Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton.  This statesman of America was the ideologist and leader of the federalist party from the very beginning of its creation. </p><p>  The largest US bill to date is $ 100.  Almost everyone knows who is depicted on it, because this is one of the most frequently encountered American "papers" in our country.  It depicts a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, who was a publicist, diplomat and famous scientist.  He is known as a publisher, journalist, and politician who was one of the leaders of the American Revolutionary War. </p><h2>  Out of circulation money </h2><p>  Earlier in the USA there was money in denominations of 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 dollars.  They were mainly used in settlements between criminal groups or in interbank operations.  The first three bills featured presidents William McKinley, Grover Cleveland and <span>James Madison</span> respectively.  The $ 10,000 bill depicts the head of the Supreme Court of America, Salmon Chase.  There was also a $ 100,000 bill bearing a portrait of 28th President <span>Woodrow Wilson.</span> </p><p>  Interestingly, those depicted in dollars were not necessarily there from the very beginning.  So, for example, on the first dollar bill was a portrait not of George Washington, but of Salmon Chase, who at that time held the position of Secretary of the Treasury. </p>
