    <p>  <strong>A bit of history</strong> </p><p>  Light emission during the passage of electric current through the electron-hole transition of a <span>semiconductor device</span> was known at the beginning of the 20th century.  Thus, in 1907, Henry Joseph Round, an inventor from the United Kingdom, described the effect of electroluminescence during the passage of an electric current through a pair of metal - silicon carbide, accompanied by a yellow, green, and orange glow at the cathode.  Similar experiments were carried out in 1923 by the Soviet scientist Oleg Losev (by the way, until the beginning of the 70s, American scientists called the LED light ‚ÄúLosev Light‚Äù, later this name was forgotten).  But then they did not attach much importance to this discovery, and therefore they did not study it for several decades. </p><p>  In 1961, the invention of the infrared was patented, and in 1962, it worked in the light (red) range of the LED.  Subsequently, the invention was constantly improved.  Accordingly, its cost also decreased.  So, in 1968, the price for LED bulbs was about $ 200, and therefore their practical use was very limited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, these lamps are used almost everywhere.  For this, LEDs with all popular types of socles are available: E27, E14, GU5.3, G53, GU10, G13. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED bulbs for car" class="if" height="467" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/266048.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>How is an LED bulb better than usual?</strong> </p><p>  LED lamps have the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  High light output.  Modern samples of these lighting devices for this parameter are quite comparable with metal-halogen and sodium <span>gas discharge lamps.</span> </li><li>  Low power consumption.  It is many times lower than conventional light sources. </li><li>  Long term of operation.  Depending on the manufacturer and production technology, the LED bulb can last from thirty to one hundred thousand hours.  At the same time, the number of on-off cycles does not greatly affect the life of the LED. </li><li>  High strength and vibration resistance.  This is achieved due to the fact that there are no components sensitive to mechanical influences. </li><li>  Low inertia.  Unlike other lamps, LED almost immediately begins to shine at full brightness.  In addition, she is not afraid of power surges. </li><li>  High environmental friendliness.  Unlike <span>energy-saving lamps,</span> LEDs do not contain mercury and other harmful substances. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that every year more and more motorists began to use <span>LED bulbs for cars.</span>  Possessing the same qualities as LEDs for domestic lighting, they are available with various base options (h1, h3, h7, h8, h10, etc.). They are installed in the headlights of the car, not only as fog lights, but also as a low beam and high beam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="light bulbs led Price" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/266054.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps the only drawback that LED bulbs have is the high cost.  The cheapest LEDs (LL) cost about 500 rubles, and the cost of the most expensive (SPOT) can reach 5 thousand.  Although everything, as they say, is relative.  A significant life of LED lamps, multiplied by the amount of energy expended, may well be even more profitable than using a conventional electric bulb. </p>
