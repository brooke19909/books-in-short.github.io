    <p>  Since the database for the sale of real estate is one of the largest in the country, contains many thousands of objects of any level - from elite to the most inexpensive and is updated daily, prices remain the most acceptable.  That is why the MITS-Real Estate agency is most often chosen.  Customer reviews suggest that no error has occurred.  More than seventy percent of the clientele appears here on the recommendations of relatives, acquaintances, friends, or after reading the reviews section.  Since 1999, the agency has grown more than a hundred times, respectively, and the base has increased.

    <p>  The experience of employees hired by the agency should not be less than five years, this is also mentioned in reviews of the "MITS-Real Estate" personnel department employees.  Business processes were constantly improved, the service was becoming increasingly high quality, so the group of companies was able to very successfully implement a number of large and important projects.  More than twenty <span>residential complexes</span> with developed infrastructure were built and commissioned only in Moscow and the region.  And this practice has not been abandoned; at the moment, construction of other objects is already underway. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Reviews of work in the "MITS-Real Estate" (Moscow) relate primarily to professionalism in this area, and the list of services provided to the clientele by the agency is also discussed.  The most basic of the following are: </p><ul><li>  Sale and purchase of rooms, apartments and houses (residential objects of the secondary fund) in the capital and its environs. </li><li>  In second place are issues of the exchange of rooms and apartments. </li><li>  The primary <span>market of Moscow</span> and the Moscow Region is the sale and purchase of apartments in new buildings (any stage of construction), where mortgage lending, housing subsidies and military certificates are discussed. </li><li>  Real Estate of the Moscow Region - purchase, sale and exchange of land, cottages and country estates. </li><li>  In MITS-Real Estate, reviews about the employer are quite common.  They note mutually beneficial cooperation.  They rarely criticize, and most often these are random people. </li><li>  <span>Commercial real estate</span> - work with the rental, purchase or sale of industrial and commercial facilities, offices and warehouses. </li><li>  Optimal lending programs are discussed up to pawn loans - bank loans, pledges, mortgages. </li><li>  A special article of services is expert assessments, since the value of Russian real estate does not stand still, but has a floating character.  Employees write a lot about the nuances of compiling official reports and documentation for various authorities. </li><li>  Foreign real estate is being discussed quite actively - mainly its purchase. </li></ul><p>  Here is the main thing in which the work in the "MIC Real Estate" consists.  Employee reviews really help customers in choosing options. </p><h2>  About professionals </h2><p>  As can be seen from the previous chapter, the range of services provided to clients by the agency is very extensive.  Here they conduct a deal professionally, from the selection of an object to ensuring its absolute safety.  All commitments made to customers are strictly implemented, the agreed deadlines are always met.  All this is confirmed in the "MITS-Real Estate" <span>employee reviews.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> knows this company, and despite a slight decline in demand for residential and even office space, agents almost never work without work. </p>

    <p>  It is rather difficult for a layman to prepare transactions with commercial real estate.  Moreover, this is fraught with complications both in Russia and abroad.  This task is too large-scale, too multi-stage.  First of all, the difficulty lies in the fact that an object of such a plan needs to be adequately evaluated, and without a specialist it is simply impossible to do.  In addition, you must have information, and even better - a detailed analysis regarding the commercial potential of this facility.  Without a carefully designed strategy to attract buyers, the sale can move as long as you like.  It is a completely different matter if the deal is taken by professionals.  This will be effective, since the experience at MITS-Real Estate is enormous in this direction. </p><h2>  What to do to the client </h2><p>  First of all, a potential client needs to make an appointment for a consultation or call in Moscow: (495) 961-00-05.  After that, everything should go like clockwork: the transaction will be executed safely and quickly, comfortably and without burdens.  It is very difficult to even consider this immense sea of ‚Äã‚Äãoffers, and it is almost impossible to navigate in it for a layman. </p><p>  The agency has the largest database, they can operate with large sums of money so as not to lose anything, documents are collected and executed quickly and accurately.  Therefore, the final deal cannot drag out or take a lot of energy for the client.  MITS-Real Estate will select options, organize negotiations, views, prepare documents, ensure the security of mutual settlements, help with subsidies and housing certificates, receive a tax deduction and provide all kinds of advice. </p>
