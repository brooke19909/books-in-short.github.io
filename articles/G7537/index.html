    <h2>  First impressions are misleading </h2><p>  When you look at the company "Investstroy", you get the impression of a good organization.  The company has been operating for quite some time.  During its activities, she managed to gain a good reputation, as well as put into operation many residential complexes.  And, of course, it may seem that all these are the fruits of the labor of a friendly team, a close-knit team of employees and management. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  That's just all this at first glance.  If, as they say, digging closer, the director of Investstroy will not be as positive and good as you might think.  This is evidenced by his attitude not only to business partners, but also to his employees.  And they themselves do not speak flattering about him at all.  Next, we will analyze the opinions of the employees of this organization. </p><h2>  What employees think about Investstroy: feedback from former employees </h2><p>  Employees of the company "Investstroy" very unflattering comments about the director.  According to many of them, Sergei Fedorovich Dankov is regularly rude to his subordinates.  Moreover, he does not respect their work, forcing them to work after school hours.  In addition, he regularly delays wages, often “throws money” on his wards. </p><p>  As his former employees write in reviews, Investstroy is a good organization in itself.  But her leadership is disrespectful to employees.  According to them, it is necessary for a very long time "to go and beat out your hard-earned money."  For the same reason, the organization has a large turnover.  Other former employees say they were paid, but half the amount promised. </p><p>  In addition, some contractors complain about the unfair attitude to partners.  According to them, the organization “Invesstroy” in the person of Sergei Fedorovich Dankov repeatedly avoided paying the promised fee. </p>

    <h2>  Unpleasant scandal with credit apartments </h2><p>  In addition to the unpleasant situation with former employees who repeatedly complained about the negligent employer, an unpleasant incident with loan apartments added fuel to the fire.  The incident occurred in Novosibirsk, where there is also a representative office of this organization. </p><p>  The problem arose among the residents of one of the residential complexes on Vilyuiskaya.  It so happened that the residents, although they live in apartments from the aforementioned developer, are in fact not the owners of the living space.  In other words, they are not entitled to sell, give, or even dispose of their square meters.  At the same time, the design process itself does not budge. </p><p>  Just imagine, people paid for the apartment, having signed an agreement on shared participation, made repairs there and live.  But in fact, they have no documentation confirming their rights to this property.  Moreover, the apartments in this house, as it turned out, are on credit, that is, they are the subject of a pledge.  It is noteworthy that in a company from which tenants bought square meters, they regularly make promises to rectify the situation and solve the problem with the bank.  However, "things are still there." </p><p>  According to lawyers, the situation is really deplorable.  It turns out that two companies are involved here at once - “Invesstroy” (appears as a developer) and “Investkom” (engaged in paperwork with share participation of residents).  Further, the company “Investcom”, having taken money from customers, did not carry out mandatory state registration.  Moreover, she did not even bother to inform interest holders that their apartments at that time were already pledged by the lender. </p><p>  Here it is worth noting one nuance: since the apartments were pledged, it was possible to sell them, give or exchange them only with the direct permission of the bank.  But since the credit organization did not give its “go-ahead” for the implementation of this transaction, the transfer of rights to the already paid apartments to the residents did not take place. </p><p>  Lawyers are sure that in order to avoid troubles, the company “Investkom” insured itself and went for a little trick.  She invited her clients to the office and, under various pretexts, persuaded to sign a new document.  According to preliminary information, in it future apartment owners voluntarily agreed to provide an interest-free loan to Investcom.  However, these agreements were not registered and notarized. </p><h2>  What do equity holders do in this situation? </h2><p>  According to lawyers, at the moment it’s too early to sound the bells and raise the alarm.  The company "Investcom" from the problems are not denied.  On the contrary, they promise to settle it before the end of this year.  In an extreme case, according to lawyers, disappointed residents can always go to court.  After all, they have in their hands an agreement on equity participation. </p><p>  In turn, the developer himself promises to help in solving this problem.  According to the representatives of "Invesstroy", in the near future it is planned to renew the contract with customers.  It is supposed to draw up a contract of sale.  However, according to lawyers, the outcome of the problem will depend on the integrity of the developer and the intermediary company. </p><h2>  How to act potential buyers? </h2><p>  In order not to fall into a similar situation, experts recommend the following actions: </p><ul><li>  Pay attention to the construction site (you need to find out if construction work is going on there or not). </li><li>  Take a look at the developer’s website and check for the presence of a project declaration. </li><li>  Study the contract several times and conclude it if you agree with all the points. </li><li>  Deposit money after your contract is registered on the official website of Rosreestr. </li></ul><p>  Other documents that involve the assignment of rights to your property must be carefully reviewed.  And it is best to do this accompanied by a lawyer.  Otherwise, there is always a chance to fall for the bait of deceivers and scammers.  And litigation, as you know, can drag on for years and lead to nothing. </p>
