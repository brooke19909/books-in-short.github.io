The project provides for the construction of six monolithic-brick houses, each of which has a height of 16-17 floors.  Currently, four buildings (Nos. 1, 3, 2 and 6) have already been completed. </p><h2>  New project </h2><p>  The construction of the Flower City complex is carried out by the Stroytex group of companies.  The houses being built will meet the high requirements that are currently being presented for housing. </p>

It reflects the latest achievements of the construction industry and world experience in the field of quarterly development.  <span>The residential complex</span> will become a real city in the city.  On the territory of the LCD ‚ÄúFlower City‚Äù all the facilities necessary for a comfortable and full life of the population of the microdistrict are provided.  The project was developed by specialists from the institute of the State Unitary Enterprise NIIIP of the General Plan of Moscow.  The customer was the administration of Mytishchi district.  "Flower City" will be commissioned with its own infrastructure and landscaped area.  However, like all the objects erected by Stroyteks.

    <h2><br>  Transport connection </h2><p>  Mytishchi is connected with Moscow by several highways.  It is worth saying that traffic jams on them are absolutely commonplace.  But in addition to road communication, the city has a railway station.  From her regularly to the Yaroslavl station go electric trains.  Unfortunately, you need to get to the nearest metro station from Mytishchi with transfers.  There are no direct routes in this direction.  If you go by car, then the Medvedkovo metro station can be reached in twenty minutes (the distance to it is 11 km). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Urban microdistricts (Mytishchi) became attractive due to their proximity to Moscow.  An electric train will take you to the center of the capital in just twenty minutes. </p><p>  The residential complex is located at a short distance from the Moscow Ring Road, which is only two kilometers.  Thus, it will be possible to get to Moscow by private car along the Yaroslavl highway in a short time. </p><h2><br>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the residential complex "Flower City" a very successful territory was chosen.  It is a quiet place.  Nearby are many private sector homes.  At the same time, Mytishchi is one of the largest cities located in the <span>near Moscow region.</span>  In this village, a large number of residential complexes are being built today.  Near the river Yauza flows and two parks are broken - Elk Island and Mytishchi. </p>

The neighborhood with noisy trains will not please everyone.  In the immediate vicinity of the residential complex there are several existing plants.  Among them are engineering, reinforced concrete and metallurgical.  They do not cause much concern.  However, the environmental situation is undoubtedly affected.
