And no wonder, because, even for a long time living in a big city, you may not know where the small streets are.  And if the work is connected with trips, then the navigator in general becomes a constant companion. </p><p>  One of the common navigators on the domestic market is Explay PN-975.  This is exactly the model that combines the main advantages of navigators.  However, it is not without flaws.  In the article we will consider the detailed characteristics of this gadget, as well as form a general opinion based on the feedback from users of the device. </p><h2>  The appearance of the gadget </h2><p>  Manufacturers did not move much away from the classic image of a car navigator, but still brought their own zest.  The case of this device at first glance very much resembles the first-generation iPad, but the similarity is limited to this. </p>

    <p>  The quality of the Explay PN-975 casing cannot be called ideal, there are some creaks and backlashes, but this is not particularly critical if the navigator spends most of the time, fixed by a suction cup on the windshield of your car.  He himself is quite thin and light, which is a plus when riding on our roads, because he will not tear off the mount with his weight due to vibration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The main chip is the ARM11 processor, which has two cores operating at a frequency of 500 MHz.  To date, this is a pretty good indicator for navigators.  This is evidenced by the massive transition to similar processors from other manufacturers of budget models, which, apparently, take an example with Explay PN-975.  The processor works in tandem with 128 MB of RAM, which is enough for a fairly smooth operation of the navigation system, even in 3D mode. </p><p>  The GPS module does not have enough stars from the sky, but it still provides high-quality signal reception from satellites in almost any environment, although sometimes with a slight error.  However, it is uncritical and does not create discomfort when using the device. </p>

    <p>  In general, the hardware component is quite attractive for the price niche in which the Explay PN-975 is located.  The characteristics are quite high, and thanks to them, the use of the device is not complicated by unnecessary hangs. </p><h2>  Display and sound system </h2><p>  To display information, a 5-inch TFT-display with a resolution of 480 x 272 pixels is used.  This moment can be called a weak link, since the picture quality is low, there is a noticeable pixelation, and the matrix has poor viewing angles.  This problem can be partially solved by fixing the Explay PN-975 navigator at a right angle to the driver. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the minuses, many users of this model note a wheezing speaker.  Indeed, it‚Äôs not very pleasant when it‚Äôs difficult to figure out exactly which hint the navigator gives during movement.  One possible solution to this problem is to connect the gadget to the sound reinforcement system of your car. </p><h2>  Firmware </h2><p>  As a navigation medium, Navitel is used.  By default, the most common cards are installed.  Explay PN-975 has atlases of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Finland.  Cards occupy almost all of the space on a 4 GB internal drive, and if you need to use other atlases, you will need to expand the memory using a micro-SD card. </p>

    <p>  There are practically no complaints about the software.  <span>The navigation system is</span> regularly updated using the official update utility.  In order to find this utility and install the update on Explay PN-975, go to the official website of the manufacturer and find your model in the "Support" section.  Although, despite this, sometimes incidents happen when even with new maps the navigator leads to dead ends, but perhaps this problem is inherent in almost all electronic atlases. </p><p>  But with regard to additional functions, the user has nowhere to roam.  In addition to the navigation program, on the device you can start viewing photo and video files, as well as a player for listening to music.  However, watching photos and films on such a low-resolution display is not particularly pleasant, and you can often listen to music using the standard audio system.  So, in fact, these applications are not needed by the average user, but the manufacturer has not provided other entertainment. </p><h2>  Reputation Based on Reviews </h2><p>  User reviews about the <span>Explay</span> PN-975 <span>navigator are</span> mixed.  This is due to the fact that a certain percentage of marriage is present, and negative reviews often mention this particular problem.  On the other hand, those who got the device without a problem note the stable operation and high-quality support during the movement, as well as the high accuracy of standard cards. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, we can conclude that for the most part, it is a matter of chance when purchasing this model.  If you find a defective gadget, do not immediately change it to a device from another manufacturer.  Perhaps you should try to take the same model, and it will turn out to be completely serviceable.  In any case, in its price segment, the navigator offers a rather high performance compared to its competitors. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This navigator is suitable for those who do not pay attention to shortcomings that arise during operation.  The system works stably and smoothly, routes are calculated quite quickly and without problems.  Low quality display and speaker still have to endure.  If you agree with this, then the Explay PN-975 model will suit you perfectly, if not, then you should look for something more expensive, but without such shortcomings.  It is also recommended to fully check the device both during purchase and in the first days of use. </p>

    <p>  Judging by customer reviews, sometimes defective devices that last only a few days come across.  It is best to identify the marriage immediately after purchase or in the near future, so that you can exchange the device for a new one in time. </p><p>  For those who are not satisfied with the quality of the built-in maps, it is possible to install other navigation systems.  In reviews, there is often information on how to do this correctly.  However, it is worth remembering that then the update function through the official application will not be available. </p>
