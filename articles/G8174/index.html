She is a kind of ghostly state.  Rather, only the Republic of Turkey recognizes it as a separate country.  And all other states believe that Northern Cyprus is an integral part of the political entity of the same name with the island.  Therefore, if you decide to travel to these places, you will have to consider this.  Planes fly there only from the Republic of Turkey.  The visa is not put in your passport, but in special paper, which is issued only here.  Even the flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus resembles the banner of its powerful patroness.  It was created based on the banner of a neighboring country.  Only, unlike Turkey, there are differently arranged white and red colors.  But, despite the political upheavals, you can relax here, and there is even something to see.  This quasi-country has good beaches, hotels at fairly reasonable prices, they will offer you many excursions and will serve you very well.  So decide for yourself, and here we will tell you briefly about what this region represents. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/694749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get here </h2><p>  The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is attractive to tourists primarily because of its special political position, which has led to the fact that a visa to visit this country is not needed.  This makes it a lot easier.  On the other hand, you can fly here only from Turkey.  There is only one airport, and it is called Ercan.  Of course, Turkish airlines fly here, first of all, Turkish Airlines and the Pegassus low-cost airline.  From the airport to any city in Northern Cyprus, getting from half an hour to forty minutes is a very small country.  In addition, from Turkish Alanya you can sail here by ferry.  If you have a “Schengen” with multi-entry and you are in the Republic of Cyprus, then you can walk to the northern part of the island through a checkpoint on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/694752.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are many buses with which you can get to the capital of the island, and to other cities - Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia.  Just pay attention to the timetable - public transport travels very well early in the morning, but after five in the evening it is difficult to get anywhere.  Turkish minibuses - dolmushi have also taken root here.  They walk very often, and you are unlikely to lose more than ten minutes, waiting for the necessary transport.  And the prices here are lower than on buses.  To stop dolmush, you just need to raise your hand.  If you rent a car, then be aware that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has an English-type <span>left-hand drive</span> .  Yes, and a ride to the south side of the island will not succeed - it is forbidden to do this on a rented transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkish republic northern cyprus attractions" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/694757.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Turkish Republic of <span>Northern Cyprus:</span> beach <span>holidays</span> </h2><p>  The sea is the main thing that people come here for.  There are no beaches on this part of the island.  They are very different.  There are public beaches, and there are private ones that belong to hotels.  There are beautiful places with sun loungers, umbrellas, sunbeds, bars and all kinds of entertainment.  And there are wild secluded bays.  In general, sea holidays for every taste.  Of course, to go to the most famous equipped beaches, you will have to pay about three euros.  But there are also many free coasts of this kind.  For example, one of the most famous beaches - Alagadi, where sea turtles lay their eggs - refers specifically to public recreation areas.  There is no need to pay for entry.  There are a lot of sandy beaches in Northern Cyprus, although there are pebble beaches.  Entertainment here is the same as in many other sea resorts - water skiing, scooters, "bananas", "pills" and so on.  Windsurfers should look for bays in the north.  Here you can dive with a mask.  But if you travel with children, then you need to look for places with a gentle and shallow entrance.  This is “Acapulco”, “Denise Kizi”, “Camelot”.  Escape Beach was chosen by young people - the best discos and parties are held here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkish republic northern cyprus vacation" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/694759.jpg" width="500"></div>

It depends on your wallet and requirements.  There are five star hotels to the highest standards.  And there are modest hotels.  But they all have a good level of service, which can be compared with a vacation on the Greek islands.  Hotel owners care about their reputation and try to attract tourists.  Those who have visited Northern Cyprus are advised to bring embroidery and lace products as souvenirs.  Lefkara is especially famous for the latter.  You can purchase good quality bedding, wicker mats and other products from the vine.  Northern Cyprus is also known for the same thing as Turkey - good <span>sheep’s cheese,</span> olive oil, sweets and alcohol, reminiscent of brandy.  Only he is called a little differently.  And the cuisine here is a mixture of different Mediterranean traditions.  Seafood, fish, and meze with kebabs and kyuft do well here.  But lovers of European or Far Eastern cuisine will also not have to starve.  Dozens of restaurants at your service! </p><h2>  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus: Capital </h2><p>  Nicosia, like all other <span>large cities of the</span> country, also has a Turkish name.  Her second name is Lefkosa.  It is considered the most interesting city on the island, somewhat reminiscent of Soviet-era Berlin.  After all, this is also a divided city, which, however, is the capital of two states.  Cypriots live in one part of it, and Turks in the other.  According to statistics, a third of the total population of Cyprus lives here.  It is a very ancient city with many wonderful museums.  Wellness lovers also come here - local spa centers are famous throughout Europe.  You can ride buses and taxis around the city.  It is recommended to visit the restored old quarter of Laika Getinia, the Cathedral of St. John with amazing frescoes, the Salimiye Mosque, the fortress wall with wonderful medieval gates, as well as a magnificent Turkish palace belonging to a noble person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkish republic northern cyprus capital" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/694760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go on a tour </h2><p>  If you like to explore various sights, especially antique, then consider yourself lucky.  Many beautiful <span>archaeological sites</span> that belong to the cultural heritage of mankind possess the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  These sights can be listed for a long time.  For example, the Vouni Palace near the city of Gizelyurt or the ruins of the city of Soloy with Roman mosaics and a huge amphitheater.  And the country's main attraction is the ancient policy of Salamis.  It is located near Famagusta and is located right on the sea.  Here you can walk along the ancient streets, look at the remains of basilicas, baths, arenas.  There are many Christian monuments in Northern Cyprus where pilgrims flock.  For example, the monastery of St. Andrew, which, according to legend, was founded by the apostle himself and has a miraculous source.  There are also medieval castles that are also worth a visit.  The most famous of them is Kyrenia Fort, which was founded by the ancient Phoenicians, and in the era <span>of the Crusades it</span> became the favorite residence of Richard the Lionheart. </p>
