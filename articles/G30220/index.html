But, once worn, they then gather dust on hangers for years, because you don‚Äôt feel like putting it on again, but it‚Äôs a pity to throw it away.  Today we will tell our readers some wonderful ideas on how to alter a dress and make yourself a new outfit from virtually nothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.velvetbirdcage.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to alter a dress" class="if uuid-2849794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849794.jpg"></div><h2>  What's the secret? </h2><p>  Dress - this is the type of clothing that is easiest to transform into something else, more practical.  It can be shortened and made out of a maxi mini, lengthened with lace, sutured, creating something more rigorous and sexy from an outfit with a full skirt, or you can simply supplement it with unexpected accessories and get a completely new and original image. </p><p>  Complex alterations are best entrusted to an experienced dressmaker.  If you have sufficient skill in such matters, transformations are done with your own hands.  To alter a dress is not so easy, especially if it is made of inelastic and slippery fabrics (satin, chiffon, silk). </p><p>  If you are not afraid of such difficulties, pay attention to the previous picture with four dresses.  All of them are sewn in a single pattern - they have the same bodice and shape.  The main differences are the length of the product and the decor of the top.  This idea can be used to alter the dress.  How to do this, it‚Äôs easy to guess, there are several options here: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  You can adjust the length; </li><li>  change clothes by combining details cut from fabrics of different colors; </li><li>  decorate part of the dress with lace, guipure or quilling. </li></ul><p>  In order to make a two-color outfit, you will have to rip the dress apart from the top to the bottom.  The guipure t-shirt is sewn according to a specially made pattern, and then connects to the bottom.  So that the part does not slip, it is better to fix it by sewing it to the belt and stitching it in the side seams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.extrapetite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remaking Grandma's Dress" class="if uuid-2849795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849795.jpg"></div><h2>  Why can‚Äôt you throw the old dress out of your grandmother‚Äôs wardrobe? </h2><p>  If a beautiful, but already unfashionable dress of a mother or grandmother was lying in the closet, you can modify it by making yourself an actual outfit (and not even one).  How to alter an old dress?  The photograph shows the robe before and after the alteration.  It is enough to rethink the outfit a little to make it fashionable and modern: </p><ul><li>  make a more accurate round neckline instead of the old angular; </li><li>  reduce armhole; </li><li>  slightly raise the waist line and draw it with a narrow belt; </li><li>  Choose a more favorable dress length. </li></ul><p>  If desired, an entire wardrobe can be made from the same grandmother's outfit without any problems.  For this, the dress is changed into a suit consisting of a skirt and blouse.  Also, the image can be radically changed by adding a removable basque to the top of the outfit.  This blouse goes well with tight trousers or a pencil skirt, and the skirt from this set looks perfect with a plain shirt of a classic cut. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.extrapetite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to alter an old dress" class="if uuid-2849791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849791.jpg"></div><h2>  Dress skirt </h2><p>  The most difficult job is to separate the bottom of the dress from the top and sew the skirt.  How to redraw the product, we will tell in the master class.  The basis is an old silk outfit, from which the output is a wonderful magnificent summer skirt: </p><div class="photo" data-original="glamorousgamergirls.wordpress.com" data-author=": Coco Rocha, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a skirt from a dress" class="if uuid-2849793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849793.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Lay out the dress and draw a rounded line across it (first you need to measure the approximate length of the future skirt).  If you cut the fabric in a straight line, it will not lie beautifully and the hem will be asymmetrical. </li><li>  Cut out the future skirt and evenly pick it up at the top. </li><li>  Cut two strips of fabric for the belt (their length is the width of the gathered skirt plus 1-1.5 cm for the seams, and the width is 8-10 cm).  Then the details must be noticed and stitched to the product. </li><li>  In this skirt model you need to sew an all-in-one zipper, best hidden.  It can be in the side seam or at the back.  The zipper is inserted after the belt is sewn to the main part of the product.  So that he does not puff, the skirt should be ironed well. </li></ul><p>  It is better to duplicate the fabric on the belt part beforehand, then it will become more rigid and will not wrinkle while wearing the skirt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="glamorousgamergirls.wordpress.com" data-author=": Coco Rocha, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewing skirts from an old dress" class="if uuid-2849796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849796.jpg"></div><h2>  Making a dress from a long skirt </h2><p>  By the way, there may be another alteration (in the next photo).  You can alter the dress from the skirt, only it should be of an elongated style.  It is best to choose a product from airy cotton fabric with a colorful pattern.  The whole course of work is described in the picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diyncrafts.com" data-author=": Elisabeth Kruger, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress from a long skirt" class="if uuid-2849792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849792.jpg"></div><p>  This dress is perfect for a beach walk, you can wear it on top of a top or swimsuit. </p><h2>  Remaking a wedding dress </h2><p>  Wedding dresses are worn only once.  This is correct, but insulting - after all, things are so good and beautiful, the best day in the life of many girls is associated with them.  This injustice can be corrected by slightly altering the wedding dress.  By the way, some salons already offer their clients dresses that can be transformed without any problems even during the celebration.  You can remove a train or several lower skirts from them, so that it is more convenient to move, dance and just sit in the dress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2in1weddingdresses.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to alter a wedding dress" class="if uuid-2849797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849797.jpg"></div><p>  What else can you do with a wedding dress to put it on again?  To begin, trim the hem, making the length to the knee or middle of the lower leg (a la 50s).  It also does not hurt to remove the excess decor from the bodice - usually wedding dresses are studded with rhinestones and pearls, but even the most elaborate evening attire cannot be so catchy.  A magnificent dress in the style of Cinderella is better to slightly reduce in volume by removing a couple of layers of tulle, so it will not look like a ballet tutu.  Complex alterations, during which the style of the product is completely changed, it is better to entrust to professionals.  How to alter a long dress and change its silhouette, they know better than others. </p><h2>  Shirt dress </h2><p>  There are many workshops on remaking men's shirts.  From this simple wardrobe item they sew aprons, sundresses, tops, skirts, blouses and even bombers.  We propose to alter a shirt in a dress with buttons.  To do this, you need to prepare a shirt of a very large size.  The photo shows that a girl of average height is not enough for her knees by about one palm.  But, if the shirt is a little shorter, it‚Äôs not scary - just the dress will turn out not so long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.michaelannmade.com" data-author=": Michael Ann, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shirt dress" class="if uuid-2849790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849790.jpg"></div><p>  This alteration is among the works of medium complexity.  In the shirt you will need to change a lot: </p><ul><li>  narrow and tighten it; </li><li>  make tucks on the back and chest; </li><li>  flutter long sleeves and replace them with small wings; </li><li>  Finish the hem by cutting wide strips from the remaining fabric. </li></ul><p>  It is better to wear such a dress under the belt to give it a more feminine shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.karmabridal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remake a dress" class="if uuid-2849799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849799.jpg"></div><h2>  Scarf plus dress </h2><p>  Another idea for transforming a dress with minimal effort, time and materials is to remake its top a little.  To do this, you will need to prepare a fairly long chiffon scarf that will fit well in color with the dress itself.  It is not necessary that the accessory is completely identical in color to the outfit, but it is still better if they visually harmonize with each other. </p><p>  So, a scarf can be used in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Make a belt out of it by tying a knot on the back with a small bow.  The floors of the scarf will flap beautifully from behind, which will make the image very tender and romantic. </li><li>  Throwing it over the neck and fixing it under the belt, you can drape the shoulders and neckline neckline. </li><li>  If you cover only one shoulder with a scarf, pulling the fabric at the top point with a knot or chipping it with a brooch, the girl will look like a Greek goddess. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.oneartsymama.com" data-author=": dancers4life, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change a dress" class="if uuid-2849802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2849802.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple metamorphoses </h2><p>  Those who are afraid to ruthlessly cut their outfit or do not know how to alter a dress with minimal risk, you can try to wear your favorite wardrobe differently than usual.  Just change your shoes, belt, bag and pick up a new cardigan for the dress, and it will look completely different.  Even with the same simple dress, you can easily create at least five looks. </p><p>  Details in this matter are no less important than the main component.  They will help to transform a modest dress into an evening outfit or make a set that is perfect for a romantic date.  Shoes will play a big role here - the simpler the shoes, the more casual the final look will be.  Also to diversify the style will help a new hairstyle, makeup and a positive attitude. </p>
