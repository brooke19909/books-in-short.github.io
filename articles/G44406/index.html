  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does a microwave work and how was it invented?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The last century is a century of discoveries and innovations.  Many devices were invented that are now firmly in our everyday life.  And one of these inventions is a microwave.  A completely new approach to cooking delicious and healthy foods.  But how does it work?  Oddly enough, the stoves owe their appearance to the military industry.  It was in radars for the first time that they began to use ultra-high frequencies to detect targets.  In the early 30s, in one US laboratory, employees accidentally prepared the first dish using a microwave generator.  This dish turned out to be sausages.  This is the first mention of the microwave cooking method.  And today <noindex>  <span>italy rimini 3 star hotels</span> </noindex>  which are popular, just awash with microwaves from various manufacturers. </p><p>  And in 1945, the microwave was patented, however, it had a completely different look, not quite similar to the one we used to see.  These were huge cabinets, the heart of which was a magnetron - a special radio tube emitting waves in the microwave range.  Here's a story, in short.  In fact, the invention of the microwave is the work of thousands of scientists.  Today, all furnaces operate at a dedicated frequency - 2450 Megahertz.  According to international agreements, stoves of all manufacturers must work precisely at this frequency, so as not to interfere with radar stations.  The basis of any stove is a magnetron, its supply voltage is about 4 thousand volts.  The mains voltage is small, so an increase is required, which occurs due to the use of special transformers.  A magnetron with a power of 850 watts necessarily has a radiator and a fan that turns on during operation and blows the device. </p><p>  Radiation from a magnetron enters the chamber of the stove through a special waveguide.  The door has a special design, as it contains a special glass, which includes both plastic and metal mesh.  The latter reflects microwaves and does not allow them to go beyond the camera.  Many <noindex>  <span>Hotels Petrovac Montenegro</span> </noindex>  their location, have a large number of stoves, all have the same design.  Differences can only be found in the little things.  Heating food is very interesting.  Radiation sets in motion the molecules of sugar, water, fats.  And movement is the release of energy, in addition, billions of molecules hit each other, which is also accompanied by the release of heat.  Consequently, food warms itself, and the waves only contribute to this. </p></div></article>
