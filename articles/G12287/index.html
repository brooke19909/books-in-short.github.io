According to our compatriots, the apartments here are spacious, clean, bright.  Furniture and appliances can not be called new and modern, but all of good quality and in working condition.  If something fails, immediately notify the administrator at the reception.  Very soon all problems in your room will be fixed.  The large furnished balconies with a pleasant view pleased the tourists.  Here you can have a good time contemplating the surroundings and listening to the sound of the surf.  Also a big plus, according to vacationers, is the fact that both in the rooms and throughout the hotel there is access to wireless Internet.  And you can use Wi-Fi for free.  The connection speed is not always high, but in general, our compatriots were satisfied. </p><h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  No complaints about the work of the maids of Acacia Palms Resort 4 * (India, Goa) were found in the reviews of Russian travelers.  So, according to vacationers, cleaning was carried out regularly and fairly high quality.  By the way, the maids in the hotel will drop by your room during the day to clean, and in the evening to find out if you need anything (prepare bed for bed, bring something, pick up trash, etc.) .  Towels are changed every day.  Bed linen, according to the guests, was updated once a week.  Please also note that the bathroom in this hotel does not have bath accessories.
