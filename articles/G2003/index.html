One of the best zoos in the country, the longest avenue in the world, an avenue of bards and unusual monuments - travelers come to the Siberian capital for new experiences. </p><p>  The real symbol of Novosibirsk is the Opera and Ballet Theater.  Legends say that a whole city was built under the building, where during the Great Patriotic War exhibits from the Hermitage and the Tretyakov Gallery were stored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marriott Novosibirsk Hotel" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1067458.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By coincidence, just opposite the largest opera house in Russia is the five-star Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk), which represents the world-famous Marriott chain. </p><h2>  Establishment of a business empire </h2><p>  The name of the Marriott Corporation today is associated with luxury and wealth.  It is unlikely that in 1927, John Willard Marriott could imagine that his modest bar of non-alcoholic herbal drinks would become the founder of the business empire. </p><p>  By investing all his money and energy in small catering establishments, John Marriott managed to reach a new level and become a supplier for three airlines.  The first <span>Marriott Hotel</span> was opened in 1957 in Virginia.  Seven years later, the founder‚Äôs son was appointed president of the company, and his restructuring benefited the business. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The following years were marked by rapid development.  In addition to opening new hotels, John Marriott Jr. tried to earn income from providing various services to guests. </p><p>  Marriott Corporation has 4,000 hotels in 80 countries.  The first five-star hotel in Russia was opened in 1997.  Today, travelers can see the high-quality Marriott service in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk and Krasnaya Polyana. </p><h2>  In the heart of the Siberian capital </h2><p>  The Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) is located in the heart of the city.  The main attractions, administrative buildings and shopping and entertainment are within walking distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel restaurant marriott novosibirsk" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1067332.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) is ready to offer a magnificent view of the Opera and Ballet Theater.  His address: Ordzhonikidze street, 31. The complex has several bars and a restaurant, a fitness center, SPA-salon, as well as modern venues for various events. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  For its guests, the Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) has prepared 175 comfortable rooms of the following categories: </p><p>  - standard single; </p><p>  - deluxe; </p><p>  - junior suite; </p><p>  - junior suite with terrace; </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - luxury; </p><p>  - business suite; </p><p>  - presidential suite. </p><p>  In addition, two rooms are available for people with disabilities.

    <p>  Spacious and bright rooms, huge beds, cleanliness and comfort are consistent with the ideas of a five-star hotel.  The only drawback that all guests noted was the paid Wi-Fi in the rooms.  Indeed, such a luxurious Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) could afford to provide this service for free. </p><h2>  Cuisine from a foreign chef </h2><p>  Residents of the city consider the restaurant of the Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) one of the most popular.  We are talking about a cozy 10Ten terrace, which gives all visitors an incredible view of the metropolis. </p><p>  In addition to the atmosphere, guest reviews note the highest quality and taste of the dishes.  This is not surprising, because the main chef is Lebanese Wissam Fakhuri, who managed to gain experience in the institutions of Paris, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMunich and the emirate of Dubai.  Now, residents and guests of Novosibirsk can try the dishes of a talented chef. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marriott Hotel Novosibirsk photo" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1067328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the ground floor of the hotel there is an elegant cafe ‚ÄúOverture‚Äù, the menu of which is an original mix of Russian, Lebanese, Asian and Mediterranean cuisines.  The buffet dinner is particularly popular, where instead of the traditional menu a buffet is presented with a large selection of appetizers, main dishes and desserts. </p><p>  According to guests, in both institutions you can eat and have a great time.  Unfortunately, one remark was still found among the guests of the Overture cafe - this is the work of the staff.  The lack of attention and interest on the part of the waiters can greatly affect the reputation and make the Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) less popular.  Contacts of direct managers, by the way, are always easy to find, so do not hesitate to contact with your feedback and suggestions. </p><h2>  In a healthy body </h2><p>  The presence of a fitness center in the hotel is a definite advantage.  As we have already said, the Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk) offers guests access to Marriott Fitness for free. </p><p>  The gym operates around the clock, so after long negotiations you can always ‚Äúlet off steam‚Äù on the treadmill.  There is also a hammam and indoor pool from 6:30 AM to 11:00 PM. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marriott hotel Novosibirsk contacts" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1067329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, many of us care about our health, so we don‚Äôt feel like interrupting sports during travel or business trips.  Everyone who visited Marriott Fitness agrees that more space can be allocated for the gym. </p><h2>  Oasis spa </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of relaxation, it is impossible to forget about Oasis SPA, which is located in the Marriott Hotel (Novosibirsk). </p><p>  Reviews about this spa promise a real journey into the world of tranquility and harmony.  Forget about business and regain strength here help certified masters from Thailand. </p><p>  Exotic spa menus include the following treatments: </p><p>  - traditional Thai massage; </p><p>  - aroma massage using oils from Thailand; </p><p>  - complex "May Tai"; </p><p>  - ‚ÄúHerbal Nirvana‚Äù program with herbal bags; </p><p>  - slim massage. </p><p>  In addition, Thai masters carry out entire complexes, combining massage with various scrubs or wraps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marriott hotel novosibirsk phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1067331.jpg" width="548"></div>
