  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs: history, language, facts and legends</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs arose long before the Baptism of Russia.  It is believed that it developed in the system of pagan perception of the world, which became the basis of the communal-clan system.  This is a complex cultural process consisting of beliefs, ceremonies, icon painting, costumes, musical and songwriting.  All this was the basis of the spiritual heritage of the Slavs, which determined the rules of their behavior for every day.  In this article we will talk about this culture, which has not been studied much. </p><h2>  Arias </h2><div class="photo" data-original="29palms.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vedic culture of the slavs" class="if uuid-3159988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159988.jpg"></div><p>  The Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs after the Baptism of Russia began to be forgotten.  Public policy played a role in this.  Some traces of this culture have survived to this day, and interest in it has only recently been growing.  Neopagans even try to find answers to pressing questions of our time. </p><p>  It is worth knowing that the Slavic Vedic culture is based on the concepts of good and good.  It is believed that among its founders were arias.  So in the ancient Slavic language our ancestors called themselves descendants of the Scythians.  Everyone in this society, with their actions and behavior, should have brought the good and good of their tribe, be useful to others. </p><p>  From this came the word "noble," that is, bringing good to his family.  This concept in the Vedic culture of the Slavs and Aryans was closely connected with the concepts of society, collective and collegiality.  When making important decisions, it was important to consider the majority opinion.  At the general council, the answer was considered found if all participants in the meeting agreed with it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Great importance was attached to social change.  In the Vedic culture of the Slavs and Aryans, only those changes that would be beneficial and useful to all members of the community were considered good. </p><h2>  Worldview </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vedic culture" class="if uuid-3159990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159990.jpg"></div><p>  To understand the peculiarities of the worldview of the Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs, it is important to recall such concepts as soul, body and spirit.  Arias have always sought to put into practice the knowledge gained from experience.  Moreover, in the pagan model of the world there were objects of three conceptually different properties. </p><p>  It was a physical body, soul (a receptacle of feelings, passions and experiences), as well as spirit (an intangible component, determined by conceptual settings).  Transferring this sequence to modern reality, we can say that the Aryans brought out three main components from their own experience of communication with nature: </p><ul><li>  material component, that is, the physical body; </li><li>  soul, that is, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãexperience and feelings; </li><li>  the totality of attitudes, concepts and rules, that is, the spirit. </li></ul><p>  As a result, several millennia ago, an evolutionary statement was formulated in the culture of the Aryans.  When choosing models of the real world, one should use a comprehensive basis based on energy, mother, and information.  Today, this approach can be called integrated realism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Paganism </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vedicworld.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vedic culture of the Slavs and Aryans" class="if uuid-3159987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159987.jpg"></div><p>  Proximity to nature was highly valued in the Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs.  God was worshiped in it, and each person was considered the son of nature.  For these reasons, the Slavs called themselves pagans. </p><p>  Kinship with the outside world gave them a special understanding of the world.  Comparing the power of nature with the actions of earthly rulers, the pagans came to the conclusion that the worldly values ‚Äã‚Äãwere worthless. </p><p>  In their own worldview, the Slavs practiced the principle of monotheism.  It was believed that the world is open to the gaze of everyone who is ready to learn the truth.  It was important to understand that the reality surrounding us is the source of all knowledge, a criterion for the truth of statements. </p><p>  Determining the ultimate goal of life, in the Slavic Vedic culture, special attention was paid to acquiring.  It was important to indicate the constant labor necessary for spiritual growth. </p><h2>  Development and evolution </h2><p>  The Vedic culture of the ancients contained a deep understanding of the fundamental significance of generational change in the evolutionary development of society.  The Slavs at the same time came to the conclusion that eternal life can be achieved, but only by group.  In this case, a tribe, clan, or society must abide by the key law of evolutionary development, which consists in a continuous generational change. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This fundamental provision on eternal life was included in the pagan canon of the trinity.  The pagans understood very well that fertility alone could not ensure the eternal life of a social organism.  It is important to pass on education and upbringing to a new generation. </p><p>  Here a large role was played by books on the Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs.  In pagan images you can see them as symbols of education, upbringing, knowledge and literacy. </p><p>  Naturally, the most productive was the creation of harmonious conditions for development among workers from their immediate environment, that is, in the family circle.  They transmitted culture on the example of elders.  The new and the old were to create a single harmonious formation.  In the modern world there is also a similar concept, which is called the technique of immersion in an environment of creativity and creation. </p><p>  For millennia, this method has been used in the Vedic culture of the ancient Slavs.  The existing orientation towards creativity and work became the basis of world order and social well-being.  The cult of a family patriarchal order was maintained.  Children treated their parents with love, affection, dignity and respect. </p><h2>  Politics and Life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vedic culture in russia" class="if uuid-3159993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159993.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that the Arians led a predominantly sedentary lifestyle.  They chose open and wide spaces for their settlements, which from time to time were intersected by forests. </p><p>  In everyday life, they had a reasonable commonwealth in everything.  This also applied to policies supported in relations with neighbors, including nomadic tribes.  Everything was based on the principles of exchange.  Settled tribes received meat and skins from nomads, and in return provided canvas, honey, hemp, pottery and birch bark. </p><p>  This reasonable practice of mutually beneficial exchange existed in the Slavic-Vedic culture in everything.  Destructive wars were contrary to their spirit.  In the chronicles, they remained as tribes that did not conduct aggressive attacks.  In the same way they acted in everything.  Even with animals they lived in harmony, without interfering with each other. </p><p>  Among scholars of the Slavic-Aryan Vedic culture, there is an opinion that the conquest of Russia by the Tatar-Mongols is nothing more than a myth, a fiction.  Allegedly, this was in the hands of the Romanov dynasty, thanks to which he appeared.  Proponents of this version consider the Tatar-Mongol yoke a political ploy, with the help of which it became possible to justify the seizure of power as a result of a palace coup when the throne passed from the Ruriks to the Romanovs. </p><p>  During the years of the existence of the specific principalities, clashes between the princes regularly took place.  They continued at the time when the formation of Russian statehood began.  On both sides, the warring armies and the Tatar cavalry participated in the warring armies that were at war with each other.  By greedy princes, the latter was always valued an order of magnitude higher, since it was the most maneuverable part of the army. </p><p>  Trying in our time to understand the reasons that led to the systemic crisis of civilization, it is important to realize that the image of unity between people and power is nothing more than a fiction.  In most cases, rulers have no idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnobility at all.  Moreover, the higher a person ascends the career ladder, the more immoral he becomes, as well as his environment and the environment itself.  At that time, Kievan Rus and developed socialism in the Soviet Union are very similar. </p><p>  For our ancestors, it was obvious that the true face of power is not at all the one that it shows to everyone around, but the one that carefully conceals.  In this case, it would be a great mistake to consider that the existing pagan life of the Slavs was ideal.  Passions boiled here, a struggle was fought for leadership and life.  But all this was carried out exclusively within the framework of churches and monasteries.  It was a cruel way of tonsure, austerities and penance. </p><p>  Of course, the creators of the Vedic culture of Russia were not ordinary peasants.  They lived by the rules, which rooted in the centers of pagan Orthodoxy.  Therefore, this concept applies to monastery cloisters and their novices, and not to ordinary villagers who lived on the earth. </p><p>  It was to such provincial monasteries from the surrounding villages that people came with yellow-handed babies, and returned with wise life-experience magicians.  These were harsh schools for the development of the Holy Spirit.  It is worth noting that in some monasteries a similar pagan practice exists today. </p><p>  In Russian Vedic culture, baths have always occupied a special place.  This tradition has been preserved in our time.  Thanks to its presence, the Slavs sought to get rid of the dominance of insects and diseases.  At the same time, the bathhouse was considered an ideal place for rest and leisure at the end of a busy and difficult working day.  People here dressed up in clean undershirts, spent time eating plentiful food with their family and closest friends. </p><h2>  The concept of beauty </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic-Aryan Vedic culture" class="if uuid-3159989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159989.jpg"></div><p>  Later, through the places in which the settlements of the Slavs were located, the Silk Road passed, which became a source of cash receipts.  Coin burials of various sizes are still found on the territory of modern Belarus and western Ukraine.  On the world market, foreigners valued silk much higher than gold, but the Slavs did not use it in special demand.  Moreover, they considered it a waste product, preferring fabrics from natural herbs of their region. </p><p>  At the same time, the Slavs were endowed with a sense of beauty, appreciated unusual costumes, decorated with embroidery or original decoration.  River pearls were very popular.  The costume of the simplest peasant woman left up to 200 pearls.  Massively produced jewelry.  These were rings, pendants, chains. </p><p>  With the development of statehood and under the influence of Byzantium, the impoverishment of the Slavs who lived on earth began.  Since then, only the costume of the first persons of the state remained chic and rich.  In terms of its components and cut, he continued to copy the original pagan garment of simple Aryans (although it was made at the same time from more expensive materials). </p><p>  The Slavs transferred their reverent attitude to nature to later times, when cities were already created.  In Slavic culture, the concept of "garden city" appears.  They were considered Putivl, Moscow, Yaroslavl, Kiev, Nizhny Novgorod, Murom, Vladimir.  The peculiarity of these settlements was that each individual building was surrounded by a personal plot with a bathhouse and a separate well. </p><p>  In the Vedic culture in Russia, the environment of the home with the pristine forest, clean air and fragrant fields was highly valued.  The Slavs initially sought to turn any of their communication with nature into a peculiar course of aromatherapy, enjoying the healing herbs and infusions, the juice collected from the trees.  In everyday life, wormwood, nettle, flax, and hemp were everywhere used.  Often they served as raw materials for the manufacture of all kinds of healing and odorous preparations, infusions. </p><p>  The abundance and affluence, which manifested themselves most clearly in everyday life, were the result of high industriousness and reasonable organization.  In constant labor and care lived all members of society, without exception.  To do this, a spindle or a spinning wheel, combs for combing tows were installed in each room.  Everywhere there were traces of tireless and constant work. </p><p>  The nomads who lived next door to the Slavs considered them to be true magicians in terms of industriousness.  The villagers transferred their relationship with nature, which they considered their patroness, to prayer churches.  Because of this, the carriers of pagan Orthodoxy were repeatedly subjected to persecution and oppression. </p><p>  At the same time, they continued to relate with superstitious fear to the rites performed by sorcerers.  Those marveled at new generations of people who became too self-serving. </p><h2>  Current state </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ruspravda.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic vedic culture" class="if uuid-3159992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159992.jpg"></div><p>  After the Baptism of Rus, the situation changed radically.  The influence of Byzantium and Christianity increased significantly.  The pagan culture of the Slavs-Aryans began to methodically be destroyed. </p><p>  Pagan Orthodoxy has a powerful and dangerous enemy.  They became the army of greedy priests and priests, who began to preach under the banner of Christianity, introducing in fact a monopoly on religion and worldview. </p><p>  An important role was also played by the fact that from the position of the Russian Sovereign, as the current government, Byzantine Christianity was a more convenient and understandable religion.  It was easier to build political systems, unite the princes, begin centralization, lay the foundations of statehood, and finally control the masses. </p><p>  By the XV-XVII centuries, only minor traces and vague recollections remained from the Vedic culture.  But even at that time the peasant community still continued to live in abundance. </p><h2>  "Veles book" </h2><p>  It is believed that this is one of the first sources about the Slavs and Aryans that has come down to us.  In this book, the Vedic culture of the Slavs is described as fully and in detail. </p><p>  Moreover, today it can be stated with confidence that this work was falsified in the 19th or 20th century.  But this does not prevent him from being widely used by modern neopagans as evidence of modern forms of their religiosity. </p><p>  In fact, in the Veles Book, the Proto-Slavic language is rather roughly and primitively reproduced.  This work was first published by Russian immigrants in the 1950s.  The most likely author is the Russian writer Yuri Petrovich Mirolyubov, who first published it.  Today the name of Mirolyubov is well known in scientific circles, he is considered one of the most famous falsifiers of the history of Ancient Russia. </p><p>  At the same time, Mirolyubov himself claimed that he wrote off the Veles Book from wooden planks that he lost during the war.  He said that this work was created around the 9th century.  It contains numerous prayers, traditions, legends and stories about the history of the ancient Slavs, dating back to about the 7th century BC. </p><p>  Most researchers are convinced of its forgery.  They do not consider it to be any reliable historical source.  Moreover, this work is still being studied.  For example, in the centers of the Slavic Vedic culture, open throughout the country.  In the mass consciousness, the Veles book is considered as a fake, but still continues to attract great attention from readers. </p><h2>  Pantheon of gods </h2><p>  It is no secret that divine essence is the basis of any culture.  It consists in understanding and realizing that a person is not alone on this earth, but is a certain higher being who plays a decisive role. </p><p>  Modern neopagans claim that the gods of the Vedic culture were common to the Aryan and Old Russian peoples.  For example, Triglav was worshiped in Russia.  These are the names of the three main Slavic gods.  The first of them was called Vyshny, that is, a god who was at the top of the hierarchy.  The second was Svarog, who created the universe, and Siwa.  The same trinity occupied the highest steps in the hierarchy of the ancient Indian gods. </p><p>  Supporters of the Vedic culture claim that the Slavic god Vyshny corresponded to the ancient Indian Cherry, and Shiva was transformed into Siwa.  He personified the process of destruction. </p><p>  Thus, this trinity maintained a balance in the world, personifying the three most important stages in the life of every person (birth, development and death).  The names of many other gods for India and Russia are similar.  The goddess Mara was the personification of the afterlife.  Everything associated with death is associated with her name. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="happylifeguide.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic-vedic culture" class="if uuid-3159994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3159994.jpg"></div><p>  Summing up, it is worth noting that acquaintance with the ancient and rich culture of the Aryan Slavs leaves an ambiguous impression. </p><p>  On the one hand, it is a primitive and sufficient rough culture, revived from the Stone Age.  On the other hand, a powerful life-giving force comes from her.  In this culture, everything is extremely clear and understandable.  Everything is subject to the ideas of universal development and collective creation. </p>
