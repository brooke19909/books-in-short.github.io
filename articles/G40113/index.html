    <p>  The future entrepreneur was born in September 1953 in a small town of the Uzbek Republic.  He is the eldest son in the family, where besides him there was another child.  The main hobby of Alisher‚Äôs childhood was fencing.  Being only fourteen years old, he was part of the youth team of the Uzbek Republic in this sport.  And soon he received the title of master of sports and entered the national team of the Union.  In 1971-1976 he studied at the most prestigious university in the country - MGIMO, majoring in International Law.  After graduation, the young man enters the Academy of Sciences and becomes a junior researcher there. </p><p>  <strong>Alisher Usmanov's biography: difficult years</strong> </p><p>  It would seem that such a successful start to a career in the state system should have led the guy to brilliant results.  However, here the successful biography of Alisher Usmanov for some time changes its focus.  In 1980, the young man was arrested on charges of embezzlement, fraud and extortion.  The future oligarch received eight years in prison.  However, already in 1986, he was released on parole from places of detention.  Later, the businessman said that this was <span>political repression,</span> and in 2000 he was completely acquitted and rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the Uzbek Republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
