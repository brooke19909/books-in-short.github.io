    <p>  Novy Svet: reviews report that the area near the village is part of the landscape reserve, so the famous trail and bays in high season can be visited only for an additional fee.  Here you can see <span>tall juniper,</span> Crimean and Sudak pine.  In the wildlife sanctuary there are also wild animals, including those belonging to 50 rare species. </p><p>  By the way, it should be noted that the beautiful nature of the New World attracted the attention of cinematographers more than once: in these places the films “Anna Karenina”, “Amphibian Man”, “Andromeda Nebula”, “Treasure Island”, “3 + 2” were shot ". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The climate in this part of the coast is smooth and mild, as the mountains in the west and east are a reliable protection against cold winds.  It has warm winters and very early spring. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2.

    <p>  Here the first Greeks settled here 2 thousand years ago.  They called this area Paradise.  Indeed, it is difficult to doubt that paradise may look different than Crimea (New World).  Rest, reviews of which this is confirmed, is wonderful. </p><p>  By the way, this name was given to the coastal village at the end of the 19th century.  At that time, L.S.  Golitsyn, who built a winery in this place, famous for the production of champagne wines.  Now it’s hard to imagine that in the Golitsyn collection there were more than 44.5 thousand bottles of the rarest wines.  What happened to her after 1917 is still unknown.  There is even a version according to which a collection of wines is hidden in an underground grotto, one of many on Crimean land. </p><p>  It is believed that the name New World is associated with the time when Tsar Nicholas II visited the estate of Prince Golitsyn.  He is credited with the phrase that after tasting champagne wine produced at a local factory, everything around begins to appear in a new light.  This factory works today.  In addition, the building that was built for the employees of the plant was preserved. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3. Reviews: The New World - Amazing Features</strong> </p>
