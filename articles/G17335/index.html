It is located at the very beginning of Pioneer Avenue, which extends along the seashore for 16 kilometers through Dzhemete to Vityazevo.  The sun, sea, clean sandy beach make your stay here unforgettable.  The infrastructure of the camp fully ensures the normal relaxation of children, including sports, creative activities of interest. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.91286389999999" data-lng="37.324470700000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/9/1/9/16919.png"></div><h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  Children's camp "Zori Anapa" is very conveniently located.  It is located at the very beginning of Pionersky Prospekt, house 10, which provides proximity to the city center and the sea beach.  From the camp to the sea is only 200 meters, which the guys walk in 5 minutes.  I would like to say separately about Anapa, which is officially recognized by the federal children's resort.  Since the days of the Soviet Union, a large number of children's sanatoriums and pioneer health resorts have been built here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="anapacity.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://anapacity.com/detskie-lagerya-v-anape/detskij-lager-14.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's camps in anapa" class="if uuid-3200687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3200687.jpg"></div><p>  Today this tradition is preserved.  Children's <span>camps in Anapa</span> occupy a leading position.  They are located almost throughout the territory.  Especially a lot of them on Pionersky Prospekt, on both sides of which are children's health resorts.  This is due to the favorable climate, warm sea, beautiful sandy beach that stretches for kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sea bathing </h2><p>  Camp "Zori Anapa" has its own beach area.  It is fenced, guarded, equipped with awnings so that you can lie in the shade, as well as lifeboats.  Guys come here twice a day.  Each swimming is carried out in two sets, for 15-20 minutes each.  At this time, counselors, rescuers and a medical worker are present on the beach.  It is covered with clean fine sand.  The bottom is shallow, sandy, shallow.  Anapa beaches are the most suitable for children. </p><h2>  Territory and area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="incamp.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://incamp.ru/camps/zori-anapyi/#gallery_group-7"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dol Zori Anapa Children" class="if uuid-3200695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3200695.jpg"></div><p>  Camp "Zori Anapa" is buried in the greenery of trees, among which there are coniferous representatives.  This makes it cozy.  Particular attention should be paid to flowers, among which a large number of roses of different varieties.  In the blessed shade arbors and benches are arranged.  Here you can chat with friends or read a book. </p><p>  Children from 7 to 15 years old are accepted here.  The guys, who have a rest in the Dawn ‚ÄúZori Anapa‚Äù, mainly live in 5-6-bed rooms.  There are 2-seater.  Everything is stipulated in the cost of the permit.  The availability of amenities in the room will depend on this.  There is a toilet and shower.  In the rest of the rooms this pleasure falls on several chambers.  The camp has a central two-story building and several one-story buildings.  In addition, on the territory of the wellness structure there is an outdoor shower and washbasins. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Food in the camp "Dawns of Anapa" </h2><p>  Children are fed five times a day.  The camp has a large and comfortable dining room, where breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, the first and second.  In the summer, afternoon tea is in the fresh air.  The diet is diverse and always includes a lot of fruits and vegetables.  All of them are environmentally friendly and grown on the farms of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  Teaching and service staff </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tetelia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dol Zori Anapa" class="if uuid-3200686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3200686.jpg"></div><p>  Counselors are required to have a pedagogical education.  In the summer, when there is a large influx of vacationers, students of the Ufa Pedagogical University work as counselors.  In addition to them, professional choreographers, leading circles, psychologists, physical education, as well as DJs who conduct evening discos work in the camp. </p><p>  All children are divided into groups by age, each of which has two counselors.  The camp has medical staff.  All wellness procedures are carried out under the supervision of doctors.  Experienced chefs and nutritionists work here.  Room cleaning is carried out by special technical workers.  The camp is guarded by professional guards. </p><h2>  What do children do </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.alyans-kurort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zori Anapa Camp" class="if uuid-3200677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3200677.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, people come here because of the sea and the sun.  Therefore, twice a day, before lunch and after, the guys take sea and sun baths.  The camp hosts battles of choirs, performances, various contests and quizzes.  They prepare for them by learning songs, dances, and theatrical skits that are played out on the summer stage. </p><p>  Sports competitions are also being held, to which professional physical education teachers help prepare.  For this there is a stadium, equipped venues for sports games.  Two or three excursions are carried out per shift, during which the guys visit the sights of Anapa. </p>
