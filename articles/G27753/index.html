But at the same time, Lebanon is a very interesting and colorful country that you definitely need to visit: the ancient Byblos, Tripoli, famous for its orange gardens and, of course, Beirut - the capital of Lebanon and the largest economic center.  In addition, Lebanon is an attractive tourist destination for Russians.  This is an interesting story, ancient sights and national cuisine.  To do this, you need a visa to Lebanon.  It is also attractive that obtaining a visa to this country is not so problematic. </p><h2>  How to apply for a visa directly to Beirut Airport </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.the961.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beirut Airport" class="if uuid-2597221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95801/2597221.jpg"></div><p>  If you plan to travel to this country for a period of no more than 90 days, then applying for a visa to Lebanon for Russians is not required for him.  If you have plans to stay in Lebanon for more than 90 days, then you still need to go to the visa center or the Embassy of Lebanon and apply for a visa. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.77318" data-lng="37.617589899999984" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/2/6/9/5269.png"></div><p>  Address of the Lebanese Embassy in Moscow: Sadovaya-Samotechnaya Str. 14. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To cross the border of Lebanon, you must have the following documents with you: </p><ul><li>  Paid voucher or hotel room reservation. </li><li>  Passport, which expires in at least 3 months. </li><li>  Return ticket to the homeland. </li><li>  Travel insurance. </li><li>  Migration card that will be issued to you on the plane.  During the flight you will have time to fill it.  During the verification of documents by the border guard, the entry part of the migration card will remain with him, and the exit part will be returned to you, which will need to be kept until departure from Lebanon. </li></ul><p>  In this case, you will be issued a visa at the airport, and the long-awaited stamp will appear in your passport.  Moreover, a visa will not cost you a dime.  After all this, Lebanon, famous for its history, its attractions, interesting culture and friendly residents, is open for you. </p><h2>  Are you going to visit?  Then you need a guest visa! </h2><div class="photo" data-original="graphicshoplb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Long awaited visa" class="if uuid-2597231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95801/2597231.jpg"></div><p>  If such a situation arises that you fly to Lebanon in order to stay with your relatives or friends, then you will need to apply for a guest visa, which is issued only at the Lebanese Embassy.  To do this, you will need to have: </p><ul><li>  Completed application form. </li><li>  Invitation. </li><li>  Copies of completed pages of a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Copies of completed pages of the passport. </li><li>  Passport with an expiration of at least 6 months. </li><li>  Certificate of employment, which will indicate your current position and monthly salary. </li><li>  Photo for a 3x4 cm visa. </li></ul><p>  A visa to Lebanon will be issued within 10 days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Single women, apply for a visa in advance </h2><p>  Lebanon, despite economic development, is still a traditional and conservative eastern country.  Therefore, in some cases, there may be problems with crossing the border for unmarried women under 40 years of age.  Therefore, it is best to take care of the visa in advance, because it will be very unpleasant when a person who is set up for a long-awaited vacation is denied a visa at the airport and there is nothing left for him except to board a plane to Russia and spend his vacation not on ancient Lebanese land, but at home . </p><p>  To avoid such problems, you need to contact the Lebanese Embassy.  To do this, you will need to collect the following documents: </p><ul><li>  A completed application form. </li><li>  Tourist voucher. </li><li>  Copies of completed pages of a civil passport and passport. </li><li>  Certificate of employment, which will indicate your current position and monthly salary. </li><li>  Photo 3x4 cm. </li></ul><p>  A visa to Lebanon will also be issued within 10 days. </p><p>  If a woman travels to the Lebanese Republic with her spouse, then there should be no problems crossing the border.  In this case, it will be important to have a marriage certificate (translated and notarized). </p><h2>  A trip to Lebanon with children is not so complicated </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.insuremytrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="With children ride" class="if uuid-2597270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95801/2597270.jpg"></div><p>  It often happens that Lebanon attracts family travelers.  If your children have not yet reached the age of fourteen, then when checking documents, you will definitely need to present a birth certificate.  A child over 14 years old must have a passport with him.  And if the child crosses the border with one parent, then take care in advance of the written, notarized consent of both parents to the trip. </p><h2>  Israelis are not welcome here </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.colourbox.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.colourbox.com/vector/judaism-religion-symbols-vector-set-of-icons-eps10-vector-15263302"><img itemprop="image" alt="Israeli paraphernalia in Lebanon" class="if uuid-2601761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95801/2601761.jpg"></div><p>  Also, a problem may arise if you have an Israeli passport or a mark in your passport on crossing the Israeli border.  In this case, you will also be denied a Lebanese visa.  In order to avoid such misunderstandings, it is best to contact the embassy in advance. </p><p>  A situation may arise that you stay in Lebanon for no more than 2 days, here the good news awaits you: a visa to Lebanon is not needed for the Russians and the customs fee is absolutely free. </p><h2>  Customs regulations </h2><p>  However, when entering or leaving Lebanon, as from any country in the world, you will have to follow certain rules: </p><ul><li>  The import and export of ammunition, combustible and explosive substances, and weapons is prohibited. </li><li>  The import of drugs is prohibited. </li><li>  Be attentive to the Israeli paraphernalia of books or newspapers in Hebrew - it should not be. </li><li>  If you are interested in antiques and have looked for something unique to your collection in Lebanon, do not lose your purchase receipt.  Otherwise, your purchase will be regarded as smuggled goods. </li><li>  When you enter you must have your doctor‚Äôs prescription with you if you bring medicines for personal consumption with you to the Lebanese Republic. </li><li>  You also have a limit on alcohol and tobacco products: no more than 2 liters of alcohol and no more than 50 cigars or 500 cigarettes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.layoverguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lebanon is beautiful" class="if uuid-2597273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95801/2597273.jpg"></div><p>  And when you get off the plane and apply for a visa, the Republic of Lebanon is open for you.  Meet local people, admire historical monuments, beautiful landscapes, enjoy national cuisine and get acquainted with the culture of this unusual region.  Believe me, Lebanon will be able to surprise any traveler.  Just be careful and careful - any problems and troubles can happen anywhere in the world.  In this case, you need to know the address of the representative office of the Russian Federation, which is located in Beirut: Beirut, Mar-Elias street, El-Tina, POBox 5220. </p><p>  Have a good trip! </p>
