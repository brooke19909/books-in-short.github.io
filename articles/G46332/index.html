  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copper hydroxide</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The compound copper (II) hydroxide - is a bright blue crystals, may also have an amorphous (powder) structure.  It is insoluble in water, the rating on the safety registry is average.  The chemical formula of the substance is Cu (OH) ‚ÇÇ, it is a <span>weak base,</span> which, as a rule, is obtained as a result of the action of strong bases on copper salts. </p><p>  The use of this compound is widespread in various fields of chemical and industrial production.  So, copper hydroxide is used as a pigmenting component in glasses, ceramic products used in engineering and jewelry, glazes.  The pigmentation properties of the compound are successfully used in the manufacture of highly resistant paints, which are used for applying to the bottoms of ships and even submarines, since this substance prevents the underwater parts of the vessels from fouling with algae and other water elements that damage the metal structures of ships. </p><p>  Great prospects are opening up for the use of this substance in modern electrical and electronic industries.  Here, it can become an indispensable component of the technology for manufacturing high-temperature superconductors.  In addition, the use in electrical engineering has already been sufficiently tested in laboratory practice. </p><p>  Actually in chemical production, copper hydroxide is widely used as a catalyst for <span>chemical reactions.</span>  In addition, you can also point to such areas of application of this substance as the preparation of animal feed for cattle, the manufacture of cements of various grades, especially decorated (non-ferrous) cements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although the compound is not classified as highly toxic and hazardous chemicals in terms of safety classification, some important safety precautions must be taken when working with it.  First of all, this refers to compliance with the storage conditions of the substance and the prevention of cases of its scattering in the open air.  If this happens, immediate measures should be taken to isolate the spillage site and remove the hydroxide to a safe distance. </p><p>  As the formula shows, copper hydroxide is an alkaline compound.  Therefore, all existing and promising options for its practical use are due precisely to alkaline properties. </p><p>  Before answering the question of how to obtain copper hydroxide, a reservation should be made that there are several such options. </p><p>  Consider some of the most common ones. </p><p>  Copper hydroxide can be obtained from its sulfate.  This substance is a white crystalline powder, highly soluble in water.  Its chemical formula is CuSO‚ÇÑ.  If this substance, called <span>copper sulfate, is</span> dissolved in water, you can get the well-known <span>copper sulfate.</span>  Then, if alkali is added to this solution, a reaction will occur during which Cu (OH) ‚ÇÇ is <span>precipitated as a</span> blue <span>precipitate</span> . </p><p>  Hydroxide can also be obtained from copper (II) nitrate, which is a colorless crystalline substance with the chemical formula Cu (NO‚ÇÉ) ‚ÇÇ.  If a hydroxide production reaction is carried out, then it is necessary to add copper (II) nitrate to the NaOH solution.  The resulting precipitate is a blue precipitate and will be the desired copper hydroxide. </p><p>  A common way to obtain a substance is the use of copper (II) chloride for this, which has the chemical formula CuCl‚ÇÇ.  To obtain hydroxide, a yellow powder, which is copper chloride, must be dissolved in a certain amount of alkali.  In the course of such a reaction, the yellow crystals disappear, and instead of them the same precipitate, necessary for us, of a blue hue - Cu (OH)  - falls out. </p>
