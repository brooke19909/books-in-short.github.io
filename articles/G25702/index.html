This mobile operator offers a lot of different commands that allow you to receive this or that information about the SIM card, as well as connect / disconnect certain functions.  In general, there are a lot of USSD requests on Velcom.  But we will consider only the most useful and popular of them.  Maybe they will more than once help to cope with a particular problem. </p><h2>  What it is </h2><p>  But first, find out what are our today's needs?  Knowing this, you can understand whether you need them or not.  Maybe you can completely do without them?  Velcom USSD-requests, like any mobile operator, is nothing more than a subscriber‚Äôs self-service. </p>

    <p>  With their help, you can control the balance of the phone, check and change the tariff plan on the SIM card, implement various options, as well as disconnect and connect certain services and options.  The main advantage of such combinations is that they are free and are activated at any time of the day or night.  The main thing is to know what exactly you need. </p><h2>  Balance </h2><p>  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting with the main function - this is a USSD balance request and all the commands that will help control funds on the SIM card account.  There are not so many of them, but there are some special ones among them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, a balance request occurs through a combination of * 100 #.  At the end of each set you need to click on the "Call" button.  In response, you receive a message about the status of the account of the SIM card, and the result is displayed directly on the screen. </p>

    <p>  Velcom USSD requests allow you to easily change the tariff payment system.  To work without prepayment you need to dial * 145 #.  If you want to register some unconfirmed request, then * 141 * 1 # will help here.  Basically, these are all useful commands for managing your account.  We continue to study Velcom USSD requests further. </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  It's no secret that with the help of these commands any subscriber can change their tariff plan.  Each offer has its own combination.  Full information on this can be found on the official website of the operator.  After all, Velcom has a lot of tariffs.  Enumerate all USSD commands to connect them for a very long time.  So at the moment check with the operator. </p><p>  Instead, we will try to learn the universal USSD-requests of Velcom.  The tariff plan that you are currently connected to can be found using * 141 * 2 * 1 #.  In addition, the subscriber is able to receive his phone number when dialing * 147 #.  Information about the Internet tariff plan is displayed after dialing * 141 * 2 * 3 * 1 #.  Everything is easy and simple.  In some cases, you receive an SMS message with all the information that you requested, but often the data is displayed directly on the phone‚Äôs display. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Now a little about the interesting features of our operator today.  They also have their own Velcom USSD requests.  ‚ÄúFavorite number‚Äù, for example, is added using * 141 * 3 * 3 #.  After that, you can add one or another subscriber to the corresponding list. </p><p>  In addition, note that you are also able to activate some interesting and useful features with our today's teams.  For example, you can connect the Internet, MMS, protection to the phone with a single request.  With it, you will also receive all the information about the mobile Internet, which is available on the SIM card.  To do this, dial * 135 # on the mobile phone and send a request for processing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ussd requests wellcome favorite number" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1141979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sometimes you want to talk in roaming.  Velcom USSD-requests allow all subscribers to quickly connect themselves to such services.  "Roaming" (international) is activated using * 141 * 3 * 2 * 1 #, and "International calls" can be activated by dialing * 141 * 3 * 1 * 1 #.  It turns out that without outside interference at any time everyone is able to connect the services of profitable calls by mobile phone abroad. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Do not forget that USEL-requests "Welkom" have another feature.  And it applies not only to this operator, but to everyone as a whole.  These commands make it possible to connect / disconnect certain additional service packages and services.  What can help us in communication? </p><p>  Let's say the option package is ‚Äú500 SMS‚Äù.  To do this, you must type * 119 # from the telephone.  Please note that the request itself is free.  But for connecting this or that option you have to pay at the tariff.  All available settings (Internet and MMS are included here) come after sending * 135 * 0 #, and "Mobile Internet" is activated by the command * 135 * 1 #.  As you can see, there is nothing difficult about this. </p>

    <p>  Pay attention also to a few non-standard services.  "Velcom" offers its customers the service <span>"Anti-identification number".</span>  Strangely enough, it connects without problems using the USSD request * 200 * 2 #.  Melofon is another service that subscribers often pay attention to.  And it is activated through the combination of * 424 #.  In principle, all these are quite popular services that you can connect to yourself. </p><h2>  Help and Queries </h2><p>  The last item that we will consider is sending homeless people, as well as receiving help information on a SIM card.  Wellcom allows you to do all this with the help of various USSD commands. </p><p>  So, for example, everyone can request a call back (send a "homeless person") for free.  Dial * 131 * friend‚Äôs number # and send the processing command.  Another Velcom subscriber will receive a free message from you asking you to call back.  Sometimes this feature is very useful. </p><p>  The rest of free SMS, MMS, minutes and Internet traffic also has to be checked from time to time.  In this situation, the next self-service team will help.  It looks like * 100 * 1 #.  If you want to know the entire list of paid services connected to your mobile number, refer to * 141 * 2 * 2 #. </p>

    <p>  Do not forget that the full list of USSD commands at Velcom is quite diverse.  Sometimes you want to quickly look through it and select the desired self-service function.  Everyone is able to do this very easily and simply.  What does that require?  Just send a special request for processing.  It looks like * 141 * 9 * 1 #.  In response, you will receive an SMS message in which all available commands will be published.  Except that this does not include requests to change the tariff plan (for a specific offer). </p><p>  As you can see, Velcom USSD teams are diverse.  And with their help, you can completely control the functionality of the SIM card.  Do not be afraid to experiment.  Remember that when you connect a service, you will be charged a fee in the amount established by the tariff.  All background information is free. </p>
