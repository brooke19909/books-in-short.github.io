Tsunami is very popular - an attraction, which is a huge slide in the shape of the letter U. You can ride it only on special circles, moving along the surface of the descent, like a pendulum.  One of the most extreme open slides is the Anaconda, it is twisted in a spiral, due to which high speed develops during movement.  Another quick and exciting descent is Free Fall.  They say that the feeling of such a flight is comparable to falling from the roof.  Waterpark "Baryonyx" has a traditional attraction "Braids", consisting of two interwoven slides.  For lovers of a relaxing holiday, the "Slow River" works, the descent along which really resembles a measured swimming.

    <p>  The water park in Kazan ‚ÄúBaryonyx‚Äù can be called classic with confidence: it has a large children's area and many interesting slides for adults.  Many residents of the city come here and just swim.  From the new water park, the old one is favorably distinguished by lower prices.  A ticket here costs 400-800 rubles.  for children under 14 years old, 500-900 rubles.  for children 14-18 years old and 600-1000 rubles.  for adults (the cost depends on the time of stay and the day of visit: on weekends - more expensive).  There are special rates for senior citizens, expectant mothers, students, large families, birthday men and newlyweds. </p><p>  Despite the term of operation, all attractions are recognized as safe, they are regularly checked and maintained. </p><p>  Waterpark "Baryonyx" reviews are positive and due to some special internal rules.  Guests of the complex do not have to wear circles for descents on their own, they can always be taken directly on the upper areas of the slides before the descent.  The number of inflatable products and sun loungers is also sufficient.  Moreover, competition has a positive effect on the number of visitors.  The water park is never crowded even on weekends and holidays.  You can relax with maximum comfort at any time.  Visitors to this water entertainment center claim that you can spend at least 2-3 hours in it, but if you go for half a day, it will not be boring. </p>
