Dynamics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Yaroslavl region was formed in 1936.  The territory is about 36.4 thousand square meters.  km  The population of the city of Yaroslavl is 605.2 thousand people.  In the region as a whole, 1338.7 thousand permanently live, urban residents of them - 1088.6, rural - 250.1 thousand. The main feature of the territorial distribution of the population is its unevenness.  Concentration is noted along the banks of the Volga, fulfilling the task of a kind of core of the entire distribution system of residents. </p><h2>  The population of Yaroslavl.  Quantity change <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl population" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/317623.jpg" width="301"></div></h2><p>  As you know, a favorable demographic situation contributes to the development of the economy, while a critical situation provokes various difficulties in different spheres of life.  The population since the end of the 19th century.  and until the end of the forties of the 20th century increased.  During this period, there is a significant predominance of fertility over mortality.  The fact that the population of Yaroslavl increased during this period was also facilitated by the development of industry.  For the construction of enterprises, for example, labor was required.  She was attracted from other parts of the country.  The maximum level of the number of inhabitants in the region was noted in 1939, which is associated with a larger (compared to the present time) area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory.  Specialists describe war years as demographic depression.  In the post-war period, the country as a whole was in an economic crisis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="population of the city of Yaroslavl" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/317621.jpg" width="266"></div>  However, it should be noted that between 1979 and 1988, the population of Yaroslavl (according to the census) increased significantly.  In 1991, the number of residents reached the highest level.  In the future, it began to decrease.  This trend continues today.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Birth rate </h2><p>  As early as the beginning of the 20th century, in Russia as a whole, there was a slight decrease in the birth rate.  In 1991, a clear tendency towards a decrease in this level with the subsequent stabilization of low indicators began to be observed in Yaroslavl.  At the same time, as experts say, a decrease in the birth rate is also observed in peacetime against the background of an increase in the mortality rate.  This situation is called pronounced depopulation.  There is an opinion that the number of children directly depends on the quality and standard of living of citizens of reproductive (reproducible) age.  However, such a causal relationship is not noted here.  This is proved by the fact that many progressive countries in Europe take various measures to improve the demographic situation, while <span>poor African countries,</span> for example, are forced, on the contrary, to struggle with high birth rates. </p><h2>  Statistics of the last decades <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl population" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/317619.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  According to the census, the population of Yaroslavl in 2010 was about 591 thousand hours. These figures are slightly lower than previous figures.  However, at the same time, according to statisticians, in recent years there have been slight shifts towards a decrease in natural mortality and an increase in fertility.  Of course, the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were during the Soviet Union are comparatively far, but nevertheless, the <span>demographic crisis that</span> began in the 90s is gradually declining.  The population of Yaroslavl is replenished at the expense of visitors.  Migration in recent years has significantly affected the number of inhabitants.  It should be noted that despite the influx of citizens from other regions, especially from Kazakhstan, the population of Yaroslavl remains stable in its ethnic composition. </p>
