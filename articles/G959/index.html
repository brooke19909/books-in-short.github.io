    <h2>  History in a nutshell </h2><p>  The official written sources mentioning Tula are dated 1146.  The architectural, cultural, historical heritage of the city is exceptionally rich.  However, the settlement experienced not only prosperity, but also difficult periods of history. </p><p>  In 1382, as it became known from the found chronicles, Tula was ravaged during the invasion of <span>Khan Tokhtamysh.</span>  More than once the Tatars came here, the Golden Horde.  During the reign of Ivan III, the city began to be considered a Moscow principality.  And in the 17th century, Ivan Bolotnikov captured it. </p><p>  Under the reign of Emperor Alexei Mikhailovich, Tula was once again in full bloom, since arms production was being opened there.  A century later, Peter I decided that it was in Tula that an arms factory would open.  This was built by Nikita Demidov. </p><h2>  Interesting features </h2><p>  <span>Is Tula</span> included in your itinerary <span>?</span>  <span>Sights</span> and tourist routes around the city will help you get acquainted with this ancient place, nowadays known around the world.  But in the old days things were a little different, as the very name of the settlement already testifies.  Philologists say that the name was formed from the word "zatuli", which means a hidden, hidden place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hence the name of the river flowing in the virgin forests.  And to this day, it has retained its historical name - Tulitsa.  Well, later on the waterway also called the settlement that grew on its banks. </p><p>  Going on a tourist route along Tula, the traveler learns that the city attracted the attention of those in power in 1146, when he was looking for salvation from enemies by the Novgorod-Seversky prince.  First he went to Vyatichi, and from there he reached Tula, where he decided to collect tribute, subjugating the surrounding lands.  Consequently, to the first written mention, the settlement was already.  And now it is still unclear in which year Tula appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative stories </h2><p>  Another version of how fame came to the city connects ancient history with the Tatars and the wife of the khan.  Exploring the <span>sights of Tula</span> in one day, the traveler will hear: according to legend, the Khan‚Äôs wife was called Taydula.  It was from here that the name of the settlement appeared. </p><p>  After some time, he passed into the possession of Prince Oleg, and subsequently ended up with Dmitry Donskoy. </p><h2>  Strategic importance </h2><p>  In the old days, Tula was no different from other nearby settlements.  She was very small, and she was protected from enemies by a prison.  First, people settled on a small island formed by Tulitsa and Upoy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city passed from the Ryazan princes to Moscow, but never became independent.  Tula was a strategically important point, since the fortress built here made it possible to defend the southern approaches.  That is why the military history of which Tula is famous is so rich.  Sightseeing and tourist attractions are also a field where the Battle of Kulikovo took place, because this event took place near the city.  An important battle happened in 1380. </p>

    <h2>  Tula Kremlin </h2><p>  If Tula is included in the trip, the sights and tourist routes will not do without exploring the local Kremlin.  And today, this important ancient building looks magnificent, demonstrating the luxury of wooden architecture, whose experts were generations of artisans living in these places. </p><p>  The Kremlin is like a toy, and its beauty does not leave anyone indifferent.  It is dated to the 16th century, when Russia needed a fortress that would help defend itself from the Crimean Tatars.  Nowadays, the building has ceased to play strategic importance, but has become a symbol of the city, attracting curious tourists from different countries. </p><p>  First, the Kremlin was erected on the main road, which was called the Muravskaya Shlyakh.  It was on it that the militant Crimean peoples walked, counting on rich prey.  It so happened that the fortifications were too weak to defend the city, and the structure was rebuilt on the left bank, not subject to floods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If Tula happened to be in your route, the sights and tourist routes will surely lead an inquisitive person past the shores of Upa, the lowlands of the Rzhevskaya Gati, as well as the most important military point of intersection of the Upoy Muravsky Shlyakh. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction and restoration of the Kremlin </h2><p>  Since the building is old, it has undergone perestroika more than once.  In particular, the overhaul was launched on the initiative of Catherine II in 1784.  Since the empress did not set the task for workers to preserve the appearance of the building, the modern Kremlin is completely unlike the one it was centuries ago. </p><p>  Another repair was started in 1820.  It was then that the turrets were decorated with wooden domes.  However, they lived less than a century.  By the 20th century, the entire building with annexes and additional territories was close to destruction.  At that time, an important, beautiful, historically significant building not only turned out to be abandoned, but turned into a city dump.  The territory was not cleaned, and then it was here that they decided to build a stadium.  The greenhouse complex and a dead factory fence adjoined the Kremlin. </p>

    <p>  Important changes in the history of the Tula Kremlin occurred in 1948, when the government of the Soviet Union decided to restore.  The work was completed in 1957, restoring the battlements and gates.  In 1975, the Assumption Cathedral began to be restored. </p><p>  If you plan a short trip to this ancient city, you can briefly see the sights of Tula by visiting the territory of the Kremlin.  It is here that all the most interesting and significant from the point of view of history is located. </p><h2>  Temple of the Twelve Apostles </h2><p>  If you study the sights of Tula and the region, you will notice that there are not many temples.  The situation was even worse at the end of the 19th century, which is especially surprising if you look at the map, because these are really large territories, densely populated by people. </p><p>  Mostly <span>Tula churches</span> were located in the city center.  But the <span>diocesan sheets of the</span> 19th century wrote that the existing churches were not able to satisfy popular needs. </p><p>  The problem attracted the attention of Bishop Pitirim, who found himself in these parts in 1896.  At that time, it was decided to start a program for the construction of churches on the outskirts of the city.  That's exactly what was laid: </p><ul><li>  Temple of the Twelve Apostles. </li><li>  Zion Church. </li><li>  St. Znamenskaya. </li><li>  Church of the <span>Theodosius of Chernigov.</span> </li></ul><p>  The most interesting story is the Temple of the Twelve Apostles, originally built of wood.  Assistance in its creation was provided by forest merchants who owned rich warehouses on the southern outskirts of the village.  Providence also helped in the creation of the temple, thanks to which the elder Chistikov from Nikolsky participated in the construction of churches.  Together, they managed to put the temple out of oak, which was later replaced by stone. </p>

    <p>  Considering what Tula is, sights (photos - on this page), be sure to look at the internal structure of the temple.  It was supposed to create it with three thrones, in the name of: </p><ul><li>  The Twelve Apostles. </li><li>  Nicholas the Wonderworker. </li><li>  Great Martyr Catherine. </li></ul><h2>  Temple of Seraphim of Sarov </h2><p>  Be sure to visit this temple, if your tourist route has the city of Tula, attractions.

Chronicles say that in 1914 130 people were in charge of the temple. </p><p>  The diocesan newspapers wrote about the church of Seraphim of Sarov that it is clean and comfortable, like a chapel.  As you know, St. Seraphim preferred to pray in a tiny cell, lived modestly and protected the destitute.  The church is fully consistent with his lifestyle and habits. </p><p>  In 1976, the temple was transferred to the archival department of the regional executive committee.  It was supposed to be used to store documents.  The territory was leased to the deaf and dumb society, a club was set up here. </p>

    <p>  Many Tula factories simultaneously produced both samovars and weapons.  In a certain historical period, as many as fifty of them worked in the city!  Most were in the district of the village.  It was here that the legendary masters of the 19th century worked: </p><ul><li>  Nikolai Malikov. </li><li>  Ivan Batashev. </li><li>  Vasily Lyalin. </li></ul><p>  Samovars were made of copper and cupronickel, decorated with gilding and silvering.  But the base was always poured from brass.  From century to century, fashion has changed, which affected the styles of products.  But the methods of production, oddly enough, practically did not change over time.  To make a good samovar, to this day you need to have: </p><ul><li>  to a mare; </li><li>  bay </li><li>  soldering iron; </li><li>  scissors for metal; </li><li>  anvil; </li><li>  stamp. </li></ul><p>  Already at the end of the XIX century, more than one and a half hundred styles of samovars were known.  In the second half of this century, the city turned into a samovar center.  Moreover, production was established not only in the village, but also in nearby villages. </p><h2>  Samovars and their fame </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine an exhibition of Russian folk crafts without a samovar.  The manufacturers who produced the best models were awarded medals, whose prints then adorned the walls of new products.  When exploring the modern sights of Tula, photos and a brief description, be sure to pay attention to the museum of samovars, which allows you to get to know how the best objects were created. </p><p>  Today, Tula continues to be the center of samovar production.  Magnificent samples of products manufactured in these places are sold not only in Russia, but throughout the world.  They are presented in the best gift shops.  Antique items are stored in private collections and collections of major museums. </p><h2>  Tula and weapons </h2><p>  Another aspect that attracts tourists and curious travelers in the history of Tula is arms manufacturing.  It was established in these parts from ancient times, and the first plant was opened at the direction of Emperor Peter the Great.  Nowadays, you can visit special museums that tell about the military history of the city and about where and how weapons were made.  Incidentally, in the old days, weapons made in Tula were considered one of the best in the world! </p>
