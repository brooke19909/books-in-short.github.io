According to tourists, such a convenient location is the main advantage of the hotel.  To find yourself on the beach, just cross the pedestrian path.  The coast is sandy.  Sunset at sea is gentle, but the depth begins fairly quickly.  Along the coast there are all kinds of shops with souvenirs and other goods, restaurants and cafes.  On the beach, guests of the resort expect numerous water activities. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  The famous Golden Sands resort is located near Varna.  It got a beautiful name thanks to the park, on the territory of which there are hotel complexes, beaches and entertainment clubs.  The park occupies a very vast territory, which is a nature reserve.  Here you can see forests, beautiful beaches and, of course, the sea with clear water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glarus golden sands bulgaria description" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1788048.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fifty hotels have been built in this region.  All are located near the coast.  It is worth noting that the resort has long gained popularity as the best place for families with young children.  Each complex has children's clubs in which experienced animators work.  Well, on the beaches for young tourists there are a variety of attractions. </p><p>  The coast of the resort offers all kinds of entertainment for guests.  Here you can go diving, hang gliding or ride a water bike.  The beaches stretched along the entire resort, reaching in some places up to 100 meters wide.  Fine-grained sand cover and shallow sea with a clean bottom are the pride of Golden Sands. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Golden Sands is a fairly young resort, which has not yet managed to grow significant sights.  In the list of interesting places there are several objects worthy of the attention of tourists. </p><p>  One of them is <span>Aladzha Monastery.</span>  It is located 15 kilometers from Varna, near the resort of Golden Sands.  The monastery was once carved by hermit Christians in a sheer scale around the 4th century.  The monastery lasted peacefully until the 14th century until it was plundered by the Ottomans.  The monastery is one of the places visited by tourists in Bulgaria.  The medieval structure is perfectly preserved to this day.  It consists of two tiers.  Here you can see the temple itself and the living quarters of the monks.  Catacombs are located nearby, in which Christians hid from the Ottomans.  Now the monastery is a museum and receives visitors all year round. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glarus gs 4 bulgaria golden sands" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1788050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main property of the resort can be considered the beautiful forests of the national park in whose territory it is located.  Local authorities decided not to block these places from tourists, but, on the contrary, paved walking routes of different difficulty levels, constructing paths with places for halt, drinking fountains and observation platforms.  There are trails for cyclists, children, senior citizens, you can even hire a guide who will help you overcome the route, and at the same time will tell a lot of interesting things about the park. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Many consider the nightlife of the resort to be very significant.  A large number of discos, clubs, casinos really function on its territory, noisy beach parties are organized. </p><p>  <span>Aquapolis water park</span> works for parents with children <span>,</span> everyone can visit it and try out the fun rides.  It is located in the northwestern area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort.  It is believed that the water park is quite good.  It has everything: extreme slides, sunbeds and a relaxation area, lazy river, pools and attractions.  For a fun pastime with the whole family it is difficult to find a better place. </p><p>  Another worthwhile entertainment might be a dolphinarium.  But in order to get into it, you have to go to Varna.  Dolphinarium "Festa" will delight adults and children with colorful performances.  And next to it is the zoo, which is definitely worth a walk in the family.  On its territory you can see representatives of the fauna collected from around the world.  The zoo has a rather long history, since it has been operating since 1961. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glarus golden sands 4 bulgaria golden sands" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1788052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you still went to Varna, then you should go for a walk along its Seaside Park, which was designed by Anton Novak in the 19th century.  It is located on the beautiful coast.  The park consists of several alleys that are laid along the sea.  They are decorated with planted bushes, trees, flower beds and flowers, as well as numerous fountains.  In the park there are: museums, a sports complex, a zoo and a dolphinarium. </p><p>  A little north of Golden Sands is the town of Albene, which has another water park called Aquamania.  In general, the distances between cities are small, and there are no problems with transport, so you can see the most interesting places in the district.  In each hotel there are representatives of travel agencies offering sightseeing trips.  Therefore, you can use their services or travel on your own. </p><p>  It has long been known that Bulgarian cuisine is what it is worth to visit this wonderful country.  In the resort you will not find traditional mehans, but there are many cafes and restaurants that offer you dishes of Oriental, Bulgarian, Russian cuisines.  But the most popular among our tourists, of course, are fish restaurants.  You can have a bite to eat at the resort almost anywhere, so do not worry if you have purchased packages without meals. </p>
