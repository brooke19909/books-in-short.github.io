Characteristic and Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ruza is the left <span>tributary of the Moscow River,</span> located in the Moscow Region of Russia.  Its origins originate in the Shakhovsky district on the eastern outskirts of the village of Maloye Krutoe.  Further, it flows through the Ruzsky and Volokolamsk districts within the Moscow Upland towards the southeast.  The depth of the stream is small (no more than 5 meters), length is 145 km, average width is 50 m. Many people wonder where the river Ruza flows.  The answer to it is extremely simple: of course, to the Moscow River in the vicinity of the village of Timofeevo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="river ruza" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1138189.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Two large <span>reservoirs</span> operate on Ruze <span>: Verkhneruz</span> and Ruza.  Thanks to them, there is a full-fledged nutrition of the Vazuz water system.  Also, do not underestimate their role in the water supply of the capital of the Russian Federation.  The reservoirs regulate the drain, so even in the summer, the Ruza River remains passable.  Along its right bank, not far from the former village of Nezhdino, the settlement of the same name is located, dating back to Old Russian time and the Iron Age - the so-called Diakovo culture. </p><h2>  Take a look at the story </h2><p>  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> conducted in these places confirm the fact that these territories were inhabited by people back in the Paleolithic era.  And about 2 thousand years ago, the Baltic tribes and Ugro-Finns settled here.  It was they who most likely called the water stream Rowza or Rudza, which in translation meant "calm, quiet."  Due to the fact that the Ruza River was completely safe, the first settlement was founded on it.  The name of the stream has changed a bit over time, and now sounds more consonant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was these tribes who began the construction of their ancestral fortresses on the banks of the Ruza, from which the Ruza Kremlin (Gorodok) grew over time.  Today it is considered an archaeological site and is fully protected by the state.  Today, on the territory of Gorodok there is a charming park, which is a favorite place for walks of indigenous people and visiting tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where does the river Ruza flow" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1138186.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tributaries of the Ruza River </h2><p>  Many other rivers flow into the reservoir.  The most significant - 8. Closest to the mouth is the largest left tributary - the Ozerna River.  Its length is 63 km, in the upper reaches there is a swampy valley.  The coastline is high, covered with dense thickets of forest.  Right Pednia is also a tributary of Ruza.  Length - 16 km, it flows into the <span>Ruzskoe reservoir.</span> </p><h2>  What awaits fishing lovers? </h2><p>  People who like to sit on the beach with a fishing rod in their hands will really like it here.  The Ruza River is considered the most popular fishing spot in the Moscow Region: sports and amateur.  Over 20 species of <span>river fish</span> live in its waters <span>.</span>  The most intense fishing season falls on August-September, when a large number of fish are in the river.  You can easily catch crucian carp, ide, roach, and occasionally carp.  Fans of winter fishing come across mainly pikes, breams and scammers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tributaries of the river Ruza" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1138191.jpg" width="600"></div>

Due to the fact that the river Ruza along the entire coastline is covered with forests, this area is ideal for many representatives of the animal world.  Nearby you can easily meet moose, wild boars, wolves, foxes, hares, badgers and raccoons.  The banks of the river, overgrown with willow trees, were chosen for nesting by wild ducks and geese.  Forests, represented mainly by birch forests, spruce, oaks, alder, larch, provide shelter for many other species of wild birds. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Due to the fact that Ruza is considered one of the cleanest and most beautiful rivers of the Moscow region, its banks are famous for its numerous health centers, resorts, and children's camps.  It is also popular among kayaking tourists who love its dense forests, comfortable parking and even flow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="river protection" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1138196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Protection of the Ruza River </h2><p>  In order to continue to please the body of water with its clear water and picturesque shores, considerable attention is paid to the protection of the river and adjacent territories.  To do this, <span>shore strengthening</span> and channel cleaning are carried out, and the state of the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe stream and its tributaries is also monitored.  Enterprises are fined for dumping waste into the pond and polluting the environment.  Punishment can only be avoided if a sewage treatment plant system is installed. </p><p>  In Moscow, the creation of a unified system that carries out eco-monitoring of water bodies, the activity of which allows us to timely assess the quality of water in rivers, analyze the status of each reservoir, and respond to cases of so-called volley discharges and accidental pollution, identifying their sources.  And of course, every vacationer should remember that the fate of our planet depends on his careful and conscious attitude to the environment. </p>
