All this is due to the absence of any wise or, on the contrary, decisions for the state.  However, this article will reveal to you what Catherine 2 was - once the Empress of Russia. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Empress of Russia" class="if uuid-2489790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2489790.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, you need to find out the main facts about the life of the ruler.  She was born on April 21 (or May 2) in 1729 and her real name was Sophia Frederick Augustus of Anhalt-Zerbst. </p><p>  Catherine received a home education, learning everything that a noble girl needs to know: dancing, music, geography, history, and also various languages.  She studied English, French and Italian at the same time.  From childhood, however, many adults were dissatisfied with her boyish behavior - young Sofia was not averse to taking walks with local guys on the Stettin streets. </p><h2>  Throne </h2><p>  She came to the throne after having overthrown her completely unpopular husband, Peter 3. From the throne. Since then, the power of the nobles over the peasants and complete enslavement reigned in Russia.  In addition, the public administration system was completely reformed. </p><p>  However, it is worth saying that Catherine‚Äôs noble upbringing was not in vain and she devoted a lot of time and effort to fiction and culture in principle.  One became one of those in Europe who invested most in the development of culture.  She has been seen more than once in correspondence with popular enlighteners, and has collected paintings and manuscripts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Catherine's name 2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="24smi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine's life" class="if uuid-2489786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2489786.jpg"></div><p>  As already clear, the name Catherine is Russian, and she could get it only in Russia.  Having moved, the girl actively began to study culture, customs and traditions, mentality, and, most importantly, language.  She wanted to learn it as soon as possible in order to become closer to Russia, because she perceived it as her new homeland. </p><p>  Once she, once again diligently studying the language, did it at night by the window, from where the frosty winter wind was blowing.  This could not pass for Sofia for nothing, and she fell ill with pneumonia.  However, instead of the Lutheran pastor whom they were planning to provide, she sent for Dr. Todorsky.  It was this act that later became one of those thanks to which she gained such fame in Russian circles. </p><p>  Later, the future empress converted to Orthodoxy instead of Lutheranism and she was awarded the name of <span>Ekaterina Alekseevna.</span>  After that they were engaged to Peter 3. </p><p>  The appearance of Sophia with her mother entailed a whole thread of political intrigue.  Many through them wanted to seize power over the emperor, but, according to sources, Catherine herself was not involved in these intrigues and did not take part in them. </p><h2>  Youth and personal life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rus.rus4all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine 2" class="if uuid-2489783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2489783.jpg"></div><p>  With Peter Fedorovich, Catherine was married at the age of 17.  However, immediately after the wedding ceremony, he did not pay any attention to his spouse, and there was no marital relationship between them either. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Catherine was twice pregnant, but both times unsuccessfully.  Son Paul was born as a result of the third pregnancy, and he was immediately taken from his mother, after which she did not see him for more than 40 days.  Around the born child there were many rumors and intrigues, because it was rumored that Peter could not have children, and Catherine gave birth to a child from her lover.  Then there was a version that the emperor had an operation, during which they removed the very defect that prevented them from having descendants.  Simply put, a rather great interest in society was caused by the palace passions during the time of Catherine 2. Historical works on this subject can be found in large numbers on the Internet. </p><p>  However, what can I say here, the palace was indeed in full swing with continuous passions.  Peter openly despised his wife, calling her "spare."  He made lovers, but also did not interfere with his wife doing it.  Catherine, in principle, was not against it herself and started an affair with Stanislav Ponyatovsky. </p><p>  The colors thickened after the Empress gave birth to a daughter, who was named Anna, on December 9, 1757.  Peter was indignant and perplexed, because he could not know for sure whether it was his daughter, and whether he should take her to his imperial family. </p><h2>  Political intrigue </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nanevskom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The rise of Catherine 2" class="if uuid-2489794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2489794.jpg"></div><p>  However, this is not the end of our historical work.  Catherine 2, on her example, managed to prove as far back as the 18th century, how cunning politicians can be. </p><p>  To begin with, she had active relations with the English ambassador, whose name was Williams.  Catherine ‚Äúpresented‚Äù him confidential information on a man‚Äôs behalf (in order to maintain secrecy) and received money for this, as her receipts repeatedly said. </p><p>  However, the problem was that England, at the time of the seven-year war with Prussia, was her ally.  The money and the constant receipt of it from the treasury of England led her to the fact that she promised Williams that she could help.  Russia under Catherine 2, unexpectedly for all, could become an ally of Prussia. </p><p>  And during the period of Elizabeth Petrovna‚Äôs illness, the future empress launched an active campaign to eliminate her ‚Äúloving‚Äù husband from the throne.  This began after Peter became emperor and began to conclude treaties that were completely unfavorable to Russia and make decisions that almost no one was satisfied with.  It was at that time that Catherine 2 decided to participate in the coup and overthrew Peter 3. </p><h2>  Positive sides of the board </h2><div class="photo" data-original="milli-firka.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trip to Crimea" class="if uuid-2489792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2489792.jpg"></div><p>  One can talk infinitely much about Catherine 2. Historical works are full of themes about her rule.  However, indeed, many Russians are still convinced that it rules are quite reasonable. </p><p>  What is it worth only that the empress began to fight various epidemics through vaccinations and set an example for her subjects on her own.  Exports increased, and Russian ships began to sail in the Mediterranean.  In 1783, the Russian Academy was founded.  There was also an important moment in monetary reform - Catherine introduced paper currency.  The role of the empire has increased in the global economy. </p><h2>  Negative sides of the board </h2><p>  Not without negative sides in the reign of Catherine II Alekseevna. </p><p>  Historians note that in peasant villages, hunger has been seen more than once.  Many claimed that hunger was caused by frequent crop failures, but later it turned out that it was caused by a large export of wheat, which, of course, was collected from the peasants. </p><p>  In addition, significantly increased the power of the nobles under her rule.  Also, the policy of state power of Catherine 2 has radically changed. A historical essay on the topic of her reign shows which sides she is called the Great for and whether it really is. </p><h2>  Contribution to the life of Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="eadaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oath to Catherine" class="if uuid-2489796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2489796.jpg"></div><p>  Although each of the rulers had some peculiarities of his tenure on the throne, it is safe to say that Ekaterina Alekseevna was one of those who raised Russia to a higher level. </p><p>  Catherine 2 - a personality in history, which is discussed to this day.  Through intrigues, conspiracies and gossip, she still did a lot, for which the Russians still remember her. </p>
