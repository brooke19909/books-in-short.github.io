Where is it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What associations do ordinary people have when they hear the word “Courchevel” (also pronounced “Courchevel”)?  As a rule, these are stormy parties of Russian oligarchs surrounded by girls of easy virtue, champagne by the river at a price of 1000 € per bottle, black caviar in spoons, high-profile scandals, paparazzi, etc.  But is it really so?  What is this mysterious Courchevel?  Where is it? </p><p>  And this famous ski resort is located almost in the center of the Taransee Valley, in the Savoy department in the <span>French Alps.</span>  Courchevel is four stations located at different heights (1300, 1500, 1650 and 1850 m), which are part of a joint zone called “Three Valleys”.  Courchevel has existed as a resort since 1946, but it was best known in 1992, when part of the competition took place here as part of the XVI <span>Olympic Winter Games</span> in Albertville.  It was then that the world learned about Courchevel - where it is and why it is so beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Courchevel where it is" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/270782.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  <strong>What are the attractions in Courchevel?</strong> </p><ul><li>  First of all, skiing.  For lovers of skiing, there are four levels (from 1000 to 1850 m), on which skiing is possible during the entire ski season, which lasts from November to May in these places.  To climb up there are <span>cable cars,</span> lifts, a funicular.  And for the descent - more than a hundred tracks of varying complexity, which vary in color (from green to black).  Their total length is more than 150 km. </li><li>  Golf.  For lovers of this aristocratic game, there are 9 holes, 27 stops, of which 7 are indoor.  There are bars and restaurants nearby, a terrace with sun loungers, and even an artificial lake. </li><li>  Mountains and rocks.  For lovers of mountaineering and climbing in Courchevel, there are several specially equipped sites designed for the most different levels of training. </li><li>  Bathing.  Oddly enough, to go for a swim and sunbathe, some go to Courchevel.  Crimea and the <span>Black Sea coast of the</span> Caucasus, of course, are more suitable for this type of vacation.  Nevertheless, in Courchevel many hotels have on their territory specially equipped swimming pools and spacious terraces where you can sunbathe, admiring the unique views of the Alpine nature.  And in the area, located at an altitude of 1550 m, there is a whole entertainment complex with an outdoor 25-meter pool and a magnificent green beach, located directly on the hillside. </li><li>  Mountain biking.  There is everything you need for fans of this sport: bike rental, special lifts, equipped tracks. </li><li>  Fishing.  In local lakes you can catch lake salmon, several species of trout.  In order to go on a mountain fishing, you must purchase a special permit - a fisherman's card. </li><li>  Classical music.  Courchevel hosts numerous classical music festivals.  By the way, for most of the events, admission is absolutely free. </li><li>  Shopping  For those who decide to combine business with pleasure, going here on vacation: in Courchevel prices are very dependent on the season.  At the beginning of summer, the discounts are just fantastic.  Sellers try to get rid of the goods in order to make room for new collections, and in other places to get such discounts is simply unrealistic. </li><li>  Local kitchen.  For lovers of gastronomic pleasures there are many restaurants in which the prices in summer are also much lower. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in Courchevel prices" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/270781.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><p>  <strong>Courchevel Resort: where is it and how to get there?</strong> </p><p>  The nearest airports to Courchevel are the airports of Geneva (140 km), Lyon (180 km), Grenoble (180 km) and Chambery (110 km).  There is a small landing site in Courchevel itself, but its length is not much more than 500 m and not every pilot has the right to land there.  Therefore, it is better to get from the airport to this ski resort by bus.  It will cost about 70 €.  You can also take a train to the nearest Moutiers station, then catch the local bus or take a taxi. </p><p>  As for the cost, everything here depends on the place of residence, and if desired, you can find quite reasonable prices.  It is not for nothing that vacationers from all over the world are striving here, and not the descendants of the Rockefellers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Courchevel Crimea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/270780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  High-quality and safe ski runs through a picturesque forest, a carefully thought-out system of lifts - this is what Courchevel means.  Where else is it possible to ski on the threshold of your home and quickly go down the slope?  Perhaps only here. </p>
