    <h2>  Dmitry's childhood </h2><p>  When was Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich born?  Date of birth - 1919, the exact date and month are not indicated in the sources.  Dmitry Romanovich was born in Ukraine, in the Kharkov province, in the village of Ovcharovo.  In modern times, this place is called the Trinity district of the Luhansk region.  Dmitry was born into a simple peasant family.  His mother, Vasilisa Ignatievna, lived in the village from childhood, like her father.  He worked as a carpenter. </p><p>  When Vasilisa Ignatievna was about to give birth, at that time the village was already under the yoke of the German invaders (the First World War was on).  And when the son was born, he notified his appearance with a loud cry.  Vasilisa Ignatievna was very scared, fearing that she and the baby would be punished for violating silence.  But her surprise was great when joyful cries of women, children and men were heard from the street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  They opened the window and heard the sounds of the song.  And someone exclaimed: ‚ÄúLad!  You were born free! ‚Äù  Dmitry grew up an ordinary boy, a strong and handsome guy.  From childhood, he learned to care for livestock, chopping wood and harvesting hay. </p><p>  Father taught him how to use an ax.  For the peasants, this was a mandatory skill.  At the same time, the father taught his son also his craft.  Therefore, the time for education was barely enough.  The war prevented.  And Dmitry managed to finish only five classes. </p><h2>  Ovcharenko Dmitry, a serviceman: war broke out </h2><p>  He got into the army even before the war, at the call of 1939. After that he was going to return to his native village, start a family, in a word, to realize the usual plans of a simple village guy.  But the war prevented that broke out in 1941. Dmitry was enrolled in the 176th Infantry Division of the 389th Regiment, in the third machine-gun company.  In the very first days at the front, he was slightly injured. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich Hero of the Soviet Union photo" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1552614.jpg" width="250"></div>

His duties were charged with delivering ammunition and food to the soldiers.  The task seemed harmless.  But Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich carried the cargo alone, and at the same time was armed with only a ‚Äúthree-ruler‚Äù and an ax, hidden in the hay of the cart. </p><h2>  Meeting with the Nazis </h2><p>  In the middle of summer 1941, the company Ovcharenko fought near the city of Balti.  Once, Dmitry, as usual, was carrying another batch of food and ammunition to the fighters.  Suddenly, on the road, right in front of Ovcharenko‚Äôs cart, two cars drove in which the Nazis were.  There were 50 soldiers and three officers in the cars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich feat" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1552608.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In captivity </h2><p>  At that time, such enemy breakthroughs beyond the front line were commonplace.  Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich was ambushed near the village of Pesets.  The Red Army soldier was captured.  To lull the vigilance of the Nazis, Ovcharenko pretended to be scared and confused.  The officers, chuckling at the cowardice of a soldier, took Dmitry's weapon.  And one of them decided to start the interrogation right on the spot, near the carts. </p><p>  The Germans felt very confident and relaxed.  They all got out of the cars.  Someone just breathe air, some to relieve themselves.  But nobody was particularly interested in the interrogation of the prisoner.  At the beginning of the war, the Nazis often captured Soviet soldiers.  Their Germans considered "subhuman" and were sure that the Russians were all scared to death. </p><h2>  Happy ax </h2><p>  Interrogation began right at the cart.  Since the prisoner had the only weapon that the Germans immediately took away, 50 soldiers did not expect a catch from one person at all.  But Dmitry always carried an ax in the hay.  The Hitlerites, apparently, simply did not notice this "cold weapon."  Or they thought that the prisoner still could not use the ax.  And for urban residents, this was not a weapon.  And the villagers used it with enviable virtuosity. </p><p>  Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich, who mentally calmly reasoned, suddenly decided to use village weapons.  This saved the Red Army life.  There was no time to analyze the battle options.  It was necessary to act suddenly.  And Dmitry, unexpectedly for the Germans, was able to quickly snatch an ax out of hay.  After one sweep, the head of a Hitler officer flew to the ground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ovcharenko Dmitry Romanovich Date of birth" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1552616.jpg" width="366"></div>

    <h2>  Feat of Ovcharenko </h2><p>  The Germans did not expect any resistance from the only prisoner.  What they saw shocked them, and the Nazis fell into complete stupor for some seconds.  This time was enough for Dmitry to jump into the cart for grenades.  And all three the Red Army threw into the crowd of Germans. </p><p>  When the smoke cleared, many Nazis lay wounded or killed on the ground.  And the Soviet soldier rushed straight at the enemy with one ax in his hands.  This terrified them so that instead of confronting the furious peasant carpenter, the survivors (there were more than twenty of them) tried to flee the soldier.  They did not even remember their weapons. </p><p>  But not everyone managed to escape.  Dmitry Romanovich beheaded one officer, Ovcharenko, overtaking in the gardens.  Then he set about the rest.  When only corpses remained on the ground, Dmitry calmly collected enemy weapons, tablets, documents and continued the trip to his company.  When on arrival he told his colleagues about what had happened, they did not believe him. </p><p>  And the political instructor, having carefully examined the <span>officer tablets</span> and documents brought by Dmitry, was greatly amazed.  Taking a few soldiers with him, he went to the battlefield.  The earth was strewn with the corpses of Germans.  And when the dead were counted, it turned out that two enemy officers and twenty-one soldiers were killed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ovcharenko Dmitri military man" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1552613.jpg" width="600"></div>
