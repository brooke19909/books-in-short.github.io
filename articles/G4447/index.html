    <p>  To begin with, we note that access to the network is assumed by several tariff plans developed for both smartphones and tablet computers.  For example, the same Beeline has a comprehensive solution that combines minutes for calls and messages, as well as Internet traffic.  And there are separate tariffs calculated for any device: from the phone to the USB modem for the PC. </p><p>  However, in today's review we will talk about a different category of tariffs.  This is ‚Äúpure‚Äù Internet traffic, which is provided in different volumes, depending on the needs of the user.  The option "Highway" is called ("Beeline" is the provider of this service). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Customer reviews note that the advantage of such a tariff plan is that it has a narrow focus - it offers exclusively access to the Internet, without any additions.  Accordingly, it can be suitable for those users who are sitting ‚Äúonline‚Äù from tablet computers or, for example, work through their smartphone.  An ideal combination could be (according to reviews of some users) connecting one SIM card for calls, and the second one for working on a network on which the ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù (‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù) option is activated. </p><p>  The disadvantage that is inherent in the tariff is also obvious - this option is not a comprehensive solution.  This means that if the subscriber wants to be able to not only surf the Internet, but also communicate cheaply, he must choose another service.  Such, for example, are the ‚ÄúAll for‚Äù options.  And the Highway (Beeline) service is not so universal in nature, and this, as noted in the comments by subscribers, is not necessary. </p><h2>  Diversity </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that the mobile operator has a whole ‚Äúset‚Äù of data packets that the subscriber should choose.  Such an ‚Äúassortment‚Äù is designed specifically so that the user can select a service that will most closely match his needs. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, the option "Highway" ("Beeline") has 5 varieties that differ in the amount of data allocated.  In accordance with this, of course, the cost of services is changing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cheapest tariff requires only 1 GB of traffic, while the most expensive option is as much as 20 gigabytes of data.  As for the question of how to choose the Highway (Beeline) tariff, there is nothing complicated in this - they all have a name that displays the final amount of data.  That is, for example, a package with one gigabyte is called that.  More details about each of the options will be described below. </p><h2>  1 GB </h2><p>  Starting tariff in the framework of the "Highway" ("Beeline") service.  The subscriber's phone is the main target device for this plan.  The reason is simple - on a tablet computer or, especially, on a USB modem, this amount of data will be consumed in a short period of time.  Therefore, such a tariff is ordered most often for a mobile device. </p><p>  The cost of the option is 7 rubles per day (starting from the 8th day of using the service) for daily debiting, or 200 rubles per month - if the subscriber chooses the second form of payment - on a monthly basis. </p>

    <p>  The Beeline company ‚ÄúHighway 1 GB‚Äù places it on the first place in the list of its services of this line, defining it as ‚Äúbasic.‚Äù It is often, according to information from reviews, ordered for the second SIM card slot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  4 GB </h2><p>  The second largest data volume is the tariff with 4 GB of traffic.  It is called accordingly - the option "Highway 4 GB."  "Beeline" positions it as the most popular.  Perhaps this is indeed so - the package is suitable for both the active user of the smartphone, and for those who rarely access the Internet from their tablet computer.  The cost of the service is 400 rubles per month, or 18 rubles per day.  As a gift with this tariff, a free package of television channels is allocated (a very favorable offer, as noted by the company's clients in the recommendations). </p><h2>  8 GB </h2>

    <p>  This is the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù <span>tariff plan</span> in the account <span>,</span> which, as the name suggests, contains 8 gigabytes of network traffic.  Some users even paired with this option "Highway" ("Beeline") use a <span>USB modem</span> .  However, with this set of traffic, with economical work, you can really work through a computer.  However, this service is more suitable for interaction with the tablet. </p><p>  There is a tariff "Highway" ("Beeline"), which assumes the presence of 8 GB of traffic, 600 rubles per month (with monthly installments).  It is noteworthy that the daily payment in his case is not provided. </p><h2>  12 GB </h2><p>  The next largest data package is a 12 GB package, which, of course, is called that.  In the case of this tariff plan, both tablet owners and computer users will be considered the target audience.  If you do not upload large files and do not spend the Internet on media content, you can work with mail with such a volume of data, sit on social networks, read news for a month. </p>

    <p>  The described Highway service (Beeline indicated this information on the tariff page) costs only 700 rubles a month - ‚Äúa hundred‚Äù more than the smaller 4 GB packet in terms of traffic.  Obviously, this option is more beneficial than the previous one.  It‚Äôs even possible that this is a tricky marketing move developed by a mobile operator. </p><h2>  20 GB </h2><p>  Finally, the latest rate in traffic growth is the one that provides 20 gigabytes.  This is the maximum package of all that is possible in the Highway lineup, and it is obvious that it serves for working with USB modems.  At the very least, you can spend this <span>amount of information</span> either on a very powerful smartphone or on a tablet - or through a stationary PC or laptop (most likely). </p><h2>  Work speed </h2>

    <p>  In this article, we talked about the amount of data transmitted by the operator;  however, we did not address the issue of speed, although this is an extremely important point.  The fact is that some companies are resorting to various ways to optimize their mobile Internet management policies, including speed limits.  For many providers, for example, we see unlimited traffic allocated to work at a certain speed.  This means that the user will not be able to download large files simply because of the presence of such a filter.  And working with it in full mode is very difficult - such packages are not suitable for fans to download movies, music and games online. </p><p>  As noted on the company's website, the tariff from Beeline (Highway) has a connection speed of 10-20 Mbit / s when working via LTE (4G) connection.  In the format of a 3G network, this figure drops to 3-5 Mbit / s, and when working in 2G (GPRS), it is not higher than 60-100 Kbit / s.  Naturally, the figures given may vary, depending on the load on the network and the strength of the signal that your device catches.  This speed, according to subscribers, is quite enough for work, online games and even for watching movies online (on an LTE device). </p><h2>  Territory of action </h2>

    <p>  All subscribers have the opportunity to order a Highway - it will operate in Russia, except for the following regions: Magadan, Crimea, Norilsk, Chukotka, Yakutia.  Probably, such a specific feature of the service is the remoteness of these regions and the lack of the ability to connect them to the main network, providing a stable signal.  So there you can forget about GPS or LTE-connection. </p><p>  Therefore, perhaps, if you are going there for a long time, you should know how to disable the "Highway" option on the "Beeline".  We will talk about this a bit later. </p><h2>  TV package </h2><p>  As already mentioned, with more expensive tariff plans, the service provider company offers a package of television channels as a gift.  The operator‚Äôs website indicates what kind of channels they are.  According to official information, there are 15 of them - all of them are included in the Beeline TV group.  Mostly these are some of the most popular in our country. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  So, suppose that you are satisfied with all the conditions of the service.  You have decided on the option, based on your own preferences, you live in the right region and more.  So how does the Highway (Beeline) connection go? </p><p>  You can do this in several ways, and they are actually quite simple.  On the website, where tariff information is presented, there is a special ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button.  By clicking on it, on the screen you will see a form with fields requiring filling.  Here you need to indicate whether you want to receive an SMS with your code confirming the connection to the service, or if you prefer to see a short code that needs to be activated from your device.  Another option is to log into your personal account using the username and password;  or just contact the Beeline representative / call the operator number and find out there. </p><p>  The answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow to disable the option" Highway "on" Beeline "?‚Äù  it sounds in much the same way - you can do it exactly the same way. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  While writing this article, we used various reviews and opinions of people who have experience with Beeline and the described service.  For the most part, they are positive ‚Äî users only respond negatively about a possible drop in speed and a weak network signal (depending on the location of the subscriber with the Highway (Beeline) option activated).  In other cases, the Internet "Highway" is served without interruption.  And the subscribers are satisfied! </p>
