    <h2>  Horse route </h2><p>  During the route, on horseback, tourists go to mountainous places where there is no housing, so overnight is carried out in tents.  Many (but not all parking lots) are equipped with a canopy and a garbage pit.  The toilet is usually primitive.  Everyone who buys tickets to Altai should find out from the tour operator all the conditions in which the route will go.

It is desirable that the weight of the cargo together with the tourist does not exceed 100 kg for one horse.  Bags for shipping are called archemaki.
