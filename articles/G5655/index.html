    <p>  In addition to a beach holiday in Tossa de Mar, reviews mention many <span>interesting places that</span> are recommended to be seen during the holiday.  The main attraction of the city is located in its southern part.  This is the fortified city of Vila Vella, whose construction dates back to the 12th century.  It currently houses the City Museum, which presents a wonderful collection of ancient Roman mosaics and unique works by Marc Chagall.  It is recommended to visit the ruins of the ancient Els Ametllers villa, which were discovered during archaeological excavations conducted in 1914. </p><p>  Many more sights can be seen walking around the city of Tossa de Mar (Spain).  Photos of these places cannot fully convey their beauty and uniqueness.  You need to see them with your own eyes.  So, in the Old Town stands the church of San Vincent.  It belongs to the most photographed place in the city.  The structure of this structure dates back to 1755-1776.  Initially, the interior was decorated in the Baroque style.  After its destruction, the church was restored, but with significant changes.  Only some elements of the apse with sculptures have survived, some of the fragments of pedestals, part of the spire of the church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tossa de Mar Attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/269425.jpg" width="374"></div>
