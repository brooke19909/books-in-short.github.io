  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Tridevyatkino kingdom": reviews of the developer, planning, address</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reviews about the <span>residential complex</span> ‚ÄúTridevyatkino kingdom‚Äù are of great importance for everyone who is considering the possibility of acquiring an apartment in this large-scale <span>residential complex.</span>  It is being built in a remote place, which today more resembles a reservation, but the developer is confident that the area has a great future and serious prospects. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="readyap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961692.jpg"></div><p>  There are very different reviews about LCD Tridevyatkino Tsarstvo: some interest holders are satisfied with the cooperation with this company, others complain about the poor quality of work and the deadlines. </p><p>  Currently, a residential complex is being built in the Vsevolzhsky district near the village of Murino.  Nearby there is a metro station "Devyatkino".  This is an economy-class housing, brick-monolithic buildings - from 9 to 16 floors.  The exterior of the house is bricked.  In total, about 4,000 apartments are planned.  Housing is being sold finished, there is the possibility of acquiring real estate in a mortgage. </p><p>  The work is carried out by the Unisto Petrostal group of companies, and for quite some time.  The first houses began to be commissioned in mid-2014.  Currently, 8 out of 10 lines have been built. The last two have encountered difficulties, work has not yet been completed. </p><p>  Delays in construction in the Tridevyatkino Tsarstvo residential complex negatively affect the image of the entire company.  The 9th stage (which should have been completed in the second quarter of 2017) was postponed to the 2nd quarter of 2019, and the 10th stage - from the 4th quarter of 2017 to the 4th quarter of 2018. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, the construction process of the Tridentyatkino Kingdom residential complex is closely watched by everyone who has already managed to buy apartments there, arrange a mortgage, and invest in their initial contributions their maternity capital. It is worth recognizing that they really have reason for unrest. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ownerrus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961691.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, one-, two- and three-room apartments, as well as studios are on sale.  They are rented with a finish, which includes laying a laminate, wallpapering, installing all the necessary plumbing and interior doors. </p><p>  Available studios start at about 16 square meters.  The cost of such housing will be slightly less than 2 million rubles.  Thus, it turns out that 1 square meter will cost the buyer about 78,000. </p><p>  The minimum area of ‚Äã‚Äãa one-room apartment is about 41 square meters, of which almost 12 and a half meters are in the kitchen.  The bathroom is combined.  Layouts in the residential complex "Tridevyatkino kingdom" are the most diverse.  Such an apartment will cost 2.7 million rubles (approximately 67,000 per square meter). </p><p>  Available there are three-room apartments in the residential complex "Tridevyatkino kingdom" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 77 square meters, of which 12 "squares" - a kitchen, a separate bathroom.  For such housing will have to pay 4.7 million rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The progress of construction of the residential complex Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961690.jpg"></div><p>  The lower floors in the residential complex "Tridevyatkino kingdom" in St. Petersburg are reserved for commercial premises.  Small shops of walking distance, hairdressing salons, fitness rooms, and centers of additional education for kids are opened in large numbers here. </p><p>  Most yards have sports and children's playgrounds.  There is a leisure park and a medical center, which is a significant plus for local residents.  If you believe the developer, in the future will be laid car lanes and parking areas.  A pharmacy, a shopping center, and educational institutions will appear right next to the residential complex.  Now there is none of this. </p><p>  Next to the new buildings there is a tunnel that connects Rustaveli Street with Toksovsky Highway, there is also a roundabout.  One of the main advantages of this LCD is the absence of any harmful production, which allows you to keep the air clean. </p><p>  Independent experts emphasize that the location of the residential complex cannot be called successful: there are problems with the social sphere, the necessary schools and hospitals are only in the project, the distance from the metro is added.  There is a metro "Devyatkino" near the Tridevyatkino Tsarstvo residential complex, but it cannot be said that it is within walking distance.  In a straight line, it is about 1.5 km to it, but in this case you will have to go actually along the railway lines, since there is no comfortable road.  By the way, the railway runs right under the windows of the houses of this complex.  So, even though there are no industrial enterprises in the okrug, there is no need to talk about the environmental component of the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the main advantages, it is worth noting a variety of layouts, strong brick-monolithic houses, fine finish.  The first houses were commissioned a few years ago, new residents are actively developing this place. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><div class="photo" data-original="78.house" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961693.jpg"></div><p>  If we dwell on the transport accessibility of the microdistrict, we will have to admit that it will be possible to get to the center of St. Petersburg from the residential complex at least in an hour.  The best option is a fixed-route taxi.  Because of this, there are many inconveniences for those who plan to buy an apartment in these places.  You can go with a change to the metro, but it certainly will not work faster. </p><p>  The developer seeks to develop infrastructure in the housing complex in order to attract more equity holders.  In the near future, they promise the construction and opening of medical institutions, grocery stores, a large park, which will be intended for recreation of local residents. </p><p>  Currently, you can use the services of supermarkets Pyaterochka, Lenta and Family, a network of pharmacies.  Immediately after the ring road is a city school, the next two kindergartens are at a considerable distance. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="living.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews about LCD Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961689.jpg"></div><p>  The developer of the residential complex "Tridevyatkino kingdom" is focused on attention.  Nowadays, people are increasingly choosing precisely reliable companies, which already have more than one object behind them.  Therefore, the buyer, investing in the project at the stage of excavation, can be sure that he will not lose his money. </p><p>  The Unisto Petrostal group of companies that builds these houses unites about a dozen successful organizations that provide a full cycle of the investment and construction process.  The main focus of their activities is the construction of multi-storey residential buildings, building blocks, the operation and construction of various commercial real estate.  Hundreds of specially trained workers and dozens of engineers for many years help this developer to gain confidence in this market.  The result is a high quality end product. </p><p>  The company, established in 1991, has long demonstrated professionalism, high and stable performance, and experience in solving the most complex problems.  All this allows her to occupy a worthy place among the representatives of the construction market of the Northern capital. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.0620029" data-lng="30.457590299999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/7/6/11676.png"></div><p>  Getting here will not be so easy.  Address LCD "Tridevyatkino kingdom": Lavriki highway, 74. </p><p>  Transport accessibility is poorly developed.  It is best to get by metro to the Devyatkino station, and then you need to change to a taxi.  You can get to your destination by bus number 2, but it runs very rarely (about once per hour). </p><h2>  Zakadye </h2><div class="photo" data-original="living.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Address LCD Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961694.jpg"></div><p>  They began to call Zakad a belt of sleeping areas around the Northern capital, which is formed beyond the Ring Road of St. Petersburg.  That‚Äôs just how somewhat contemptuously many call one of the most dynamically developing areas of St. Petersburg, which is clearly visible from the ring road.  Here, one after another, whole complexes grow. </p><p>  Many are skeptical of the benefits of this neighborhood.  Apartments are inexpensive, while in fact they are located in the city, and not in the Leningrad region.  But getting here is not easy.  If you go by car, there will be no less problems than with public transport.  With a high probability you will encounter traffic jams, which are simply impossible to go round.  On the road from the metro to new buildings, the private sector will surround you from all sides. </p><h2>  Layouts and finishes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="spbhomes.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Tridevyatkino kingdom" class="if uuid-2961688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2961688.jpg"></div><p>  Another obvious plus of these houses is interesting layouts and decoration of apartments from the builder.  After such repairs, it remains only to arrange the furniture, and after that it is already possible to move in. </p><p>  In all rooms, except for the bathroom, laminate is laid, and in the bathrooms and bathrooms they are painted with latex matte paint.  The walls of the hallways, rooms and kitchens are papered with paper-based wallpapers.  In bathrooms and bathrooms - they are painted with water dispersion paint. </p><p>  Be sure to install interior doors, loggias are glazed, electricity throughout the apartment.  Buyers receive housing already with meters, switches and sockets. </p><p>  From plumbing, the developer puts a sink, toilet, wash basin and bathtub in each apartment.  There is hot water all year round, steel radiators are installed in the kitchen and in each of the rooms.  There are all necessary means of communication: terrestrial television, telephone, radio broadcasting.  In the kitchen, everything is prepared for the installation of an electric stove. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the decoration is carried out very carefully, only the lack of any coverage in the toilet and bathroom, as prescribed in the contract, as well as the cheapest plumbing, interior doors and faucets that the developer could find, are striking. </p><h2>  Legends and myths </h2><p>  This residential complex has been surrounded by various myths and rumors for several years.  Because of which it is often difficult to understand where the truth is and where the lie is. </p><p>  In particular, the developer is often accused of delays in the delivery of objects.  In particular, the completion of the first stage was delayed for almost a year, but the fifth and sixth surrendered ahead of schedule.  At the moment, the company is again faced with old problems.  The delivery of the 9th building to the Tridevyatkino kingdom is again delayed for 2 years, and it is not known whether this house will be commissioned in 2019. </p><p>  Often they complain about the quality of tap water and "walking soils."  However, it is worth recognizing that this is an infrastructure problem that affects almost the entire Leningrad region.  At the same time, sewage treatment is carried out poorly. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  Among those who bought apartments in this place, there are a lot of positive reviews about the residential complex ‚ÄúTridevyatkino kingdom‚Äù. </p><p>  Many emphasize that there is an ecologically clean area, next to which there are no industrial enterprises, so there is no need to worry about clean air. </p><p>  Some real estate investors note an unusual approach to construction, which is conducted as unevenly as possible.  When floors are just being erected on one side of the house, wallpaper can already be glued on the other side in finished apartments.  This approach, at least, is surprising. </p><p>  Interest holders note that here they have to deal with the optimal ratio of quality and price.  The result is a fairly decent object.  Sound insulation is also praised here, because of the monolithic walls neighbors are almost inaudible, echoes reach only through ventilation.  Calm down by local residents and those who fear the proximity of the railway.  If the windows do not open on it, then the trains will not be heard completely. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  The main complaints in the negative reviews about ‚ÄúZhK Tridevyatkino kingdom‚Äù are connected with the unreliability of the developer, who disrupts all terms.  As a result, interest holders no longer know when their housing will actually be built and they will be able to start importing furniture, and then move to their apartments. </p><p>  Because of this, around the development of the entire microdistrict there are many unpleasant rumors that only increase general nervousness, scare away new potential customers.  For example, they argue that due to delays in the delivery of buildings, the company decided to temporarily abandon the construction of a school in the neighborhood, which was originally promised.  Now some people doubt that the company will ever return to this project. </p><p>  Those who moved tell what problems they had to face in the first months of life in the new housing complex.  In particular, flaws and flaws made during construction began to appear.  Due to the shrinkage of the house, the windows cracked, which, however, were promptly replaced under the warranty within one week.  At the same time, engineering networks are working properly, although sometimes there are interruptions with hot water. </p><p>  There is still no normal road in the microdistrict, the only minibus ends at 23.55, although a large number of residents have already moved to the complex.  Many are repelled by the lack of street lighting and comfortable sidewalks.  Construction work around already completed facilities is ongoing.  Those who have already moved still have to actually move around the construction site.  Small sections of paved roads almost immediately smash trucks from this and other construction sites in the area. </p><p>  In addition, the problem with parking is still in question.  As a result, those who moved, not only can not get the car anywhere, but also face a lack of light.  Shutdowns reach 13 hours a day.  Together with the light, heat and water disappear, since autonomous heating is organized everywhere. </p><p>  Summing up, we can conclude that here you can buy good apartments, at reasonable prices.  But you need to be prepared for transport problems and possible delays in the delivery of objects from the developer. </p>
