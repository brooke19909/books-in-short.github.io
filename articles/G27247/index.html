  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cash limit</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An organization, regardless of its <span>form of ownership,</span> may leave a certain amount of cash at its cash desk at the end of working hours.  That is, the amount of cash remaining at the checkout cannot exceed a certain amount.  This amount is called the cash desk limit. </p><p>  Throughout the day, the amount of cash is not limited, but by the end of the working time the amount of cash that remains at the cash desk should be less than the cash limit set at each individual enterprise.  If, however, the amount exceeds the limit, it must be deposited into the settlement accounts of the company intended for these purposes, opened with banking institutions.  As an exception, <span>cash funds</span> that were intended to pay a variety of benefits and wages may be kept at the cash desk more than the established limit.  But the storage period of these payments can not exceed three days, taking into account the day of receipt of funds in a banking institution. </p><p>  On January 1, 2012, new rules came into effect that relate to <span>cash transactions,</span> now the cash management procedure is regulated by Regulation No. 373-P of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation of 12.10.11.  According to this provision, both organizations and <span>individual entrepreneurs,</span> whose activity involves the use of cash, must maintain a cash register for all the requirements of the above provision.  Accordingly, correctly setting the cash register limit. </p><p>  Previously, according to the regulation that was valid until January 1, the cash desk limit was set by the bank.  With the introduction of the new rules, the question arises of who sets the cash limit now.  And now, each company or individual entrepreneur himself must establish for himself a limit of funds that can be stored at the cash desk.  At the same time, it is not necessary to coordinate this amount with a bank or some other regulatory body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cash limit can be calculated in several ways described in Regulation 373-p. </p><p>  The first concerns those who in the process of work have constant cash receipts.  First, they need to determine the period for which the cash desk limit will be calculated (month, quarter, etc.).  Then designate the billing period to determine the limit amount that can remain at the cash desk.  This period according to the Regulation cannot be more than 92 days, but not calendar, but days, which, according <span>to the work schedule of the</span> organization or entrepreneur, are working.  Moreover, you can choose the most profitable period: the same period last year;  the period preceding the time for which the cash desk limit is made;  period with maximum revenue, etc. </p><p>  Once this is determined, a selection of cash is made and all received amounts of cash are summed up.  Next, it should be determined after how many days the cashier or other authorized person will hand over the surplus funds to banking institutions.  But it should be remembered that the frequency of such surrenders should not exceed seven days. </p><p>  Having decided on all the above points, you can proceed to the calculation itself.  To do this, the total amount of cash for the selected period must be divided by the number of workers in the organization for days for the same period and the result should be multiplied by the number of days through which cash delivery will take place.  The amount received in the end will be the cash limit. </p><p>  The second method is used by organizations and individual entrepreneurs who have no cash proceeds.  That is, cash only comes from <span>settlement accounts.</span>  In this case, as in the previous one, it is necessary to choose a period for setting the cash limit.  Choose a billing period, which also cannot be more than 92 days.  Determine the amount of expenses for the selected period and the number of days that elapse between the receipt of cash from the organization‚Äôs accounts in banking institutions. </p><p>  Next, the cash limit is calculated: the amount of cash received for a certain time (not including salaries, benefits, scholarships, etc. payments) is divided by the number of working days chosen for calculation and multiplied by the number of days in the intervals between which there will be receipt of cash by check. </p><p>  A clear form for calculating the cash limit is not stipulated by the regulation, therefore it is drawn up in any form.  The calculated cash limit is drawn up by order of the head of the organization or <span>private entrepreneur</span> in any form. </p>
