    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Jimmy Savile was born in Leeds in a large family, where he was the youngest, seventh child.  During World War II, Savile worked in coal mines, and also began to try himself as a DJ.  Music played a very important role in his life, but Savile was interested in other things, including sports.  He participated in bicycle tournaments, ran in a marathon, and also wrestled on a professional level. </p><p>  Savile built a stunning career first on the radio, thanks to the mega-pop show Top of the Pops, and then through successful television projects.  Savil died in 2011, presumably from pneumonia. </p>

    <h2>  Work with the Air Force </h2><p>  Since 1958, Savile began working at Radio Luxembourg, where he led his own program.  Over time, he switches to the Air Force radio, where he continues to work on a variety of music shows.  Later, he launches other projects on the same radio, so for many Savile, BBC words become inseparable, since almost all successful projects on BBC Radio 1 belonged to Savil.  His success in Britain was so great that only a few years later he became the face and hallmark of the Air Force. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few years later, a very successful morning show was also launched, where Savile acted as the host of the program.  On this show, he used old hits, which was the first program of his kind. </p>

    <h2>  Participation in other projects </h2><p>  In 1987, after 19 years of working with the Air Force, he leaves the company and begins to work with other British radio stations in almost the same format in which he worked for the Air Force.  In parallel, he also participated in various television projects, all of which were megapopular in Britain.  For his work, he was even awarded the title of Knight of the Order of Malta from the Queen. </p><p>  In addition, Sir Jimmy Savile launched a series of public service commercials that warned of the importance of road safety.  The Clunk Click Every Trip video was especially successful, the words of which, every British, no doubt knew.  This later became the basis for his Saturday night show, which was followed by others.  In 2007, he launched a new project, which not only repeated the success of previous shows, but even beat him.  Almost until the end of his days, Jimmy Savile remained at the peak of popularity. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top of the pops" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39405/1062742.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Savile has never been married.  In addition, almost all his life he lived in his mother‚Äôs apartment.  Savil continued to monitor her mother‚Äôs bedroom, as well as her wardrobe even after her death.  Her bedroom was regularly cleaned and all her clothes were cleaned once a year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Savil never made his personal life public.  Although he repeatedly mentioned close relations with a sufficiently large number of people of the opposite sex, he did not mention any specific names. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of the scandal </h2><p>  A year after Savile's death, a big scandal erupted in the UK, caused by the TV presenter's allegations of sexual harassment of children.  Such information appeared after journalists of the famous Newsnight program began to claim that the Air Force leadership had forbidden them to shoot shows about Savile's life, in preparation for which facts of sexual violence surfaced on his part. </p><p>  After this, testimonies of women began to appear, which claimed that in the 60-70s, as children, they became victims of sexual abuse by Savile.  After the British television company showed a documentary about Savile's pedophilic inclinations, Scotland Yard, who began his investigation, became interested in these facts.  The Air Force also took up the investigation.  According to police, several hundred children were affected by Savile's actions, which shocked not only Britain, but the whole world. </p><h2>  Air force role </h2><p>  After Savila's sexual assault facts appeared in the media, Air Force Director General George Entouisl was urgently summoned to the Committee on Culture and the Press to provide an explanation.  In his speech, he apologized for the situation.  According to him, there was undeniable evidence of the crimes of Savile, who had long been the face of the Air Force.  He also said that the former management of the company knew about this, but covered Savil, because he did not want to spoil the reputation of the channel.  Moreover, many rape attempts were made directly in the dressing rooms of the company. </p><p>  Given the monstrous scale of Savile's crimes, government officials announced that this case would be public in nature.  After that, new facts of Savile's crimes surfaced, the number of which is increasing to this day.  This scandal affected the reputation of the Air Force company very badly. </p>

    <h2>  Victims of Savile </h2><p>  Following the shocking information, Jimmy Savile and his victims became the main topics of discussion in the press and television.  The facts confirm that the victims of Savile most often were children from vulnerable sections of the population who could not fend for themselves.  Often these were orphans from orphanages, as well as patients from hospitals and clinics.  Moreover, even the bodies of dead children and elderly people, to whom Savil gained access, were abused. </p><p>  According to police, Jimmy Savile had been working with the Department of Health for 50 years and used charity to search for his victims.  He committed acts of rape in 28 medical-type facilities, where more than a hundred people aged 5 to 75 years suffered from his hands.  Moreover, clinic staff were also raped.  Sometimes this happened directly in the medical wards or in the corridors. </p><p>  Despite the fact that many victims reported this to their parents, they contacted the police, as well as directly to the administration of the clinic, no investigations have been undertaken against Savil.  Most likely, this was due to his connection with the Air Force and the police.  At first Savil came to hospitals and an orphanage as a specialist in sound warning systems, and after his successful career he was warmly welcomed as a celebrity.  After Savile spent over $ 3 million on charity, the doors of almost all clinics were opened for him. </p><p>  According to the testimony of witnesses, Savil also boasted that he had sexual relations with dead bodies and liked to take ‚Äúgifts‚Äù for memory of this.  In particular, he had several rings, where instead of stones, glass eyes were used, which were torn from the eye sockets of the dead, with whom he had sexual intercourse.  Savil committed these crimes when he was already over 80 years old. </p><p>  To date, the number of victims of Savile has exceeded 500. Among his victims are representatives of different sexes, ages and social classes.  The investigation of Savile's crimes by the police continues today. </p>
