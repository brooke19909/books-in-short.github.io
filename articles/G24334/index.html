Handicraftsmen and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãpebbles</span> and shells did not pass their attention.  From smooth details you can create original crafts, beautiful pictures, arrange a mirror and flower pots.  People with artistic abilities cover stones and shells with delicate ornaments. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for crafts made of stone and sea shells, which are necessary for creating such compositions; step-by-step instructions for each work are given. </p><h2>  Seabed dwellers </h2><p>  Such an original picture can be designed using natural material too - saw cut wood.  You can not remove the bark.  So the work will look more natural.  Colorful stones are made of stones, and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãshells</span> cover the sandy bottom.  For attaching materials use transparent super glue.  Before starting the stone crafts, you need to rinse all the material under wastewater and boil it in the pan for 10 minutes.  Excess salt will come out of stones and shells in this way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="picture on a tree cut" class="if uuid-2339417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339417.jpg"></div><p>  Before sawing, the tree cut is also cleaned with sandpaper No. 100. Then dust and sawdust are removed with a dry rag and the surface is first coated with acrylic paints.  After painting on the pile, the pile rises again, so again the surface is treated with sandpaper, but smaller - No. 80. Then the surface is coated with blue paint again.  Algae are drawn on the bottom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then work begins on the creation of fish from sea stones.  One large stone and two small ones for the tail are selected for each instance.  Fish are colored differently.  Each master chooses a drawing at will.  After the fish have dried, they are finally covered with a layer of acrylic varnish.  At the bottom of the crafts made of stones, shells are glued.  For crafts, you can use any, but the shells of rapans will look beautiful, as in the photo in the article.  To make the shells shine, they are also opened with acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Tulips from stones </h2><p>  The next stone work is a picture with flowers.  Tulips are made up of three petals.  Two are rounded and the center is small.  When collecting material, you need to think through the plot of the picture in advance and select the pebbles that are suitable in shape.  Long stems are made of newspaper tubes.  To make them, you need to wind paper onto a thin needle, and stick the last turn on PVA glue.  All parts are also painted with acrylic paints.  The tubes can be sprayed with spray paint. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stone tulips" class="if uuid-2339418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339418.jpg"></div><p>  That the petals that the leaves are painted in two colors.  The main color and tint, which should be a little darker.  Streaks are drawn on the leaves with light green paint with a thin brush.  The bottom of the stone crafts is made out of dried moss.  If the stones are glued to a glue gun or transparent super glue, then the moss will perfectly fix on PVA. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mirror Framing </h2><p>  If you brought home souvenirs in the form of sea pebbles and beautiful shells after a vacation on the sea coast, you can update the <span>old mirror in a wooden frame.</span>  You will need small pebbles that are glued to the surface of the mirror from the inside.  Before work, be sure to boil the elements to remove excess salt.  For this craft of sea stones, use a glue gun, then the parts will hold tight to the smooth surface of the mirror. </p><div class="photo" data-original="za.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frame of a mirror made of shells and stones" class="if uuid-2339423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339423.jpg"></div><p>  Shells are selected relatively the same in shape and size.  They make out the outer edge of the frame.  On the corners you can place thin and long details, if any are at your disposal.  If desired, all the details can be painted or painted on shells with a small ornament. </p><h2>  Drawing on stones </h2><p>  Sea stones have a smooth and even surface structure, they can be applied to different images, using as a canvas for creative ideas.  It can be a funny face or landscape, a portrait and a silhouette of an animal.  Depending on the shape of the stone, the theme of crafts made of sea stones is also chosen.  With your own hands, using the thinnest brush, apply small details, shadows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawing on stones" class="if uuid-2339427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339427.jpg"></div><p>  You can simply colorize it with patterns.  They can consist of simple, dashed or wavy lines, circles and dots.  Drawing on stones will be interesting for both adults and children.  It doesn't matter which drawing is done.  It can be a professional painting by a miniaturist artist or an awkward childish drawing.  You can decorate your own stone crafts to decorate a flower bed or garden path by drawing simple ladybugs.  Even a person who has never done drawing before will cope with such a task.  For this purpose, use larger parts.  You can cover them with paint only on the upper side, since the lower one will be on the ground. </p><h2>  Coffee table decoration </h2><p>  You can create a coffee table as one of the original crafts from shells and stones with your own hands.  To do this, you can use the old table in which the countertop is removed.  A piece of plywood is nailed from below, onto which various beautiful shells, pebbles of an unusual shape and color are placed in free order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homebnc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="table decoration with stones and shells" class="if uuid-2339450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339450.jpg"></div><p>  It is advisable to select rare items, then such a showcase will look spectacular.  Such tables are usually made artificial aging.  First, the surface is treated with a hard metal brush to clean off all the soft layers of wood.  It is recommended that after an iron brush, a stiff plastic one be walked again.  Then the surface is opened with paint and smoothed out with the smallest sandpaper. </p><p>  To make all the beauty visible, a glass countertop is used instead of wooden.  It is located on the suction cups attached to each corner of the table.  Her form depends on the desire of the hostess and the future location of the table in the room. </p><h2>  Candlesticks made of stones </h2><p>  From <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãpebbles you</span> get a beautiful candlestick.  The base is a metal cover from the can.  This will be the safest option, although you can use other pallets.  After processing, stones are attached to the glue gun, they must be placed around the circumference of the layers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stone lamps" class="if uuid-2339456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339456.jpg"></div><p>  There should be at least three rows in height so that the candle stand completely hides behind them.  It‚Äôs better not to paint the handmade stones made of sea stones with paints, since this is unsafe, because a fire will burn nearby. </p><h2>  Flower pot decoration </h2><p>  At the cottage or on the balcony you can decorate flower pots with pebbles brought from the sea coast.  It is advisable to take a clay or ceramic pot as a basis, since a plastic base will not work at all.  The stones are rather heavy, and plastic is a moving material and can be deformed due to gravity.  In this case, the stones may fall off.  Parts are glued only with a glue gun, since other glue will not withstand such parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stone flower pots" class="if uuid-2339471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2339471.jpg"></div><p>  As can be seen in the photo, stone crafts can be painted in different colors.  Both natural stone and painted will look beautiful.  You can even create a very bright and unusual pot in which colors alternate in layers, or in a chaotic manner.  In order for the elements to sparkle beautifully, you need to coat the parts with acrylic varnish after painting. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The article presents only a few options for making crafts from sea pebbles and a variety of shells collected on the sandy shore.
