    <h2>  Marking </h2><p>  This is a pretty simple task.  You must choose the equipment on which the class A, A +, A ++ or A +++ markings are located.  In order to calculate energy efficiency, it is necessary to summarize the operating mode and certain technical characteristics that correspond to this type of equipment. </p><p>  For example, you can consider the energy consumption for a washing machine.  How to do it?  It is necessary to calculate the maximum load and energy consumption, which corresponds to the hour of work.  If we consider the oven, then the consumption of electricity will depend on power and volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  To effectively save electricity, you need to deal with technical specifications.  For example, air conditioners need to consider 3 parameters: </p><ul><li>  channels that are located in the split system; </li><li>  the presence or absence of water cooling; </li><li>  the presence of heating. </li></ul><p>  Classes of <span>energy efficiency</span> for household and office equipment in Russia - 7, and in the USA and Europe - 10. These indicators need to be paid attention to when choosing any equipment.  All energy efficiency classes are shown on the label. </p><p>  What do the different types of markings correspond to? </p><ul><li>  The letter A, A +, A ++ or A +++ indicates that the energy consumption is 45% less than that of a conventional device.  This marking is placed on high-quality and energy-efficient equipment that can last about 15 years. </li><li>  The letters B and C indicate a less efficient technique that consumes 25% (for B) and 5% (for C) less electricity than a standard technique. </li><li>  The letters D and E correspond to average energy efficiency.  Electricity costs will correspond to standard appliances (for D).  Equipment labeled E consumes 10% more than conventional equipment. </li><li>  The last class is uneconomical equipment.  Devices marked F and G will consume 25% more than standard counterparts. </li></ul>

These devices try to make them consume as little electricity as possible.  All modern household and office equipment is created taking into account this parameter.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to the energy efficiency class of office and household appliances, choosing equipment. </p><p>  As we already found out earlier, this information is made out in the form of a sticker on which there is a bright table with all the values.  Usually glue it on the front side of the device. </p><p>  If you choose the right technique, then you can choose economical equipment without any problems.  Remember that the classification is the same for any appliance, but consumption rates may vary slightly.  Therefore, when buying, it is worth considering a table of energy efficiency classes of equipment. </p><h2>  Marking in the EU countries </h2><p>  <span>Energy efficiency classes</span> were originally created in the European Union.  Based on their information, some countries began to independently develop their estimates for technology.  But this did not become an obstacle to the spread of the European system.  Now on the vast majority of various devices you can see the European markings.  It was introduced on the basis of studies by the EU Commission on Transport and Energy.  Russia also adopted the developments that were made in the EU countries. </p><p>  Such a step in effective <span>energy consumption</span> has many positive factors: </p><ul><li>  people can save, as this will reduce utility costs; </li><li>  the state will be able to save resources and budget; </li><li>  this way you can save the environment; </li><li>  energy companies will reduce production costs; </li><li>  the most important thing is that you can reduce the use of natural resources. </li></ul><h2>  Energy efficient household appliances </h2><p>  Class A <span>energy-saving equipment is</span> fairly common on the market.  This contributed to the fact that some foreign companies introduced new designations for their equipment, namely: A +, A ++ and A +++. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cooling technology </h2><p>  Today, on any high-quality cooling equipment, you can see that manufacturers are depicting an energy efficiency index on the label.  What does it depend on?  It is calculated from the <span>percentage of energy consumed per year and energy consumption for a conventional device of the same type.</span> </p><p>  At the same time, in order to calculate the average electricity consumption, it is necessary to take into account the volume of the chambers, as well as additional characteristics: defrosting and temperature conditions.  Also on the marking you can see the volume of the working compartments. </p><p>  The following parameters should be shown on the refrigerator label: </p><ul><li>  Trademark and manufacturer. </li><li>  To identify the technique, a special code must be displayed. </li><li>  The energy consumption of this model for a certain period. </li><li>  The manufacturer must indicate the volume of compartments in which the operating temperature is more than 6 degrees. </li><li>  Storage volume in places where the operating temperature is less than 6 degrees.  These compartments should be marked with asterisks. </li><li>  Of course, the energy efficiency class must be indicated. </li><li>  Noise level of equipment at work. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Washing machines </h2><p>  On washing machines you can see different types of markings.  What does each of them correspond to? </p><p>  Until 2010, energy efficiency was based on washing in the "Cotton 60 degrees" mode.  This must be taken into account when the drum is fully loaded.  Manufacturers had to fix how much energy is spent for 1 hour of work when washing one kilogram of laundry.  It was also necessary to consider that the initial temperature is 15 degrees. </p><p>  Later, a directive appeared, according to which it was customary to take into account annual electricity consumption.  It is necessary to monitor the consumption of electricity in operation mode and in <span>standby mode.</span>  Energy efficiency should be calculated based on 220 washes per year.  Of course, they should be performed at different types of load, that is, 42% - washing at full load and 60 degrees, 29% - incomplete loading, half of which occurs at 60 degrees, 29% - incomplete loading, but washing at 40 degrees.  Equipment that meets Class A consumes less than 340 kW per year. </p>

    <h2>  Office household special equipment.  Energy efficiency class </h2><p>  Unfortunately, today there are no tables of energy classes that are suitable for each office appliance.  This can be explained by the fact that this type of technology is very diverse.  In this wide assortment there is a rather large variation in the technical parameters and direction of a particular device. </p><p>  How to determine the energy efficiency class of office appliances?  To <span>reduce <span>power consumption,</span> you need to choose modern models of office equipment.</span>  Each new generation consumes less electricity, but surpasses older models in technical specifications.  For example, monitors with a radiation tube need to be exchanged for modern LED screens, which consume much less electricity. </p><p>  The energy efficiency class of a computer is difficult to determine, since it depends on many details.  It should be remembered that gaming laptops will consume much more power than budget models.  But this does not mean that new and expensive components will not be effective and reliable. </p><p>  The energy efficiency class of a computer is more determined by the power supply.  That is why a certification program was developed for them.  Now it is recommended to buy power supplies on which the marking is indicated - 80 PLUS.  Remember, the higher this value, the more economical and reliable this part is. </p>

Of course, if the necessary types do not have the appropriate marking, then it is better to choose a new technique.  It is usually quite effective, powerful and consumes little energy.  For example, if you want to choose a printer, then you need to look at the table of energy efficiency classes of the printer.  Thus, you can choose a quality model. </p>
