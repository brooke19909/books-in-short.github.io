Such accuracy in the figures is not without reason; it carries the memory of the number of days that the war lasted.  Multiple fountains, which are also 1148, are illuminated in the evening by red lights and create the appropriate atmosphere.

    <p>  Once upon a time there was the most ordinary grove in which it was customary to carry out the royal hunt for falcons, hence the name - Sokolniki.  Now it is a landscaped park with alleys and ennobled plantings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A vacation spot for everyone </h2><p>  Sokolniki Park was created for people with different interests.  Here, cyclists and scooters move along special paths, and for those who are walking, there are alleys that are lined with stone or pavers.  By the way, both rollers and a bicycle can be rented in the park, so it is not necessary to carry all the equipment with you.  If you decide to take a walk in the winter, then <span>skiing</span> and ice skating are popular here. </p>

    <p>  There are several venues where organized concerts are held, fans of extreme relaxation can try their hand at endurance and climb a climbing wall or go karting.  In the park you can shoot archery or crossbow, play tennis or billiards, and if you want, then swim in the pool.  For sports enthusiasts, fitness facilities are equipped here.  Children will be interested in horseback riding or ponies. </p><p>  And Sokolniki Park is a paradise for children.  There are multiple swing-carousels, attractions, playgrounds, including a games room in the open.  You can go for a walk in a small zoo or jump on plenty of trampolines. </p><p>  The diversity that is inherent in this park is quite difficult to describe, so it's best to see everything with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Hiding place </h2><p>  The big city always remains noisy, vibrant and too crowded.  Being in such an atmosphere around the clock, you involuntarily think about how to escape to some quiet and secluded place for at least a few hours.  This is true for the inhabitants of such a metropolis as <span>Moscow.</span>  Gorky <span>Culture Park</span> - this is exactly the place that will hide you from the bustle of days. </p>

    <p>  The wildlife here is very developed, and this despite the fact that the park is located within the boundaries of a large city.  Its most affable and friendly inhabitants are squirrels.  They meet you at the very entrance and during the whole walk appear on one tree, then on another.  Every child loves animals, all the more so cute and fluffy, and to see squirrels in their natural habitats is much more interesting than in a zoo. </p><p>  Also, many squirrels can be found at their feeding places, they are almost all tame.  Here they are not offended, they are used to people and come so close that they will jump into their arms very soon.  There is a wonderful attraction in the park - this is Kuzminki's estate.  In summer, you can admire amazing floral arrangements, and in winter it is customary to skate.  Now you know where to take a walk in Moscow.  In the parks, time will fly by quickly. </p>
