    <h2>  Kit </h2><p>  Sony Ericsson J10i2 for sale in a box of recycled paper.  It is small and looks more compact than other models.  There are no paper manuals that are practically unreadable by users.  By reducing the use of paper, the manufacturer was able to save more than one tree, which he described on his website. </p><p>  There are few accessories in the kit.  It includes: phone, battery, charger and headset.  I must say that the headset is the simplest, there are not even buttons for switching tracks in the player.  The package also contains a small paper bag that can be used as a cover.  In some regions of Russia, the kit also includes a 4 GB memory card. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The front side of the Sony Ericsson J10i2 is made in the classic style that is inherent in many models of the company.  The user is greeted by a black candy bar in which there are no frills.  Some scold Sony Ericsson J10i2 for the lack of exquisite lines and strong simplicity.  Just look at the phone from the side and you can understand that not everything here is so bad.  The case of Sony Ericsson J10i2 is made uneven.  Its middle part is the thickest (14 mm), slightly smaller towards the bottom, the top is made as thin as possible (9 mm).  Thanks to this structure, the model is more convenient to hold in your hand than conventional mobile phones.  Transitions are made smooth and even, which improves tactile sensations.  However, not everyone can like this design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The back cover is made of thin aluminum, which covers the frame of recycled plastic.  It is painted in silver color, which dilutes the officiality of the Sony Ericsson J10i2 Elm.  At the bottom there are small indentations that are part of the design.  They do not interfere with the device slipping out of the hand. </p><p>  The basis of the case was recycled plastic, which the manufacturer makes emphasis, describing its goods.  In appearance and touch, it does not differ from that used in budget-level devices.  But the Sony Ericsson J10i2 is a little taller, so the buyer wants to get something more worthwhile. </p><p>  The dimensions do not differ much from other candy phones, just that the length is a little longer.  You can‚Äôt call it ultra-thin, but it feels rather light in the hand.  The mobile phone is sold in two colors: black and pink.  The second option may appeal to the female gender.  It is comfortable in the hand, the corners do not press on the palm of the hand, the phone does not want to be thrown away after several minutes of use.  The case is assembled efficiently, there are no backlashes, the panels do not collect fingerprints, despite the material of manufacture. </p>

    <h2>  Keyboard Sony Ericsson J10i2 </h2><p>  Firmware for the phone, by the way, is on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, you can download it for free, the device is flashed in a few minutes.  The keyboard is set to the largest possible size.  It comes close to the edges of the case, which makes it convenient to use.  The keys are separated only horizontally by small grooves.  Made of soft plastic, which is rough to the touch.  It is difficult to mistakenly press another key.  There is a five-position control key, the end and call buttons are made smoother so that you can distinguish blindly.  In addition, the developer managed to accommodate two more buttons: quick access to the menu and erasing the text. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the right side there is a volume rocker and a camera activation key.  She works here in two positions - focusing and taking a picture.  Located comfortably, pleasant to the touch. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  A 1000 mAh battery is installed.  The manufacturer promises up to 10 hours of talk time and 430 in standby time.  Phone with short conversations, Wi-Fi turned on and several hours of Internet per day is able to work up to 3 days.  In gentle mode, it can be active for almost a week.  Autonomy is quite acceptable for this type of battery. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The Sony Ericsson J10i2 display is made using TFT technology.  The 2.2-inch diagonal has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels.  A special glass is installed that protects against scratches and other damage.  Contrast and color reproduction are at a high level.  Viewing angles are not very large.  Even with a slight deviation of the screen, fading occurs.  We read the text, but the colors are very distorted.  An <span>ambient light sensor is</span> installed that monitors the backlight level of the screen and keyboard. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device has a 5-megapixel camera with autofocus.  There is a flash that is used when recording movies as a backlight.  By the way, it can be used as a flashlight.  The maximum resolution of photographs is 2592 x 1944 pixels.  The same interface is used as in previous models of the line.  The entire screen acts as a viewfinder.  Above it are the control and settings buttons.  The approach is carried out by means of the volume rocker.  Button "0" gives all the information about the features of shooting. </p>

    <p>  There are four modes: smile recognition, frame, panoramic and standard shooting.  There is a timer and settings for firing the built-in flash. </p><p>  In video shooting mode, there are significantly fewer settings.  The maximum resolution at which you can record is 640 x 480 pixels.  The clips are saved in MP4 format. </p><p>  Using the camera is easy.  The quality of the pictures is at a high level. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The phone has 270 MB of memory, which can be slightly expanded by deleting some files.  You can install memory cards (the device supports microSD) up to 16 GB.  The slot is located under the back cover.  For installation, you do not need to remove the battery and turn off the phone, which greatly simplifies the task.  For most purposes, a 4 GB card (video, games, photos, music) will be enough.  The amount of free memory is displayed in the gallery of the device. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  A standard port is used to connect wired devices.  Moreover, it is one for everything in the device (charger, headphones, connection to a personal computer).  When connected to a PC, you can select the use mode - drive or player.  Works seamlessly with all operating systems.  Of the wireless interfaces there is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  They work stably, without disconnection. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Sony Ericsson J10i2 turned out to be typical for a Japanese company.  At the time of the release of the phone, the company was going through hard times, and the new model became a breath of fresh air.  Of course, the price in Russia is quite overpriced and amounts to about 10,000 rubles.  The phone did not receive the necessary advertising, so it was noticed only by true fans of SE.  In terms of housing, the model is unlikely to stand out, but not every phone in this price category has a Wi-Fi module. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  mineral glass; </li><li>  the presence of Wi-Fi; </li><li>  good camera; </li><li>  the presence of aluminum; </li><li>  high-quality assembly. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  inexpensive plastic; </li><li>  high price; </li><li>  lack of microUSB port. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Users respond positively about the model.  Sony Ericsson Elm J10i2, according to many, has received everything necessary for comfortable use.  Pleases buyers price.  The phone is stable and leaves a good impression.  It performs well during prolonged use, without letting the owner down. </p>
