One-step craquelure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, this type of decorating things like decoupage is gaining more and more popularity.  Especially in combination with craquelure.  How can you start your work if you are new to this business? </p><h2>  What is craquelure? </h2><p>  Craquelure is a term that is used in painting.  These are such fairly small cracks that form on the surface of the paintings over time.  It can be said a sign of old age.  Previously, masters tried to avoid this symptom in every possible way.  They tried to create such compositions of paints in order to delay the appearance of unfortunate cracks by all means.  But in the world, everything is changing.  And now craquelure is no longer a sign of old age, but a distinguishing feature of antiquity.  Modern artists create it purposefully in order to give things the effect of luxurious antiquity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="craquelure is" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701032.jpg" width="600"></div>  For this, a huge number of special tools and materials have been created.  Aging of not only souvenirs, but also furniture, as well as doors and windows, has come into fashion.  What can I say.  Even special plaster has been created to reproduce craquelure on walls or ceilings.  Craquelure is often used in decoupage.  A master class on the creation of such things will be discussed in this article.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is decoupage? </h2><p>  Decoupage is a way to decorate an item with paper clippings.  This skill was born in ancient China and then spread throughout.  After all, this is a great way to decorate objects with a pattern for those who can not draw.  Today, decoupage has been improved so much that it is almost impossible to distinguish from a drawing.  To age this or that product, masters use <span>the decoupage technique.</span>  Craquelure is the final element.  He seems to put an end to the work and adds to the things decorated in this way, luxury. </p><h2>  What do you need for work? </h2><p>  If you are a beginner and for the first time decide to try craquelure in decoupage, a master class is simply necessary for you.  It will also be useful to get acquainted with the list of used materials and tools.  So, what you need for decoupage.  Firstly, glue.  Well, if it is special, but diluted PVA is also suitable.  Secondly, you need sharp scissors and napkins for decoupage.  In addition, you will need acrylic paints, base coat, varnish to complete the job, hair dryer and brushes of various shapes and sizes.  Well and, undoubtedly, the subject itself, which you are going to decorate.  But, since we will talk about how to use craquelure in decoupage, the master class in our article also provides for the presence of a crackle.  This, in fact, is the tool that will serve to form cracks. </p><h2>  What happens krakele? </h2><p>  Crackle, or cracking agent, can be of several types.  But the main of them are considered only two: single-phase and two-component.  If you use the first option, then the napkin will need to be glued after its application.  Cracks formed in this way will shine through the pattern.  A two-component substance is used after gluing the pattern: first one layer of the substance is applied to the pattern, then the next, and cracks that have formed after applying the second layer will also require mashing.  A two-component craquelure is a more difficult option for a beginner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  One-step craquelure </h2><p>  A single-phase substance is located in the work between the layers of acrylic paint.  First you cover the work with the color that future cracks should have, then a single-phase layer is applied over the entire surface or only where the cracks should be.  And after that, apply that paint, which should be the main background of the work.  After the surface has dried, the background will crack and the lower color will come out.  After the manifestation of all cracks, you can proceed to gluing the selected tissue motifs.  Such cracks do not require grouting, and they shine through your drawing if they are made on the entire surface to be decorated. </p><h2>  Two-component craquelure </h2><p>  A two-component product is used, in contrast to the previous one, after painting and gluing drawings.  Already from its name it is clear that it consists of two substances.  The first is applied to the surface of the decorated object with a thin layer and dried to a sticky state.  Then it is covered with a second substance from above.  Moreover, the thicker the second layer, the larger cracks form as a result.  All the resulting cracks are wiped using various materials.  The most commonly used gold and silver powders.  But there are also multi-colored powder pigments. </p><h2>  PVA Craquelure </h2><p>  It is not always possible to purchase special materials for craquelure.  In this case, ordinary PVA glue will come to your aid.  The principle of operation is the same as with a single-component tool.  Between layers of paint glue is applied.  The thicker the layer, the larger the cracks.  Dry slightly with a hairdryer.  As a result, the glue should be crusted on top, but inside it should remain moist.  Then the background paint is applied and dried with a hairdryer.  The result is cracks.  Of course, the PVA craquelure is less elegant, but it also looks very interesting.  Here, as in all types of needlework, training is important. </p><h2>  What can be decorated with decoupage and craquelure? </h2><p>  In your wonderful decoupage technique, all your creative originality will certainly manifest.  Indeed, in such a kind of simple way, you can create unique interior gizmos.  In the decoupage technique using craquelure, <span>decorative plates,</span> watches and especially caskets look great.  You can create wonderful kitchen sets or originally decorate the desktop in your office.  In general, decoupage and craquelure - <span>this</span> is <span>an unbridled</span> flight of your imagination. </p><h2>  Master class on creating watches using decoupage technique using craquelure </h2><p>  Consider how to make a unique new watch out of an old unwanted plate using the decoupage technique.  In this case, a one-step craquelure will perfectly complement the finished product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="craquelure in decoupage master class" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701033.jpg" width="500"></div>  In addition to the materials described above for decoupage and craquelure, you will need an old flat plate, <span>clockwork,</span> drill and drill for a ceramic surface. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Drill a hole in the center of your plate into which the clockwork will later be inserted.  Degrease the surface thoroughly, cover it in two layers with <span>acrylic primer.</span>  Each layer should dry well.  If any irregularities are suddenly formed during the application of the primer, you can remove them with a little sandpaper and then cover them a second time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pkra craquelure" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701099.jpg" width="276"></div>  Now take a napkin, tear it so that you get a round shape.  Separate all unnecessary layers, and one, with a pattern, glue in the center of the plate. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now we will figure out how to make a craquelure.  Take the paint brighter or darker (as you like), apply it along the edge of the plate around the glued motif.  Use a special sponge or just a piece of sponge so that the coating is even.  Experiment with colors and shades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage craquelure" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701101.jpg" width="267"></div>  You can use one color, or you can, as in this case, mix three or more at once.  Try closer to the center to use a lighter tone. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Dry the painted surface thoroughly using a hair dryer, and then apply one-component craquelure to one layer with a brush. </p>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-step craquelure" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701100.jpg" width="266"></div>  Dry the varnish slightly and apply a top coat of paint.  To do this, add a little yellow to the white paint.  When applying paint, do not touch the sponge twice in the same place. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make craquelure" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701102.jpg" width="267"></div>  After drying completely, rub the pastel into the cracks, and you can even use eye shadow if you donâ€™t have any pastels.  Try to achieve rainbow colors, but not very saturated.  Let them have a translucent effect. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage one-step craquelure" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/701098.jpg" width="267"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now separate the individual elements from the napkin and glue them over the craquelure along the edge of the plate.  Do not forget the dial.  You can use special <span>decoupage cards</span> with his image, or you can just draw it yourself.  Or stick some small decorations instead of numbers.  In order not to be mistaken, select them based on the interior and theme of your room.  Add decorative elements to your liking.  To attach them, use hot melt glue or other quick-drying glue that can hold them well on the surface of the watch.  Screw the mechanism, insert the battery, and you can enjoy the brand new little thing. </p><p>  So, we were convinced that with the help of decoupage and craquelure it is possible to make something useful, and most importantly, completely individual, from the old and <span>unnecessary things</span> .  Do not be afraid of experiments.  Indeed, in such a business as needlework, sometimes the most grandiose masterpieces are born from completely unexpected experiments.  Unleash your imagination, and it certainly will not disappoint you. </p>
