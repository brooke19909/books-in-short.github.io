  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bolshoy Ustinsky bridge in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the twentieth century, the level of the Moskva River dropped significantly and the problem of water shortage arose in the city.  The Moscow-Volga canal, built in the 30s, helped solve this problem and the water level in the river increased.  However, this necessitated the construction of new bridges to ensure shipping.  This was carried out in accordance with the Stalin Master Plan for the reconstruction and development of Moscow.  Literally in a year and a half, several unique bridges were built, including the Bolshoy Ustinsky bridge connecting Yauzsky Boulevard with Sadovnichesky passage. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.747248825142954" data-lng="37.639210144444746" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/2/9/6/3296.png"></div><h2>  Old bridge </h2><p>  The first Ustinsky bridge in Moscow was built in 1881. It was slightly lower downstream than the modern one.  The construction of the bridge was supervised by engineer V. Speiner.  The metal structure was supported by two stone bulls equipped with ice cutters.  A new road was laid to the bridge, and a bustling market was organized near it.  Rails were laid for public transport of that time - the horses.  Subsequently, these rails were replaced by tram rails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Ustinsky bridge" class="if uuid-2474036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72794/2474036.jpg"></div><h2>  Big Ustinsky bridge </h2><p>  In 1938, according to the project of designer V. Vakhurkin and architects G. Goltz and V. Sobolev, a new bridge was built upstream.  Its steel structure is supported by underground supports and gives the impression of floating in the air.  The bridge is 134 m long and 34 m wide. The total weight of the structure is 2.2 thousand tons.  The project also envisaged the construction of a lighthouse tower, but it was not built.  Tram rails were preserved on the bridge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A little higher than the bridge, on Moskvoretskaya embankment, is the pier "Big Ustinsky bridge".  From there, you can take a variety of excursions along the Moscow River.  This pier is very easy to reach; the Kitai-Gorod metro station is located nearby.  There is a parking lot near the pier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="view-photo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ustinsky bridge in the evening" class="if uuid-2474056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72794/2474056.jpg"></div><h2>  Annushka </h2><p>  In 1911, a tram was launched along the Bolshoi Ustinsky Bridge.  The route began at the <span>Yauza Gate,</span> passed along the <span>Boulevard Ring</span> and the Kremlin, Moskvoretskaya and Prechistenskaya embankments.  Tram passengers could admire Moscow sights and beauties.  From the window of the tram you can see the monuments to Gogol and Pushkin, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, views of the Kremlin.  The conductor on this route was the writer K. Paustovsky.  This tram is mentioned in the novel by M. Bulgakov "The Master and Margarita".  Now several Annushka trams have been converted into cafes and you can take a pleasant tour of Moscow.  A variety of holidays and corporate evenings are held there. </p><h2>  Yauzsky Boulevard </h2><p>  On Yauzsky Boulevard, several interesting historical places have survived to our days.  The large house No. 2/16 (built in 1936 by the architect Golosov) became popular after the release of the film "Pokrovsky Gate".  Not far from this house is the house of son-in-law M.I.Kutuzov, General Khitrovo.  Now there is a medical school.  The general received permission to organize a market for trade in vegetables and meat.  So the famous Khitrov market arose, which became a brothel for tramps, beggars and runaway convicts.  The famous Khitrovka was described in the books of Gilyarovsky and Korolenko.  Artists of the Moscow Art Theater rallied in the Katorga tavern to study the life of tramps for Gorky's play ‚ÄúAt the Bottom‚Äù. All the houses in the district were turned into shelters and brought huge income.  After the revolution, part of the shelters were destroyed, and part were turned into communal apartments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="road-movie.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House on Yauzsky Boulevard" class="if uuid-2474048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72794/2474048.jpg"></div><p>  In Peter and Paul Lane you can see the Church of Peter and Paul on Kulishki with a bell tower in 1772. There is also a small house of a priest. </p><p>  It is impossible not to mention the house that completes the prospect on <span>Kotelnicheskaya embankment.</span>  This is one of the famous Moscow skyscrapers, the "Stalin Empire".  This building - the third tallest among the skyscrapers (after Moscow State University and the Ukraine Hotel) - was designed by architect Chechulin.  It was built by prisoners who lived in Lagpoint nearby.  There lived a lot of senior officials from the NKVD and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  They say that Stalin personally distributed apartments there.  This house has been shot more than once in the movies.  We see him in "Hipsters", the films "Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears", "Brother" and many others. </p><p>  Muscovites can tell many interesting stories related to Yauzsky Boulevard and the vicinity of Ustinsky Bridge. </p>
