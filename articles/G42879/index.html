    <h2>  Toponymy </h2><p>  It is impossible to trace the origin of the name.  Usually the villages were given the names of the owners or the church built in them, but the princes Cherkassky and Sheremetyev owned Ostankin or Ostashkov, and the famous Church of the Life-Giving Trinity was erected later.  It remains only to think over, if there is a desire, whether it is the name of the first unknown owner, or the ‚Äúremnant‚Äù of a dowry of some bride, or someone's revered remains gave the name of the village.  One way or another, but in the boundary book of the Moscow district for the first time in 1558, mention was made of the village of Ostashkovo.  Often the village passed from hand to hand, and each owner completed something ‚Äî either a pond or a garden.  So the famous Ostankino park began to emerge. </p>

    <h2>  Manor founder </h2><p>  The heyday of this village near Moscow is associated with the grandson of the famous field marshal <br>  B.P. Sheremetev, who was the first in Russia to be awarded the title of Count.  His son, marrying a representative of the Cherkassky clan (Ostankino also belonged to the dowry), laid the foundations of the legendary state - the Sheremetyevs were richer than Catherine II.  The grandson of ‚ÄúPetrov‚Äôs nestling chick‚Äù, Nikolai Petrovich Sheremetyev, remained in the history of Russia as a philanthropist, the founder of the most beautiful Ostankino residence near Moscow and simply as a person with a delicate artistic taste.  It was repeatedly noted that the "artistry" of the estate was never sacrificed to amenities or anything else. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first pond in the territory where Ostankino Park was later located appeared at the beginning of the 17th century. It was built in the floodplain of the Gorlenka River, or, as it became known later, the Ostankino Stream.  Later, the pond began to be called the Palace Pond, as the most beautiful count's residence was located right behind it. </p><h2>  Saving virtues </h2><p>  The manor was so good that in the troubled year of 1918 it was not burned and plundered, but a state museum was created on its territory.  Thanks to the responsible attitude of the authorities, in the Ostankino Palace even now you can hear the repertoire of the famous Sheremetyevo serf theater and see the authentic interiors of those times.  This is the only theater building in Russia that has been preserved in its entirety: stage, hall, dressing rooms, engine room, etc. </p>
