    <p>  Count on comfort?  Pay attention to enclosures with amenities.  Toilet, shower, kitchen with household appliances and electronics, a set of dishes, several bedrooms, a common living room - this is what you can count on.  Such houses are popular among large companies, as they can accommodate 6-8 guests at a time.  Book a house with amenities in advance, especially if you plan to celebrate an important event here. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  <span>The recreation center</span> "Vesyegonsky Island" has all the conditions for a comfortable stay.  Each room has everything you need for food storage and cooking.  Nevertheless, if you wish, you can eat in a restaurant operating in the base.  The menu is varied, represented by dishes of traditional European cuisine. </p><h2>  Price of rest </h2><p>  So, the daily stay in a double room is 700 rubles per person, subject to placement in an economy house with amenities on the street.  The cost of living in a room with amenities starts from 100 rubles per person per day.  Checkout time, operating on the territory of the recreation center - 12:00. </p><p>  Boat rental costs 250 rubles per day, boats with a motor - 400 rubles.  You can rent a set for badminton, table tennis, volleyball for only 50 rubles per day.  In addition, if you are passionate about fishing, you don‚Äôt have to bring all the gear with you, because for only 200 rubles a day you can rent a spinning reel and a set of necessary gear. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If you read the reviews of those who at least once spent their vacation here, you will want to immediately collect the bags and go on the road.  An excellent combination of quality of rest and affordable cost is what vacationers attribute to the main advantages of a recreation center.  It is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of discerning people who prefer fashionable resorts, because in most buildings there is only a minimal set of conditions necessary for living: furniture, a refrigerator, a set of dishes.  In economy buildings there is no toilet and shower - all amenities are on the street.  At the same time, it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of the right place: the air here is amazing, the views are picturesque.  Many of those who spent even a week here noted improvement in well-being, normalization of sleep. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The recreation center "Vesyegonsky island" in the Tver region is a great option for a weekend or vacation.  Here you can spend time with family and friends, celebrate important and solemn events.  Be sure to visit this amazing place at least once to personally enjoy all the benefits of a country vacation. </p>
