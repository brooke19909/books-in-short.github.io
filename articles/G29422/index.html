    <p>  For sale is ZTE Blade GF3, the instructions for which are included in the package, in ordinary packaging, so typical of the rest of the devices of the Chinese company.  We can say that outwardly everything looks pretty pretty.  However, inside you can find the minimum configuration for a smartphone, which consists of a power supply and a microUSB cable, as well as a user manual and a warranty card.  We will not find anything else here.  You should not dream about a bumper.  Neither film nor anything else is here.  Even on headphones, the Chinese have saved.  Although what to expect from such a state employee as the model we are considering today? </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2>

    <p>  ZTE Blade GF3, the price of which is about six thousand rubles, is not very different from its counterparts.  It is similar to similar models, most likely, of the latest releases.  For example, you can find the same touch buttons.  The design, of course, is copied not only in their respect.  However, what looks strange and a little even illogical is the lack of a bluish rim around the camera.  There is no logical explanation for why the Chinese suddenly abandoned such a move when creating a new apparatus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Arrangement of elements </h2>

    <p>  ZTE Blade GF3, the price of which is quite budget, reaches a thickness of 9.4 millimeters.  Under the screen, you can find three touch buttons.  One of them, having a round shape, is called ‚ÄúHome‚Äù.  On the sides of it are two points.  They respectively indicate ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  System navigation is provided precisely due to these simple controls.  Above the screen, you can find the outlet of the earpiece, as well as the front camera of the device. </p><h2>  Back surface and practical solutions </h2>

    <p>  On the back of the ZTE Blade GF3, an overview of which is presented in this article, there is a bulging lens of the main camera.  It features a single-section LED flash.  Nearby was a hole in the sound speaker.  From this side, you can see the corporate engraving and logo of the Chinese company.  If we take a closer look, we can notice that the cover is dull.  It is logical to assume that this practical solution will add safety in terms of operation, since the device will not slip in your hands, and will not collect fingerprints.  At least so active. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Interfaces </h2>

    <p>  Having twisted the ZTE Blade GF3, the review of which we are now continuing, in our hands, we will stumble upon the microphone located below.  On the opposite side there is a connector to which wired headphones are connected.  On the right, we notice a double button, which is designed to adjust the sound and change the sound mode in which the phone is switched.  There is also a button to lock the screen and turn off the device.  The cover can be hooked up using the corresponding small hole.  On the left is a connector for connecting a charge or cable for synchronization with a computer / laptop. </p><h2>  Display: how the technology of the last century save the reputation of the Chinese public sector </h2><p>  ZTE Blade GF3, the characteristics of which should be studied before buying, has a not very bright screen.  Its diagonal is, as we have said, 4.5 inches.  The picture is displayed on the screen as FWVGA at a resolution of 854 by 480 inches.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using TFT technology.  This means that in sunlight it will be difficult to make out a picture, and to read a text is generally very difficult.  Sometimes this problem is solved by a large margin of brightness, but the subject of our review today cannot boast of. </p><p>  Returning to the topic of the long-suffering matrix, which is equipped with the ZTE Blade GF3 smartphone, it can be noted that now TFT-type matrices are no longer relevant, and many manufacturers are trying to even install IPS in their state employees.  If we take the device a thousand rubles more (let it be a device of the same company, only a model with the unusual name NH), then you can find just such a screen matrix.  It is not clear why the Chinese decided on such a desperate move and such a stupid as it seems, savings.  Unjustified, one might say.  The only logical argument that begs the head is an attempt to implement the principle of energy efficiency.  Still, the device we are equipped with is not the most capacious battery, and a lot depends on the screen in this area.  By the way, the multitouch of our device is designed only for two simultaneous touches. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The ZTE Blade GF3 smartphone supports two Micro SIM cards.  They are installed by premature removal of the battery.  That is, while the phone is working, it will not work to change SIM cards.  You don‚Äôt even know, rejoice at the fact that the connection catches stably, or it should be so.  Be that as it may, the device works well in the third-generation cellular network, and it‚Äôs up to each user to evaluate the norm or advantage, comparing the smartphone with the previous one. </p><p>  ZTE Blade GF3 Black at the first start will prompt the user to choose which SIM card in the future he will use as the main one.  That is, she immediately assigned a mode of operation in a third-generation cellular network.  Priorities can be changed a little later in the device settings.  But why do this if everything can be done right away?  We can also immediately indicate which card will be used to make voice calls and send packet data.  If there is a desire, one slot can be disabled. </p><p>  We warn readers that the ZTE Blade GF3 Black allows you to assign 3G mode to only one SIM card.  Such settings as the network operator and access points for receiving and transmitting Internet traffic are separately set.  And although users do not complain about the quality of communication, but only praise it, the level is quite low.  For the surface, it will still work, but in the basement, shops, metro, in underground parking lots and in other similar rooms, the signal will disappear. </p><p>  ZTE Blade GF3, a case for which can be purchased at your nearest mobile phone salon, is additionally equipped with proximity and light sensors.  A nice bonus, although not so expensive.  By the way, there is also an accelerometer.  Sensors will simplify the handling of the device: when the corresponding function is working, the brightness will be automatically adjusted depending on the level of illumination around.  But the proximity sensor will allow you to not manipulate the screen backlight during a conversation.  So, when approaching the ear, it will turn off.  At a distance - turn on.  Satellites are searched by the device for a very, very long time.  The first launch may take as long as twenty minutes, or even half an hour.  The rest is a sin to complain about communication, there is Wi-Fi and bluetooth, but 4G LTE for a similar price should not be expected. </p><h2>  Operating system and software </h2><p>  <span>The ZTE</span> Blade GF3 phone is delivered to mobile phone stores with a preinstalled OS of the Android family of version 5.0.  You can view the name of the device in the corresponding settings menu.  A check may show that an update file has been released since the installation of the operating system.  In it, some functions of the system were optimized, and some identified shortcomings were fixed.  Now there is less chance of encountering unreadable messages and incorrect display of characters in text documents.  After installing the update, the software version will change from 5.0 to 5.1. </p><p>  The ZTE Blade GF3 8 GB has the ability to quickly access the basic settings.  They can be activated or deactivated by swiping from the top.  The set includes features such as bluetooth, Wi-Fi and geographic location.  Their list, of course, does not end there.  But the meaning is probably understandable.  There are some preinstalled applications and useful utilities.  This is the same <span>Clean Master.</span>  The list includes a branded <span>Chinese keyboard,</span> mobile office, Chinese browser, standard solutions from Google, social networks.  Pleased with the presence of any anti-virus.  The list goes on, but it should not. </p><p>  The settings menu is absolutely similar to similar elements on other smartphones running the Android operating system version 5.0.  The left touch button is factory-set to return.  The right key opens the menu.  These settings can be changed at the discretion of the user using the built-in software. </p><h2>  ZTE Blade GF3.

    <p>  What do users who have purchased this device say?  In fact, the Chinese company came out with a fairly good device, which, at least, corresponds to the price.  Thanks to the ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù mode, it can also be considered a device for the elderly.  The only weakness was the slow interaction with satellites.  This phone is far from the best option if you need frequent navigation.  It also does not shine with special performance, but within the framework of the segment it makes good competition to other creations. </p>
