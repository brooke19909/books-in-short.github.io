  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami gun</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Origami is a very ancient art, which is associated mainly with delicacy, attention to detail, accuracy and imagination.  Here, to convey the idea itself, a variety of objects, letters, forms or animals are used.  If you want to make an unusual and non-standard origami, the gun is exactly the product that will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  Such a gun is assembled from individual parts, which are subsequently combined into a single whole.  Such an assembly is one of the rather popular varieties of origami art, called model origami, which involves the creation of a whole figure from separate small parts.  All such parts are individually folded from sheets of paper. </p><p>  Such an activity is not only interesting, but also very useful and instructive.  After all, it <span>develops thinking,</span> logic, perseverance and imagination.  This is the best option for developing activities with a child.  Therefore, if a boy grows up in your family, then such an origami (gun) can be safely collected with him. </p><p>  This technique allows you to create an excellent toy that will be safe for both your child and his peers.  When the product is ready, it can be painted as your baby wants it.  And he will spend a lot of time on this lesson. </p><p>  So, a pistol is made of several parts.  First, take a sheet of paper (A4 format) and fold it in length several times.  Get the gun barrel.  Then, in the same way, bend the sheet of paper to the very end, and then - in half.  It should be noted that it is necessary to bend very finely so that the workpiece is not flimsy, but solid.  Otherwise, no good gun will work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then proceed to create the next item for which you will need the same sheet of paper.  Fold it in the same way as the previous element, taking into account that it will be a handle.  And this means that it should be slightly wider than the first part (trunk).  At the end, also fold it in half. </p><p>  To make the origami gun solid and strong, do not forget to fold all the parts very tightly.  So, spread both parts, and put the barrel on the handle.  Divide visually into three parts the lower workpiece.  To begin, bend to the center of its right side, and after - the left.  Then bend the part again to the center. </p><p>  And now you need scissors to make a small hole at the base of the part.  Take new paper of the same size again, turn it toward you, and bend from half the sheet.  Do all this very carefully and very finely, as this is a trigger. </p><p>  The excess part can be cut off.  Fold the finished element in half and insert it into the pre-cut hole.  Insert the halves of a thin blank into the pockets of a wider sheet of paper.  And bend all the edges very carefully until the corners are even.  If necessary, trim the back excess of the trigger. </p><p>  Further, in order to get a more even and beautiful handle, the origami (gun) requires one more sheet of paper for its manufacture.  Bend it the same way as before, but keep in mind that its width must necessarily coincide with the width of the handle itself.  Wrap the last edge and seal it with tape.  Make certain cuts so that the handle enters the gun. </p><p>  And at the very end, take the last sheet of paper and begin to bend it very thinly from the short side.  Fold in half and bend the right edge to the left so that the right edge is exposed outward.  Cut it off.  And then thread this blank into the back of the barrel.  Now you know <span>how to make an origami gun.</span>  As you can see, this process is absolutely not complicated.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to devote a little time and create a small miracle with your own hands. </p>
