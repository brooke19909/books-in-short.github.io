  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is a military pension calculated?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A military pension is a very important monetary issue that has worried many since pension funds began to open, and the country has gradually begun to copy the behavior of foreign countries in this matter.  As a rule, the calculation of a military pension is carried out when considering a number of factors.  Typically, the amount of the salary of a military post affects the amount of a pension - 54% of it is charged.  The second most important is the salary in rank.  And finally, the calculation of <span>military pension</span> includes an allowance for seniority.  Naturally, the higher your rank, the higher the retirement rate in the future.  Therefore, there is a benefit in career growth.  Since 2012, the government is interested in increasing the military pension.  Therefore, recounts and reforms are carried out.  According to forecasts, in the near future the pension will be increased by 3.7%. </p><p>  The procedure for calculating the pension is as follows: the future pensioner collects all documents confirming his rank, position, military service.  Bonuses are awarded to him if he received the title of a hero, or a medal, or established himself as a good specialist or participated in hostilities: Afghanistan, Chechnya, etc.  All possible documents must be provided. </p><p>  Consider the <span>calculation of pensions for military</span> pensioners in the following example.  Suppose a soldier was promoted to lieutenant colonel.  The formula in this case will be as follows: first we add the ATS, OVZ and NVL to each other.  What does it mean?  ATS - Salary for military posts, while HIA - for <span>military rank.</span>  But NVL is the size of the allowance for seniority.  Then, for each year of service, it is necessary to charge 53%.  And multiply the amount of ATS, HIA and NVL by 53. After that, once again we multiply the resulting by 54%.  If you make all the necessary calculations correctly, it turns out that our lieutenant colonel will receive a pension in the amount of 12 and a half thousand rubles. It is worth pointing out that the length of service of our lieutenant colonel is 25 years, the police department - 4700, the police department - 3400, the military duty - 5300. Significantly affects the size pensions and disability.  As a rule, military pensioners receive large treatment benefits. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If our article could not fully explain to you how the calculation of the military pension is carried out, then you can ask for help in this matter from the employees of the pension department.  They have the latest information on this subject and will be able to resolve all your doubts. </p><p>  It is also important to know who is applying for a military pension.  These are, as a rule, former employees of organizations such as the Ministry of Defense, <span>Internal Affairs Agencies.</span>  The same pension is also received by employees of the fire services, employees of the anti-drug authorities, employees of organizations of the penal system, etc. </p><p>  By the way, there are several types of military pensions.  The first of them is for length of service.  It is issued from the moment when the person served the due date and went on a legal vacation.  The second pension is for disability.  Calculation of a military pension of this kind is carried out from the moment when a person showed a certificate of fixing the fact of disability.  He can no longer work in the military sphere, and therefore, retires.  She is no less than the one paid for the length of service.  A military pension is also paid in the event of the death of the breadwinner - the relatives of the deceased military are paid all the necessary funds. </p><p>  By the way, the military pension is calculated by the periods of service.  Its size will be significantly higher if the soldier participated in the hostilities or had particularly difficult conditions of service.  Particularly difficult should include the following: liquidation of the Chernobyl accident, parachuting, frequent flights, work with nuclear weapons.  This list also includes work in highlands.  By the way, simple service in the army on conscription is also included in the length of service. </p>
