    <p>  The contact zoo on Arbat on its territory has sheltered animals and birds such as deer, goat, rabbit, llama, lemur, monkey, kangaroo, hare, turtle, <span>macaw parrot,</span> cockatoo, turkey, ram, raccoon, chicken. </p><p>  The room has cells, terrariums, pens.  Of course, all this is small.  During the visit, you can see that some animals are sleeping, others are eating something, but they react well to visitors, especially if they feel a treat.  Visitors called the raccoons raccoons-thieves, and rabbits act as a "super soft relaxant." </p><p>  If you want to make interesting photos with animals, then you can safely take pictures.  The zoo is allowed to take pictures with animals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They can also take you off while you admire the animals.  The photo will be processed and at the exit they will offer you an original fridge magnet. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arbat 16 Zoo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1023458.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Labyrinth and houses </h2><p>  In addition to communicating with animals, the contact zoo on Arbat also offers a visit to the maze and three houses: upside down, giant and butterflies.  A ticket can be bought separately for each attraction or all at once, and then there will be a good discount. </p><p>  Separately, it must be said about the mirror maze.  First, entry into it is allowed only from the age of 14.  Secondly, it‚Äôs quite scary: around the mirror, the light is constantly blinking, and there is a "ghost".  The meaning of the attraction is to find a way out.  But if you don‚Äôt get out within ten minutes, then they will begin to search.  Good activity for those who lack adrenaline. </p><h2>  Opinion of people </h2><p>  Muscovites and visitors often visit the contact zoo on the Arbat.  Reviews leave different. </p><p>  According to visitors, a visit to the zoo leaves a good impression.  There is no stuffiness and bad smell, around cleanliness and order.  Here and there, zoo workers constantly flash by, clean something, clean, but visitors are not disturbed.  Plates are installed everywhere, it says where you need to be afraid of something, so that visitors are attentive.  Contact with animals is provided well, the enclosures are small, no need to run around, fuss to catch up and stroke someone.  Animals and birds look well-groomed, do not get scared. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thanks to the fact that there are artificial plants at the entrance, at first glance it is not clear where you are: the feeling that you are in the forest.  Here at the entrance there is a sign reminding you to wash your hands at the entrance and exit.  Everything is equipped with: liquid soap, napkins.  There is a toilet right next to it. </p>

    <p>  The only negative is that there is no wardrobe.  Inside the building there are small enclosures, everything is very convenient and affordable.  There are many animals and birds, visitors note.  Particularly attracted by a dwarf exotic monkey, as tourists say.  You can take pictures with goats and kangaroos, raccoon, guinea pig, parrot.  Some animals can be fed: for them they sell food at the checkout for 50 rubles per serving, fruits and vegetables on a plastic plate.  Zoo employees are instructing: whom and what to feed.  It is especially interesting to feed the monkeys: they learned to skillfully beg for food, stretch their legs.  But if you gape, they will grab the plate in an instant.  It is better to come to this place on weekdays in the evening or on weekends in the morning, then there are fewer people. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know what a contact zoo is on the Arbat.  This is a very positive place, everyone who loves animals is delighted: both children and adults. </p><p>  Therefore, if you have free time, you love birds and animals, go to Arbat 16. The zoo is always ready to receive visitors from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. </p>
