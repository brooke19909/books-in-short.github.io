After all, Liebherr is not a newcomer to the refrigerator market, for more than 60 years it has been manufacturing equipment that is constantly at the forefront of technological development.  Although its holding is located in Switzerland (the property of the Liebher family), the backbone of enterprises is located in Germany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator reviews liebherr" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/386696.jpg" width="500"></div>  Its German high-quality refrigerators made of stainless steel and aluminum with an innovative ergonomic "filling" traditionally deserve the highest reviews from consumers.  Liebherr fridge is always premium!  It has a quite decent volume, suitable for a real family refrigerator.  And, of course, the price of such a reliable and convenient refrigerator starts at $ 1.2 thousand.

    <h2>  Types of Refrigerators </h2><p>  The Liebher company is actively working in the segment of two-chamber refrigerators.  They are most in demand.  Speaking about macroeconomics, it should be noted that at present in conditions of intense competition in the market, various manufacturers sell more than a thousand models of “two-chamber”.  Liebherr is one of the market leaders.  Analytical reviews and customer <span>reviews</span> testify to the latter <span>.</span>  <span>The Liebherr refrigerator is</span> manufactured in two fundamentally different designs: the European type (both compartments are located vertically) or the American one (side-by-side: on the left is a freezer, on the right is a refrigerator). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To clarify: for a large family of five or more people living in a spacious cottage or in an apartment, the American design of Liebherr products with a width of 1210 mm is ideal.  The Liebherr SBS 7212 and SBSES 8283 models (two doors: the freezer on the left and the refrigerator compartment on the right) traditionally receive the best reviews.  The Liebherr refrigerator for a relatively small family (up to 3-4 people) involves a European double-chamber design (where the freezer compartment is located below).  By the way, as ergonomics advises, the location of the freezer below is preferable for high refrigerators (178 cm - 210 m).  Note that the Liebher models CUN 3033, 3956, CES 4023, CN 3033, and CN 4003 of the European type correspond to these criteria. </p><h2>  The main compartments of the refrigerator </h2><p>  Obviously, the <span>interior of the</span> refrigerator is always of fundamental importance to the client.  It has been established that the average volume in our time is assumed to be in the range from 250 to 350 liters (practically it is achieved with a refrigerator height of 178 cm). </p><p>  What are the main functional departments of refrigerators most in demand by users?  There are only three of them: a freezer, a refrigerator compartment and a zero chamber.  Moreover, it is possible to implement such a separation in both the 3-chamber and 2-chamber versions.  An example of a three-chamber appliance is the Liebherr 3956 refrigerator (height 2010 m) with a total volume of 325 l, which contains a refrigerator compartment (157 l), a zero chamber (79 l) and a freezer (89 l).  In the 0-chamber, as you know, the temperature is close to 0 ° C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liebherr refrigerator handle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/386703.jpg" width="388"></div>

However, inside the refrigeration room, the designers successfully modeled the zero zone.  This design is recognized by customers as successful, and they buy it more often, as evidenced by reviews.  According to surveys, the Liebherr refrigerator is selected according to many criteria (we will touch on them in this article).  However, the average buyer in 80% of cases begins with the criterion of the volume of the freezer.  If the family practices freezing a sufficiently large number of products, then it is advisable to have an increased volume of up to 150 liters.  If family food is based on the purchase of frozen semi-finished products, 70 liters will be enough.  Let us analyze what interior spaces of their refrigerators Liebherr offers its customers (see table 1). </p><p>  Table 1.

It is a large white refrigerator, with a height slightly above average (1852 mm) it has an impressive width of 1210 mm and a depth of 630 mm.  Choosing a different model, we find that it is also reasonable to purchase an unprincipledly smaller brand of SBSES 8283. The remaining refrigerators of the presented Liebherr line will be smaller in volume.  For most people who buy American-made units, at first it’s unusual to have a freezer and a refrigerator left to right and, accordingly, the door position next to each other, which has the Liebherr refrigerator above.  Side by side - this is the name of this design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Recall about vegetarians.  For them, the zero zone is valuable in the refrigerator.  In it, with high humidity (about 90%), greens are well preserved.  However, their antipodes, zealous meat lovers, are also found in the zero zone of the “ally”: dry cold (at 50% humidity) preserves meat products essentially longer than classic units with high humidity.  The CBN 3956 refrigerator is the most functional in this regard. It is a high roomy three-compartment appliance, above average human height - 201 cm. It is positive when compartments are equipped in the same compartment, allowing the possibility to simulate both a “dry” and a “wet” zero zone at the same time. . </p><p>  However, the Liebherr 4003 two-chamber refrigerator, as well as the CES 4023 model, also have a height of 201 cm. It is noteworthy that the last two have increased the refrigeration zone to about 280 liters.  Liebher marketers are not in vain eating their bread: according to statistics, such a volume is in demand by families of 4 people.  Moreover, it’s even a little more: strictly speaking, the refrigerator compartment volume of 200–250 l is optimal for them, that is, models 4003 and 4023 are just right. The Liebher technologists in the aforementioned devices created conditions for longer storage due to a fan in the refrigerator compartment. </p><p>  The refrigerators indicated at the bottom of the table: CBN 3956, CN 4013, CN 3033 - adapted for the average family, up to three people inclusive.  And the most compact Liebherr CUN 3033 refrigerator, in fact, is a bachelor’s dream. </p><h2>  Built-in refrigerators </h2>

From the above table it can be seen that we are dealing with a two-chamber refrigerator with NoFrost type cooling.  This cooling system will be discussed below. </p><h2>  Which is better: single-compressor or two-compressor device? </h2><p>  It is known that the compressor is the “heart” of the refrigerator, pumping and compressing freon steam.  From this compression, the vapor condenses into a liquid state, and then, getting into the evaporator, evaporates, absorbing the heat of the internal space of the refrigerator.  Two-chamber refrigerators are one- and two-compressor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="repair of refrigerators liebherr" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/386694.jpg?1398969421027" width="505"></div>

    <p>  In two-compressor machines, one compressor works for the refrigerator, and the other for the freezer.  How does he deal with two refrigerated compartments at the same time?  He is helped by dividing one stream of cold into two (into the freezer and refrigerator), the distribution <span>solenoid valve.</span>  Thus, the Liebherr two-chamber refrigerator can be either single- or double-compressor. </p><p>  In the table below, we present this technical specification for Liebher refrigerators (see table 4). </p><p>  Table 4.

The Liebherr 3033 refrigerator, like the others below it in the table, is a single compressor. </p><p>  Which is better: one- or two-compressor refrigerator?  To begin with, outwardly this feature is indistinguishable.  However, experts still find a way out, how to make an exact verdict.  They immediately look for “secondary signs”: how many temperature regulators are in the refrigerator — the freezer.  If two, then there are two compressors. </p><p>  Back to the comparison.  On the one hand, a single-compressor refrigerator has the advantage of lower cost (10%).  On the other hand, in the event of a breakdown, it immediately becomes completely inoperative.  Under the same conditions, after a breakdown, his two-compressor opponent continues to work one of the squads.  This guarantees the safety of products. </p><p>  Four asterisks on the freezer door indicate that this machine allows deep freezing of products, which contributes to their further long-term storage. </p><h2>  Refrigerator noise </h2>

It happens that his “voice” is heard quite distinctly at night.  How to avoid such an unpleasant moment?

    <p>  Firstly, when buying, pay attention to its declared <span>noise level.</span>  Feel free to ask, let the seller bring you instructions.  In it, pay attention to the noise parameter.  What you need to know about decibels?  Typically, manufacturers show noise ranging from 30 to 50 dB. </p><p>  With its manifestation in the range from 30 to 40 dB, we are dealing with noise at the level of a whisper.  However, an increase of up to 45 dB resembles the annoying buzz of a fly.  How do Liebherr refrigerators sound?  (See table 5.) </p><p>  Table 5. Noise levels of Liebherr refrigerators </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 297px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Brand of refrigerator </p></td><td valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  Noise level, dB </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr SBS 7212 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  40 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr CN 4013 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  41 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr CN 4003 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  41 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr CN 3033 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  41 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr SBSES 8283 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  41 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr CUN 3033 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  42 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr CBN 3956 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  42 </p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="211"><p>  Liebherr 4023 </p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="87"><p>  39 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As you can see, the quietest among the technological ones is the “American” (side-by-side) Liebherr SBS 7212, and the “basketball player” CBN 3956 (201 cm high) and the “average” CUN 3033 make the most noise.  Although, to be punctual, the championship is held by the 201-cm Liebherr 4023 refrigerator. However, it is assembled in Bulgaria, it provides for manual defrosting of the freezer and drip defrosting of the refrigerator. </p><p>  We’ll add some lyrics to our story.  After all, the refrigerator is not just noisy, it is “talking” (naturally, we are talking about all refrigerators, not only Liebherr).  Let's see what he can "tell us". </p><p>  A humming fridge gives out the compressor.  If vibration is added, then you should better install it.  By the way, the two-compressor refrigerator buzzes quieter (its compressors are weaker).  Other sounds: buzzing, gurgling, etc. - caused by the movement of freon.  The third type of sound, clicks, demonstrates the operation of the relay, which turns the refrigerator motor on and off.  The cooler fan is also noisy if it is controlled by NoFrost.  Noise is accompanied by the process of defrosting devices of the "crying" type. </p><p>  All these diverse noises accompanying the functioning of the Liebherr refrigerator are brought to the standard and are quite weak. </p><p>  However, installing a purchased refrigerator in their kitchen, often its owners are faced with a louder sound than given in the instructions.  The reason may be the non-sustainability of the unit at home in an upright position in its place within the prescribed time (1-2 days, which is indicated in the instructions).  The sound is also amplified when the unit is improperly placed on a horizontal surface (due to the resulting play) or when it touches the walls surrounding the kitchen furniture with its body.  We draw your attention to the fact that delivery of the purchased refrigerator home should also be done exclusively in an upright position. </p><p>  If you, having purchased a refrigerator, find that it makes a noise fundamentally stronger than indicated, we recommend involving service specialists to replace the noise level.  Theoretically, the possibility of replacing the device with a similar one is not ruled out.  You can also make appropriate repairs on Liebherr refrigerators.  Although we found out during a survey of sellers of three supermarkets of household appliances that such precedents did not happen.  At the same time, reasonable tolerance should be shown and, of course, be aware that large household appliances that do not emit noise at all do not exist. </p><h2>  Refrigerator cooling system, cost-effective </h2><p>  Refrigerator buyers have an alternative choice between the two types of cooling systems.  The more traditional jargon is called the “crying evaporator” (we will consider the principle of its operation below), and the newer is called the forced ventilation system. </p><p> They coexist, since the traditional system also has its strengths: greater simplicity and, as a consequence, profitability. </p><p>  Imagine the principle of the "crying evaporator".  When the compressor is operating, frost is formed on it.  After the compressor stops, this frost melts and goes into the drainage system in the form of water.  When the compressor is turned on again, the resulting water evaporates again, while absorbing heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge liebherr 3956" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/386704.jpg?1398969682064" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The NoFrost system works on simultaneous inclusion together with the fan compressor.  Her freeze is drier.  However, it is more expensive, more energy-intensive, and its operation is accompanied by fan noise.  The main advantage of NoFrost is a better temperature distribution than when cooling with a “crying evaporator”. </p><p>  The level of energy-saving technologies used in the design of a particular brand of refrigerator was reflected in the energy consumption indicator.  A, A + and A ++ (as you know, A ++ is the most economical class). </p><p>  Let us present a summary table of the types of cooling devices and the energy saving class of various Liebherr refrigerator models (see table 6). </p><p>  Table 6.

If we talk about the first of them, then for its implementation on the front door of Liebherr refrigerators is a control electronic system with a mini-display.  On it you can always see the temperature and the modes in its compartments.  Sensors are also equipped in the screen on which you can set the temperatures and modes you require.

    <p>  The Premium + system is visually identical to the previous one, however, it includes, in addition to the above features, the presence on the display of such an element as a cursor, as well as the ability to select a language by the client.  She has expanded the reference section due to various recommendations and descriptions. </p><p>  By connecting special units to refrigerators, the HomeDialog system allows you to connect Liebherr appliances into a single network (up to 6 units).  General network management is done on the display of the main refrigerator.  From it, you can control the operating modes of the remaining units. </p><h2>  Handle problem </h2><p>  Unfortunately, today this problem is typical not only for Liebherr, but also for other large manufacturers of refrigerators: while there are practically no complaints about the unit itself, there are enough questions about its handles (which break during operation).  (By the way, there are perhaps fewer similar claims to the company we are considering than to others.) </p><p>  Why, with Liebherr’s high market reputation, does the refrigerator handle still break?  What are the causes of this phenomenon?  Indeed, in modern refrigerators, the handle does not look like a "bulwark of reliability."  Indeed, its working plastic fragment half a centimeter thick has a fairly significant load, especially when opening the freezer, the door of which under the influence of internal low temperature has the property of "sticking". </p><p>  Are manufacturers, reputable companies, allowed the problem of pens to drift? </p><p>  Not at all.  The indicated bottleneck is not a structural defect in the handle, but a violation of the technology for the production of plastic from which it is made.  As you know, when assembling by an orthodox German manufacturer of the company Liebherr, the handle for the refrigerator must contain a marking like plastic.  It is the material approved by the technologists that ensures the regular functioning of this part and frees users from unnecessary headaches.  Cautious people on the eve of the purchase clarify this point and necessarily carry out a “face control” of the original marked pens.  Agree that this prevention reduces the likelihood that you will come across the specified part of inadequate quality. </p><p>  The reason for the marriage was caused by the “daughters” of the parent company, namely, their negligent fulfillment of the function of localizing production, that is, the manufacture of some components at home.  Perhaps homegrown technologists send unsuitable plastic to the injection machine. </p><p>  What to do if after buying the Liebherr unit the handle for the refrigerator still broke.  There are two ways: contact the warranty repair line (a shorter way, but you will get a pen of the same quality) or take the trouble to take a photograph of the breakdown, send it with a letter to the parent company and wait for the package with the original pen. </p><h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  An indispensable paragraph in the description of the operation of any equipment, including the refrigerator, is repair and maintenance.  It should be noted that the company referred to in this article organized a service of its equipment with a maximum of amenities for the client. </p><p>  To begin with, when you buy a refrigerator, its owner receives a branded warranty card valid for two years.  In addition, these coupons set in advance that Liebherr refrigerators will be repaired by specific service centers.  In confirmation of this, upon purchase, a service stamp is affixed to the coupon, for which the refrigerator is attached.  With such repair companies, the manufacturer has concluded contracts for the provision of high-quality spare parts.  The Liebher company supplied them with the necessary documentation for a quality repair.  Such services are equipped with proprietary equipment for high-quality diagnostics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator liebherr sbs 7212" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/386706.jpg?1398970045825"></div>

    <p>  Arriving at the customer’s house with the necessary set of equipment, the repairman in 97% of cases performs the necessary complex of work at a time.  It produces the following actions required to restore the refrigerator's operability: </p><p>  - replaces or repairs electronic components, refrigerator compressor; </p><p>  - replaces the electric fan, condenser, evaporator, timer and ten, filter drier, temperature sensor; </p><p>  - refills the Liebherr refrigerator with freon; </p><p>  - cleans and replaces capillary nozzles; </p><p>  - Produces optimal system settings; </p><p>  - Eliminates increased noise and humidity. </p><p>  If, nevertheless, your refrigerator should be transported to a service center for repair, then according to the consumer policy of Liebherr, you will be provided with another in return for the repair. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing our review of the refrigerators of this respected company, we note: having bought decent and high-quality equipment for yourself, you will undoubtedly make the right and justified choice, be it the Liebherr 7212 refrigerator or any of the other ones considered by us in this article. </p>
