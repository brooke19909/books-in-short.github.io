It is easy to guess the reasons for its occurrence: the beauty of nature, many excursions, hospitable people or the warm sea ... Most hotels are noticeably refreshed after renovation, and this is noted by many tourists.  Fortunately, while the country has not turned into an expensive tourist destination.  So for a budget vacation and an interesting "excursion" you should definitely go to the Sunny Beach resort. </p><h2>  Briefly about Nessebar </h2><p>  One of the oldest European cities, founded more than 5 centuries ago.  The resort is located on a rocky peninsula and is conditionally divided into 2 territories.  Most hotels, including Riviera Nessebar 3 *, are located in the new part, and the historical center falls on the old one. </p><p>  Most of the city was subjected to natural disasters - earthquakes.  Only ruins of aqueducts, towers, ancient walls and temples remind of former glory.  On the old streets of Nessebar you can see the stone bases and protruding wooden bay windows.  But it is these architectural ruins that cause great interest among tourists staying at the Riviera Nessebar 3 * hotel (Bulgaria).  Nessebar, judging by the reviews, amazes with the magical combination of medieval churches and Renaissance houses.  All this has turned the city into a tourist pilgrimage center. </p><p>  Also, the advantage of the resort is associated with the relatively inexpensive cost of permits.  Private 2 * and 3 * hotels will save on accommodation without compromising comfort. </p><h2>  Riviera Nessebar 3 * (Bulgaria / Nessebar) </h2><p>  Sunny Beach is a 7-kilometer beach located north of Burgas.  Every year he receives the <span>blue flag</span> for a reason, since the tourist complex is located away from highways, railways and big cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that Sunny Beach is the largest Bulgarian resort, on the territory of which more than 800 hotels are built, including the Riviera Nessebar 3 *, so it is very busy here in high seasons. </p>

    <p>  The tourist complex is ideal for families with children: a shallow bottom and a calm shallow bay, many children's swings, playgrounds, pools and entertainment areas, where discos, competitions and games with prizes are often held.  Just 10 km from the resort in 2003, an aquapark opened.  In addition, all hotels are built along the coast, so the descent to the sea is carried out without stairs. </p><h2>  Location of hotel Riviera Nessebar 3 * (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) </h2><p>  Only a few dozen hotels belong to the 3 * category.  According to tourists, these include the Riviera Nessebar 3 * hotel, located between Ravda and Nessebar and only 50 meters from the beach.  Interestingly, the hotels in Sunny Beach do not have an address (even on official websites), only the location map is indicated. </p>

And also vacationers emphasized that all employees are fluent in Russian, do their job quickly and efficiently. </p><p>  There are few reviews about the pool, since almost everyone preferred to swim in the warm sea.

    <p>  Some tourists shared a trick on the Internet.  According to them, in rooms the quality of communication is much worse than in a restaurant, by the pool and at the reception. </p><h2>  A few words in conclusion </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, Sunny Beach is a place worth visiting if only to enjoy a calm atmosphere, soak up the sun, walk barefoot on the soft sand of a 7-kilometer beach, climb the hotel terrace and meet the sunset there, make " tourist pilgrimage "to the city-museum of Nessebar and marvel at the beauty of architectural buildings. </p>
