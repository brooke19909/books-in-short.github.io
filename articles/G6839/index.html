They grow strawberries so that not only lines in company stalls are lined up for it, but also thousands of people gather annually for berry plantations to harvest. </p><p>  Comfortable conditions are created for residents. </p><p>  Kindergarten is like fabulous scenery from Disneyland. </p><p>  State farm named after Lenin, the children's park "Lukomorye" - a combination of these words has long been a standard in organizing children's leisure. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Lukomorye, state farm named after Lenin" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/1661821.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "At the Seaside ..." </h2><p>  Children's Park "Lukomorye" (state farm named after Lenin) invariably arouses admiration among children and parents at any time of the year. </p><p>  Thirty-three heroes, as if inviting to proceed to a fairy tale, are majestically and strictly met at the gate, on which the dragon is depicted. <br>  As usual in any fairy tale, at the beginning of an unexplored path lies a stone with the lines carved on it: "You will go to the right ..., to the left ...".  With each further step, travelers understand that history comes to life and is addictive, beckons to see what will happen next. </p><p>  Here is a fabulous tree.  Around it is a golden chain wrapped.  A fairy-tale cat, a scientist walks on it, looks at each visitor with curious huge eyes.  The mermaid is comfortably located on the branches - obviously he is not in a hurry anywhere, I am glad to every guest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A hut on chicken legs.  The roof was overgrown with fly agaric, the ravens sat in a friendly company and looked down on passers-by.  Just do not live in the hut of the Baba Yaga.  Windows and doors are in place.  Moreover, you can enter the hut and slide down an excellent hill. </p><p>  The fountain surrounded by sculptural frogs, the sparkling coolness of the beating jets is real grace on a sultry day. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="State farm named after Lenin, children's park &quot;Lukomorye&quot;" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/1661820.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "There on unknown paths ..." </h2><p>  Interactive towers are waiting for guests, where mechanical dolls live: songs are sung, fairy tales are told - just press the button located next to each window. </p><p>  Kids can linger on the Dunno site: get to know the artist Tubik, ‚Äúswim‚Äù in the house with balls, jump from the bottom of the strawberry-shaped trampoline on the trampoline. </p><p>  Lukomorye Park (state farm named after Lenin) prepared a real adventure for young guests - a suspended cable town stretching between the trees.  Not even a town - a huge multilevel city with <span>rope ladders,</span> tunnels. </p><p>  For beginners and very young daredevils, the height above the ground is small: so that the kids are not afraid, and their parents did not catch their hearts from worries about their child from excitement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The child will master, making his way along the simple structures, and can already move to structures located at a higher height, with a different level of difficulty. </p><p>  Parents can also remember their childhood and swing on a swing, while the kids have fun on the rides, ride on a carousel with a horse. </p><p>  The fairytale castle, through which the airways of the cable town lie, is striking.  Stairs, secret passages, the real royal throne ... From the doors and windows a variety of slides invite to slide down: straight and twisted, gentle and steep. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park &quot;Lukomorye&quot;, state farm named after Lenin, how to get there" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/1661822.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Tablecloth-self-assembly", or where to feed the child </h2><p>  A fabulous journey takes a lot of energy, especially for young adventure lovers.
