    <h2>  Nives 3 * <span>(Rimini): reviews of</span> tourists from Russia </h2><p>  Since many people when planning a trip are interested in the opinions of other travelers who have already visited this or that resort, we will give generalized comments from our compatriots regarding their stay in the hotel in question. </p><p>  According to tourists, "Nives" is a very good option for living while <span>relaxing in Rimini.</span>  Here guests will find the best value for money.  The biggest plus tourists considered the location of the hotel.  So, despite the fact that it is only a 10-minute drive from the airport, aircraft are not heard here.  In addition, Nives 3 * (Rimini) is located not on the main street, but in the alley, therefore it is always quite quiet and calm here.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket where you can buy a basic set of necessary products and goods.  But, of course, the main advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the beach.  The path to it takes just a couple of minutes.  Tourists also mention that there is a stop near the hotel, from where you can get to all places of interest. </p><p>  As for food, many travelers only ordered breakfast here.  According to them, morning meals are not diverse enough, but no one went hungry.  Some guests were also pleased with the fact that if they needed to leave for an excursion early in the morning, then the staff provided breakfast for them ahead of schedule.  By the way, as for the staff of Nives 3 * (Rimini), then most of the tourists were satisfied with them.  According to them, everyone here is very friendly and always happy to help.  All the staff speaks English, and one of the administrators also speaks Russian.  The guests did not consider cleaning the rooms to be particularly thorough, but there were no complaints. </p><p>  As for the rooms, here the reviews of most vacationers also converge.  So, our compatriots found the apartments quite acceptable for living.  Accommodation conditions here are quite consistent with the level of the European "three rubles".  So, the furniture is good, the plumbing is in working order.  True, travelers warn that there is no hairdryer, and bath and toilet accessories are provided only upon arrival, afterwards they will have to be bought by ourselves.  But let's not forget about the "stardom" of the institution. </p>
