But in fact, everything is much simpler than it might seem at first glance.  And the effect of bead embroidery is much more impressive than regular <span>embroidery.</span>  <span>The technique of embroidery</span> with beads is quite simple and understandable, the main thing is to be patient and have a great desire to create a masterpiece with your own hands. </p><p>  Before you begin, you need to understand that the technique of embroidery with beads is a multi-component and painstaking process.  First you need to decide what you want to get as a result.  Whether the product will be entirely embroidered with beads, or just some elements, what colors will be used and which particular beads.  You can make either a simple picture or a complex portrait or icon. </p><p>  Starting the process of selecting beads, pay attention to its quality.  Preference should be given to its Czech variety, this is one of the highest quality options.  A big plus of it is that all the beads are of the same shape, and the color does not fade after a while.  Beads can be round (from very small to large), bugles, chopping, in the form of various figures, the choice is yours, depending on what you need. </p><p>  For embroidery with beads you will need a needle with a small eye and durable thin threads (can be replaced with fishing line) and, of course, beads.  The thread must be fixed very carefully, in a place that will be closed with beads in the future. </p><p>  The easiest and most famous method of embroidery was sewing "in the attachment."  The thread on which the necessary beads are strung, in accordance with the figure, is attached with another thread with intercepting stitches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bead embroidery technique can be done by attaching each bead separately.  Smooth stitches and with the same distance between the beads, this seam is somewhat like a dotted line.  This seam takes a lot of time and is suitable for decorating not all products, but at the same time it is often used by needlewomen. </p><p>  Weaving beads will also be very exciting.  Using this technique, bracelets, belts, ties, paintings and even bags can be made.  The product can be made both in the technique of manual weaving, and use a special machine.  For products of large sizes, of course, it is better to use a machine. </p><p>  Weaving machine can be purchased at a specialized store, as well as made by yourself.  How to use it is described in detail in almost any book on needlework.  The main advantage of this product variant is their integrity.  As a result of work, you will get a double-sided canvas, the picture will be even and the same on both sides.  Alternatively, a lampshade can be made from several paintings of the same size.  The light will be a little dim, and the flickering of hundreds of colorful beads, like stars, will be bewitching. </p><p>  Also, with the help of beads, you can transform almost any object, and use it for interior decoration.  For example, many wondered: how to braid a bottle with beads?  The answer is quite simple, braiding can be done both in the embroidery technique and in the weaving technique.  You can also just glue the bead thread, while creating your own special pattern.  If you use embroidery, then in advance you need to make a fabric cover to fit the size of the bottle so that there is something to attach the beads to.  You can braid in the <span>brick weaving</span> technique <span>,</span> or make lace from beads. </p><p>  The technique of embroidery with beads, weaving, and indeed any work with beads will be positive not only upon obtaining the desired result, but also in the process of work.  According to scientists, this type of needlework calms and distracts well from all problems.  And besides, you can make a lot of beautiful things for yourself and your loved ones. </p>
