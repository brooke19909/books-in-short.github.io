Almost every smartphone has this tool installed, so any owner of a mobile device can use it.  If there is no need for a graphic or digital key, users are interested in how to disable the screen lock on the phone.  In this article, we will consider the main methods of deactivation with a different operating system.  Let's get started! </p><h2>  Memory encryption </h2><p>  Built-in algorithms provide reliable protection of personal files from possible hacking.  Disabling <span>the screen lock on the "Android" is</span> not difficult.  First, open the "Options" menu and select "Security."  Then you need to find the "Encryption" section and click on the "Decrypt" button.  At the finish stage, you will need to open the "Lock Screen" tab and tap on the "No" icon. </p><h2>  Why is the key not removed on Samsung? </h2><p>  In the normal mode of operation of a mobile device, the user just needs to go to the "My Settings" menu and open the "Lock Screen" tab.  In the window that opens, you need to click on the "No" button in front of the presented protection methods (picture, face control, PIN).  However, there are some factors that may prevent you from turning off the screen lock.  We list the main ones: </p><ul><li>  installation of third-party certificates; </li><li>  use of a VPN network; </li><li>  software malfunction; </li><li>  discovery of administrative rights on the gadget; </li><li>  encryption of embedded or internal memory; </li></ul><p>  Next, we consider how to disable the screen lock on the Samsung in each of these cases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Removing third-party certificates </h2><p>  In the process of downloading some programs from the Play Market and other resources, the system issues a request to set a password.  It will not be possible to disable the PIN code while the certificates will work.  Therefore, they will need to be removed before disabling the screen lock on Android.  To do this, go to the "Security" section and open the "Other Settings" tab. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pecul1ar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disable screen lock" class="if uuid-3192254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3192254.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to tap on the item "Delete credentials" and confirm the cleaning process.  Sometimes such a line is inactive, which indicates that there are no such certificates on the smartphone.  In this case, you need to take other actions that will disable the screen lock. </p><h2>  VPN Security Removal </h2><p>  Users will be interested to know that <span>Virtual Private Network</span> is a special network that is designed to provide secure access to the Internet.  Activating this function allows you to hide information from third-party attacks.  The user will need to put a graphic or digital key on the input screen in order to enable VPN.  It is impossible to remove such a password using standard methods, so you will need to delete this network first.  Consider how to disable the screen lock on the "Android" in this case.  To do this, make the following manipulations: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  go to the "Connections" section; </li><li>  open the item "Other settings" and select VPN; </li><li>  click on the used virtual network; </li><li>  go to the properties section and click on the "Delete" button. </li></ul><p>  Successful deactivation of the function will unlock the device.  As a result, the smartphone will work as usual. </p><h2>  Operating system crashes </h2><p>  If the above methods did not bring a positive result, then a system failure has occurred on the mobile device.  The user will need to reset the smartphone to factory settings.  This procedure can be performed using the "Backup and Reset" section.  Please note that this manipulation will delete all settings and data on the device.  It is recommended that you save important information in advance on a memory card or PC. </p><h2>  Disabling Administrative Rights </h2><p>  For certain applications, administrator rights are required.  The gadget owner will need to go to the "Lock screen" section and tap on the "Other settings" item.  Then click on the line "Device Administrators".  The system will open a window in which the used programs with system privileges are displayed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techrepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android logo" class="if uuid-3192256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3192256.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you will need to disable the extended rights next to each item.  To do this, just drag the slider to the Off position.  It happens that for some utilities it is impossible to remove administrator rights.  In such situations, it is recommended to check the mobile device for viruses, and then try to delete it again. </p><h2>  Reset via iTunes </h2><p>  Now consider how to disable the screen lock on an iPhone using two programs.  If the user cannot remove the lock screen, use a PC.  First you need to press the key combination "Shutdown" and "Home".  Then you need to release the "Shutdown" button, but at the same time hold Home.  Only iTunes can recognize this mode, so the external state of the phone will not change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lock deactivation" class="if uuid-3192258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3192258.jpg"></div><p>  After that, you can connect the smartphone to the PC and open the "iTunes" program.  On the keyboard, click on the Shift key and simultaneously click on the "Restore" item in the program.  Next, the updated version of the operating system will download, and the password will be automatically reset.  It is important to know that all user files will be deleted.  It is recommended that you back up before performing this operation. </p><h2>  Reset via iCloud </h2><p>  This will require an Internet connection via Wi-Fi.  Then you should take another mobile device and go on it to the iCloud site.  Next, you need to go through the authorization procedure and open the "My devices" section.  It is worth making sure that the "Online" mode is set in the context menu opposite the "iPhone" icon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="noticias.duriva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Password entry" class="if uuid-3192257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3192257.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to click on the name of the device and click on "Erase iPhone".  The system will require you to enter your Apple ID password.  The device will begin the recovery process and reboot.  It‚Äôs important to know that after resetting your password, the Lost iPhone feature will be deactivated. </p><h2>  Auto Lock on iPhone </h2><p>  The screen is the main energy consumer in the smartphone.  When choosing the maximum brightness, the user should know that the battery lasts for a maximum of 6 hours.  This problem can be solved by automatic display lock.  Each iPhone has this function, which is responsible for this process.  The user will need to open "Settings" and click on "Screen and brightness."  Then you need to tap on the "Auto-lock" button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.resonate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Screen Lock Methods" class="if uuid-3192262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3192262.jpg"></div><p>  The system will offer several time intervals, after which the screen will turn off.  The user should select "Never".  As a result, the phone screen will not go blank on its own - only when you click on the "Block" button. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  On mobile devices with the Android operating system, a screen lock is set by default.  In other words, when the smartphone is woken up from sleep mode, the user will need to perform an additional action.  Disabling the screen lock is quite simple, so any user can cope with this task.  In this article, we looked at a few simple methods that will enable you to deactivate this function. </p>
