Indeed, sometimes the most beautiful promises when buying a ticket actually turn out to be nothing more than a hoax.  Therefore, it always makes sense to study the reviews that will give a more or less true picture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xanadu resort hotel belek reviews" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1368754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Let's discuss whether the Xanadu Resort Hotel (Belek) is really good?  Guest reviews provide an opportunity to draw some conclusions. </p><p>  When choosing a resort and hotel for your stay, always consider what you want to get in the end to avoid unnecessary disappointments.  We have already said that the level of service at Xanadu Resort Hotel 5 * is High Class.  Reviews of most guests confirm that the service here is at a high level.  However, guests of the complex emphasize its family orientation, which, in fact, is promoted by the hotel administration.  As practice shows, not everyone is satisfied with evening animation and night club life.  Indeed, if you are looking for an active party and want to have fun in the clubs until the morning, then you probably should choose a different place to relax.  The complex is designed for couples with children.  Evening entertainment is organized by local animators, according to visitors' reviews, it‚Äôs even very good, some only complain about the prevalence of local motifs and the lack of modern European hits.  Someone is fully satisfied, but someone was bored. </p><p>  But the territory of the hotel makes absolutely all vacationers enthusiastic.  The fact is that the complex is located in a park area.  You are surrounded by wonderful pine trees from all sides.  Throughout the rest you breathe this healing coniferous air in combination with the sea breeze.  Is there anything better?  In addition, the park is full of wonderful little animals.  Every now and then everywhere, red squirrels are found that are completely not afraid of people.  For children, here is just a real paradise.  All buildings, made in the antique style, are perfectly combined with pine trees.  All vacationers emphasize a calm and quiet environment, which contributes to relaxation and rest.  If you want more privacy and live right in the park, then you should choose a room in one of the bungalows.  Silence and tranquility, clean air and sea landscape will create an indelible impression. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xanadu resort hotel 5 high class reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1368761.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to the guests of the complex, the hotel is perfectly organized children's animation.  A large club divides children by age and organizes their leisure based on age.  Even the smallest hotel guests will not be left without attention.  Each age group has its own play area with its own entertainment.  Children really like to have fun in the club and participate in game programs that are regularly held by animators.  Meanwhile, parents can relax and devote time to themselves by going to the spa.  For kids, relaxing at the hotel will be an unforgettable and fun adventure.  According to visitors, it is the children's animation at the hotel - at the highest level, only because of this it makes sense to visit here. </p><p>  According to reviews, the use of the spa is included in the price of the ticket, so you can treat yourself to procedures.  Only some services require additional payment, such as Thai massage.  In general, vacationers are satisfied with the spa and pools. </p><p>  But as for the rooms, there are complaints about the apartments located in the bungalow.  According to people, they need repairs, and the furniture would not hurt to change. </p><p>  Regarding nutrition, reviews, oddly enough, are quite controversial.  Someone considers it sufficient and very tasty, but to others it seemed very monotonous, fish is served only once a week - on Monday.  In addition, there are comments on the buffet, to which the most delicious dishes have not ended, and therefore it makes sense to come, for example, to dinner on time or a little earlier, because if you are late for a couple of minutes, you can skip all the fun.  It's nice that food is organized separately for young guests, given their age.  Not always to kids to taste adult dishes.  So it‚Äôs very difficult to determine grades regarding food.  To be sure to truly appreciate the food, you need to stay at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xanadu resort hotel 5 high" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1368766.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All vacationers admire the wonderful beach of the hotel.  It is really big and spacious.  Absolutely all the guests of the complex will easily stay here, and at the same time there will be no discomfort.  In addition, there is a children's area on the beach, which is important because children can find something to do here. </p><p>  Hotel guests note that in the complex there are not so many rest of our compatriots, most of the guests, apparently, are Turkish families. </p><p> If you came to rest exclusively on the sea, then you will certainly enjoy it.  But on the beach you will not see any hangouts.  According to tourists, daily animation for adults is mainly carried out near the pool in the hotel, and on the coast, vacationers are left to their own devices.  Although, in general, such remarks are not very clear, since it is impossible to simultaneously enjoy the sea, the beach and at the same time participate in some kind of active ventures.  But as for the standard marine activities on the beach, there is everything you need.  You can ride a yacht or try out any attraction.  You won‚Äôt be bored.  Even if you are hungry, you can grab a bite to eat at the beach bar and take your time to leave the beach. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned regularly and efficiently, therefore, in principle, everyone is satisfied.  The staff themselves, according to vacationers, are very welcoming and friendly.  Of course, as elsewhere, sometimes there are incidents that can be forgiven and hope to eliminate minor flaws. </p><p>  The hotel is definitely good and corresponds to its five stars, since everything in it is up to standard.  However, some tourists who have rich travel experience believe that the complex does not have a high-class level, which everyone says so.  And the rest of the place is beautiful in every way.  Especially couples with children will like it, and adults will be able to relax, and the children will be satisfied.  And inveterate party-goers and lovers of an active nightlife should look for a different place. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of hotel guests, the territory is very beautiful, there is where to walk and enjoy the local beauties.  Relaxing in Xanadu Resort Hotel, you will always be in the lap of nature, surrounded by pine trees and the sea.  The hotel has everything you need for a full vacation, you do not need to leave the complex.  If necessary, you can of course go on excursions.  But probably, true lovers of the beach and the sea will not want to spend their time on something else. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Xanadu Resort Hotel is considered one of the best <span>hotels in Belek.</span>  To assess the level of service and quality of service, perhaps it‚Äôs worth going there yourself.  Surely you will enjoy the beautiful territory and the beautiful beach.  What else is needed for a good holiday? </p>
