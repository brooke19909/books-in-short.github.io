    <h2>  When do I need to contact the office? </h2><p>  Is it always worth going to the operator‚Äôs office or can some issues be completely resolved without contacting the company‚Äôs department?  Most of the issues that subscribers (future and present) seek to address to the <span>MTS salon in St. Petersburg (the addresses of the</span> most popular of them are mentioned in the current article) are resolved through a contact center employee, i.e.  remotely or using the functionality of your personal account.  Conventionally, there are several real situations where you can‚Äôt do without a visit to the salon.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  purchase of SIM cards and equipment (smartphones, tablets and other gadgets presented on the company's window of display or in the online store);  even if the order was made through the official online store, then you still have to pick it up from the salon (unless the customer orders a courier delivery); </li><li>  SIM card replacement (for any of the possible reasons: getting a lost one in exchange, exchanging for a SIM card of a different format - nano, micro, etc.; getting a new SIM card due to a breakdown of the current one); </li><li>  implementation of SIM card blocking (to establish a voluntary suspension of communication services it is not at all necessary to contact the salon, since the service is available through your personal account and contact center); </li><li>  termination of the contract (if the client decided to refuse the MTS communication services, you can fix the fact of canceling the existing contract by contacting the salon and writing a statement of the appropriate form - the current procedure is not performed by calling the customer support service); </li><li>  MTS salons in St. Petersburg may also be needed by persons planning to renew the contract for another person - it is also not possible to remotely perform such an operation; </li><li>  registration of claims by the MTS client - complaints are accepted only in writing at the company‚Äôs offices; </li><li>  changing the type of number, for example, at the moment the client uses a federal number, but wants to connect a direct number (changing the number without changing the type can be done remotely); </li><li>  replacement of equipment purchased in the cabin (if defects, malfunctions, etc., if there are documents and packaging, for a specific period specified in the documentation); </li><li>  for corporate clients, some of the actions that individuals can perform on their own is not available. </li></ul>

Any actions with a number are available here - viewing information, performing most of the actions (except for those that were previously agreed). </p><p>  For users of mobile Internet, a great alternative would be an application for mobile gadgets.  You can download it for free in any market for operating systems.  The interface of this program for smartphones and tablets is fully optimized for small device displays. </p>

    <h2>  What you need to take to the salon? </h2><p>  When performing actions in the salon, it should be remembered that most registration actions, obtaining details, clarifying information on debiting from the balance sheet, replacing a SIM card, and blocking it are carried out only upon presentation of an identification card of the owner of the number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, you must have this document with you.  A person for whom a SIM card is not issued will receive a refusal to <span>provide information</span> and perform the necessary actions.  Of course, if you just need to pay for communication services, then you do not need to go through identification. </p><h2>  Delivery of equipment ordered through the online store </h2><p>  The receipt of goods, the order of which was carried out in the official MTS online store, is also done through the salon.  When filling out an application for equipment or a SIM card, the client can indicate the branch of the company in which it would be convenient to pick up his order and pay for it (in the event that non-cash payment has not been made before). </p>

    <h2>  MTS salons in St. Petersburg: how to choose a convenient office </h2><p>  Since there are more than 115 salons of the operator under consideration in the Northern capital, some of them may provide certain services, while others may not, it is necessary to first clarify whether it is worth contacting the selected department.  Indeed, in some it is possible to obtain loans when buying equipment, making payments on a loan, in others it is possible to pay by credit cards.  You can also sign up at the MTS salon in St. Petersburg.  Addresses of branches where this service is available: </p><ul><li>  8 line V.O., d. 45/34; </li><li>  pr. t Leninsky, d. 129; </li><li>  Ave Nevsky, d. 76; </li><li>  <span>Peterhof highway,</span> 51; </li><li>  Prospect of Enlightenment, d. 21; </li><li>  st.  Savushkina, house 116 A; </li><li>  st.  Sadovaya, d. 40; </li><li>  pl.  Stachek, d.9; </li><li>  st.  Utochkina, d. 3/1, etc. </li></ul><p>  Thus, before visiting the selected office, you need to familiarize yourself with the list of salons and choose not only the one that is closer to home or work, but also the one in which the execution of certain operations is available. </p><p>  Also, all available information can be found by going to any MTS salon in St. Petersburg: addresses, operating modes, list of available actions.  For example, all available services can be obtained in the following departments: </p><ul><li>  <span>Peat road, 7 (open until 22 hours);</span> </li><li>  <span><span>19 Kolomyazhsky Ave. (open until 22 hours);</span></span> </li><li>  <span><span>Avtokonstruktors Avenue, d.9 (up to 21 hours);</span></span> </li><li>  <span><span>st.</span></span>  <span><span><span>Yaroslav Hasek,</span> d.6A (up to 21 hours)</span></span> . </li></ul><p>  These elephants can be considered universal, since they carry out all operations regarding subscribers numbers (both corporate and individuals) and other services. </p><p>  You can also highlight the Central Office located on Vladimirsky Prospekt, <span>23 A</span> (opening hours from 10-00 to 21-00).  In it, you can also solve many issues on your personal account. </p><p>  You can clarify information about a particular department by dialing the contact center short number from your mobile device - 0890 (this call is free).  It is recommended that the employee specify in which of the existing salons it is possible to carry out the intended operation. </p>

    <h2>  What is the operating mode of MTS salons in St. Petersburg? </h2><p>  Most salons are open until nine in the evening, opening at the same time at nine to ten in the morning.
