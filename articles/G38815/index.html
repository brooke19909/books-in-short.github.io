    <p>  Close your eyes ... Imagine what your ideal resort looks like ... Imagine?  Now look at the map of Africa.  Yes, yes, your dream is there!  In the center of outlandish Tunisia near the major tourism center of Sousse. </p><p>  Ten kilometers from here is the resort of Port El Kantaoui.  A very picturesque and peaceful settlement combines incompatible things: paved narrow roads and arches in the Andalusian style peacefully coexist with modern promenades, where luxurious boutiques, restaurants, souvenir shops and cafes are located. </p><p>  The coastal zone of the resort is a chic tourist complex, where a huge number of establishments for relaxation and entertainment are spread.  In this place there is an oasis of Port el Kantaoui, a botanical garden with a huge number of rare plants, an artificial bay Marina, shopping centers, a water park, discos "Moroccan" and "Samara", a casino "Miramar Golf", an ice cream house, as well as one of the largest golf clubs in the country. </p><p>  Port El Kantaoui is especially popular with wealthy tourists and beginners. </p><p>  You can get here in an hour and a half from Tunis airport or in half an hour from <span>Monastir airport.</span> </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The resort was built in 1979 on a wasteland.  Architects tried to ‚Äúage‚Äù this city as much as possible, giving it a natural look.  All buildings are designed in the classic Tunisian style and are made of white stone.  The streets are overly narrowed.  Around the port, the area is stylized as a traditional fishing village, turning into a calm medina. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Port </h2>

    <p>  The port capacity is 300 boats or yachts.  In this place there is an opportunity to ride on real pirate brig and dive into the abyss of the sea on bathyscaphes.  Fans of a peaceful sea walk can rent catamarans.  In addition, you can negotiate with the fishermen and go fishing in the open sea. </p><p>  Near the entrance to the port, which is stylized as a fabulous gate, there are musical fountains.  Nearby is a small zoo and a children's park, exotic sweets are sold nearby.  A great place to walk with your family, isn't it? </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Sousse is the main city, the beaches in Port El Kantaoui are much cleaner.  Clear azure seawater is ideal for diving.  At this point, the quality of the sand is second only to the sand of Mahdia.  The resort is justly proud of its beaches, because they are considered one of the best in the country.  Their territories are often bordered by hotels and are considered private.  At this place you can enjoy water skiing and catamarans or paragliding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Port El Kantaoui Hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/489009.jpg" width="600"></div>

There is a huge variety of entertainment for children and adults.  At the same time, some tourists often go to Sousse in order to compare its beaches with Port el Kantaoui or visit the sights and museums of the neighboring city. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Port el Kantaoui, the photo of which is presented in the article, is the best place for lovers of club life.  In the evening, the port is filled with chic yachts of millionaires who came here to have a good time.  In this place you can easily find entertainment to your taste: discos, bars, theatrical performances and dance shows will long be remembered for the atmosphere of general fun and celebration.  If you are a gambler, just five minutes from here there is a casino with gaming tables and slot machines, entertainment shows and restaurants. </p><h2>  Alcohol </h2><p>  There are several exclusive sellers of alcohol.  The cafe sells local wine and beer.  True fans of the foamy drink do not like unusual beer.  In addition, it costs 3 dinars per bottle, which is quite expensive. </p><p>  But the quality of the wine is much better, since Tunisia (including Port el Kantaoui) has long been a colony of France, and the Arabs were able to adopt the traditions of making a fragrant drink from the French. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Rest here will provide an opportunity to explore the cultural and historical heritage of the area.  You can devote all day to viewing the Roman ruins in the Arc, go to the Friguya wildlife park, and go on a trip and visit Kairouan and El Jem.  A huge number of pleasant memories in your heart will leave a trip to Sousse, which is a few kilometers from here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sousse Port El Kantaoui" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/489010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The shops </h2><p>  As an entertainment you can go shopping located on the main street.  The owners are trying to attract visitors to them, each time inventing something unusual.  Inside the shops there is no variety of prices and assortment; they sell about the same thing at the same prices. </p><p>  There is an area decorated with aircraft parts, and local craftsmen from iron trash collect real sculptures. </p><h2>  Golf </h2><p>  Port el Kantaoui is one of the largest golf centers in the world.  It often hosts not only amateur championships, but also tournaments of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) series.  If you want to play golf at least once in your life, do it here.  Playing on the field costs $ 40-60, you will need to pay another $ 50 to rent balls and clubs. </p><p>  There are two main fields: Sea Course - has 18 holes and starts near the beach, and Panorama Course - has 18 holes, starts from a hill and is considered more difficult. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Port El Kantaoui photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/489011.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Port el Kantaoui is considered to be a great place for sports.  Here you can go water skiing, scuba diving, fishing or windsurfing.  By renting a boat, you can go out to sea and enjoy the dolphins.  <span>Holidays in Tunisia, the</span> prices for which are quite affordable (on average a week of stay will cost you 30,000 rubles), offers all these entertainments.  There are volleyball courts, 11 tennis courts and horse rental.  Those who want to tickle their nerves can go deep into the Sahara: here you can visit the shooting locations of the legendary Star Wars and the housing of a typical Berber family.  There is also a water park, a zoo, a musical fountain and Hannibal, an amusement park. </p><h2>  Rental Property </h2><p>  Walk along the boulevard called Chott Meriam - here you can find a quiet place where summer villas are buried in ever-blooming gardens.  It is possible to rent an apartment or villa, but this area is far from the main places of Port El Kantaoui, therefore, without a car you will not be easy to get to. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Every tourist will find the masu of entertainment that Tunisia is so rich in.  Port El Kantaoui provides an opportunity to see wooden carved pirate ships, on which you can go for several hours to the open sea.  During a unique cruise, a very tasty lunch is served. </p>

    <p>  Port El Kantaoui - Sousse - excellent transport links.  Tourists can easily explore the surroundings, while traveling only by public transport.  Some choose trains that often run between Mahdia and Sousse. </p><p>  Of course, there are little yellow taxis here.  Many <span>hotels in Port El Kantaoui</span> offer them for use by their vacationers.  They have a taximeter installed, but it is better to insist that it be turned off, and agree in advance on the cost of the trip.  The road to Sousse from Port El Kantaoui costs about 10 dinars. </p><p>  If you come to rest here, you will be delighted with the beauty of white cozy houses, local landscapes, a clean port, densely filled with chic yachts, as well as the azure sea with amazingly clear water. </p>
