  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Society as a System in Sociology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>Society as a system in sociology</strong> begins to be seen from the earliest stages of the development of scientific thought.  The concept of ‚Äúsocial system‚Äù has been scientifically developed in the modern sense relatively recently, in connection with the emergence of a <span>systematic approach</span> in science. </p><p>  There are more than 50 definitions of a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù in various fields of social sciences.  The generalized definition can be formulated as follows.  <strong>A system</strong> is a combination of various elements that are interconnected and form a single whole.  Moreover, society as a system in sociology in the formation of new forms becomes a new element in relation to existing ones.  So, the system is something independent, and on the other hand it depends on all the elements included in it. </p><p>  <strong>Systemic connections</strong> that exist between the elements of society are characterized by multilevel.  They exist between the individual elements of one system and between the system as a whole and each of its elements separately.  Since systems can also include subsystems, this doubles the possible number of links in them. </p><p>  Separate subsystems are in a certain subordination to each other, therefore, the study of subsystems allows to reveal the laws of development of the entire system completely. </p><p>  <strong>Society as a system in sociology is</strong> characterized by integrity, only at which its existence is possible.  It is characterized by a certain structure (interconnection of elements) expressing its qualitative certainty. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Structural relations in the system of society depend on the place of a particular element, therefore the development of the structure of society is expressed in the interaction of its main elements with secondary ones (example: leader and team).  The development of elements leads to an increase in the number of system connections.  This means that all changes in the structure change the system itself.  It, in turn, also affects the structure through the elements, contributing to or inhibiting their development. </p><p>  Thus, society as a system in sociology has the <strong>laws of development</strong> .  Society is a fundamental category in sociological science.  In science, it is understood as a broad community of people, as well as a form of social communication uniting individuals and groups into a certain integrity on the basis of joint activity and a common culture.  All researchers recognize society as a complex holistic education and social organism.  There is no disagreement that the study and analysis of society requires a systematic approach. </p><p>  So, <strong>society</strong> is a very complex system, characterized by an internal structure.  For example, the structure of the <span>labor collective,</span> territorial community (city, village), ethnic <span>community, social</span> class, etc. </p>

    <p>  Society as a system in sociology is characterized by human nature and nature.  It is simultaneously the <span>sphere of</span> human <span>activity</span> and its product.  The initial element of the system is <strong>personality</strong> .  People interact with each other, which turns them from individual individuals into a social system. </p>

    <p>  Highlight the concepts of open and closed society.  These concepts were introduced by K. Popper to describe the cultural-historical and political systems that were characteristic of various societies at certain stages of development. </p><p>  <strong>A closed society in sociology</strong> is a <span>type of society</span> that can be characterized by a static <span>social structure,</span> low mobility, rare innovations, traditionalism of structure and ideology.  In such a society, most of its members willingly recognize the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are intended for them.  As a rule, these are totalitarian or authoritarian societies. </p><p>  <strong>An open society in sociology</strong> is a type of society characterized by a dynamic structure, high mobility, criticism, the desire for innovation, individualism and a pluralistic ideology.  In such a society, a person can choose moral and ideological values.  It does not have a single state ideology, and the constitution guarantees <span>individual freedom.</span>  These are democratic societies. </p>
