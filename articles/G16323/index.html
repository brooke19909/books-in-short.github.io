    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In order not to be disappointed upon arrival, it is important to prepare yourself in advance for some negative moments that you may encounter at a resort hotel (including <span>Sentido Lykia Resort &amp; SPA 5 *).</span>  <span>Many travelers have already acquired a tour to this complex, and therefore you will not have a shortage of information.</span>  <span>You must be aware of such negative reviews:</span> </p><ul><li>  only live music is provided from the evening animation and nothing else (for brighter and noisier leisure you can go to numerous nightclubs located nearby); </li><li>  in the lobby area there is a smell of dampness, as if there is a pool or a fountain in the room (although there are none in this area); </li><li>  guests are not helped to bring suitcases to the room, which is unacceptable for a five-star resort; </li><li>  for guests who have pre-booked rooms, a shuttle service is provided, but, in fact, they only give you the contacts of the agency, in which you will have to book a car yourself); </li><li>  the flooring is damaged in many places (this applies to both rooms and public areas); </li><li>  very slow free wireless Internet (high-speed signal will cost you 5 euros per day); </li><li>  one gets the impression that the hotel management saves energy by air conditioning (the normal air temperature in the rooms is set only after numerous complaints from guests); </li><li>  the rocky bottom on the beach forces you to enter the sea in special rubber slippers; </li><li>  insufficiently thorough cleaning of the rooms (dust remains under the beds, the balcony is also not clean enough); </li><li>  the main restaurant‚Äôs menu has few traditional Turkish sweets (mainly mousse cakes); </li><li>  early in the morning, lawn mowers work in the park, which can interfere with the relaxation of guests who prefer to sleep with the windows open (and this has to be done, since air conditioning leaves much to be desired); </li><li>  high prices for accommodation (the price tag does not correlate with the design and equipment of rooms); </li><li>  small portions in a la carte restaurants (despite the fact that the prices are quite high); </li><li>  the bars do not provide snacks - only drinks (thus, you will not be able to have a snack during the day between main meals); </li><li>  uncomfortable hard pillows on which it is simply impossible to sleep (moreover, if you ask at the reception to replace them, you will not be able to offer any alternative). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Fans of a relaxing holiday and high-quality European service with confidence choose the resort complex <span>Sentido Lykia Resort &amp; SPA 5 *</span> .
