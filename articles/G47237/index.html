To make your first products, you need to master knitting with <span>slippers.</span>  Getting to work, you will have to find out many points: how many loops will be needed to knit the required size, how much yarn is needed, what part should be knitted first, which threads are best used.  Many questions arise in the process of work.  Therefore, if knitting home slippers with knitting needles is done for the first time, it is best to take on a simpler model. </p><p>  When choosing a size, the sole length should be taken as a basis.  And when deciding on yarn, it is necessary to consider that the appearance of slippers will largely depend on the thickness and composition of the threads.  In this case, it is worth buying yarn that contains a large proportion of wool.  This will ensure comfortable wearing due to better elasticity.  Before deciding on a knitting pattern, you need to know that not every type of knitting is suitable for slippers.  It should be understood how the properties of the product depend on the type of knitting.  So, for example, a scarf made with a scarf will be better stretched in width than in length. </p><p>  If knitting needles with slippers, then in some cases a pattern will be required, in others a pattern.  Free patterns and models with a description of knitting can be easily found on sites on the network. </p><p>  Performing work with the help of two knitting needles, slippers are made in parts, while using a handkerchief.  Then they are connected using threads, the seam should pass along the sole.  In this case, you need to correctly calculate the required number of loops per desired size. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The original knitting of slippers can be made from the remains of yarn.  The resulting models resemble loafers.  For their production, any thread is suitable: the remains of wool, synthetics or a mixture thereof.  The main thing is that the yarn is the same thickness.  It is best to take cotton threads - in such slippers the leg will breathe well. </p><p>  Knitting starts from the sole, and the method does not play a special role: whether it is a column, a longitudinal or transverse pattern.  As a result, an oval fabric narrowing to the heel area should come out.  In order not to be mistaken, it is necessary to prepare a pattern, outlining the foot on paper, this will help to make the soles the same for both legs.  Tying the element, it must be applied to the pattern, and where necessary, add or reduce the number of loops. </p><p>  It‚Äôs more convenient to knit in the transverse direction, in which case it is easier to adjust the width of the row.  Performing the sole of the first slipper, it is necessary to mark all the places where the increments and loops were made: this will simplify the creation of the second slipper.  Then the remaining elements are knitted, which are eventually sewn with the sole. </p><p>  Today, there are many models, and knitting with slippers or crochets is a very exciting activity.  For example, any craftswoman can master <span>knitting Japanese</span> slippers that do not require much experience.  They begin to make them with an elastic band, then they switch to the garter method of knitting.  The finished product is folded in half and sewn from the sides. </p><p>  For guests you can knit slippers from the squares.  This is a quick and easy way.  Eight squares are created, which are stitched into two strips.  The first includes five elements, the second three.  Then the strips are sewn together, the sole of natural suede or leatherette is added to them - and the slippers are ready.  To decorate them, you can embroider in the form of names. </p><p>  <span>Knitted slippers</span> can be used as socks if the house is cold.  Winter shoes are best knitted from woolen yarn, and summer shoes from cotton, while the density can vary. </p><p>  Knitting slippers with knitting needles will help provide all family members with home shoes, as well as make a wonderful gift to friends and relatives. </p>
