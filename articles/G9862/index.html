The model debuted in 2017.  Compared to other budget-friendly gadgets, it stands out thanks to its stylish design and metal casing.  As for the "filling", it is not so simple here, so let's deal with the characteristics in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade v8 lite specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077535.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Before delving into the specifications of the ZTE Blade V8 Lite Blue smartphone, let's get acquainted with the design features.  Externally, the device has a stylish design, so it is very difficult to determine its value at a glance.  The back panel of the case consists of several parts.  There are plastic inserts at the top and bottom, they are separated from the metal surface by shiny lines. </p><p>  The smartphone is not only nice, but also comfortable to hold in your hand.  Its dimensions are 143 √ó 71 √ó 8 mm.  The average weight is 137 g. The rounded edges of the case give the phone attractiveness.  It is worth noting that the device is equipped with a fingerprint sensor, which is located on the back side.  In front there is a control panel and all standard elements. </p><h2>  Screen and camera </h2><p>  Want to have fun working on your smartphone?  Then pay attention to the screen, or rather its characteristics.  The ZTE Blade V8 Lite has a 5-inch display with a matrix made by IPS technology.  The image quality is excellent.  Color is good, saturation is at an optimal level.  The picture is displayed in HD format.  The pixel density is average (294 ppi), but this is enough to not see the breakdown into "squares". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But users will not be able to enjoy the cameras.  The manufacturer sold 5 and 8 megapixel modules.  Expect professional shots not worth it.  The main camera is equipped with a flash and autofocus, but they do not greatly affect the result.  In poor lighting, photos are blurry, with poor detail and lack of color. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade v8 lite blue specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077536.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  ZTE Blade V8 Lite: Performance Features </h2><p>  This model did not differ in a powerful platform.  The developers installed the mid-range MT6750 processor of the Chinese company MediaTek.  At first it may seem that the 8-core chip is capable of much, but in practice, not everything is so rosy.  Computing modules accelerate to 1500 MHz.  The maximum device - applications with medium requirements.  Most likely, it will not work to install and play 3D games at high settings, you will have to sacrifice the quality of the graphics.  By the way, the Mali-T860MP2 video card is responsible for the latter.  The amount of RAM is two gigabytes.  This parameter is average, although for the price category, which includes the ZTE Blade V8 Lite Blue, the characteristics could be better. </p><p>  The developers integrated 16 GB of memory.  Some volume is already occupied by system folders.  Given the versatility of the smartphone, the remaining storage may not be enough, so the user is invited to expand it to 256 GB by installing a USB flash drive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Most buyers rate gadgets according to certain criteria.  One of the important is the mobility of the device, that is, the battery life.  In ZTE Blade V8 Lite, battery characteristics are mediocre.  The device has a small by modern standards battery - 2500 mAh.  If you pay attention to the processor that V8 Lite is installed, then you can‚Äôt call the platform energy-efficient.  The screen will also consume a large amount of charge, so you should not count on long-term operation.  With light workload, the device will work until evening.  And if you turn on the game, then a 100% charge is enough for about 3 hours. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there is no quick charge function.  The buyer should be prepared for the fact that the smartphone will have to be connected to the network quite often, and also wait a long time until the battery is charged (about 3 hours). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZTE Blade V8 Lite Smartphone Features" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077537.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The lite version of the V8 is the ZTE Blade V8 Lite smartphone.  Its characteristics, of course, are slightly weaker than that of the "elder brother."  However, this was to be expected.  The device is perfect for those people who want to have an inexpensive device for calls and entertainment.  On average, its cost is 11 thousand rubles.  Many modern applications, but not the most demanding ones, run on the phone without problems.  In the variety of software, no special restrictions will arise, since the device works on Android 7. Well, and, of course, a lot of pleasant impressions will give a high-quality screen with HD resolution.  There were some flaws, but which smartphones do not have them. </p>
