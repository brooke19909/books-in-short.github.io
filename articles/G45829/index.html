    <p>  If you are a lover of the exotic, all the extraordinary and mysterious, then Bulgaria is the ideal country for you.  Tsarevo is a paradise town where high temperatures of both air and water are kept for a long time, where ancient pagan rituals are constantly held, where there are many mineral springs that can cure any ailment.  The local clean air is literally saturated with sea salts and esters of mountain plants.  But let's talk about everything in order, and start with the sea and the sun, which all of us so lack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tsarevo bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/263825.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beaches in Tsarevo are wide and very long.  Covered with sand, they can stretch for whole kilometers in length.  The waters of the Black Sea are calm, the temperature is kept at around 25 degrees throughout the summer.  This is one of the few so warm regions that Bulgaria can boast of.  Tsarevo is also a port city, however, the seaport is located away from recreation areas, so ships will in no way be able to disturb your vacation. </p><p>  Bulgaria has a very rich history.  Tsarevo is a village that was founded in pre-Christian times, but has since changed its name many times.  However, the very traditions that were inherent in the pagan peoples were preserved here in our days, although they were mixed with various Christian rites and beliefs.  For example, it is in this town that dances on a hot coal are held, which are dedicated to the holy martyrs Konstantin and Elena.  Many tourists note that this tradition is inherent only in this region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria tsarevo map" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/263824.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The great cultural and historical center of the country is Tsarevo (Bulgaria).  Reviews of historians and archaeologists about this mysterious place are unanimous - many people passed through this port, bringing their beliefs and traditions here.  The main attraction of the city is the destroyed ship "Goryanin", which was partially restored and located in the central square.  There are also museums and galleries where numerous artifacts are collected, which scientists have discovered in Bulgaria. </p><p>  Tsarevo is considered a paradise resort, a city of summer and warmth, cozy cafes and beautiful promenades.  Here you will not find noisy discos and giant markets, numerous beauty salons and expensive restaurants.  This is a place of seclusion not only with nature and ancient traditions, but also with oneself.  Believe me, such a place can only be found on the territory of the state of Bulgaria. </p><p>  Tsarevo, a map of which shows its proximity to megalopolises of the country, is a quiet corner where you can recover, enjoy the silence and put your soul in order.  Well, if you want to go to a noisy event, go to the nearest resorts, where life is vibrant, both night and day. </p>
