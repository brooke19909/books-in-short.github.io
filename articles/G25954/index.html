So, the resort complex Larissa Phaselis Princess Resort 5 * was awarded the following negative reviews: </p><ul><li>  it is not clear why there is a reservation system if, upon arrival, guests are accommodated in completely different rooms (it is possible to get into the apartments of the selected category only after a monetary reward to the reception staff); </li><li>  the restaurant constantly lacks crockery and cutlery (the situation is especially acute with forks); </li><li>  Despite the fact that air conditioners are installed in the rooms and other rooms of the hotel, they are very old, and therefore they cannot cope with their main task; </li><li>  there are very few seats in the dining room, and the waiters cannot cope with the amount of work assigned to them; </li><li>  most of the lighting fixtures installed in the room are inoperative; </li><li>  not only in the bathroom, but throughout the room terribly reeks of damp; </li><li>  the air conditioner works strictly on schedule (it is usually turned on early in the morning, when the temperature is already tolerable, and in the very heat it does not work); </li><li>  in the lobby area, as well as in the dining room in a circle, plays several tracks that during the stay in the hotel bother all guests; </li><li>  there are very few meat and fish dishes in the restaurant, and therefore they are quickly dismantled; </li><li>  reception staff treat guests very familiarly (and especially when it comes to women); </li><li>  There are many animators in the territory, but they practically do nothing; </li><li>  entering the sea is uncomfortable, and without special slippers it is also painful; </li><li>  nobody watches the condition of the furniture in the rooms (obscene words and so on can be scratched on wooden surfaces); </li><li>  there are many small fish in the sea that bite their legs; </li><li>  if you don‚Äôt hide your valuables and things in a safe, you can say goodbye to them (there were precedents for theft at the hotel); </li><li>  in the bathrooms you can find ants and other insects; </li><li>  Checking into your room, you may be surprised that no one cleaned it before your arrival (as maids hint at a tip). </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that one of the most expensive vacation options in Turkey is a resort like Tekirova.  Larissa Phaselis Princess 5 * with its low prices looks quite attractive compared to other expensive hotels.  Although this is precisely what should alert, after all, a quality vacation in a five-star hotel cannot be cheap.  This situation is largely due to the fact that the hotel has not been renovated for a very long time.  Here you can‚Äôt expect a comfortable stay in beautiful rooms (with the exception of several renovated ones).  also forget about delicious and nutritious nutrition with a huge number of dishes.  Here, the buffet resembles, rather, a school cafeteria. </p><p>  One of the main problems that the Larissa Phaselis Princess 5 * hotel does not want to solve for some reason.  - This is an air conditioning system.  The hotel is just incredibly hot.  In the rooms, in the lobby area, in the dining room and in other rooms there is a very high air temperature, which air conditioners cannot cope with.  Moreover, they are simply disabled.  A centralized system only works a couple of hours, and then early in the morning.  At this time, the room is already cool.  That is why, if you want to be able to hide from the heat at least somewhere, try to move to a restored room for a certain surcharge.  Most of them have new air conditioners, which, moreover, have an individual control system. </p><p>  The hotel management should pay special attention to the behavior of the staff (although, most likely, all this happens precisely with the connivance of the owners).  The way employees treat guests is not eastern openness and frankness, namely rudeness.  The female half of vacationers is especially affected by this.  At every opportunity, workers remind the ladies of their low position in the public hierarchy.  This could be disregarded if employees performed their duties with dignity, but no.  It seems that everything is left to chance at the hotel and is not controlled by anyone. </p><p>  Thus, experience shows that low rates in a five-star hotel is the first alarm bell that should warn you against an erroneous decision. </p>
