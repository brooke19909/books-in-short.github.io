The hotel is also called Burj al-Arab.  This chic building is located in the elite urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJumeirah, in the middle of the sea on an artificial island.  It can be reached with a bridge, the length of which is 280 meters.  The name of the hotel was not accidental.  This unique structure was built in the form of a sailboat, whose height is 321 meters.  Its front part has a special coating that glows at any time of the day.  That is why the building is visible from anywhere in Dubai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dubai hotel sail" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/225277.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Parus Hotel is considered the tallest hotel in the world.  Anyone who at least once rested in this magnificent hotel will remember their stay in it for the rest of their lives.  Despite the fact that he was assigned 7 stars in the media, he has a maximum category of 5 stars.  This is probably because the standard of living is higher than in other five-star hotels, and there is no such category as 7 stars.  And the Parus hotel could well correspond to this status. </p><p>  Going on vacation to <span>Dubai, the</span> Parus <span>Hotel</span> , you need to know that it is far from a cheap place to stay.  Those who just want to see the beauty of the building can enjoy the view from the shore.  Only guests are allowed inside.  For access control, a checkpoint is installed here at the entrance.  In order to feel the comfort and splendor of this building, you need to get into the apartments themselves.  That is why many tourists try at least one day to settle in one of the rooms.  Immediately after the entrance to the building there are 2 fountains, the design of which is made in oriental style.  Next, 2 escalators are installed, raising guests to the lobby, the dimensions of which delight everyone.  Floor to ceiling distance is 180 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dubai hotel sail photo" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/225278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Continuing to consider the main attraction of the city of Dubai - the hotel "Parus", it's time to proceed to the inspection of rooms.  It should be noted that the building has 27 floors, each of which is unique and unlike the other.  This makes each floor special and unique.  The first thing that catches your eye is that even the most ordinary room has a mahogany finish.  As for the most expensive room, diamonds were used in its design and interior, and the toilet bowls are made of special tiles with gold streaks.  Without exception, all apartments have superb sea views.  The rooms have everything you need not only for relaxation, but also for work: fax, photocopy, laptop.  Despite its size, the hotel has a total of 202 rooms, each of which has 2 floors. </p><p>  Of course, not everyone will be able to get into the room provided by the Parus Hotel in Dubai.  Prices here range from $ 5,000 to $ 30,000 per night.  But this is not the most important thing.  Even the smallest room needs to be booked in advance, as there are a lot of people wishing to visit this tale.  Available rooms are not always available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sail in dubai prices" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/225276.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <p>  The services of the hotel deserve special attention.  Having chosen Dubai to stay at the Parus Hotel, it is recommended to visit the Al Mahara Underwater Restaurant.  Its volume is more than a million liters.  You can get into such an institution on a ship similar to a submarine.  Among other services, it should be noted the helicopter platform located on the roof.  For the convenience of guests arriving at the hotel by air, check-in is provided on each floor.  The building has a number of excellent restaurants, including Al Muntaha.  It is located at an altitude of 200 meters and has superb views of Dubai.  Among other advantages of the hotel, it should be noted the attendants, who speak three European languages, one Asian, one Slavic. </p>
