Turkey, vacation in october: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thousands of Russian tourists prefer to relax annually in a sunny and friendly Turkey, without betraying her with any other country.  Very many, having chosen their favorite resort, visit only it, surprising with their constancy.  Our article is designed to help tourists answer the question of where in Turkey it is warmer in October.  But let‚Äôs start to figure out what is so special in this country. </p><h2>  <strong>Why Turkey?</strong> </h2><p>  In fact, everything is very simple: </p><ul><li>  Flight from Moscow takes only 3.5 hours.  For families with small children, this is a very powerful argument. </li><li>  In Turkey, in resort towns, almost the entire population speaks the Russian language a little bit, so there is no difficulty in speaking and understanding each other. </li><li>  99 percent of hotels offer tourists an all-inclusive all-inclusive meal plan. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-634066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23243/634066.jpg?1535216737"></div><ul><li>  Turkey is much more familiar with climatic conditions to Russian tourists than distant exotic countries. </li><li>  Among other things, vacation in this country is versatile, and everyone can find entertainment to their liking - this is rich excursion programs, sports events, and just a lazy beach vacation. </li></ul><h2>  Pros of visiting the country in the fall </h2><p>  The question of where in Turkey is warmer in October, worries all tourists who want to go there this month.  But we will answer it a little later.  To begin with, let's figure out what kind of advantages this country has for those who want to visit it in the fall.  October is ideal for a <span>trip to Turkey</span> if: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  You do not like a large crowd.  The fact is that this is the closing month of the velvet season, and tourists at this time are much less than in other periods. </li><li>  You want to relax without the screams of the children around.  Families with young children and schoolchildren usually rest until the beginning of September.  Indeed, from the first day it is time for them to attend educational institutions.  Therefore, if you are a non-family person or just tired of the noise, welcome to the Turkish resorts in October! </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-635538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23243/635538.jpg?1535216737"></div><ul><li>  You want to shop at good discounts.  The season is ending, sellers are trying to sell off old collections and get a little more profit from tourists leaving the country, so they are ready to give their goods almost at cost.  Haggle and grab the thing of your dreams for a ridiculous price! </li><li>  You are not ready to give a huge amount of money for your vacation.  All for the same reason that closing the season of trips to this country in October will pleasantly surprise you with its cheapness. </li><li>  You do not like heat.  Autumn is the ideal time of the year: there is no exhausting heat, but even in the evenings it is still not cold. </li></ul><h2>  Cons of visiting Turkey in October </h2><p>  Any medal has a flip side.  There are certain shortcomings of rest in Turkey in the middle of autumn, namely: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The weather can be extremely volatile.  Rain is not uncommon, and the thermometer at some resorts can show only 18‚Äì19 degrees of heat during the day and 12‚Äì13 degrees at night.  Here, as they say, lucky / not lucky. </li><li>  90 percent of hotels are already dismissing animation teams.  And this is a big minus for visitors who are forced to stay in a hotel, for example, due to bad weather. </li><li>  Hotel staff get tired by the end of the season.  Do not expect initial zeal, desire and strength from him. </li></ul><h2>  Where in Turkey is warmer in October: on the Aegean or Antalya coast? </h2><p>  So, you have weighed all the pros and cons and decided to go!  And to go without fail in October.  Perfectly!  In order to minimize risks with weather conditions, to get a chic tan and soak up the gentle sun, you need to choose the resort correctly.  Where is warmer in Turkey in October? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-634068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23243/634068.jpg?1535216737"></div><p>  If we consider the Antalya and Aegean coasts, then it is definitely worth choosing the first.  This is because the Mediterranean Sea is warmer than the Aegean.  So, the resorts of Bodrum, Marmaris and Fethiye automatically disappear. </p><p>  The most visited cities on the <span>Antalya coast</span> are Kemer, Alanya, Side, Antalya and Belek.  Which one is worth a visit?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Alanya, Side or Belek? </h2><p>  Where is the sea warmer in Turkey?  This question can be easily answered only by looking at a map of the country.  Its shores in October are comfortable enough for relaxing and swimming in general, but resorts such as Alanya, Side and Belek are the southernmost points on the Antalya coast, which means they have a higher temperature of air and water and a much more stable weather than other cities.  Rains here in October, if any, are generally not as protracted as, for example, in Kemer.  And the presence of sand, not pebbles on the beaches is a significant plus. </p><p>  So, you have chosen October for your holiday in this wonderful country.  Where is warmer in Turkey at this time of the year, you already know.  Feel free to choose Alanya, Side or Belek - and then precisely reduce the risk of bad weather to a minimum. </p><p>  <em>Alanya</em> </p><p>  It is one of the most inexpensive resorts, the air temperature here in October will fluctuate from 24 to 30 degrees Celsius, and in the evening - from 19 to 22. The water has not cooled yet and will delight tourists with indicators of 22-24 degrees.  In addition, this city is the ‚Äúdriest‚Äù: in autumn, rains are much less common here than in other resorts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-634069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23243/634069.jpg?1535216737"></div><p>  <em>Side</em> </p><p>  The city is a little more expensive than Alanya, it is closer to the airport and will also please you with warmed sand.  The probability of rain here is slightly higher (on average 3-5 days per month), but the temperature of the air and water is no different from that in Alanya. </p><p>  <em>Belek</em> </p><p>  This is another noteworthy <span>resort in Turkey.</span>  It is much more expensive than others, has the status of fashionable and is designed for tourists with a higher income.  If funds allow, you can safely go to rest there in the fall. </p><h2>  <span>Turkey: vacation in</span> October.  Reviews </h2><p>  Travelers who visited the country in the middle of autumn speak of rest both positively and negatively.  In many respects, the opinions are connected precisely with the climatic component.  Those who were lucky enough to find the hot sunny weather, of course, were satisfied with the vacation.  Well, others were less fortunate ... That is why it is so important to choose the right place to stay.  What do tourists recommend? </p><ol><li>  Choose Alanya, Side or Belek.  The reviews of vacationers confirm the information that these are more resilient weather resorts for autumn holidays. </li><li>  Choose hotels that have a heated pool and an animation team is still present in October.  Even if the weather does not work out, the vacation will not be spoiled - you can always swim and have fun. </li><li>  If possible, choose the first half of October for the trip, because by the 10th the weather is almost always excellent, without rain. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-635539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23243/635539.jpg?1535216737"></div><p>  Now you know where in Turkey it is warmer in October, all the pros and cons of visiting the country this autumn, but still such a warm and affectionate month.
