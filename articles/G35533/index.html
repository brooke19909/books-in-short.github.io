  <section class="page js-page"><h1>State economic policy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The country's economy is always developing according to historical and other objective laws.  If we consider it from this point of view, then we can assume that its path is predetermined, given from above.  But in reality, the economy is only partially connected with what was in the past, under the influence of such entities as, for example, citizens, enterprises, the state, its development can go in many different directions.  Of course, the extent of their impact on the economic fate of the country is significantly different.  The biggest opportunity for this is the state represented by the government.  It is she who chooses a line of behavior for implementing a <span>socio-economic strategy.</span>  Moreover, it proceeds from the set goals, takes into account the situation that has already developed in society, as well as those trends that are only emerging. </p><p>  Thus, the economic policy of the state is a line of action in this area, carried out by him and the government.  Thus, they give the processes that are taking place the desired direction, put into practice the measures by which tasks and goals are achieved.  The economic policy of the state directly reflects the course that the government of the country implements.  Its meaning lies in the expression, and then the embodiment of the interests, tasks and goals of the people and power.  And at the same time, the economic policy of the state reflects the views and positions of the government itself.  The interests of the circle of persons with whom it is connected and on which it depends are also expressed here. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the economic policy of the state is dictated by past events, earlier commitments and decisions.  To a large extent, it is predetermined by the situation in the world and within the country.  This includes the state of the market, economy, and supply and demand for services and goods, and trends in recession and growth. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that the economy of any country in the world is developing unstably, it is cyclical.  The phase of activity and growth is replaced by a phase of decline, a recession occurs, demand and supply decrease, and entrepreneurial activity is also dying out.  Based on this, it is customary to distinguish the following cycles of economic development: </p><p>  - rise; </p><p>  - economic boom (conjuncture); </p><p>  - recession; </p><p>  - depression. </p><p>  So, the type of policy in this area depends on what phase the country's economy is in.  Those who construct it are guided, first of all, by the dynamics and volume of the <span>national gross product,</span> by the value of supply and demand in aggregate, prices, consumption, income, <span>unemployment</span> and employment. </p><p>  The economic policy of the state is closely related to its internal, foreign and even <span>military policy.</span>  The ideology prevailing in the country also affects it. </p><p>  What can be said about economic policy in Russia?  The crisis, although limited, still affected the situation in the country.  The growth rate slowed down, and this, in turn, does not double the GDP for the next ten years.  But this is not the worst.  It is much more important to weaken Russia's dependence on the external market.  That is why during the crisis they started talking about the ways of modernizing the country.  At the beginning of 2011, the expert community was instructed by V.V. Putin to work out options for a new strategy for the development of the state until 2020.  This task was made relevant by two reasons: </p><p>  1) the consequences of the most severe crisis, because of which the <span>socio-economic policy of</span> Russia needs a complete rethinking; </p><p>  2) includes several reasons specific only to our country.  And first of all, it is an urgent need to update the economic course of the state, since the model that has developed under the psychological, political and intellectual influence of the post-communist period has long become obsolete. </p>
