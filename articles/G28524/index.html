    <ul><li>  The whole transport system is very well developed here.  At most stops, there are signs that tell you how soon the next bus will arrive. </li><li>  Any tourist will be surprised at how shops operate in Greece, because on Sundays there is a day off, and on weekdays they close at around 7-8 pm.  At the same time, some of them are completely closed for the summer. </li><li>  All Greeks are required to vote.  In case of failure to appear to citizens of the country may be denied certain public services. </li><li>  In 1812, the war of independence began on the territory of modern Greece.  When the enemies captured the Parthenon, they ran out of bullets, and they began to get lead from the columns.  The Greeks, fearing for their architecture, sent them lead so that they would not destroy the monuments. </li><li>  The sirtaki dance, which many consider Greek, was actually created specifically for the film ‚ÄúGreek Zorba‚Äù, after which it became popular.  Today it is one of the important symbols of the state. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  During the meeting, the Greeks must kiss on both cheeks.  Despite the fact that they only do this with good friends and relatives, they very quickly transfer everyone to the category of friends, and therefore, after the first meeting they are often ready to demonstrate their affection. </li><li>  A favorite dance for many here is Zeibekiko, which is more like the dance of a drunken sailor.  As a rule, one man dances, and the rest sit in a circle and support him with applause.  When he gets tired, the baton takes the next one. </li></ul><h2>  Laws, Police, Crime </h2><p>  When telling interesting things about Greece, you must definitely remember the local order that many other European countries should learn from. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  There are generally few representatives of the law, and on the street they can be met extremely rarely.

The origin of the country </h2><p>  The path of this state is long and difficult.  On the modern territory of the country, civilization appeared one of the first in the world.

For a century and a half of its history, before falling under the rule of Rome, the state managed to survive the monarchy, the republic, and even tyranny.  In 146 BC  e.  Greece came under the rule of Rome, and in the 6th century AD  e.  it became part of the Byzantine Empire and was it until the 13th century. </p>

    <h2>  Development </h2><p>  Interesting facts about Greece also relate to the Crusade, which took place in 1204.  During it, the Byzantine Empire collapsed, and the territory of modern Greece was divided into certain counties, the most powerful of which was considered the Athenian. </p><p>  In 1460, most of the country fell under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, and two hundred years later, the Turks also expelled the Venetian merchants.  In 1669, Crete was annexed to the territory of the Ottoman Empire. </p><h2>  Independence </h2><p>  In 1821, the first war for the independence of Greece began, which at the end of the confrontation became known as the Greek Kingdom.  Later, in the same century, the country continued to fight for its independence.  There were several more wars, as a result of which Greece managed to get back Crete and Macedonia. </p><p>  In the 20th century, after the Balkan wars, in which Greece also participated, some more lands moved to it.  In 1967, "black colonels" came to power in the country.  In 1975, a new constitution was adopted here, after which the position of the state was relatively stabilized. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Ancient Greek culture throughout the world is famous for its legends on a variety of topics.  They tell about the gods who lived on Olympus, and about the ancient heroes.  The myths about Heracles, whose father was Zeus himself, the main god on <span>Mount Olympus,</span> are considered one of the most famous <span>.</span>  An important role among the legends of Greece is played by the cycle of the <span>Trojan War,</span> which tells about all the events of the confrontation caused by the abduction of Helen. </p>

    <h2>  Hercules </h2><p>  The most interesting facts about Greece and the myths of this state primarily relate to the <span>gods of Olympus.</span>  The most important god, as mentioned above, was Zeus, and his wife was called Hera.  But in the legends, Zeus was not distinguished by devotion and monogamy, so he had many children from different women.  He did not deprive his earthly girl Alkmene of his attention, as a result of such a union, the illustrious Hercules was born.  Before he was supposed to be born, Zeus said that his child would become the lord of all earthly nations.  But Hera, the wife of Zeus, did not like this statement, and she delayed the birth of Hercules, so that the grandson of Perseus was born first, to whom <span>Zeus's son</span> would have to obey. </p><p>  As soon as the child of God and the earthly woman was born, Hera began her persecution.  For example, when he was still quite a baby, she sent two snakes to him that were supposed to kill him, but it turned out the other way around - the child himself strangled them.  During his life, the hero accomplished a dozen exploits that glorified his name. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  A unique country with a diverse culture is today an important European tourist center.  Yes, that‚Äôs all Greece.  The photos presented in the article prove how beautiful this country is.  And having become acquainted with the traditions of the state, it is completely impossible not to fall in love with it.  Despite the fact that in antiquity it was a very developed cultural center, now Greece attracts tourists rather than admirers of art and culture.  The largest city here is Athens, the capital of the state of Greece.  Interesting facts for children about this country concern, of course, ancient legends, and adults will like Greek gastronomy and picturesque beaches. </p>
