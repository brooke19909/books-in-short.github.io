The city of Rimini is in special demand.  An eventful history, beautiful architecture, fifteen kilometers of wonderful beaches - this is not all that attracts a Russian traveler to the Adriatic Riviera of Italy.  Rimini, like Milan, is a center of shop tourism.  Only here the capital of Lombardy can not boast of the presence of the sea.  And in Rimini, visiting the Rimini Fiera, that is, the famous fair, you can relax on the soft sand of one of the beaches.  And when it gets dark, go to the Old City to have dinner in a restaurant overlooking the Arch of Augustus or the Tiberius Bridge.  But where to stay in the vicinity of Rimini?  Your attention is invited to the hotel Baia Imperiale S-Giuliano <span>4 *.</span>  <span>Rimini</span> has a long coastline, which is replete with bays.  One of them is called San Giuliano.  On the shore of this bay, on the first line of the sea, the hotel we are describing is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baia Imperiale 4.

    <h2>  Nuances of a vacation spot: location of the hotel Baia Imperiale 4 * </h2><p>  Italy, Adriatic Riviera Rimini - that says it all!  Rest, of course, cannot be called cheap, but it is one hundred percent high-quality.  A few words should be said separately about the bay of San Giuliano and the resort area of ​​the same name.  It is quite quiet, calm, although there are many restaurants, cafes, pastry shops and shops nearby.  There are two supermarkets within walking distance of the hotel.  The ancient center of Rimini is two kilometers away.  There, as well as to the train station, bus number 4 runs. In the San Giuliano area, Italians themselves like to relax, mostly pensioners.  If you want fun and gatherings of youth, you just need to cross the bridge over the river.  So you will find yourself in the Rivabella area.  Reviews of tourists suggest another option, how to get to the center of Rimini.  From the hotel you need to walk to the port (it's about ten minutes on foot) and catch a ferry.  A ticket costs only eighty cents, and travel time is a couple of minutes.  The bus travels a long distance, although its stop is right at the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Baia Imperiale 4 * (Rimini) photos pose standing directly on the beach.  But this does not give you the right to take sunbeds.  They are paid and, frankly, expensive.  Towels are not allowed in the center of the beach.  But a little to the right there is a site where you can.  This hotel is small.  There are only fifty four rooms in his building.  But everyone remembers you in person and is treated like a dear guest or beloved relative.  The owner of the hotel is always present on site, greeting, inquiring whether everything is fine.  On the roof of the building there is a sunbathing terrace with a canopy and protection from the wind.  There are free sunbeds.  The hotel also has two pools.  One of them is located on the ground floor of the building and is heated in the cold season.  This is important to know for those who come to Rimini for an excursion vacation or shopping.  An outdoor pool is located behind a small fence between the Bahia Imperial and another hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baia Imperiale 4 (Rimini) reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1434356.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  Baia Imperiale 4 * (Rimini) - a small hotel occupying an old building.  But the furniture and plumbing in the rooms, according to reviews, are completely new.  The rooms are very comfortable, although according to the Italian tradition are small.  They are equipped with air conditioning, a safety deposit box and satellite TV.  Balconies overlook either the sea or a busy street with a cafe and restaurant.  However, those who had spent the night in the last rooms slept peacefully.  The blinds hid the noise completely.

Therefore, he offers his guests to decide for themselves what kind of food to choose.  Those who are aiming not to stay at the hotel, but to go on excursions, will be convenient to stay only at breakfast.  It is very convenient to go sightseeing with a light snack.  Many tourists in haste choose half board: breakfast and dinner.  And very much later they regret that they did not take All Inclusive.  The latest diet gives the wearer a tangible advantage.  Judge for yourself: even those who book <span>full board</span> pay for drinks (except those available at breakfast).  For guests with All Inclusive, half a bottle of wine and half a liter of table water per day rely on a person.  And this is not all the bonuses!  For holders of All Inclusive bracelets, an umbrella and a sunbed are reserved on the beach.  And this is a significant savings.  After all, such beach ammunition costs no less - fifteen euros a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baia Imperiale 4 Italy (Rimini)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1434359.jpg" width="600"></div>

But very different morning meals at the Baia Imperiale 4 * hotel (Rimini).  Baking for breakfast exhibit at least six kinds, and there is also milk, about four varieties of cereal or granola, various yogurts, cheeses, <span>Parma ham,</span> fruits.  Coffee, tea, juices - all in unlimited quantities.  Those tourists who took half or full board praised the quantity and quality of food in the hotel.  Lunch and dinner are served à la carte.  On the evening before, you need to fill out a form and order separately snacks, two hot dishes, desserts.  The type of feeding is slightly different for holders of All Inclusive bracelets.  They also order hot fish or meat dishes and desserts on the proposed menu.  But appetizers and side dishes for them are available in unlimited quantities, since they are set in the buffet mode.  Reviews note that two Russian waitresses work specially for tourists who do not know foreign languages.  They will help you choose the dishes, tell you which is better. </p><h2>  Food nearby </h2><p>  Hotel Baia Imperiale 4 * (Rimini) is located in a quiet place.  But San Giuliano is not a sleeping area at all, devoid of any urban infrastructure.  Near the hotel there are at least two grocery supermarkets.  There are departments where you can buy ready-made food.  The hotel is surrounded by pizzerias, cafes, pastry shops, where you can enjoy real Italian ice cream, and restaurants.  The nearest is Tiki-Taki.  But the prices in it are not inferior to those in the hotel restaurant.  What conclusions do tourists make?  If you come to Rimini for an excursion vacation, it is best to order breakfast or half board.  But if your goal is complete relaxation on the beach, then in this case it is beneficial to take "All Inclusive". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baia Imperiale 4 (Rimini) photo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1434355.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services and maintenance </h2><p>  <span>Reviews</span> Baia Imperiale 4 * <span>(Rimini)</span> characterize as a first-class hotel, fully drawing on all five stars.  The staff is very friendly, attentive to customer requirements.  The most unexpected service in the hotel, according to tourists, is bike rental.  Given the high cost in Italy, it is strange to know that you can take two-wheeled vehicles absolutely free.  Also freely accommodated in the rooms of tourists who come to Rimini with pets.  Otherwise, the services and infrastructure of the hotel are similar to other Italian “fours”.  You can send a fax, hand over valuables to a safe, park a car near the walls of the hotel, hand over clothes to the laundry, dry cleaning or ironing.  For children there are playgrounds (including on the beach).  Kids will be more convenient to feed, sitting them on a high chair in a restaurant. </p><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Hotel Baia Imperiale 4 * (Rimini) photos represent towering on the seashore, next to its own beach.  However, the reviews warn that in Italy there is one, but a significant nuance in the rest of the Riviera.  On many beaches you can’t sunbathe, just lying on the sand on your own towels.  And for the sunbeds have to pay.  And the price, complained reviews, bites.  Sun beds are in rows, at different distances from the sea.  Therefore, the price is different.  But in total, for beach pleasure, two people will have to pay about fifteen euros a day for sunbeds and an umbrella.  There are three ways out of this situation.  First: pay for "All Inclusive" - ​​then beach ammunition will be free for you.  The second is to go to the farthest corner of the beach (to the right of the entrance), where you can just lie on the sand.  And the third opportunity to save is sunbathing by the pool, and only swim to the sea.  But this tank is located a hundred meters from the hull.  There is still the opportunity to swim in the indoor pool - in summer there are almost no people there.  You can sunbathe on the hotel's rooftop terrace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baia Imperiale 4 Italy Adriatic Riviera (Rimini)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1434347.jpg" width="600"></div>

Fortunately, the distance Baia Imperiale 4 * - Rimini is quite small.  The city was built in the Antiquity, and since then many sights have been preserved.

    <h2>  What to try </h2><p>  Emilia-Romagna, in whose territory Rimini is located, is considered one of the gastronomic centers of Italy.  She gave the world parmesan, mortadella sausage, balsamic vinegar and Parma ham.  Grapes are also grown in this region, from which excellent wines are made.  So you will have something to try in Baia Imperiale 4 *.  Rimini, the reviews are unanimous, full of restaurants and typically Italian taverns.

Local wine tasting is best done at the Tenuta del Monsignore. </p><h2>  Where to shop </h2><p>  Hotel Baia Imperiale 4 * (Rimini) reviews call it a convenient platform for shopping.  Directly from the hotel gate, from the stop, there is a free bus to the Le Befane shopping mall.  This huge temple of commerce is located in the western part of the city.  Many shops with branded clothes, shoes and accessories are located in the triangle of the streets of Corso Augusto, Gambalunga and Garibaldi, as well as on the Square of the Three Martyrs in the center of Rimini.  But, reviews complain, Italy has adopted a long siesta.  The lunch break lasts about four hours, when the streets of Rimini simply die out.
