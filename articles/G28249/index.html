Amazing and good-natured staff, speaking four languages, according to the guests, is always ready to help and solve the problem as soon as possible.  Incredibly tasty and nutritious menu, a lot of vegetables and fruits, meat dishes and fish - all this was noted by many holidaymakers in their reviews.  The atmosphere of a park zone and hotel pools leads to unprecedented delight.  Saturated with rest and fresh air, travelers return to the routine city life vigorous, sunbathed and rested.
