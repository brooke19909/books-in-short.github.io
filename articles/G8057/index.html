The reasons for this are very different: a balance between the dimensions and computing capabilities of devices;  absolute silence during operation, lack of additional components (keyboard and mouse);  energy efficiency  high reliability due to the lack of moving parts.  However, if questions do not arise with the first paragraphs, then the last is not so simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix a tablet" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1088496.jpg" width="540"></div>  Now on the market there are a huge number of inexpensive tablets from Chinese manufacturers that do not differ in too high build quality, which sometimes leads to the occurrence of certain malfunctions.  In some cases, you can‚Äôt do without contacting service centers, and sometimes it‚Äôs enough to just find information on how to fix the tablet at home, and put the acquired knowledge into practice.  Surprisingly, most often it is possible to "lift" the device yourself, saving money and time.  The main thing is to constantly remember that the answer to the question ‚Äúis it possible to fix the tablet‚Äù is always in the affirmative, but you should not even start without self-confidence.

All of them can be conditionally divided into two categories: software, in which, for one reason or another, a "software" failure occurs, and hardware, when any internal electronic component fails.  Depending on this, the approach to repair also differs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix the tablet if it does not turn on" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1088497.jpg" width="600"></div>  The likelihood of self-recovery is higher when it comes to a system error.  Although in the first case, you can fix the tablet.  A broken screen is one of the most common failures that can be fixed without help.  To do this, you need to determine the designation of the display, which is indicated on it, order a new one and make a replacement.  Note that models that are indicated as compatible may refuse to work in this configuration.  Therefore, 100% coincidence in designation is desirable.  If the tablet‚Äôs work is violated due to updating system files, obtaining root access rights, attempting unsuccessful firmware, then, of course, the software problem is solved by returning the file system to its original state.  This kind of malfunction occurs most often.  Consider how to fix the tablet if it does not turn on.

Actually, it should be familiar to anyone who at least once wondered "how to fix a tablet."  The specified application is designed to work with processors from MTK. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fix tablet broken screen" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1088498.jpg" width="600"></div>  Further, we will talk specifically about tablet models on such computing cores, since they are the most common.  It is recommended to refuse old versions of the program, since compatibility with new models in the proper amount may not be ensured.  Pay attention to version 5.x.x.  This software solution allows you to write new system files to the internal memory of the device, i.e., perform the so-called flashing.

    <h2>  System kit </h2><p>  You also need to find and download the archive with firmware to your computer.  It is a set of system files, usually distributed in a single archive.  It is important that it is designed specifically for the restored <span>model of the tablet,</span> including its revision. </p><p>  Best of all, if the firmware is received from the device‚Äôs developer‚Äôs site.  So, for example, for an Oysters tablet, you should not look for a suitable product on network resources from Apple, Lenovo, etc. Also, do not ignore the ability to search for the right software solution in specialized forums if the model is not supported on the official website for any reason.  And finally, you need a cable that allows you to connect the tablet to the computer. </p><h2>  Modification Definition </h2><p>  It often happens that two seemingly completely identical devices are actually different.  For example, a manufacturer, collecting a new batch, may begin to install a different type of display matrix on the tablet, similar in characteristics, but controlled by other drivers.  Accordingly, two revisions of the same device will appear on sale, differing by the driver embedded in the firmware.  Thus, anyone who wants to figure out how to fix a tablet is simply obliged to correctly determine the modification of the gadget. </p>

    <p>  If the system‚Äôs functionality is not completely lost, then this can be seen in the section ‚ÄúAbout the phone - Build number‚Äù.  For example, in one case the version SA0001 is indicated there, and in the other SB0001.  In this situation, firmware from one device to another will not work.  Modification is also indicated on the board, which is very useful if the device does not start at all. </p><h2>  The boot process of the new system </h2><p>  An archive with firmware must first be unpacked into a folder containing only Latin characters or numbers in the name.  Then run the Flash Tool.  In this program, select the scatter file, and MTKxxx.bin, to indicate the paths to which the dialog is necessarily displayed.  The firmware mode must be set to Download.  After that, you need to press the green button to start the process and attach the tablet to the computer.  If everything is done correctly, the system will start loading to internal media. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The case considered above with the loading of new control programs is, so to speak, an ideal option.  Although service centers even require such an impressive reward for such work, there is nothing complicated in that, unless, of course, a suitable firmware is selected and a software breakdown is selected.  But how to fix the tablet if it does not turn on due to a completely ‚Äúdead‚Äù battery?  In this case, any attempts to turn on the device are useless, and connecting the charger does not lead to anything.  In fact, this is not a breakdown, but a feature of the work, which also applies to smartphones, registrars, etc. The reason is the peculiarities of the charge controller, which controls the filling of the battery with energy. </p><p>  How to fix a tablet that turns off and does not charge?  With a regular plastic card with sharpened edges, you need to disassemble the gadget's case and get to the battery.  Usually it is connected to the main board with two wires through the block controller.  Most often it is black ("minus") and red ("plus") veins.  You need to take any charging unit that produces the desired voltage (current - preferably at least 1 A), and determine the polarity of the wires - often it is indicated directly on the case.  Then solder both wires of the battery from the main board of the tablet and wrap / solder them to the cores from the prepared charge, observing compliance.  The unit must be heated (up to 50 degrees) depending on the parameters.  Upon completion, the controller will interrupt the process and the temperature will drop.  Wires can be soldered back and assemble the tablet.  If the problem was excessive discharge, the device will turn on and will be fully operational. </p>

    <h2>  How to fix a broken tablet </h2><p>  Perhaps this is one of the most difficult failures.  If repair is advisable (the device is not shattered), then you need to carefully inspect the damaged element and find the designation on it, which is a set of letters and numbers.  Then, having these data on hand, order a replacement.  Each character is important.  In fact, there‚Äôs nothing complicated about fixing a tablet.  One of the conditions for the successful completion of this operation is the correct selection of programs (in the case of a "software" malfunction), as well as the accurate determination of component models by designation numbers - if there is a hardware breakdown. </p>
