    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Experts say that the hotel was built in the forties and fifties of the last century.  However, it is not known for certain when the Beijing Hotel was exactly commissioned.  Moscow, Russia in those years took a course towards rapprochement with China.  It is believed that this hotel was built as a <span>symbol of friendship</span> between these countries.  Initially, it was already considered a hotel with a high level of comfort.  On the eleventh floor were the most expensive, exclusive rooms with a ceiling height of six meters. </p><p>  According to contemporaries, the Beijing Hotel (Moscow) began operating in 1958.  Although in the newspapers there was not a single mention of its discovery.  This was due to two reasons at once.  Initially, the building was supposed to be used as an administrative, but with departmental hotel rooms.  I must say that at that time there were a lot of such structures in the capital.  Among them was the Beijing Hotel.  Moscow developed rapidly, a stream of tourists rushed into it.  And while the skyscraper was rebuilt, the influence of the departments that were supposed to be placed in it weakened.  Therefore, the building began to be used as an elite hotel, which was greatly facilitated by high ceilings and numerous stucco molding, as well as the presence of granite, valuable wood and marble. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In those days, the "regular" for the most powerful department of the USSR - the KGB - was the Beijing Hotel in Moscow.  The hotel address (Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, Building 5 - the very center of the capital) contributed to the fact that only high-ranking guests stayed here, often being in the center of attention of the ‚Äúcommittee members‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Beijing Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1289666.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The second reason to explain the silence of the press about the opening of this building is that at the time of completion of the design work and the beginning of construction, relations between the USSR and China had cooled.  Apparently, this is why the Beijing Hotel in Moscow was so imperceptibly open to the public. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel is in the very center of the city.

    <p>  The atmosphere prevailing in the lobby of the hotel and its corridors is associated with many Soviet films.  The furniture in the rooms is made in the style of Moscow of the fifties.  Especially impressive is the truly enormous bathroom.  The beds are so comfortable that many people want to sleep and sleep on them all the time.  Those who stay at the hotel during the <span>May holidays</span> can watch the parade directly from the windows of the rooms, as all the equipment passes right under them.  Some guests were unsatisfied with their rooms overlooking a neighboring construction site.  But this minus is transient, because after the end of work the noise will stop.  As for nutrition, there were no complaints about it. </p>
