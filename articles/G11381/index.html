This oldest city located on the Volga has a thousand-year history.  Its sights occupy worthy places in the UNESCO World Heritage.  Such a "venerable age" at the same time did not prevent Yaroslavl from freezing in idle splendor.  The city quickly turned into a fairly large industrial center.  However, few people visit it in order to study the achievements of economic progress.  The revived past is the magnet that attracts crowds of tourists to Yaroslavl who come here on a string of sightseeing buses, trains and airplanes. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Of course, guests traveling independently around the country are primarily interested in the question of where it is better to stay in big cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelscombined.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Sport&quot;" class="if uuid-2670691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2670691.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists who come to Yaroslavl specifically to get a closer feel for the ‚Äúspirit of Russian antiquity‚Äù often like themed design hotels such as ‚ÄúIvan Vasilievich‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlyosha Popovich Dvor‚Äù.  Visitors can find many offers for a comfortable stay outside the historic city center.  Basically we are talking about quite decent hotels with two or three stars or even without them.  Some mini-hotels in Yaroslavl are located in capitally restored historical buildings, for example, Dostoevsky or Kuptsov Dom, which gives them additional attractiveness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the budget is limited, then you can inexpensively rent a room in city hostels.  There are also those who come to Yaroslavl with the aim of wandering around mushroom places, fishing or just taking a ride around the Volga environs.  Country hotels or forest cottages are perfect for them.  The beauty of this type of accommodation is that they are usually located on the picturesque banks of Mother Volga and are removed from industrial facilities.  For those who love sports and are a fan of hockey, hotels located close to sports halls and complexes are perfect. </p><h2>  Description and address </h2><p>  At the entrance to the city in the direction from Moscow, the Sport Hotel is small in size.

At the end of the nineties of the last century, it became clear that the local Sports Palace does not satisfy the needs of fans.  Therefore, it was decided to build the complex UKKS "Arena 2000".

Almost half of the reviews indicate that those who left them have come to this hotel more than once.  The rooms are always clean and tidy.  The staff always monitors the order and proper operation of plumbing.  However, in almost all reviews there is one big ‚Äúbut‚Äù: the main drawback is many call poor sound insulation.  Among the minuses, some also note the lack of a cooler on all floors except the second, as well as an insufficient number of towels in the bathrooms. </p><p>  In winter, the hotel is almost always crowded, since hockey fans who come to the city to watch the game of their favorite team stop here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice Palace nearby" class="if uuid-2670718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2670718.jpg"></div><p>  Despite some shortcomings, this hotel is quite popular in the city.
