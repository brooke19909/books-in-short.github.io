    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Ibis Pattaya 3 * in Pattaya is a network hotel.  Moreover, almost all hotel complexes of the network stand out for comfort and coziness.  They carefully monitor the design of rooms, and the modern design of hotels is always pleasing to the eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ibis <span>Pattaya Hotel 3 * (Pattaya)</span> is a seven-story residential building located almost in the center of the resort.  The hotel is one of the newest in Pattaya; it was commissioned about nine years ago.  The building has three hundred rooms, a restaurant and bars. </p><p>  The hotel complex has virtually no territory of its own; it is extremely modest.  However, it housed a large and beautiful pool with a compact relaxation area. </p><p>  Ibis <span>Pattaya 3 * (Pattaya)</span> is located on the second coastline.  Tourists often write that it takes no more than ten minutes to get to the sea from here.  If you plan to travel frequently to the nearby island of Koh Lan, then you need to walk about twenty minutes from the hotel to the ferry. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  From reviews of Ibis Pattaya 3 * you can find out that the hotel is located close to shops, shopping centers and main tourist attractions.  For example, the distance to the aquarium does not exceed six kilometers, and the famous jewelry center is only five hundred meters from the hotel. </p><p>  The direct location of Ibis Pattaya 3 * is Second Road or Second Street, as it is also called.  In Pattaya, streets and alleys are called depending on their location relative to the sea coast.  Therefore, it immediately becomes clear how long it takes to go to the beach. </p><p>  The hotel is quite far from the international airport.  After arrival, tourists will have to travel about two and a half hours; if there are traffic jams, the road will increase by about another hour.  However, a similar path is carried out by everyone who travels from Bangkok to Pattaya. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beach Feature </h2><p>  Almost all the beaches in the resort are municipal.  Both visitors and local residents rest on them.  The beach consists of small sand and, according to tourists, is quite clean.  Sun loungers and umbrellas need to be rented, with some bargaining skills they can cost you no more than twenty baht.  And when renting several sunbeds at the same time, you can throw off another ten to fifteen percent of the declared price. </p><p>  Beach towels are not provided at the hotel, so take care of this yourself.  Judging by the reviews of Ibis Pattaya Hotel 3 *, vacationers get everything they need, including towels, in the nearest shops. </p><h2>  Pay attention to infrastructure </h2><p>  We think you already understood that the hotel complex is not distinguished by an abundance of infrastructure.  Therefore, it refers to the budget, although in many ways it resembles a good four. </p><p>  Ibis Pattaya 3 * (Pattaya) has one restaurant and a bar.  Mostly guests only have breakfast here, however, many liked the tasty and inexpensive dinners, which delight guests of the local chef. </p><p>  The hotel complex has a large swimming pool.  Its bottom is tiled, from which the image of turtles is formed.  Around the pool are sun loungers and umbrellas.  You can use them absolutely free, and towels are also freely given.  However, note that taking them to the beach is prohibited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has two conference rooms.  Due to the fact that the hotel itself is quite compact, the capacity of the halls is also quite small - for twenty and fifty people.  They are well equipped and it will be quite pleasant to hold business meetings in them. </p><p>  Ibis Pattaya 3 * (Thailand / Second Road) has a cozy Internet cafe.  It accommodates no more than ten people, but usually in a cafe there are five to six guests. </p><p>  At the 24-hour front desk, tourists can exchange currency, rent a car or motobike, and use the safe.  This service requires an additional charge. </p><h2>  Service level </h2><p>  First of all, Russian tourists are worried about whether there is free Wi-Fi in the hotel.  We hasten to please you - all guests of Ibis Pattaya 3 * (Pattaya) can use the Internet at the hotel complex. </p><p>  The hotel provides laundry and dry cleaning services.  This service is paid, but its cost is quite acceptable for budget travelers. </p><p>  If necessary, guests can check in luggage storage.  This is done quite often, since the apartments in the hotel have a small area that should not be cluttered with things. </p><p>  Maids clean their rooms daily.  Guests in their reviews claim that they did not have any complaints about the quality of cleaning during their stay.  Rather, on the contrary, the rooms were always perfectly clean, and the towels changed even when they had not yet been used. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel compliments </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Ibis Pattaya 3 * belongs to budget hotel complexes, it is ready to provide its guests with two types of compliments: </p><ul><li>  in honor of a birthday; </li><li>  newlyweds. </li></ul><p>  If you come to rest in your name day, you will definitely receive a festive cake from the hotel administration. </p><p>  Newlyweds must notify the hotel of their celebration in advance at the booking stage.  In this case, a surprise will be waiting for them in the room. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Should I come to this hotel complex with children?  If you focus on guest reviews, you can advise you to choose another hotel for a trip with your child.  The fact is that here is a very small territory in which the kids will simply have nothing to occupy themselves.  They can only spend time in the children's section of the shared pool. </p><p>  When traveling to Thailand, keep in mind that there are no special conditions for children in these hotels.  Many large chain hotels do not even have playgrounds and clubs.  Therefore, be prepared to entertain your child on vacation on their own. </p><p>  Also in Ibis Pattaya 3 * there are often noisy companies, because of which children will not be too comfortable.  Be sure to consider this nuance when choosing a hotel complex for families. </p>
