    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The four-star Grand Ozzelik Hotel (Kusadasi, Turkey) operates according to the all-inclusive scheme, which is popular with our compatriots.  Three times a day in the hotel restaurant guests are offered <span>a buffet,</span> represented by various dishes of both local and international cuisine.  Here you can always try meat, fish dishes, a variety of salads, as well as fresh pastries and delicious desserts.  In several bars of the hotel you can enjoy drinks for every taste. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Just a few meters away is its own private beach.  Guests of Grand Ozzelik can use sun loungers and umbrellas for free.  For a fee, here you can ride a scooter or rent other equipment for water activities.  The hotel's private beach is sandy.  Entering the water here is gentle.  There is a narrow pebble strip near the shore, but then sand begins again at the bottom. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Grand Ozcelik hotel belongs to the four-star category, this place can be called quite budget.  So, for example, a seven-day stay here in August will cost you 525 euros for a standard double room.  In low season, the cost of accommodation will be lower. </p><h2>  Grand Ozcelik 4 *: traveler reviews from the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Due to the fact that today many people when choosing a hotel in a particular country rely not so much on its official description as on the opinions of other tourists, we decided to make it easier for you and to bring to your attention the comments of our compatriots who stayed during their vacation in Turkey at the Grand Ozzelik Hotel (Kusadasi).  Looking a little ahead, we note that, according to travelers, this establishment is fully consistent with its four-star category and value.  This place is perfect for a relaxing holiday by the sea.  But we will understand in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Comments of tourists about the hotel itself and its location </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, Grand Ozcelik is not a new hotel, but well built, clean and well maintained.  The hotel area is small.  There are two not very spacious swimming pools (open-air and indoor), a hammam, a sun terrace, a bar and a residential building with a restaurant.  A few meters away is the hotel‚Äôs private beach. </p><p>  The rooms at the Grand Ozzelik are nicely decorated, restrained, without pathos.  Almost all apartments have sea views.  The cleaning, according to many travelers, is very high quality.  So you will not find any ants or cockroaches in the hotel.  The bathroom has a hairdryer, as well as shampoo, shower gel, soap and other bath accessories, which are regularly replenished as necessary.  Towels are changed every day, regardless of whether you threw them on the floor or neatly hung them. </p><p>  As for the location, from Grand Ozcelik the center of Kusadasi can be reached in just 10 minutes by shuttle bus (dolmushe).  To go to the city, just leaving the hotel, cross the road.  Minibus drivers themselves will stop to pick you up.  Also within walking distance for hotel guests are various shops, supermarkets, bazaars and other infrastructure. </p><h2>  Beach Holidays &amp; Entertainment: Traveler Experience </h2><p>  Just a few meters from the Grand Ozzelik terrace, there is a hotel's private beach.  It is sandy.  When entering the water there is a pebble strip, but then the sand begins again.  The beach, according to our compatriots, is small.  Experienced travelers are advised to occupy the sunbeds early in the morning, because if you come to the beach after breakfast, then finding a free sun lounger will not be easy.  The beach also has water sports equipment.  As for <span>beach towels,</span> they can be taken in any quantity without a deposit and cards, as well as changed as necessary. </p><p>  Just note that there is no special animation in Grand Ozcelik 4 * (Kusadasi).  So, here you will be offered to play darts, table tennis and do water aerobics.  Also during the day they play games with children.  In the evenings, performances are sometimes held. </p>

    <h2>  The opinion of the guests about the food and hotel staff </h2><p>  As for food, our compatriots found it good enough for the level of a four-star hotel.  According to them, the menu always had meat, vegetables, fruits and delicious desserts.  Here you can taste both national dishes and our usual food.  It‚Äôs impossible to stay hungry at Grand Ozzelik.  True, some guests were embarrassed by the fact that meat dishes cannot be taken at the buffet, but the chef distributes them portionwise.  However, one could always approach him for the supplement. </p><p>  As for the staff at the Grand Ozcelik Hotel, reviews are mostly positive.  So, according to hotel guests, pleasant, attentive and quick people work here.  They always try to do their best to solve any problem that arises.  Especially our compatriots in their comments noted the senior manager of the hotel, who, according to them, always kept up to date and was in the know about absolutely everything at Grand Ozselik, which characterizes him as a professional of the highest class.  The tourists considered the only minus the fact that not all hotel staff speak Russian.  However, you can always explain to them without any problems, remembering a little the curriculum of the English language. </p>
