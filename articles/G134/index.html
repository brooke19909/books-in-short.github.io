Providing for bad debts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The assets and liabilities of an entity should be adjusted for accounting estimates.  In <span>receivables,</span> such an indicator is the allowance for doubtful debts - in the balance sheet the amount of subsidiaries is shown net of the accumulated savings.  This avoids overstating assets.  Since 2011, the formation of a reserve for doubtful debts is the responsibility of the organization (according to paragraph 70 of the PBU of the Russian Federation No. 34n).  Although in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation this operation is registered as the right of companies.  But when you consider that this amount should be included in tax expenses, many enterprises enjoy the right to create reserves.  You will learn about how to correctly implement this, what transactions should be generated, and how this operation is displayed in “Accounting 1C” from this article. </p><h2>  Reserves in BU </h2><p>  "Accounting" and "tax" accumulated amounts for doubtful and bad debts are very different, therefore, they need to be formed separately for different purposes. The accounting procedure is established by the enterprise on its own. The accounting procedure of the Russian Federation indicates that the amount of funds should be calculated using one of the following methods: </p><p>  - separately for each debt, the enterprise determines the amount of subsidiaries, which will not be returned and includes it in the reserve; </p><p>  - based on information from past periods: the proportion of the unpaid amount for the previous few years is calculated; </p><p>  - for each amount in proportion to the delay.  A similar method is used in NU. </p>

In the proportional method, you need to set the percentage values.  When choosing a reserve formation option, it is important to consider the purpose of its creation.  The higher this amount, the greater the net asset ratio.  For "beautiful" reporting, it should be minimal.  So the legal requirements will be met, and investors will not suffer.  In the BU, the creation of a provision for doubtful debts is recorded in the account.  63, analytical data are recorded separately for each debtor.  Deductions to the reserve are shown in “Other expenses” (accounts 91-2). </p>

    <h2>  Creating a reserve for doubtful debts in NU </h2><p>  This calculation procedure is clearly stated in Article 266 of the Tax Code.  It states that the taxpayer can create / make deductions for any debt.  The exception is interest on loans.  In the same article, it is said that a reserve for doubtful debts can be created only by the results of an inventory of subsidiaries at the end of the reporting period.  This operation should be carried out no earlier than the obligation to pay taxes has arisen.  The accounting policy must reflect the fact of the creation or refusal to form a reserve.  This must be done before the start of the year.  It is not allowed to make any changes in the current period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The purpose of the inventory in this case is to determine the timing of delay in payment of the debt.  Based on the calculations, the company determines the amount of delay, and then classifies it as hopeless (if the debtor was liquidated) or doubtful.  In the first case, the debt should be written off at the expense of the created reserve, and in the second - included in it.  Fund funds can only be used to cover costs from bad debts. </p>

This is due to the following reasons: </p><p>  1. The amount for the reserve for doubtful debts in the BU includes only the amount for the unpaid realized GP.  Debt for the sold OS and other property is not included. </p><p>  2. On accounts of BU, the amount of doubtful debt is displayed by decision of the management.  In the Tax Code, with an delay of more than 90 days, the amount in the reserve is taken into account in full. </p><p>  3. In the BU, the unused balance should be attributed to the financial results of the organization.  In the Tax Code, it can be transferred to the next period (year). </p><p>  The company must create a calculation register and keep records of reserves for doubtful debts in it.  The results of the inventory of the reporting period must be confirmed in the relevant act (No. INV-17) with the following chapters: </p><p>  - the date of the debt (3 groups from the tax code); </p><p>  - percentage of deductions (0 or 100). </p><p>  The accountant must monitor the transition of doubtful debts to bad, and transfer the balance of the amount or include it in the financial results. </p><h2>  Display of operations in "Accounting 1C" </h2><p>  Typical configuration settings allow you to track the amount of overdue debt separately for each client.  But for this you need to install checkboxes.  In the "Accounting Settings Settings" window, on the "Settlements with Counterparties" tab, specify the period after which the delay period begins.  But this rule will be valid if the checkbox “Create reserves in the NU and / or the BU” is set in the accounting policy on the tab “Accounts with counterparties”.  If both checkboxes are activated, then inevitably there will be a difference in numbers.  The reasons for its appearance have already been indicated above. </p><p>  If the debt period is more than 45 days, then during the closing of the month a reserve will be charged in the amount of 50% of the total amount under DT 62 and DT 76.06.  If the period is more than 90 days, then - 100%.  For delay in foreign currency, the amount of the reserve will have to be formed manually.  You can check the correctness of the calculations in the database in the homonymous reference. </p>

    <p>  Next, we consider the typical <span>accounting entries that</span> are formed in the database. </p><ul><li>  If the client used the old configuration in which analytics was not carried out for each shipment document, then after updating the configuration, you need to create a new accounting policy, distribute the total amount of the reserve according to the shipment documents using "Operation (control and control unit)." </li><li>  Dt 91.02 Ct 63 - the posting is created automatically on the last day of the month. </li><li>  The reserve is formed for each client.  The program analyzes balances according to DT 62 and 76.06.  If the client has an advance payment under one agreement, and in another debt over 45 days, the reserve will still be accrued.  And if this amount is different from OU, then the difference will be automatically taken into account. </li><li>  Dt 63 Kt 91.01 - posting the restoration of the reserve, which is generated automatically at the end of the month.  The amount is reduced if the customer paid for the goods. </li><li>  Dt 63 Kt 91.01;  - transfer of debt. </li><li>  Dt 63 Kt 62 (76.06) - write-off of DZ.  This posting is generated by the document “Debt adjustment” with the type “Write-off”.  Indicate the “Bad Debt Reserve” account 63 and indicate the subconto. </li></ul>

    <p>  If the company keeps records in NU and BU, it is necessary to separately change the amount.  To do this, in the document "Debt adjustment" you need to activate the checkbox "Manual adjustment".  Then, in the posting Dt 63 Kt 62.01, indicate the amount of the reserve, and transfer the balance to permanent and temporary differences.  The program correctly calculates the NPP, if the following condition is met: BU = NU + PR + BP. </p><p>  The rest of the debt not covered by the reserve in NU must be accounted for.  91.02 “Write-off of DZ (KZ)". That is, a negative permanent and temporary difference arises on debit and credit. </p><p>  The amount of debt written off, over which more than three years have already passed, should be added to the off-balance account 007 for another 5 years. But if during this time the client returned at least part of the money, then this operation is reflected in the following transaction: Dt 50 (51) Kt 91.02.  If the money has not been returned, then the account is closed by "Operation BU (OU)" for the entire amount. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The company at the end of the reporting period should create reserves for doubtful debts, that is, for those amounts whose repayment is unlikely.  The methods for calculating such amounts in NU and BU are different.  If the management decides to display the amounts not only in the reporting documents, but also in the accounting policy, then adjustments will have to be made in the database manually.  It is important to understand the purpose of this reserve.  The higher the amount of doubtful debts, the greater the net asset ratio.  For the "beautiful" statements that are submitted to the bank, this is not always good. </p>
