  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chemical and physical properties, use and production of oxygen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Four elements - ‚Äúchalcogen‚Äù (ie, ‚Äúgiving birth to copper‚Äù) lead the main subgroup of the VI group (according to the new classification - the 16th group) of the periodic system.  In addition to sulfur, tellurium and selenium, oxygen also belongs to them.  Let's take a closer look at the properties of this element most common on Earth, as well as the use and production of oxygen. </p><p>  <strong>Element prevalence</strong> </p><p>  The oxygen content in the earth's crust is almost 50%.  It is found in various minerals in the form of oxides and salts. </p><p>  In bound form, oxygen is included in the chemical composition of water - its percentage ratio is about 89%, as well as in the composition of the cells of all living things - plants and animals. </p><p>  In air, oxygen is in a free state in the form of O2, occupying a fifth of its composition, and in the form of ozone - O3. </p><p>  <strong>Physical properties</strong> </p><p>  O2 is a gas that does not have color, taste or smell.  It is slightly soluble in water.  Boiling point - 183 degrees below zero Celsius.  In liquid form, oxygen has a blue color, and in solid form it forms blue crystals.  The melting point of oxygen crystals is 218.7 degrees below zero Celsius. </p><p>  <strong>Chemical properties</strong> </p><p>  When heated, this element reacts with many simple substances, both metals and non-metals, thus forming the so-called oxides - compounds of elements with oxygen.  <span>The chemical reaction</span> in which elements enter with oxygen is called oxidation. </p><p>  For instance, </p><p>  4Na + O2 = 2Na2O </p><p>  S + O2 = SO2 </p><p>  Some of the <span>complex substances</span> also react with oxygen, also forming oxides: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O </p><p>  2CO + O2 = 2CO2 </p><p>  If any substance slowly reacts with oxygen, then such oxidation is called slow.  For example, these are the processes of decomposition of food products, rotting. </p><p>  <strong>Oxygen production</strong> </p><p>  This chemical element can be obtained both in the laboratory and in an industrial enterprise. </p><p>  Obtaining oxygen in the laboratory is carried out in several ways: </p><p>  1. Using the decomposition reaction of <span>bertoletova salt (potassium chlorate).</span> </p><p>  2. Through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide when heated in the presence of manganese oxide, which acts as a catalyst. </p><p>  3. Through the decomposition of potassium permanganate. </p><p>  The production of oxygen in industry is carried out in the following ways: </p><p>  1. For technical purposes, oxygen is obtained from air in which its usual content is about 20%, i.e.  fifth part.  To do this, the air is first burnt, obtaining a mixture with a liquid oxygen content of about 54%, liquid nitrogen - 44% and liquid argon - 2%.  Then these gases are separated using the distillation process, using a relatively small interval between the boiling points of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen - minus 183 and minus 198.5 degrees, respectively.  It turns out that nitrogen evaporates earlier than oxygen. </p><p>  Modern equipment provides oxygen of any degree of purity.  Nitrogen, which is obtained by separation of <span>liquid air, is</span> used as a raw material in the synthesis of its derivatives. </p><p>  2. The <span>electrolysis of water</span> also gives oxygen of a very pure degree.  This method has become widespread in countries with rich resources and cheap electricity. </p><p>  <strong>Oxygen application</strong> </p><p>  Oxygen is the main element in the vital activity of our entire planet.  This gas, which is contained in the atmosphere, is consumed in the process of <span>respiration by plants,</span> animals and people. </p><p>  Obtaining oxygen is very important for such areas of human activity as medicine, welding and cutting of metals, blasting, aviation (for breathing people and for engines), metallurgy. </p><p>  In the process of human economic activity, oxygen is consumed in large quantities - for example, when burning various types of fuel: natural gas, methane, coal, wood.  In all of these processes, <span>carbon monoxide is formed.</span>  At the same time, nature provided for the process of natural binding of this compound using photosynthesis, which takes place in green plants under the action of sunlight.  As a result of this process, glucose is formed, which the plant then spends to build its tissues. </p>
