For example, a loan for the development of personal subsidiary plots.  It is issued for a period of up to two years for the purchase of plant protection products and mineral fertilizers, fuels and lubricants, payment of electricity needed for irrigation, purchase of young farm animals, payment of land rent, purchase of materials for reconstruction, construction or repair of fences and fences. </p><p>  If the farmer purchases farm animals, equipment, plans to send money for the reconstruction, repair or construction of livestock buildings, the purchase of land, gas equipment, a loan is provided for up to five years. </p><p>  The loan amount is up to one and a half million rubles.

Up to five hundred thousand rubles can be issued for five years at a rate of 11.25 percent per annum. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  There are many positive reviews on loans at the Rosselkhozbank.  Customers note that loans are approved without delay.  Many of those who wanted to get a loan at this financial institution managed to do this without any problems. </p><p>  Of the negative customer reviews of loans at Rosselkhozbank, users admit that they often have to deal with the lack of professionalism of employees, because of the incompetence of which ordinary people suffer.  For example, after arranging a mortgage for several months, the borrower pays payments on time and on time, and then finds out that he has already owed a fairly large amount.  When Pustysch finds out what happened, it turns out that initially the client did not accrue interest on the loan in full, but it happened because of some technical problems.  Because of this, the entire payment schedule has changed. </p><p>  In general, problems with loans arise most often when applying for a mortgage.  If everything is normal for the first couple of years, then serious problems begin.  When calculating the monthly payment, a bank employee does not count two rubles, after which in a matter of weeks the debt grows to 750 rubles, the penalty increases it every day.  There are also cases when two pennies were not counted, which is why debt began to form again, which grew like a snowball.  After that, the bank decides to unilaterally increase the interest rate on the loan, which increases the monthly payment by about two thousand rubles.  This is due to the fact that the client did not extend the annual insurance of real estate, although in reality it was done. </p><p>  From all these examples, we can conclude that sometimes the bank does not value its customers.  Some employees are incompetent, do not correspond to their positions.  But most importantly, the bank is making efforts to rectify the situation. </p>
