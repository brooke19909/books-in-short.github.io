    <p>  August 31, 1997.  Paris.  Night.  As a result of a car accident, Diana, Princess of Wales, was tragically killed.  The funeral was a week later - September 6.  The tragedy occurred in the tunnel in front of the Alma bridge on the embankment of the river called the Seine.  Diana died two hours after being removed from a Mercedes car.  The blood of the deceased driver was found to exceed the permissible alcohol concentration by three times.  In addition, the speed limit of the car was doubled.  Only the princess' personal bodyguard Trevor Rhys-Jones survived.  To this day, he has amnesia, he does not remember anything about those tragic events (or does not want to remember). </p><p>  <strong>How was the funeral of Princess Diana</strong> </p><p>  Burial place </p><p>  Diana Francis Spencer was buried in Northamptonshire - on a family estate.  Diana was such a famous person all over the world that in the headlines of the news about her death they did not even specify who she was.  The whole world already understood who it was. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mourning </p><p>  From September 1 to September 8, mourning for Lady Dee lasted.  During this period, five million (!) Bouquets of flowers were laid in memory of the princess at Buckingham, Kensington and James Palaces (photo 3).  Their total weight was about 15 thousand tons!  In one of these palaces, 43 books intended for visitors were completely filled with notes of condolences.  In addition, such publications are not only in the UK, but also around the world. </p><p>  Broadcasting </p><p>  Princess Diana‚Äôs funeral was broadcast live.  It is noted that 2.5 billion viewers from all over the world watched them. </p><p>  Brother's request </p><p>  On September 9, Diana‚Äôs brother, Lord Spencer, urged people not to lay bouquets at Lady Dee‚Äôs house, but to donate flowers to charity.  That is what the princess herself would approve of.  As a result, part of the flowers was taken to the island where Lady Dee rests, and part was distributed to hospitals. </p><p>  Funeral incidents </p><p>  On the day that Princess Diana‚Äôs funeral took place (photo 2), ironically, <span>Mother Teresa</span> , a woman whom the deceased very much admired during her lifetime, died.  It must be assumed that the news of the death of Teresa remained almost unnoticed against the background of general grief. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Diana Princess of Wales funeral" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/273610.jpg" width="512"></div>

Her brother blamed the sister‚Äôs death for the media.  He noted that Diana was the most popular person among the paparazzi.  The whole world supported the lord then.  Indeed, the thirst for profit made journalists, eager for dirty gossip, ready to do anything for scandalous and shocking shots.  She discussed, reviewed, quoted too much. </p><p>  By the way, the princess herself was also annoyed by the eternal circle of photographers and paparazzi around her person during her lifetime.  Lady Dee never played in public, so the constant presence of the press was not a necessity for her.  So on that tragic night, the paparazzi chased the Mercedes with Lady Dee, and after the death were not too lazy to make sensational shots. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Legal aspect</strong> </p><p>  The criminal case on the death of Lady Dee was closed not so long ago.  Litigation continued until 2008.  On April 7, the investigation into the death of Princess Diana was completed.  Nine of the eleven jurors reached a verdict stating that her death was an unintentional murder due to the negligent attitude of the Mercedes driver to his duties and because of the paparazzi chasing the princess in their cars. </p>
