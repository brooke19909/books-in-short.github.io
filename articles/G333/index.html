Resort hotels amaze travelers with traditional Greek hospitality and a wide variety of services.  Picturesque beaches, mild climate, ancient architecture, numerous attractions - all this is attractive for tourists coming from all over the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Hotel 2" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550200.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Overview </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the island is not very large in size - its width is from thirty to forty kilometers, nevertheless there are places with a highly developed infrastructure, as well as sparsely populated areas. </p><p>  In general, in Rhodes, you can find hotels for every taste, starting with luxury hotel complexes that respect their highest standards of respectability, as well as small, cheaper options, such as Margaret Hotel 2 *.  Ialyssos, Ixia, etc. - villages located on the west coast of the island are considered to be relatively poorly understood.  Those who are tired of crowded beaches and noisy nightlife, as well as those who prefer to combine an economy-class vacation with sightseeing of local attractions that Greece is so rich in, prefer to come here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Margaret Hotel 2 *: description </h2><p>  The village of Ialysos, in which this small private hotel is located, is located in the northwest of Rhodes.  It is quite ancient.  As early as the fifteenth century BC, this settlement was one of the largest Dorian cities of the island.  This is evidenced by the remains of the acropolis, preserved to this day, as well as the ruins of temples in honor of Athena and Zeus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Hotel 2 Rhodes" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550199.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Today Ialyssos is a popular resort town famous for its culture and rich traditions.  From the modern capital of the island - the city of Rhodes - it is only eight kilometers away.  It is here that there are many small private hotels, for example <span>Margaret Studios (Margaret</span> Hotel) 2 *. </p><p>  The international airport is located six kilometers away.  This fact is especially convenient for those tourists who travel with small children.  After a flight to the island, kids can‚Äôt tolerate the transfer, so the proximity of the hotel to the airport in this case is a rather big advantage. </p><p>  Another advantage of this hotel is its proximity to such attractions as the Rhodes Acropolis, the Temple of Apollo, etc., which every traveler who comes to this ancient resort should see. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The area in which Margaret Hotel 2 * is located is quiet and calm.  Around the hotel there is a lot of greenery, there is not that fuss and noise that prevails in the central regions.  Tour operators position this hotel as a place where you can spend a relaxing beach holiday.  Near the hotel there are many bakeries that sell buns, hot bread, pastries, within walking distance there is a vegetable market where you can buy tomatoes, delicious peaches, melons, etc., as well as small shops and souvenir stalls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Hotel 2 Ialyssos" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550197.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Margaret Hotel (Rhodes) is a 2-star hotel, so the list of services it offers is relatively small.  The total area on which the hotel is built is only a thousand square meters.  Around the residential building trees, many flowers and shrubs are planted.  The hotel is considered small by current standards.  It has a total of forty-six rooms. </p><p>  The hotel has a truly homely atmosphere.  The registration desk is always open.  At any time, day or night, administrators are ready to solve problems.  The hotel has its own small parking.  Parking is not required in advance.  There is a car rental desk in the lobby.  Judging by the reviews of our compatriots, many Russians rented a car to drive around this small island on their own and see the local sights.  Those who do not have a driver's license of international standard can use the services of a tour desk, which works next to the registry.  Wi-Fi is free in all public areas of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A hundred meters from the entrance to the hotel there is a bus stop.  This is the final stop.  Here you can buy shuttle tickets in any direction on Rhodes, which is very convenient for those who are going to travel around the island on their own.  For tourists: group transfer due to the difficult access to the main building is not organized to the doorstep of the hotel.  The bus stops a hundred meters away. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Small, budget - this is how the Russians characterize Margaret Hotel 2 * in their reviews.  In Rhodes there are a lot of such mini-hotels owned by one family.  On the one hand, this is a big plus, as the owners are trying to create a truly homely atmosphere in their hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Hotel 2 Rhodes reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The only building Margaret Hotel 2 * seven-story.  It has forty-six double and triple rooms of standard categories, as well as family apartments.  All have a furnished balcony or terrace overlooking the patio or pool.  In 2014, the hotel was thoroughly renovated.  The rooms are equipped with good furniture, there are beds and bedside tables, a dining table with chairs, a kitchen area, a small refrigerator with all utensils. </p><p>  Standard equipment in the rooms is air conditioning, for which you need to pay five euros per day, a TV with cable TV, showing one Russian-language channel, radio. </p><p>  Bathrooms combined.  They include showers, a hairdryer.  Essential hygiene items are updated daily.  At the same frequency, staff changes towels.  Judging by the reviews, new linens are covered twice a week. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned once a day, at a time convenient for residents.  On the floor - ceramic tiles. </p><h2>  Rules of residence </h2><p>  Check-in and check-out at the hotel are scheduled for twelve o'clock in the afternoon.  According to the current rules, pets are strictly forbidden.  There are separate rooms for smokers, as well as adjoining apartments, which can accommodate 5 + 1 guests at a time. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Margaret Hotel 2 * (Rhodes) offers only a <span>continental breakfast,</span> which will cost six euros per day.  In the mornings, a buffet is served in the restaurant, which also has a preliminary menu.  However, many of our compatriots prefer to eat at nearby taverns and cafes, as well as cook on their own, buying food in a supermarket or in the many shops that are at every step in the area.  The rooms have dishes, plates, cups, spoons, forks, in a word, everything you need for food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Hotel Rhodes 2" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550198.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the prices in the nearby taverns are quite affordable, so many of our compatriots went to eat outside the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel also has a poolside bar and bar, which offers paid cocktails and refreshments. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Margaret Hotel 2 * is positioned as a family.  There is a playroom for children, there is a small office in the adult pool.  On request, extra beds are available in the rooms and high chairs in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel is on the third line from the coast.  To the public beach from the main building - just five minutes walk.  The hotel is separated from the coast by a boardwalk and a motorway.  An underground passage is not provided, especially since traffic on the highway is not overloaded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Studios Margaret Hotel 2" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the beach is sandy and pebble, with entry into the water difficult due to pebbles.  Therefore, our compatriots strongly recommend taking special silicone or rubber shoes with them, especially for young children. </p><p>  On the beach with a huge coastline there is a shower and toilet, a cafe.  For sunbeds and sunshades you need to pay separately three euros per day. </p><p>  If you walk two or three hundred meters to the left, you can find yourself on a completely sandy, more equipped beach, where there are many paid entertainment, as well as rental equipment for surfing. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Margaret Hotel is a 2-star hotel, so in this regard its infrastructure is quite limited.  On its territory there is a fairly clean small pool with free sunbeds and umbrellas located around. </p><p>  Those who wish can order excursions to Symi, Halki, the island, the capital of Rhodes from the hotel guide, from where you can reach Turkish Marmaris from the port by boat in thirty minutes.  Round-trip tickets cost twenty euros. </p><p>  In the village you can rent a boat and go fishing, and in the evening in the coastal cafe you can taste the seafood caught with your own hands.  Peace and silence - these are the reasons why many choose Margaret Hotel 2 * (Rhodes). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Among those of our compatriots who chose exactly this option for their holidays, few were unsatisfied.  Moreover, against the background of a fairly affordable price for a meager list of entertainment, few paid attention.  Basically, those who chose this particular hotel traveled a lot around the island and returned to their rooms exclusively for overnight stays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margaret Hotel 2 in Rhodes" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1550196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the service, taking into account the Margaret Hotel category, Russians rated it a solid four.  There are conflicting reviews about nutrition.  Some say that breakfasts were very tasty and satisfying, but there are those who believe that for this price you can have a great lunch in one of the nearby taverns. </p><p>  Our compatriots call the proximity of the airport the biggest disadvantage of this hotel.  This, on the one hand, is a big plus due to the short transfer, but on the other, the noise from landing aircraft often interferes with complete relaxation and rest. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the sea is excellent: warm water, a mild Mediterranean climate - all this contributes to relaxation, and the island itself with its ancient monuments, according to many, must be seen. </p><p>  Nevertheless, even taking into account all these shortcomings, most of our compatriots were satisfied with their stay at this hotel and plan to return here again. </p>
