  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tours in Newcastle, Australia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The small charming town of Newcastle is located on the east coast of Australia, which is washed by the Tasman Sea.  In New South Wales, this city is the second largest after Sydney, which is 162 km from Newcastle.  Tourists who choose <noindex>  <span>Holidays in Australia for the New Year holidays</span> </noindex>  often stay in calm Newcastle, whose population is only 500 thousand people.  If you want to visit Sydney and other cities in Australia is easy. </p><p>  Newcastle was founded near the Hunter River in 1804 as a colony, originally it served as a prison for criminals.  The sinister casemates that tourists are now happy to visit are still preserved.  Rapid development of the city was the development of coal deposits, the export leader of which is Australia.  Every day, dozens of huge ships loaded with coal leave the port of Newcastle for a raid. </p><p>  Harbor observation is one of the favorite tourist attractions.  The famous Nobby lighthouse and the promenades adjacent to it, with their many restaurants and bars, are a popular area for walking.  The subtropical climate and the hot sun make Newcastle a great place for a beach holiday, several excellent beaches are close to the city center.  Warm summers and rather mild winters attract tourists here all year round, and sea waves attract surfers who organize professional surfing competitions in Newcastle every year.  Vodafone Surfest gathers many people in Australia and even more tourists. </p><p>  In the city, in addition to many large and small parks for walks, there are art galleries, theaters and concert venues. <noindex>  <span>Holidays in New Zealand in the spring</span> </noindex>  Of course, beautiful, but fans of museum exhibits will enjoy Newcastle more.  The history of the city can be traced in the expositions of Fort Scratchley, located above the harbor, and the Marine Center. </p><p>  In addition to the usual places of relaxation - shopping centers, restaurants and nightlife - in Newcastle, tourists can fly in a balloon over the sea or visit the bush, go sailing to frisking flocks of dolphins and huge whales, and then they can slowly enjoy popular local drinks in brewery and winery.  The history of aviation, which can be found in the World Fighters Center, is complemented by a fascinating observation of the takeoffs of American fighters from a nearby base. </p><p>  The location of Newcastle enables tourists to travel not only to the bustling Sydney with its famous sights, but also to the rainforests under the protection of UNESCO.  Unique plants, mammals and birds have been preserved here, and nature is striking in the beauty of rivers, waterfalls, prehistoric volcanoes and gorges. </p><p>  A striking attraction of Newcastle is the Honeysuckle complex - former shipyards, where now there are a lot of cozy restaurants and cafes.  Newcastle Beach has a unique small pool called Gods Hole, which was carved into the rock in the 19th century for the mayor of the city.  It is necessary to swim in it when you visit the city. </p><p>  Historic Colonial buildings that have survived in traditional Victorian style have survived in Newcastle, such as the customs building, Christ Church Cathedral, train station, post office, courthouse and Scratchley Fort.  Tours to Costa Rica, the prices of which are very high, of course, are popular with travelers, but it is just a vacation in Newcastle that can give an abundance of bright and varied impressions.  Sightseeing can be done on the famous Newcastle Tram. </p></div></article>
