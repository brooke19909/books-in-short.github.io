Best villas: features, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A summer residence is happiness for a Russian person.  This is a separate phenomenon directly of the whole of Russian culture, to which dozens of scientific monographs are devoted, an informative article on Wikipedia, and even a separate word is highlighted in English.  A summer residence is a place where three family generations can gather together with great pleasure.  It remains only to figure out how the cottage differs from other buildings and why a person needs it at all. </p><h2>  Cottage is a place of rest for those who already have a palace </h2><p>  The very first dachas in Russia appeared during the reign of Peter I. Then the definition of this term gave the word “give”.  In the 18th century, so-called plots of land with small estates - these were places where government rulers could take a break from court life, relax and feel like a simple person. </p><p>  So how does a summer cottage differ from a wooden house in a village?  Residents of cities dream of a country house where you can relax with the whole family, enjoy the purity of fresh air and the simple joys of life.  In turn, those who already have a country house are building the so-called distant cottage - a place where you can do things unusual for ordinary life.  Only here can a miner grow various varieties of cucumbers, and a minister can collect Colorado potato beetles. </p>

    <h2>  Cottage - not a separate type of architectural structure </h2><p>  Around the middle of the XIX century, the fashion for summer cottages became more and more popular.  It was at this time that aristocrats began to actively build and lease territories with estates and family estates.  These places were called "master's dachas."  Old buildings, as well as idle parts of the imperial palaces, were often used as rental premises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gatchina, Peterhof and Pavlovsk - ancient St. Petersburg suburbs - are now the most popular holiday destinations.  Land in these regions costs a lot, and there are many reasons for this.  By the way, even in the city the land was worth decent money.  Several factors affect the price at once - in many respects it depends on climatic and geographical features.  If Peterhof was often blamed for the unfavorable climate, then Gatchina was a real resort for the Russian soul. </p><p>  By the way, in those days a so-called guide was issued for those who could not decide on a place to stay.  The author of the book in 1992 was V. Simansky, who among the most popular trends distinguished Klyazma, Pushkino, Mamontovka, as well as Abramtsevo and other suburbs. </p>

    <h2>  Romance in its true face </h2><p>  Anton Pavlovich Chekhov gave a good definition to the cottage: “Neither plow nor sow, but only live for your own pleasure, live only in order to breathe clean air.”  The photo of the summer house is the best evidence of this. </p><p>  Sunday breakfasts, light dresses, wicker furniture, spacious terraces, gooseberry bushes, walks on summer evenings, a river and a carefree pastime - could there be anything better than such a vacation?  The real standard of the Russian dacha was formed closer to the 20th century.  It so happened that the cottages were especially popular in the warm season.  For this reason, spacious verandas, large windows with stained-glass windows, as well as all kinds of balconies are integral attributes of country houses.  Of course, for winter holidays they were of little use, but they created an incredible feeling of proximity to nature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Country life in the 21st century </h2><p>  Today, a summer residence is a separate life and era.  A happy owner of suburban real estate can use it in different ways.  For some, this is a place for a summer vacation where you can get together as a family and invite friends.  Someone uses it to grow cucumbers and tomatoes.  And for someone, this is an ideal place to spend time in the Chekhov style.  For many, the best summer cottage is the place where you can truly enjoy peace and quiet, be alone with yourself and relax from the bustle of the city. </p><p>  At present, no one is limited by the size of buildings and household territory.  However, there is an unwritten rule - a real summer cottage cannot be huge and modern.  Otherwise, it will be the same apartment located outside the city limits. </p><p>  In the reviews, many summer residents say that they prefer old wooden houses.  With great pleasure, abandoned plots and buildings are bought up. </p>

    <h2>  Some dry facts about the cottage </h2><p>  Today, building a summer house with your own hands is not difficult.  It is enough to find an old house, still suitable for living in it, make a little repair and come with the whole family for a general cleaning of the territory, which can be finished by gatherings around the fire.  In order to make all this possible, it is necessary to register the right of ownership to a specific property.  This means that you need to buy a cottage. </p><p>  In legal practice, such a thing as a summer residence does not exist.  But there are two other real estate objects: a land plot and a residential (or non-residential) building.  To purchase, you will have to register the ownership of these two objects. </p><p>  Currently, cottage real estate is conditionally allocated in a separate category.  The cost of a cozy house in the lap of nature depends on its location, the size of the adjacent territory, the condition of the building itself.  Oddly enough, but the distance to the water (river or lake) also affects the formation of the total cost.  So, cottages in areas characterized by picturesque landscapes and cleanliness will cost a little more than plots of land located near the city. </p>

    <h2>  The most famous summer cottages </h2><p>  Each has its own concept of a country idyll.  Someone is quite comfortable living in the so-called creative chaos, someone appreciates the spaciousness and a large amount of light, and someone just enjoys life away from the city. </p><p>  What summer cottages are most attractive?  Most likely, those from which literally blows homely warmth and comfort.  So, for example, the house of Boris Pasternak, a famous poet and Nobel laureate, is still preserved in the Peredelkino summer house near Moscow. </p><p>  The famous ballerina Maya Plisetskaya often remembered her family’s cooperative cottage, located in the village of Zagoryanka.  A boardwalk with a toilet on the street at that time seemed to be “royal luxury”, and the inconvenience did not bother the owners at all. </p>

    <h2>  Summer house construction </h2><p>  It is easier for someone to buy a plot of land with a small house in order to spend time there with your family and enjoy a good rest.  And for someone this is a great opportunity to build your own home. </p><p>  Material for construction can be the most diverse.  Brick, wood, cinder blocks - all this is suitable for the construction of suburban real estate.  It is important to remember that the cottage is the place where people gather most often in the summer.  Therefore, to build thick walls is impractical. </p><p>  If funds permit, household amenities are best done at home.  However, a truly Russian cottage is a street bathroom and summer kitchen, where it is so nice to cook Sunday breakfasts. </p>

    <h2>  About how good it is in the country in the summer ... </h2><p>  With the first summer months, the owners of the cottage begin to plan their vacation.  And it is unlikely that hopes will be associated with Turkey or European countries.  Out-of-town relaxation is the best SPA-salon, which will return radiance to the skin and peace of mind. </p><p>  The happy owners of suburban real estate can rightfully be considered rich people, because they have all the opportunities to grow their own fruits and vegetables, have a great time in the fresh air, and also have a good rest. </p>
