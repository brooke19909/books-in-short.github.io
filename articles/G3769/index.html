    <p>  Bulgaria for our compatriots is also attractive in that it is possible to get to the country with various options, and the road will not fly into a sonorous penny.  From the Russian side you can fly here by plane, by train or bus, from Ukraine ferries run.  All year round, Bulgaria hosts tourists.  Beach - in summer and autumn, mountains - in winter.  Rest here is for every taste and inexpensive in comparison with other European countries. </p><h2>  The beaches of Sunny Beach </h2><p>  And yet, missing the warmth and gentle sea, people tend to get here in the hot season.  You can bask in the summer rays, dive into the transparent waves by going to the popular beaches of <span>Sunny Beach.</span>  <span>Bulgaria is</span> known to them all over the world.  They are recognized as the largest resorts in the country, have existed for more than thirty-five years and are located near the mountain of Stara Planina.  The day here is longer than in other Bulgarian recreation areas.  Due to the location of the beaches in the east, the sun starts to “work” here, it just looks out of the horizon.  Perhaps, it will seem to someone that there are few green spaces in the territory of Sunny Beach.  But this is the center of civilized tourism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  A large number of hotels, entertainment complexes have appeared here in recent years.  Therefore, those who choose a family vacation, and young people, and even those who are looking for a quiet corner, feel comfortable here.  The beach is covered with even golden sand, in more “wilder” places forming beautiful dunes.  You can find free areas or sites where for a small fee they offer a comfortable location with umbrellas, sun loungers, there are also rental centers for other equipment.  A special pedestrian walking alley called the Promenade separates the residential complex from the beach recreation area. </p><h2>  "Golden Sands" </h2><p>  Bulgaria still offers many more comfortable holiday destinations.  The beach of Golden Sands resort is called a paradise.  One hundred meter wide and stretching for three and a half kilometers in length, it is a place of fun and active entertainment, in addition to the ability to passively stay in the sun.  Water parks, individual <span>water slides,</span> sports fields, cafes and restaurants - all this is literally a couple of steps from the beach.  Here you can book a yacht trip, windsurf and dive, ride a catamaran or the famous "banana". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Sandy beach areas are located in numerous bays for one and a half kilometers.  This is one of the attractive places for those who like Bulgaria.  The beach is designed for a quiet secluded vacation, and entertainment lovers will appreciate the proximity of Sunny Beach with a rich program of active pastimes. </p><h2>  Resort Sozopol </h2><p>  Sozopol, founded by the Greeks in the 4th century, is the country's historical pride.  However, not only contact with the past makes this city popular with tourists.  Gorgeous panoramic views from the rocky shores, as well as beaches framed by stone capes, distinguish Sozopol from other resorts.  And at a depth of twenty meters from the coast here you can see a unique sight - an apocalyptic composition of large columns. </p><h2>  The village of Pomorie </h2><p>  The unique health microclimate of the resort village of Pomorie allows you to spend time not only with pleasure, but also with benefit.  The beaches stretched for more than four kilometers. </p>

    <p>  And even the sand here is healing, it contains iron, and the mud from the local lake is used in the treatment of dozens of ailments.  Pomorie is distinguished by a comfortable temperature during the holiday season, which, incidentally, lasts until the month of October. </p><h2>  Dunes </h2><p>  It is difficult to name the best beaches in Bulgaria.  Each has its own highlight, attractive side.  For example, in the resort town of Dunes, forty kilometers from Burgas, they provide the most comfortable conditions for windsurfing.  The beach, which won the Blue Flag prize, is a semicircle inside a nature reserve. </p><h2>  Varna </h2><p>  For more than a hundred years the resort of St. Constantine and Helena has been taking vacationers.  Only eight kilometers away is the famous Varna.  Tourists can relax on the equipped sandy beach, undergo pleasant wellness treatments in spa centers or mineral pools.  For a "quiet" tan and bathing - small cozy bays. </p><h2>  "Wild", nudist beaches </h2><p>  There is one more attractive side for freedom lovers.  <span>Bulgaria's</span> nudist <span>beaches have</span> glorified the country's resorts around the world.  Topless sunbathing is allowed here on the central beaches, however, not everywhere.  But there are also specially designed for fans of "nudity" territory. </p><p>  <span>Wild</span> Velena <span>beach is</span> washed by the river of the same name on one side and the sea on the other.  There are no special amenities, and nudists have to go far to the end of the territory, but there they are given complete freedom.  The water in the sea is crystal clear, plus a choice you can splash in the river water.  This beach compares favorably with others.  The inconvenience can be delivered only by small sharp pebbles on the coast, at least light rubber shoes should be taken care of. </p>

    <p>  Another “wild” place is the nudist beach in Nessebar.  It is not official, so vacationers will not find deck chairs, cafes and other civilization services on its territory.  But here there is warm soft sand, clear water and a gentle entrance to the sea. </p><p>  The beach for nudists in Albena is called paradise.  Nearby is a comfortable hotel that allows you to stay in close proximity to the place of "naked" rest.  It should be taken into account that a local pedestrian route passes through the beach.  But if the number of people does not bother, then we can assume that this is an ideal place for nudists. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  If you have not visited the beaches of Bulgaria, reviews will help you choose exactly the resort where you can fulfill all your vacation desires.  The warm Black Sea and silky sand, healing mineral waters, modern entertainment are the key to a successful holiday. </p>
