    <p>  All the complexes of the developer provide for their own infrastructure, due to which residents of even distant districts from the center of the capital will feel as comfortable as possible: they will not have to leave the LCD in order to make purchases, have dinner, go in for sports or take a walk with children. </p><h2>  LCD "Butovo Park" </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Butovo Park <span>residential complex</span> threatens to become the largest project of the PIK company.  <span>New buildings in Moscow</span> are a luxury.  Since 2012, it was Kaluga and Warsaw that were chosen for the development of the capital, respectively, all residents of the complex will receive Moscow registration and will be able to use all the privileges of Muscovites.  The project was awarded the highest expert ratings, all commissioned facilities are populated, and residents of the new microdistrict enjoy comfortable conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  This is indeed the largest microdistrict with a building area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 1.4 million square meters.  The complex is located only 3 km from the Moscow Ring Road, so its residents will not have to say goodbye to the capital's infrastructure.  This is the first project in Russia, where most, namely 80% of the entire territory, is allocated for public buildings and only 20% - for residential facilities.  On the territory of the new microdistrict there will be 8 kindergartens, 7 secondary schools, two polyclinics, FOK, even an Orthodox church. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The complex is adjacent to the forest belt, so the air here is incredibly clean and fresh.  Houses for rent in several stages, there are already commissioned objects.  Residents emphasize the excellent location, transport accessibility, a variety of planning decisions.  An apartment here at the construction stage can be purchased for just 2.1 million rubles.  If you are interested in new PIK buildings in Moscow on the Warsaw highway, take a closer look at this option.  Moreover, the developer offers favorable credit conditions. </p><h2>  LCD "Left Bank" </h2><p>  If you are interested in PIK new buildings in Moscow and the Moscow region, pay attention to the residential complex "Left Bank".  In truth, it is located on the completely different side of Moscow, in Khimki.  Like many other PIK Group projects, the Levoberezhniy residential complex turned out to be as large-scale as it provides for the construction of several buildings with its own infrastructure. </p>

    <h2>  Detailed description </h2><p>  The new microdistrict is located just 1 km from the Moscow Ring Road, a 7-10 minute drive to the Rechnoy Vokzal metro station.  The complex is located near the most important <span>transport hub in</span> this direction, so car owners do not have to spend a lot of time getting to the center of the capital or get out of the city: numerous road junctions, highway reconstruction make life here better and better.  PIK new buildings in Moscow and the Moscow Region are thought out to the smallest detail.  Residents of the complex will have access to their own social and shopping and entertainment infrastructure of the complex, as well as facilities located near it. </p><h2>  RC "Rimsky-Korsakov 11" </h2><p>  The company PIK offers <span>new buildings in Moscow.</span>  In particular, the project of the Rimsky-Korsakova 11 complex is located in the north of the capital, just a 15-minute walk from the <span>Otradnoye metro station.</span>  This area boasts good ecology and well-developed infrastructure.  Several kindergartens, secondary schools, FOC, developing sections and circles, a stadium - all this will be the residents of the new complex. </p>

    <h2>  LCD Benefits </h2><p>  PIK new buildings in Moscow and the Moscow Region are focused on the comfort of each resident.  If the project does not adjoin the forest belt, it is necessarily within walking distance of a park or square.  LCD "Rimsky-Korsakov 11" - a clear example of this.  In walking distance from it are the parks "Joy", "Chermyanka" and the green square "Otradnoe".  They have already become favorite places for residents to walk.  The project provides for the construction of a kindergarten, school, sports facilities, which all residents will have access to.  You do not have to overcome difficulties with placing a child in a kindergarten or school - the developer has thought through everything to the smallest detail. </p><h2>  Residential complex Izmailovsky Les </h2><p>  All those who are interested in PIK new buildings in Moscow and the region will probably be interested in the Izmailovsky Les residential complex, located just 900 meters from the Moscow Ring Road in Balashikha.  But this is not the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBalashikha through which a busy highway with dense traffic runs.  This is a remote region with developed infrastructure and excellent ecology.  The Novogireevo metro station is just a 15-minute walk, and there are bus stops and ground transportation near the house. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  <span>Green courtyards</span> are a feature of the project.  The developer equipped the closed green courtyards without cars, parking lots.  Here will be laid out recreation areas, walking and bicycle paths, excellent playgrounds and playgrounds.  Clean air, pleasant coolness is what allows you to feel all the delights of suburban life without losing access to the developed metropolitan infrastructure. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We presented to your attention the best PIK new buildings in Moscow and the region.  Each project deserves special attention to itself.  The developer really managed to take into account the wishes and preferences of modern residents of the metropolis, choose the most favorable areas for them and create comfortable living conditions.  That is why, if you are in the process of choosing an apartment, pay attention to one of these complexes - you will receive the optimal combination of quality and affordable cost.
