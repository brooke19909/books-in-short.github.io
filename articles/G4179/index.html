    <h2>  From the history of the state </h2><p>  Goa people inhabited the territory of another 30 thousand years ago.  Traces of human presence in these places, which archaeologists have been able to detect, are of precisely such an age.  These are primitive tools, cave paintings.  The history of the current state began with the landing on this land of colonists from Portugal in the 16th century. </p><h2>  Arambol, Goa (India) </h2><p>  This is the most peaceful and at the same time popular place in the state.  Arambol is endless beaches, often wild, a small number of vacationers.  This place is ideal for those who prefer to relax in the wild. </p><p>  This former fishing village is 38 km from the state capital.  The area is called North Goa.  Arambol is a picturesque and popular beach.  In some places it is pebble, in other places it is sandy.  Right on the shore you can see small lagoons with <span>fresh water.</span> </p><p>  Arambol Beach (Goa) because of its isolation is not very convenient for visiting tourists.  But fans of great surfing still come here.  There are several attractive bays in the north of Arambol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Behind one of them, the trail leads to a wide strip covered with white sand.  From two sides it is surrounded by steep cliffs.  At the bottom of this valley is a small freshwater lake that goes into the jungle.  It feeds on hot springs.  Its bottom is lined with sulphurous mud.  This place was chosen by hippies who have been living here for many years.  They claim that dirt is very good for human health, so they spend most of the day walking naked around the shallows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arambol goa reviews" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/724376.jpg" width="600"></div>
