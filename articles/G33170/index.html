    <p>  The territory consisting of the Primorsky Territory of Russia and the Trans-Amur part of the Khabarovsk Territory is called Primorye.  This huge physical and geographical area includes mountains and plains, rivers and lakes, and therefore the nature of Primorye, which is characterized by elements of the subtropical and temperate zones, is unusually diverse. </p><h2>  A land rich in waterfalls </h2><p>  Primorye is rich in everything, including waterfalls, there is even a river of the same name - Waterfall.  The sights of the region are the following objects belonging to this category - the gutters of the Waterfall and Cheremukhovaya rivers, Berendey, Black shaman and Alekseevsky waterfalls.  There are also gutters with such names: Milograd, Shkotov, Smolny, Voroshilov, Benevsky and waterfalls of the Kema River. </p><h2>  Natural monument </h2><p>  The most popular and most visited are Kravtsovskiye waterfalls - they are located not far from the Razdolnoye-Hassan highway, and it‚Äôs convenient to drive up to them.  And they are not far from Vladivostok, only 100 km.  There is a stop on the road, which is called ‚ÄúKravtsovka‚Äù, from which within walking distance there is a unique natural monument Kravtsovskiye waterfalls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kravtsovskiye waterfalls Primorsky Krai" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1012538.jpg" width="600"></div>  What are they?  A cascade of five low drains is located in the Khasansky district on the Kravtsovsky stream, which is a small mountain stream flowing along a narrow rocky gorge from north to south.

On the Gryaznaya river, which used to be called Sabaycha (it itself is a tributary of the Razdolnaya), the village of Kravtsovka is located.  The Razdolnaya River was once called Suifong.  It flows into the Amur Bay, forming the Tauride estuary in its mouth.  This is how far the waters flowing through Kravtsovskiye waterfalls go, which, due to their attractiveness and location in a convenient place for access, is called the brand name of Primorye. </p><h2>  Sights of the Khasansky district </h2><p>  Work on attracting tourists is gaining momentum.  In the Khasansky district, in addition to the beautiful waterfalls, there is a natural park called "Land of the Leopard."  The name is justified, since up to 50 individuals of the Far Eastern leopard live in it now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the coastal region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1012539.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  Kravtsovskiye waterfalls are located on the stream of the same name, in the place where the cliff blocks their path, and the slopes of the valley almost close.  Waterfalls are low - from 2 to 6 meters, according to some sources, from 3 to 7. The first four are located at a distance of 15-17 meters from each other, and the last, fifth, is 270-300 meters away from them.  Along the creek there is a trail that is good only in dry weather.  It originates from the bus stop "Kravtsovka".  From the second stream, the rise becomes quite steep and requires special shoes.  There are waterfalls at a distance of approximately 600 meters from the highway, almost on the border of the Khasansky and Nadezhda districts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beautiful in any weather </h2><p>  Kravtsovskiye waterfalls (Primorsky Krai) are wonderful at any time of the year, but in the fall they are incredibly good.  Crimson deciduous trees and dark green conifers serve as a wonderful setting for a cascade of several low waterfalls.  Some of them are called thresholds in general, which does not detract from their beauty.  They are not similar to each other, and each is beautiful in its own way, has a twist.  In winter, frozen gutters are also an amazing sight.  The ice cascade seems to come out of a fairy tale.  And the path along the stream is not slippery, but sprinkled with a shallow snow. </p><h2>  Fairytale Kid </h2><p>  Kravtsovskiye waterfalls (Primorsky Territory) can be seen in an hour.  Each of them has its own name, in which its feature is reflected.  So, the lower, the first waterfall along the route has several names - Fairy Tale, Kid (due to low altitude), Stone Chaos.  This waterfall is considered the most classic of the five - it falls vertically from a height of 6 meters, breaking on an inclined plate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kravtsovskiye waterfalls how to get there" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1012540.jpg" width="600"></div>  Huge stones are piled around, creating the impression of a fabulous country.  Old-timers claim that the stones scattered in a chaotic mess were once a cornice that could be passed under a drain.  Over time, he collapsed, creating a mysterious world around.

    <h2>  <span>Stone bowl</span> and Devil's mouth </h2><p>  The second waterfall is slightly 2 meters lower than the first.  Its peculiarity is the giant cauldron formed below - this term refers to a hemispherical depression in rock formations.  Hence the name of the drain - Stone bowl.  It is quite extensive, and in the summer you can swim in it. </p><p>  From the Kid to the Stone Bowl - a 10-meter climb, it is almost sheer (it is advisable to use a rope when climbing).  The waterfall itself consists of two different ledges.  The next, third waterfall is called the "Devil's Mouth."  To the left of the jets sticks a piece of rock.  He reminded someone of a tooth - if you wish, you can imagine that this 6-meter drain and the stones surrounding it are somewhat similar to an ominous mouth. </p><h2>  Stepped and Crystal </h2><p>  The fourth waterfall, consisting of two steps of equal height, is called Step-wise.  The most recent, Crystal Falls, is the widest.  Consisting of three steps, the upper of which is the highest, it reaches a little over four meters.  And all this splendor, numbering five drains, is located in the north of Primorsky Krai.  In some notes it is noted that the water in them is clean, in others - that with a yellowish tint on the ridges, clearly visible in sunny weather. </p><h2>  Human factor </h2><p>  This beauty, representing the sights of the Primorsky Territory, was officially ranked as a natural monument of regional importance in 1984, and Kravtsovskiye waterfalls should be protected accordingly.  Moreover, there is a project called ‚ÄúClean Water‚Äù.  But all these good intentions do not prevent some fans of swag in the fresh air from turning protected areas into a landfill.  Therefore, close proximity to the highway is both an advantage of the cascade and its disaster.  I want to believe that over time everything will work out. </p><h2>  Possibility of access </h2><p>  The routes offered to this area are numerous and diverse.  Among them is a visit to a hot year-round outdoor pool.  Kravtsovskiye waterfalls become more and more popular every year.  How to get to these fabulous places? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of Primorye" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1012541.jpg" width="600"></div>  Only by road.  You can get to the village of Razdolnoye, or you can get to Kravtsovka.  As noted above, the indicator that you have reached the right place is the bus stop of the same name or a fairly large number of cars on the side of the waterfalls.  Vladivostok is 100 km away.
