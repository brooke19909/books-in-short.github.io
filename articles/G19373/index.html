    <h2>  Decoration options </h2><p>  In fact, a bottle can be made almost anything.  Making glass bottles with your own hands has an advantage over working with plastic containers.  This is due to the fact that plastic can not withstand hot melt adhesive, and sometimes even the Moment glue.  This means that this limits the variety of materials that can be used in the decor. </p><p>  Bottles can be decorated with fabric, napkins, papier-m√¢ch√© or artificial flowers, as well as ribbons, paper elements, acrylic paint, sparkles, sequins and much more.  Plastic bottles are most often painted with acrylics or decorated using decoupage technique.  Before applying soil to them, the surface is treated with sandpaper.  Do-it-yourself bottles, photos of which you will see in this article, are made using a variety of materials. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tools and materials for bottle design </h2><p>  If we summarize all the information, we note that a whole mountain of tools may be needed to <span>decorate the bottle</span> .  Therefore, before you purchase or prepare them, you should decide as accurately as possible in what style your bottle will be framed and what materials are planned to be used.  But in almost any case, you will need brushes, scissors, Moment Crystal glue.  It‚Äôs better to use hot melt adhesive.  Also, alcohol and cotton wool are needed to degrease the surface of the bottle before embellishing it. </p><h2>  Workplace preparation </h2><p>  To make the beautiful design of bottles with your own hands also convenient, you should take care of your workplace.  As it should choose a well-lit table.  Lighting matters if you intend to work in the evening or with small elements.  Also take care of protecting the surface of the table.  Especially if you are going to work with paints, glue or other materials that can stain the table.  If you intend to use small parts (for example, beads), then consider the containers in which these elements will be placed. </p><h2>  DIY wedding bottle decoration </h2><p>  Wedding bottles decorated in the style of the celebration will be a real decoration of the holiday.  According to tradition, there should be two such containers.  They are placed on the table near the newlyweds and then stored with them.

In this case, small flaps of organza, satin and velvet are used from the materials, and beads and lace complement the picture.  Bottle decoration using newlyweds photos is also popular.  Pictures are printed on a self-adhesive film, cut into the desired shape and glued to the bottle.  The edges of the photo are decorated with braid or beads.

    <p>  They also decorate bottles using flowers made of polymer clay, pearl strings, beads and other jewelry.

Master Class </h2><p>  Design options for champagne containers may be different.  Among them are painting, decoupage, or even the use of polymer clay modeling techniques or papier-m√¢ch√© masses.  Consider the most popular way - filling bottles with ribbons.  With your own hands, you can easily turn a bottle, for example, into a chic lady dressed in a satin dress with lace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY bottle of champagne" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/787326.jpg" width="413"></div>

    <p>  To complete the decoration, you will need a satin ribbon, Moment Crystal glue or hot glue, scissors and decorative elements.  The bottle should be cleaned of all labels and degreased.  To do this, moisten the cotton with alcohol and wipe the surface of the container.  Now you should cut off the tape of the required length, lightly grease it with glue (preferably pointwise) and stick it on the bottle.  If you use a <span>glue gun,</span> the process will go much faster, since hot glue, unlike the "Moment", freezes instantly. </p>

    <p>  The tapes are overlapped until the entire neck is closed.  After that, they are placed horizontally over the entire remaining surface of the bottle.  In the neck area, you need to use narrower ribbons, they will fall better, and on the rest of the surface - wider ones.  At the very bottom, you can make a skirt of ribbon or lace to match the bottle.  If there are any shortcomings, then they should be hidden using <span>decorative braid.</span>  You can decorate with any artistic elements to your liking. </p><h2>  We use sweets </h2><p>  The decoration of the bottle with sweets is considered quite interesting and original.  With your own hands, you can create, for example, a wreath of sweets that is attached to the bottle.  Or attach sweets directly to the bottle, creating candy sculptures.  The most common option is a pineapple bottle.  Round-shaped candies in a golden wrapper are glued throughout the bottle from the bottom to the neck.  Paper leaves are added at the top to simulate a pineapple rosette.  Or an easier option - fill the bottles with small colorful candies and attach interesting labels to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself candy bottle decoration" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/787323.jpg" width="600"></div>  Such a sweet present will appeal to people of absolutely any age category.  The main thing is to choose the right appearance.  Proceed from the one to whom and for what reason this gift is prepared.

    <h2>  Decoupage </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself bottle decoration using decoupage technique is loved by many needlewomen.  This option may be the most economical compared to the rest, and at the same time much more beautiful than any others. </p><p>  For decoupage you will need <span>acrylic primer, a</span> dishcloth for applying it, a brush, glue, a napkin or a rice card, acrylic varnish and various decorative elements. </p><p>  Remove all labels from the bottle, degrease the surface and cover it with acrylic primer using a sponge.  After the soil has dried, it is necessary to glue a napkin or a rice card to the bottle and leave it to dry.  It is best to stick a napkin using a fan brush.  After the product dries, you should choose the colors of the paint for the background, and use the same sponge to compare the background of the napkin with the bottle in color, then paint on the spot where it is needed. </p><p>  Having finished the design of the bottle with your own hands using the decoupage technique, you should cover the product with acrylic varnish.  Then you can add volumetric elements, if such are provided by your design. </p><h2>  Painted bottles </h2><p>  If you know how to draw, then you can make the design of the bottle with your own hands, using various painting techniques.

    <p>  You can paint the bottle, resorting to the elements of Chinese painting.  The <span>dot painting</span> looks very interesting on the bottles <span>.</span>  With its help, very unusual patterns and elements are created.  No less original look tanks made in black and white style.  They are painted, as a rule, with acrylic paints.  Pre-coat the surface with soil, and preferably twice.  You can add small sparkles, sprinkling colored areas until they are dry, or mix the sparkles with paint.  At the end of the work, such a bottle is covered with acrylic varnish.  It can be matte or glossy, depending on the final idea.  Varnishing is carried out in several layers, at least three, or even four.  This will prevent exposure to environmental factors. </p><h2>  Using decorated containers </h2><p>  Hand-decorated bottles can be used in different situations.  For example, sealed packaging for a gift in honor of a birthday or any other holiday.
