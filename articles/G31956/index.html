    <p>  The method of <span>expert assessments is</span> periodically applied when conducting research in various fields of science and technology.  For this, the most diverse forms of expert information are used.  Using these methods: </p><p>  ¬∑ Determination of the main objectives of future research; </p><p>  ¬∑ Establishing the relevance of the work carried out in a given period of time; </p><p>  ¬∑ Determination of the complexity of the selected topics; </p><p>  ¬∑ Selection of criteria for research; </p><p>  ¬∑ Identification of the most important factors and their relationship; </p><p>  ¬∑ The choice of an alternative solution. </p><p>  The method of expert evaluations allows taking into account not only the opinion of one specific specialist, but also a whole group of employees.  In the first case, the assessment of the problem that has arisen is given by each expert separately, after which individual opinions are combined through the application of a particular technique or method into one common opinion.  In the second case, several specialists look for solutions together, analyzing and processing the available information. </p><p>  The most common collective peer review method is the brainstorming or attack method.  During the search for a solution, researchers are divided into two groups.  The first group includes those who will look for possible solutions to this problem.  The second group includes those who will criticize them, supplement them and choose the most optimal way out of the current situation. </p><p>  The <span>Delphi method</span> will help to generalize the opinion of individual specialists <span>.</span>  For this, all experts are introduced to a complex of tasks that need to be solved, that is, a goal tree is formed.  Then, each participant, relying on their experience and knowledge, evaluates each factor in points, depending on the degree of its influence on the achievement of goals.  After that, individual opinions of the participants are generalized into a single one using a special formula, which includes assessments of relative importance, expressed in points that the expert put to factors, as well as coefficients that take into account the competence of the expert.  The competence of a research participant is influenced by the reasonedness of the answer and the degree of familiarity with the subject of the problem.  If such an expert method of assessment is used, then it is worthwhile to make sure that the experts do not know about other participants, and also to exclude the experts from getting to know each other's answers in order to obtain reliable data.  If the opinions of the participants differ too much, it will be possible to familiarize them with the opinions of the opposite side and the validity of the arguments presented so that the experts can clarify their assessment.  These actions will be carried out until the estimates are comparable, and their average reaches the desired level of reliability. </p><p>  The method of expert assessments can be applied not only during research, but also in the process of solving various everyday tasks related to the complexity of choice.  The role of specialists in this case will be played by your relatives or friends.  You do not know which doors are better to put, what furniture to buy, what specialty is better to go to study?  Contact your loved ones, listen to their opinion and find the best way out of this situation. </p><p>  This method can also be used by students when writing term papers or <span>graduation projects,</span> when it is necessary to choose the most suitable way to solve the problem.  The role of experts in this case will go to university teachers who are most competent in this field. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that the method of expert assessments is a method that helps to find a solution to absolutely any problem, based on the experience and knowledge of the people most competent in this field. </p>
