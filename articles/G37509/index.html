It invariably attracts the attention of everyone who wants to know and understand Russia better, its historical and spiritual heritage.  To look at the <span>sights of Yaroslavl,</span> people come sometimes from afar, sometimes from other countries and from other continents.  And the city has something to show its guests.  Its cultural and architectural heritage has been preserved very well, despite all the historical whirlwinds that have swept over it for several centuries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of yaroslavl" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/274516.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  Sights of Yaroslavl </p><p>  Most often, the image of this city is familiar to tourists in absentia.  Often people find out what they see for the first time in their life.  Even those who have never been here, the city of Yaroslavl is well known.  Sights, photos of which adorn school textbooks on the history of Russia, were certainly seen by everyone.  But even those who skipped classes and ignored the textbooks, have a thousand-ruble note in their hands.  The sights of Yaroslavl are also depicted on it, on both its sides.  The oldest architectural monument of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the Volga</span> is the Transfiguration Monastery, founded in the twelfth century.  For many centuries, it was one of the centers of spiritual and intellectual attraction of Ancient Russia, in its unique library, among other things, an ancient list of the monument of Russian literature was stored - "Words about Igor's Campaign". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl city attractions photo" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/274515.jpg" width="495"></div>  In addition, the massive walls of the monastery served as <span>fortifications</span> and defended the city from enemies.  Be sure to climb the belfry of the monastery, founded in the sixteenth century.  It offers a magnificent view of other attractions of Yaroslavl.  Here, within the walls of the monastery, there is a historical, architectural and art museum-reserve, which has unique funds and exhibits of ancient Russian culture and icon painting.  An absolute city attraction is the Volkov Theater.  It was founded in 1750, it is generally one of the first Russian theaters, and it exists to this day, despite all the restructuring and reconstruction. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl sightseeing tours" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/274513.jpg" width="495"></div>  The pride of Yaroslavl is its famous Orthodox churches: the Church of <span>Elijah the Prophet</span> and the Church of St. Nicholas Nadein of the seventeenth century, the Church of the Archangel Michael, of the same historical period.  At the <span>mouth of the</span> Tolga <span>River</span> is the famous <span>Tolga Monastery,</span> founded at the beginning of the fourteenth century.  This is an unconditional masterpiece of Russian architecture, which has come down to us from the depths of centuries. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of yaroslavl church" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/274517.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  Yaroslavl: attractions, excursions and tours </p><p>  Yaroslavl, which is a mandatory item in the routes of the Golden Ring of Russia, is one of the most popular destinations.  People want to see its sights, and many tourist structures are taken to help them in this.  But if you travel without their participation, then city tours are best done in pedestrian mode.  It is worth asking one of the local residents to show the most significant and interesting.  Among the indigenous Yaroslavl people there are many patriots of their city, and they always gladly show it to guests. </p>
