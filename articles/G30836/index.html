    <h2>  Vacationers </h2><p>  People who have been to Possidi Holidays <span>5 * (Greece, Halkidiki,</span> Possidi) are happy to share their impressions regarding their vacation here.  The first comments are always about the location and the hotel itself.  Everyone says that the hotel looks like a large and beautiful villa, surrounded by lush vegetation.  The sea here is good, clean, and the sunset is convenient.  There are also deck chairs with umbrellas. </p><p>  The staff is attentive and polite, but sometimes tired, as workers work seven days a week (this applies to the high season).  In the store, located in the hotel, fairly reasonable prices.  Many are there who buy home gifts - oil, wine, cheeses, etc. </p><p>  Guests are advised to rent bicycles and go to Olympus, a beautiful and interesting place with a picturesque waterfall on top of the mountain. </p><p>  Another plus is that there is rarely a show.  Some consider this a minus, as there are people who like animation.  But the plus is that the territory is always quiet.  So basically people who lack this peace come here. </p><h2>  Guest Recommendations </h2><p>  A few words should also be said about what people who visited the hotel advise.  Possidi Holidays Resort 5 * Travelers' reviews receive extremely positive.  Moreover, this hotel is very loved by the Greeks themselves.  And the locals know exactly where to rest and where not to.  So this is a serious sign of quality. </p><p>  Apartments are best booked in two-story bungalows.  It is very quiet and comfortable.  But, on the other hand, it‚Äôs better to settle in the main building, closer to the lobby - there is an option to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù Wi-Fi.  Although it is free, it is only in the lobby. </p><p>  It is even better to immediately pick up such a flight in the opposite direction so that you do not have to renew the apartment at a late departure.  Since it costs 50-100 euros (depending on the category of apartments and previously paid services).  And yet, it is better to take fumitoxes from mosquitoes with you on vacation.  Although you can close the door to the room and turn on the air conditioning - this is a simpler solution to the problem. </p><p>  And further.  If you want to go somewhere, then it is better to call a taxi at the reception.  Before Possidi, it will cost 6.5 euros.  If you "catch" a car outside the hotel, it will turn out to be more expensive. </p>

The hotel has a lot of Russian-speaking people who are always ready to help with advice or any recommendation. </p><p>  Due to the close proximity to the sea, convenient beach and the availability of appropriate conditions in high season, there are a lot of people who came with small children.  If you want perfect silence, you should go here in October.  At this time, the real velvet season reigns here, ideal for sea holidays - the temperature of water and air does not drop below 22-24 degrees.  But for the evening it‚Äôs worth taking a couple of sweaters with you.  In addition, at this time there are very few tourists in principle.  And there is a chance to book any room you like. </p><p>  In general, this is a really worthy and good hotel, ideal for people who dream of a secluded vacation by the sea, in a beautiful and picturesque place.  Numerous reviews are a direct confirmation of this. </p>
