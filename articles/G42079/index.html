    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Experienced tourists highlight a number of significant shortcomings of rest at the Perla 3 * hotel (Bulgaria, Golden Sands).  The reviews contain a number of negative comments, namely: </p><ul><li>  the furniture in the rooms is quite old; </li><li>  ceilings and walls in the bathroom in mold and stains; </li><li>  you need to go to the sea for about 10 minutes with a quick step; </li><li>  sunbeds by the sea are provided for a fee; </li><li>  Despite the fact that wireless Internet is paid, the speed and quality of the connection are just disgusting; </li><li>  the main contingent of vacationers is German youth, which behaves noisily both in the daytime and at night; </li><li>  in hard-to-reach places of the room you can see dust and cobwebs (the maids will not climb there, even if you leave a tip daily); </li><li>  loud music plays in the territory all night; </li><li>  there are very few empty areas on the beach where you could sunbathe without a sun lounger; </li><li>  of alcoholic drinks, the hotel has only beer and wine; </li><li>  at the exchange office of the hotel a very disadvantageous rate; </li><li>  rooms with beautiful views are provided only to European guests, and tourists from the CIS countries are often lodged on the ground floor overlooking trash cans or outbuildings; </li><li>  hygiene items in the bathroom are provided only on the day of settlement, and then you have to buy everything yourself; </li><li>  it is better to keep money in a safe, as there were cases of theft at the hotel (the hotel administration does not even try to deal with such situations); </li><li>  the buffet menu has very little natural meat and fish (mainly served with "rubber" sausages and thawed convenience foods); </li><li>  if you are not comfortable with the number, then in order to achieve its replacement you need to show tremendous perseverance; </li><li>  regardless of whether you will use the safe for a week or a day, the price is fixed (in rubles, this is about one and a half thousand); </li><li>  the rules of the hotel provide for the issuance of dry rations to guests who arrive in the evening and at night, but the staff pretends that they do not know anything about this; </li><li>  in the hotel quite often there are cases of poisoning; </li><li>  due to the lack of plastic card terminals in the hotel, you have to bring a lot of cash with you. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Arriving in Bulgaria on Golden Sands, it is worthwhile to understand that this is although a popular, but very poor resort, and therefore you will not find a service similar to, for example, Turkish.  Nevertheless, the hotel makes a rather positive impression, given the budgetary rates for accommodation.  The cozy territory located in a park zone deserves special attention.  Well, of course, one cannot fail to say about the friendly attitude of the staff with whom you will practically have no language barrier. </p><p>  The nutritional impression is rather mixed.  On the one hand, this hotel is one of the few in Bulgaria that operates on an all-inclusive basis.  Nevertheless, the quality of the dishes leaves much to be desired.  Therefore, experienced travelers recommend staying only at breakfasts included in the price, and you can have lunch and dinner in the numerous restaurants of the resort. </p><p>  Given the low stardom, as well as the honorable age of the hotel, it is not surprising that it has a lot of flaws in the form of old furniture, centuries-old dust and cobwebs in hard-to-reach places and so on.  Nevertheless, having arrived in Bulgaria, you should not spend days in a hotel looking for flaws.  Given the convenient location of the resort, you can go on an excursion to neighboring settlements, as well as make budget shopping.  If you do not like the beach located next to the hotel, after exploring the resort, you can find many beautiful and sparsely populated places with white sand and clear water. </p>
