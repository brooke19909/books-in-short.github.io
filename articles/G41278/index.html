  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Europe.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The upcoming vacation is the most anticipated event of the year.  If you are preparing for a family vacation, the most difficult part of planning is deciding on the type and route, or rather, finding an option that will satisfy both sides.  The most difficult thing is for those couples where the views on vacation differ radically, for example, he prefers active tourism, and she has a relaxed beach holiday.  Here, most likely, you will have to choose the option of separate leave or split vacation time - part devote to the interests of one family member, and part of another. </p><p>  When the views on the rest are not fundamentally different - it remains only to decide on the route.  It is very simple to fulfill all your wishes while traveling in Europe: here you can not only see architecture, visit famous museums, theaters, but also soak up the beach, watch football matches, enjoy a beer in a small Czech beer house or in the Royal beer garden of Munich.  In addition, Europe is ideal in terms of organizing independent travel.  This is facilitated by a well-organized transport infrastructure and well-established tourist service.  It‚Äôs as easy to order tickets for transport, football, a theater or an exhibition without leaving your home, just like booking <noindex>  <span>Paris hotels</span> </noindex>  or any other city. </p><p>  The Old World is a rather large territory with ancient history and a lot of places for tourism are concentrated here. </p><p>  The Czech Republic is one of the most beautiful countries in Europe, with preserved medieval castles and churches.  The legend and the biggest jewel of the country is Prague.  This city holds medieval legends and architectural masterpieces.  It is difficult not to feel the mystical energy of the city, which witnessed the most important historical events. </p><p>  From the Czech Republic you can head to the amazing country of Austria and visit the ski resorts if you wish and the weather allows.  Here you can find everything for a wonderful and varied vacation - in addition to alpine resorts, the country is rich in architectural monuments, museums and theaters. </p><p>  Impossible to miss Holland.  You can talk about it endlessly, because it is the birthplace of many talented artists, tulips, bicycles and the famous Gouda cheese.  But the main thing is the incredible atmosphere of serenity and happiness, which you charge when you barely step on this fabulous land. </p><p>  Germany is, first of all, Berlin and Munich.  The most beautiful cities with a rich history and heritage.  Absolutely clear <noindex>  <span>what to see in Munich in one day</span> </noindex>  You can only a fifth of all the attractions.  Therefore, you should not plan to cover the whole of Europe in one trip.  It is better to choose what the soul reaches for, correctly plan your vacation and start collecting things. </p></div></article>
