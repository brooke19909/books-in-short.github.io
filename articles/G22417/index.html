    <h2>  Types </h2><p>  The area covered and the degree of detail affect the type to which the construction master plan belongs.  It can be object or general site.  For the largest construction projects, including water management, the construction master plan is not limited to these types; a situational plan is compiled necessarily, in which the district‚Äôs conditions for the construction industry are characterized. </p><p>  The situational plan indicates not only the location of the construction, but also the enterprises of the construction industry existing at the facility: </p><ul><li>  quarries where sand and gravel are mined; </li><li>  factories from which reinforced concrete structures, bricks and metal structures come from; </li><li>  all communications: water, rail, road, power lines and much more. </li></ul><p>  The construction master plan for drainage and irrigation systems additionally has a designation of the boundaries and area of ‚Äã‚Äãdrained and irrigated territories.  The plan should also indicate the sequence of commissioning of each node and the boundaries of operational and construction sites, the boundaries of water drainage and flooding of territories, all bridges and <span>bypass channels.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Planning </h2><p>  The development of the construction master plan begins with a list of economic objects that will be used to the maximum in construction.  These are enterprises of energy supply, construction industry, various buildings for the needs of construction and so on.  If such objects are absent or their capacity is insufficient, then temporary structures of a similar purpose are designed.  The development of a building master plan for a general site type covers the entire territory of the construction site and includes absolutely all of its facilities. </p><p>  The plan consists of graphics and an explanatory note with the rationale for each decision of the graphic part, which includes a detailed plan of the construction site, the operation of permanent and temporary objects, legend, as well as fragments of the plan with technological schemes.  In addition, in the graphic part, the design of the construction master plan assumes the availability of technical and economic indicators and notes.  The scale of the general site construction plan can be 1: 5000, 1: 2000 or 1: 1000. </p><h2>  Sequence </h2><p>  The general plan for the construction site is usually started with the layout of roads for internal construction vehicles, while the location of mechanized installations and general site warehouses is planned.  Only after that it is possible to place all the main construction and economic facilities.  After completion of this work, the projected temporary networks of electricity, water, heat supply are introduced into the master plan of the construction project. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When performing all this design work, you need to be guided by the results of the calculation of needs for these objects, as well as special rules for their placement.  For example, the calculation of the construction master plan should take into account that the distance from food points to domestic premises should not exceed six hundred meters (here you need to be guided by the rules), to domestic and sanitary premises should not be more than two hundred meters, and at least fifty to production work meters.  Also, according to existing rules, fire breaks between rooms and between warehouses are planned. </p>

    <h2>  Design stages </h2><p>  The composition of construction master plans necessarily includes calculations of needs for certain resources, as well as for construction and economic facilities.  All this is given in the explanatory note.  In the general site construction master plan, this information is usually given approximately, based on the norms. </p><p>  When constructing water management and hydraulic facilities, it is imperative to show all devices and structures that ensure construction water consumption during the construction period, as well as a breakdown of the priority of all work on the construction of a complex or unit of hydraulic structures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a one-stage design, which is usually associated with medium-sized construction projects, then a general site construction master plan is not drawn up.  Types of construction plans are mainly listed, it remains to talk specifically about the second of the main ones. </p><h2>  Object construction master plan </h2><p>  It is being developed, as already mentioned, especially for each object of those that are shown in the general site plan.  Also, an object construction plan can be drawn up for each of the stages of work: the preparatory period, the zero cycle, the construction of the aboveground part.  The graphic part contains the same elements as the general site one, only each question is worked out in much more detail. </p><p>  Scaling is most often the same.  Construction and household facilities are located in the same way as when designing a general site plan, be sure to comply with established rules and accepted calculations.  The only difference is that there can already be no rough estimates, since there is a basis for the natural volumes of work, the norms of expenditure of resources, and so on. </p>

    <h2>  Drawing up procedure </h2><p>  The design of the general object plan begins most often with the choice of mounting <span>hoisting mechanisms</span> and machines and their specific and rational placement.  Then it will be clear how to establish places for storing building materials, prefabricated structures, where to place in-site roads.  After the completion of these design works, the remaining elements of construction are placed in accordance with the list (SNiP 3.01.01.85). </p><p>  When a variety of buildings or structures are being erected, at the construction sites should be located not only these building objects, but also numerous temporary auxiliary buildings that are necessary for the needs of the construction site, the so-called construction facilities.  Ways and roads, conveniently located administrative and industrial buildings, various mechanized installations, warehouses, technological piping networks, water supply, power supply networks are arranged for construction vehicles. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><p>  The construction master plan exists in order to provide the construction site with all the necessary conditions, household and industrial, as best as possible, so that the timely receipt, storage, delivery to the workplace of the necessary building materials, semi-finished products and products takes place. </p><p>  It is necessary that all construction mechanisms and machines work normally, so that the construction is uninterruptedly supplied with heat, water and electricity.  The construction master plan reflects all solutions to the issues of construction safety, labor protection, fire prevention, as well as lighting of the entire construction site in the dark. </p>

    <h2>  Temporary buildings </h2><p>  On the construction site, among the permanent facilities under construction, a special place is occupied by buildings that are used only during the construction period.  Their construction is designed in the first place, and after completion of construction they will be dismantled or demolished.  Also considered as temporary structures are railways and roads located on the construction site. </p><p>  For example, rails for tower cranes will be sure to be removed when they are no longer needed.  All warehouses for materials and products, as well as <span>utilities,</span> outdoor lighting, fire hydrants, <span>building site fences</span> - all this will be removed after construction. </p><h2>  Master Plan Differences </h2><p>  Judging by the composition, construction master plans differ from each other at each stage of work, which is characterized by the completeness of the nomenclature, the degree of detail and the exact location of all temporary and permanent structures. </p><p>  When developing, special attention is paid to the rational use of the construction area, minimizing the cost of temporary structures and buildings, rational placement on the construction site of everything necessary for the operation of the economy.  Ecological issues are also very important. </p>

    <h2>  Initial data </h2><p>  For the design of construction master plans, the most important is the following: the dimensions, location and nature of the construction site, the size and topography of the territory, the characteristics of the materials, structures and parts used in construction, the types of mechanization that will be used, and methods of installation of structures.  Mandatory construction schedule for this facility or network schedule. </p><p>  A lot depends on the relief of the construction site: placement of temporary and permanent objects, optimal directions of railways and roads, drainage of sewage and storm water from the construction site.  Climatological baseline data should correspond to the choice of the type of premises for warehouses (they can be closed or open), as well as the places where they should be located.  For example, open warehouses with dusty materials or flammable materials are equipped on the leeward side. </p><h2>  Stages </h2><p>  Designing a construction master plan typically involves three steps.  First, the composition of all temporary structures is determined, then the locations of all construction elements are outlined, and finally, accurate calculations are performed. </p><p>  When a construction master plan is being designed, it must be correlated with the general plan, where the <span>engineering networks</span> that already exist are indicated, because it is impossible to place temporary structures on the site of the laid communications.  Also this is what makes it possible to use permanent networks for construction needs. </p>

    <h2>  Roads, storage facilities </h2><p>  Roads inside the construction site are placed in such a way that transport and exit vehicles, as well as loading and unloading, are convenient.  The road network necessarily provides a circular passage.  The width of the roadway of temporary roads is determined taking into account the transport that will be involved.  Most often, temporary roads are built from reinforced concrete inventory slabs laid in two rows. </p><p>  Warehousing is organized according to the project of the construction plan.  Warehouses can be: </p><ul><li>  heated and not; </li><li>  closed premises; </li><li>  in the form of open or under awnings sites. </li></ul><p>  Capacity is designed depending on the amount of materials and their storage conditions.  Warehouses at the construction site are divided into on-site and general site.  The latter - closed type, designed for expensive and perishable materials (glass, paints, fittings and the like). </p>
