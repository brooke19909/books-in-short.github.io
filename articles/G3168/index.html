  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in the UAE</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a long time, <span>Arab countries</span> have been leaders in the lists of the most visited countries <span>.</span>  This is due to the development of tourist infrastructure, their deliberate luxury, numerous ancient cultural monuments, beautiful places, clean beaches, tropical climate and gentle sun, which heats here almost all year round.  A few decades ago, the Emirates could not boast of modern luxury and such a rapid development, which many associate with finding oil in these places.  It would be a mistake to assume that the UAE lives only at the expense of it, the tourism sector also invests in the treasury, but the main income comes from trade. </p><p>  On vacation in the UAE, you can safely take children with you, without fear of any unsanitary conditions.  In large cities, such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, almost everywhere there is perfect cleanliness and careful control of food, which will protect kids from poisoning by local food.  In megacities there are a huge number of skyscrapers and bizarre houses.  The architects of this country are characterized by extremely developed imagination, and many of their ideas are implemented.  The Arab culture itself is very colorful, so it is impossible to imagine a vacation in the UAE without visiting its attractions. </p><p>  The largest and richest emirate is Abu Dhabi.  The oldest building here is the fort of Al-Husn, which a hundred years ago defended the city from attack by enemies.  Today it stores archived data.  The government of Abu Dhabi created the cultural and ethnographic village of Umm al-Nar, which tells the story of the emirate from ancient times to the present day.  Rest in the UAE will present to many its splendor, where among the futuristic skyscrapers are harmoniously blended into the general landscape of the mosque.  The largest of them is in Abu Dhabi and bears the name of Sheikh Zayed.  It is able to accommodate up to 40 thousand believers at the same time.  It is here that in the prayer hall is the world's largest carpet, whose area is 5627 sq.m.  The mosque amazes with the luxury of its decoration and is rightfully considered one of the most beautiful religious buildings in the world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is impossible to imagine a romantic holiday in the UAE without visiting the fountain promenade Cornish Road in Abu Dhabi.  Its length is 10 km.  Here is a whole exposition of fountains, among which there are 7 structures corresponding to each emirate.  Of particular popularity was the Volcano Fountain, from which a huge stream of water poured with orange backlighting, which gives the impression of a real <span>eruption of the volcano.</span> </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if a tourist gets last-minute packages to the UAE or not, he must take into account the fact that the most beautiful hotels are located in Dubai.  Other cities do not have such buildings, although the service in them is in no way inferior to them.  The tourism business is so developed in the country that it is simply impossible to encounter rudeness or some other overlap in service.  Regardless of the category of the selected hotel, the guest in it will feel itself the most expensive and desired. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning about <span>Arabic cuisine.</span>  The traditions of cooking are so strong in this country that even in all the famous fast food Arabs managed to bring a little of their own.  Food is usually flavored with spices, a huge selection of all kinds of teas, exotic fruits.  For dessert, candied or fresh fruits are usually served.  Cooks are reluctant to share the recipes for their dishes, because they are a family heirloom.  Last-minute <span>tours to the UAE,</span> tourists are buying up very quickly, because this is a real chance to see a live oriental fairy tale.  Rest in the Emirates will not be able to leave anyone indifferent! </p>
