  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to cut snowflakes correctly</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The development of creative thinking in both children and adults can be helped by a simple exercise - making snowflakes.  Various patterns can not be invented - for us it was nature.  Taking a walk on a winter day, carefully examine along with the baby several snowflakes that fell on your clothes and remember the pattern.  It will be he who will serve as the starting point in your work. </p><p>  How to cut snowflakes?  Such a question is asked by every person who is engaged in such an exciting business for the first time.  There is nothing complicated in this exercise.  First you need to figure out how to fold snowflakes correctly.  The final result will depend on this stage.  Recall the real snowflake.  It has the correct geometric shapes and may look like a circle, square or rhombus.  We will focus on only two options - a square and a circle. </p><p>  We take a sheet <span>of</span> A4 paper.  One large and two small snowflakes can be cut from it.  Take the square as the basis.  We put the sheet on the table and, taking it at one corner, fold it diagonally, equalizing the edges.  We got a folded square and a strip of loose paper, which should be cut off.  She will go for little snowflakes.  Cutting off the strip, we got a square folded diagonally.  Fold it again and get an isosceles triangle.  Let's fold the triangle again - now we have a blank for our snowflake. </p><p>  Now we have come to the most crucial moment in our exercise and must understand how to correctly cut snowflakes.  If you are cutting this product for the first time, then you should draw your favorite pattern on the workpiece.  Lay the triangular blank in front of you so that the tip points up.  Draw a pattern that will be the edging of our snowflake, and cut off the excess paper. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now draw the internal patterns.  They should be placed on the workpiece so that it is convenient for you to cut them, and they do not reach the opposite edge of the triangle.  Work with scissors is very neat.  After cutting the snowflake through, we get not a beautiful pattern, but a few pieces of paper.  If you can‚Äôt cut it the first time, then read it again, as it should.  Cutting snowflakes is a fascinating activity that will help entertain a child and an adult. </p><p>  After you have cut out all the patterns, you must carefully unwrap the snowflake.  Having laid it out on a flat surface, iron it or put a book on top.  This will help to completely straighten the paper. </p><p>  After explaining to the child how to cut snowflakes correctly, give him the opportunity to dream.  Children's fiction on various patterns is limitless.  In the end, you will get a lot of paper snowflakes of various patterns and shapes that you can attach to your window, curtains or furniture in the room with your child. </p><p>  If the child does not manage to cut very well, then in the next lesson, you can show him how to draw snowflakes correctly.  Remember together how you looked at the patterns of snowflakes on the street, and how beautiful they were.  Draw a few snowflakes with the baby, drawing his attention to the correct form and clarity of the lines.  After a while, the child will get better.  Cutting and <span>drawing snowflakes</span> will be your favorite collaboration. </p><p>  While drawing or carving snowflakes with your child, tell him about the New Year holiday and various <span>fairy-tale characters.</span>  Attach a picture with Santa Claus and the Snow Maiden in his room, on which the Christmas tree and many snowflakes will be visible.  Decorating rooms for the holiday with you, the baby will begin to fantasize better.  Such activities will help the development of imagination, and cutting and drawing will contribute to the development of <span>fine motor skills of the</span> hands. </p>
