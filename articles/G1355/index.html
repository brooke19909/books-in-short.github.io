This, of course, is the Holy Trinity Lavra, erected in the 14th century.  This attraction arose thanks to Sergius of Radonezh, who at the indicated time lived on the territory of the city and, in fact, is considered its founder.  This place was very visited by Russian emperors of different generations, which made the shrine even more popular among Russians and tourists from other countries of the world. </p><p>  In 1746, a fire occurred on the territory of the shrine, which destroyed part of the buildings.  However, thanks to the hard work of the famous architect Michurin, the destroyed buildings were restored on the basis of existing architectural plans, which is why tourists are now able to enjoy this object in a fresher form. </p><p>  This Lavra is located on the territory of Krasnogorskaya Square, which, in essence, is a separate attraction of the city.  In more ancient times, active trade unfolded here, and also the most important information was brought to the local population.  It was here that in the 19th century a hotel was built, built of wood, in which Bagration himself stayed. </p><p>  In reviews of Sergiev Posad, experienced tourists say that when you visit the Holy Trinity Lavra, you definitely need to use the paid services of a guide.

This place was opened relatively recently - in 1920.  By its nature, it is a real museum, since the most valuable treasures of the Sergius Monastery are collected on the territory of the reserve.  Recently, the existing collections have been supplemented with new exhibits that preserve the history of Ancient Russia.  Having been here, you can admire the exhibits of folk decorative art, which were created in the 14th century and later by residents of the local region.  These include handwritten books, interior details, gold embroidery, very rare photographs, as well as icon paintings. </p><p>  The Museum of History and Art (Avenue of the Red Army, 144) consists of four separate buildings, each of which contains exhibits of a certain nature.  The main building presents modern works made mainly by painters.  In the second hall you can observe the oldest exhibits, which are the centuries-old wealth of the Lavra.

This attraction of the city was based on the collection of the local art critic Bartram, who loved old toys. </p><p>  This museum is located in a building built of red brick, which previously housed a commercial school.  Its halls present a real abundance of unique exhibits, the history of which dates back to the distant 11th century.  It is here that you can see the very first Russian nesting doll, as well as those toys that were used by the children of the last Russian emperor - Nicholas II. </p><p>  The building of the Museum of Toys also has a separate room, which will be interesting to visit for fans of painting - "Children's Portrait".  On the walls of this hall are presented little-known works written in the period from the 17th to the 20th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onreal.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergiev Posad museums" class="if uuid-2865397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2865397.jpg"></div><h2>  Kelar Pond </h2><p>  Having been in the city of Sergiev Posad, you definitely need to admire its main natural attraction - Kelar Pond.  This object, as tourists note in their reviews, is incredibly beautiful at any time of the year and in any weather. </p><p>  The history of this reservoir begins from the 16th century - it was then that it was artificially constructed by local monks.

In their comments, tourists who visited this place note that they are attracted by the appearance of the building.  The walls of the Elias Church are painted dark red and are painted with interesting patterns throughout their area.  The main historical feature of this object is that the church was the only one operating throughout the Soviet period. </p><p>  Walking along the shore of the pond, you can get acquainted with an interesting sculpture - a monument to Fevronia and Peter of Murom. </p><h2>  Gremyachiy Klyuch Waterfall </h2><div class="photo" data-original="krugozor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergiev Posad Street" class="if uuid-2865396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2865396.jpg"></div><p>  Almost all reviews of Sergiev Posad give recommendations for visiting another unique natural site - Gremyachiy Klyuch Waterfall.

In addition, radon helps to actively combat allergic reactions that occur in the human body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Sergiev Posad" class="if uuid-2865395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2865395.jpg"></div><h2>  Church Archaeological Office </h2><p>  From the total number of museums in Sergiev Posad, a church-archaeological cabinet should be allocated, which is located in the building of the Moscow Orthodox Theological Academy.
