This region can offer many interesting things to tourists seeking unity with nature and the knowledge of its pristine beauty.  One of such places is the Mezmay village, whose sights are not modern water parks and man-made sculptures, but mountain rivers, stormy waterfalls and mountains. </p><h2>  Mezmay is the pearl of the Caucasus! </h2>

It will be useful to know if you are planning a vacation: Mezmay is not a city of entertainment and nightlife.  There are no ultramodern hotels and large shops.  However, it is here, among the mountains and forests, that you will see rare plants, centenary trees and enjoy the incredible atmosphere of a natural and calm life that the locals live.  Do not think that such a vacation will be boring, there are still entertainments for tourists, and the abundance of natural attractions will delight even the most demanding guest.

And indeed, there are a lot of fruit trees.  At the same time, delicious apples can be harvested not only in local yards or orchards, but also in the forest or just outside.  A warm climate promotes the growth of all plants.  In summer, herbs are harvested in these places and berries are harvested, and in the fall, a rich harvest of vegetables and fruits is harvested.  It is curious that locals often call their village a bear angle.  Indeed, in the surrounding forests and today you can easily meet a bear.  However, wild animals rarely visit the village itself, but it is better to go for a walk around its surroundings with a guide as part of a tourist group.  How to find a unique village?  It's simple: your goal is the Absheron region.  Mezmay is located in a river valley called Kurdzhips, surrounded by three mountain gorges.

There was also a camp for prisoners engaged in correctional labor.  Around the same time, a narrow single-track railway was built.  Today, only memories have remained of those times, but, despite this, the distinguishing feature of the settlement is mainly wooden buildings.  Stone buildings in the whole village are easy to count on fingers.  Local residents are engaged in agriculture - they cultivate cultivated plants and raise animals.  Despite such a short and prosaic story, Guamka, Mezmay and all the neighboring points on the map have the glory of special energy zones.  Very often the village is even called the ‚ÄúRussian Shambhala‚Äù.  Mezmay is surrounded by three gorges: Guam, Upper Kurdzhip and Mezmay, each of them is characterized by incredible beauty and an abundance of natural attractions. </p><h2>  Horse and Hiking </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Absheron district" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/966842.jpg"></div>  What to do on vacation if you have chosen Mezmay as your place of residence?  First of all, enjoy the silence, the abundance of greenery and the incredibly clean and fresh air.  Agree, all this is very much lacking for all residents of megacities.  Walk along the quiet streets, take photos as a keepsake, chat with the locals, whose legends are told about the hospitality.  The best way to get to know the nature of the surrounding area is to go for a walk as part of a tourist group on foot or on horseback.  These are the most popular excursions for tourists, which you can learn about without leaving the village of Mezmay.  The routes will delight you with their diversity, choose the most interesting types for you - mountain gorges, forests or <span>alpine meadows.</span>  Everything is here.  If you do not know how to stay in the saddle, rest in the village of Mezmay is the best time to learn.  There is no organized riding school, but horses are still one of the main means of transportation.  And almost any resident of the village is ready to give riding lessons to tourists.

This is a giant funnel, which gradually increases and continues to draw trees and large fragments of rocks into its center.  Not far from this mysterious place there are two large caves.  There is also a "house of astronauts" in the <span>Guam Gorge</span> , and near it there is a unique cave, from which a stormy stream flows, which is divided into two cascades.  A television repeater is installed at the highest point of the Guam mountain range.  It would seem that this is a miracle of engineering, and not a mysterious attraction.  However, residents of the village claim that during church holidays and the full moon around this object, an unusual glow can be seen with the naked eye.

Sights of this region are not always included in standard excursions in the Krasnodar Territory.  It is most convenient to drive a private car or arrange a transfer.  Today there are two roads.  One of them, more comfortable, starts from the village of Nizhny Novgorod, the landmark is a monument to the founding Cossacks.  The road is covered with gravel, but despite this, in good weather you can drive here by almost any car.

    <p>  Another option is the exit from the highway Dakhovskaya - Lago-Naki.  However, this road is in worse condition (the length of the emergency section is about 12 kilometers), and it is better to go along it only if you are completely confident in your own car. </p><p>  You can also come to the village of Mezmay by single-track railway.  However, the possibility of such a trip should be clarified upon arrival, since the passenger train sometimes runs along the rails to the "house of astronauts." </p>
