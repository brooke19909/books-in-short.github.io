A brief description of the Renaissance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Renaissance begins in the <span>XIV century.</span>  This period is also called the Renaissance.  The Renaissance replaced <span>medieval</span> culture in <span>Europe</span> and became the forerunner of modern culture.  And the Renaissance ended in the XVI ‚Äì XVII centuries, since in each state it has its own start and end date. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance era briefly" class="if uuid-595284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595284.jpg?1556528376"></div><h2>  A bit of general information </h2><p>  <span>Distinctive features</span> of the Renaissance are anthropocentrism, that is, an extraordinary interest in a person as an individual and his activities.  This also includes the secular nature of culture.  An interest in the culture of antiquity appears in society, something like its ‚Äúrevival‚Äù is taking place.  From here, in fact, the name of such an important period of time appeared.  Prominent figures of the Renaissance can be called the immortal Michelangelo, <span>Niccolo Machiavelli</span> and the always alive Leonardo da Vinci. </p><p>  The Renaissance (briefly the main features are described in our article) left its ideological and cultural imprint on all European countries.  But for each individual country there are individual historical boundaries of the era.  And all because of the unequal economic and social development. </p><p>  The Renaissance arose in Italy.  Here, his first symptoms were noticeable in the XIII-XIV centuries.  But the era was firmly rooted in the 1920s.  In Germany, France and other powers, the Renaissance arose much later.  At the end of the 15th century, the highest heyday of the Renaissance falls.  And already in the next century there is a crisis of ideas of this era.  As a result of the incident, baroque and mannerism arise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance art" class="if uuid-595283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595283.jpg?1556528376"></div><h2>  What was this era </h2><p>  The time of the Renaissance is the period when the transition from medieval <span>feudal society</span> to bourgeois begins.  This is precisely the stage in history when bourgeois-capitalist relations have not yet been formed, and the social and feudal foundations have already been shaken. </p><p>  In the Renaissance, a nation begins to form.  At this time, the power of the kings with the support of ordinary citizens managed to overcome the power of the feudal nobles.  Until that time, there were so-called associations that were called states solely for geographical reasons.  Now large monarchies are emerging, the basis of which are nationalities and historical destinies. </p><p>  The Renaissance is characterized by the incredible development of trade relations between different countries.  During this period, grandiose geographical discoveries are made.  The Renaissance was the period when the basics of modern scientific theories were laid.  So, natural science appeared with its inventions and discoveries.  The turning point for the described process is the opening of typography.  And it was it that perpetuated the Renaissance as an era. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance literature" class="if uuid-595285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595285.jpg?1556528376"></div><h2>  Other renaissance achievements </h2><p>  The Renaissance is briefly characterized by high achievements in the field of literature.  Thanks to the advent of printing, it gains those distribution opportunities that it could not afford before.  Antique manuscripts that rose like a phoenix from the ashes begin to be translated into different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand reprinted.  They travel the world as fast as ever.  The learning process has become much easier thanks to the ability to reproduce on paper a wide variety of scientific achievements and knowledge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The revived interest in antiquity and the study of this period were reflected in religious mores and views.  From the lips of Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of the Florentine Republic, a statement was made that the Holy Scripture is nothing more than poetry.  In the Renaissance, the Holy Inquisition reaches its peak.  This was due to the fact that such a deep study of ancient works could undermine faith in Jesus Christ. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance features" class="if uuid-595286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595286.jpg?1556528376"></div><h2>  Early and High Renaissance </h2><p>  Features of the Renaissance are indicated by two periods of the Renaissance.  So, scientists divide the whole era into the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance.  The first period lasted 80 years - from 1420 to 1500.  During this time, art has not yet completely got rid of the remnants of the past, but has already tried to combine them with elements borrowed from classical antiquity.  Only much later and very slowly artists, thanks to the influence of cardinally changing conditions of culture and life, abandon the foundations of the Middle Ages and without a twinge of conscience begin to use ancient art. </p><p>  But all this happened in Italy.  In other states, art has long been subordinate to Gothic.  Only at the end of the 15th century did the Renaissance begin in Spain and in the states located north of the Alps.  Here the early stage of the era continues until the middle of the XVI century.  But nothing worthy of attention has been produced over this period. </p><h2>  High Renaissance </h2><p>  The second era of the Renaissance is considered the most grandiose time of its existence.  The High Renaissance also lasted 80 years (1500-1580).  During this period, Rome became the capital of art, not Florence.  All this became possible due to the accession to the throne of Pope Julius II.  He was an ambitious person.  He was also famous for his honesty and enterprise.  It was he who attracted the best Italian artists to his court.  Under Julius II and his successors, a huge number of monumental sculptures were built, unsurpassed sculptures are molded, murals and paintings are painted, which today are considered masterpieces of world culture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance features" class="if uuid-595287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595287.jpg?1556528376"></div><h2>  Renaissance art periods </h2><p>  The ideas of the Renaissance were embodied in the art of that period.  But before talking about art itself, I would like to highlight its main stages.  Thus, the Proto-Renaissance or the introductory period (approximately 1260-1320), Ducento (XIII century), Trecento (XIV century), as well as Quattrocento (XV century) and Cinquecento (XVI century) are noted. </p><p>  Naturally, the sequence of the boundaries of centuries does not quite coincide with the specific stages of cultural development.  The Proto-Renaissance is celebrated at the end of the 13th century, the Early Renaissance ends in 1490, and the High Renaissance runs out before the beginning of 1530.  Only in Venice does it continue to exist until the end of the 16th century. </p><h2>  Renaissance Literature </h2><p>  Renaissance literature is such immortal names as Shakespeare, Ronsard, <span>Lorenzo Vala,</span> Petrarch, Du Belle and others.  It was during the Renaissance that the poets demonstrated the victory of mankind over their own shortcomings and mistakes of the past.  The most developed was the literature of Germany, France, England, Spain and Italy. </p><p>  English literature was greatly influenced by Italian poetry and classical works.  Thomas Wayatt introduces a sonnet form that is gaining popularity quite quickly.  The sonnet created by Count Surrey also receives attention.  The history of the literature of England is in many ways similar to the literature of France, although their external similarity is minimal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance ideas" class="if uuid-595289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595289.jpg?1556528376"></div><p>  German literature of the Renaissance is known for the fact that during this period, swanks appeared.  These are interesting and funny stories that were first created in the form of poems, and later in prose.  They talked about everyday life, about everyday life of ordinary people.  All this was presented in a light, playful and laid-back style. </p><h2>  Literature in France, Spain and Italy </h2><p>  French Renaissance literature is celebrated with new trends.  Margarita of Navarre became the patroness of the ideas of the Reformation and humanism.  In France, folk and urban art began to come to the fore. </p><p>  The Renaissance (briefly available in our article) in Spain is divided into several periods: the early Renaissance, high Renaissance and Baroque.  Throughout the era, the country has noted increased attention to culture and science.  In Spain, journalism is developing, typography is appearing.  Some writers intertwine religious motives and secular <span>ideas of humanism.</span> </p><p>  Representatives of <span>Italian</span> Renaissance <span>literature</span> are Francesco Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio.  They became the first poets who began to express lofty images and thoughts in an open, common language.  This innovation was received with a bang and was spread in other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="renaissance history" class="if uuid-595288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/595288.jpg?1556528376"></div><h2>  Renaissance and art </h2><p>  Features of the Renaissance is that the human body has become the main source of inspiration and a subject of study for artists of this time.  So, emphasis was placed on the similarity of sculpture and painting with reality.  The main features of Renaissance art include radiance, sophisticated handwriting, the play of shadow and light, thoroughness in the process of work, and difficult compositions.  For Renaissance artists, the main ones were images from the Bible and myths. </p><p>  In <span>Renaissance painting, the</span> similarity of a real person with his image on a particular canvas was so close that the fictional character seemed alive.  This can not be said about the art of the twentieth century. </p><p>  The Renaissance (briefly summarized its main trends above) perceived the human body as an infinite beginning.  Scientists and artists regularly improved their skills and knowledge by studying the bodies of individuals.  Then the prevailing opinion was that man was created in the likeness and image of God.  This statement reflected physical perfection.  The main and important objects of the Renaissance art were the gods. </p><h2>  The nature and beauty of the human body </h2><p>  Renaissance art paid much attention to nature.  A characteristic element of the landscapes was a diverse and lush vegetation.  The blue-blue skies that pierced the sun's rays that penetrated the white clouds were a great backdrop for soaring creatures.  Renaissance art admired the beauty of the human body.  This feature was manifested in the refined elements of the muscles and body.  Difficult poses, facial expressions and gestures, a well-coordinated and clear color palette are characteristic of the work of sculptors and sculptors of the Renaissance period.  These include Titian, Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt and others. </p>
