He is very fond of young people from the UK.  Parties at Irish pubs and Spanish taverns continue until the morning.  And if you are young and full of desire to have fun on holiday to the fullest, you are in Magaluf.  Because in neighboring Santa Ponce mostly retirees from Germany rest, and nearby resorts have a reputation for quiet and peaceful places. </p><p>  Magaluf is also good because from here you can very quickly get to the island's capital, Palma de Mallorca.  And where to live in this resort?  So, to be within walking distance of the fun, but not hear the noise at night?  There is such a place.  It is called Bahia Principe Coral Playa 4. This article will be devoted to a review of the hotel.  To compile its description, we analyzed the reviews of those tourists who rested there recently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahia Principe Coral Playa" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1554326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  The reason for the nightly silence enjoyed by the Bahia Principe Coral Playa guests is that this hotel is on a hill.  The cliff rises directly above the beach.  Yes, you need to go up to the hotel from the center of Magaluf.  But the resort's fun (as well as its side effect - noise and din) remain below.  Maybe a person with weak legs will be uncomfortable living in a hotel, but a kind of audience is going to Magaluf.  And the elevator carries the hotel guests to the beach.  To the center of the resort to go five minutes (ten back).  The capital of the island is fourteen kilometers away, and the airport is twenty-five kilometers away.  Palma de Mallorca is easily accessible by bus.  His stop is three hundred meters from the hotel.  Despite its hillside location, this is a first-line hotel.  An elevator takes you to the sandy beach of San Matias in minutes.  The hotel is located just east of the center of Magaluf, closer to the village of Palmanova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahia Principe Coral Playa 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1554325.jpg" width="600"></div>

Previously, it belonged to the Pinero Hoteles chain.  Then it was called "Pinero Coral Playa 4".  Later, the hotel was bought by the Bahia Principles Hotels and Resorts chain.  Accordingly, the hotel changed only the first part of its name.  But the thirteen-story hotel building was built in general in ancient times - in the sixty-eighth year of the last century.  Of course, for the long existence of the building, he repeatedly underwent major and cosmetic repairs.  The last such renovation took place in 2011. </p><p>  From the side of the street, the building seems five-story.  But he goes down, clinging to the cliff, like a swallow‚Äôs nest.  The building was erected so that most of the rooms had a frontal view of the sea.  And this panorama is an inexhaustible topic of the delight of tourists.  Not a single review can do without not saying a few words about the beautiful view that opens from the balconies of the rooms.  All upper floors are occupied immediately.  Tourists who are accommodated on the first or second tier are waiting for their turn to move higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahia Principe Coral Playa Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1554324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where do guests stay </h2><p>  In the thirteen-story building Bahia Principe Coral Playa fits one hundred eighty-four rooms.  Their lion's share, or rather 172 rooms for guests, has a direct view of the sea.  Only single rooms have neither a balcony nor a terrace.  All of them, however, belong to the same category - double standard.  Tourists, however, can choose the type of beds.  There are rooms with one wide bed (king size) or with two separate.  There are also four rooms with an adjacent door.  These rooms are good for families.  All standards have air conditioning, a telephone, a TV with satellite channels (among them there is Russian), a minibar.  Filling the latter is free only for holders of all inclusive bracelets.  The balconies in the rooms are spacious.  The floor in the bedroom is ceramic tile.  Each room has its own bathroom, which has a bathtub and shower.  The bedroom also has a safe, but use of it is only at an additional cost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What tourists say about the rooms </h2><p>  The guest rooms at the Bahia Principe Coral Playa Hotel are characterized as spacious, bright, clean and incredibly stylish.  The helpful staff will provide you with an iron and ironing board completely free of charge.  A hair dryer is hanging in the bathroom.  Rooms are cleaned daily.  Bed sheets are changed three times a week, and towels - when you drop them on the floor.  Many tourists appreciated the large balconies on which it was nice to sit and enjoy the view. </p><p>  The cleaning is very high quality: they not only wash the floor, but also wipe the dust in hard to reach places.  If any minor breakdowns occur, everything is quickly repaired.  Tourists liked the fact that there wasn‚Äôt a sound in the rooms from what they usually complain about in Magaluf ‚Äî loud music from the bars and the cries of tipsy teenagers.  Life on top of a cliff has its charms.  Recommendations for choosing rooms: ask higher, starting from the eighth floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahia Principe Coral Playa 4 Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1554328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Bahia Principe Coral Playa offers its guests either half board or All Inclusive.  The last option opens up the widest possibilities for a drink-snack.  Firstly, you can use the minibar in your room for free, which is replenished once every two days.  Secondly, all drinks at meals in the main restaurant and in two bars are also poured "for nothing."  And thirdly, the owners of All Inclusive bracelets have the opportunity to spend a romantic dinner at the Portofino √† la carte restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This restaurant specializes in Italian cuisine.  Reservation of the table, as well as the dress code, is required.  The only negative of the All Inclusive concept is the affection for the hotel.  This is not Egypt, but Majorca.  You have to choose: tour or lunch.  The half board option makes it possible to travel around the island.  You can come for lunch instead of dinner.  Drinks for afternoon or evening meals will be paid.  The hotel also has a snack bar and two bars - by the pool and in the lobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahia Principe Coral Playa reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1554333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What nutrition reviews say </h2><p>  "Champagne in the morning !!!"  - This phrase is most often mentioned by tourists.  And the point is not that the hotel‚Äôs administration treats the sick heads of its guests who have gone too far on the eve of it.  It's just such a Majorcan (and Catalan) tradition - to drink cava (local sparkling wine) early in the morning. </p><p>  Otherwise, the food in the hotel Bahia Principe Coral Playa 4 reviews was described as decent and five stars.  Breakfasts always consisted of one set of dishes.  But how wide this set was!  There are four types of yoghurts, several types of sausages and cheeses.  Pastes, hot dishes, vegetables, fruits, delicious pastries.  Afternoon and evening meals were even more plentiful and varied.  Meat of different varieties, fish, seafood, paella, souffle, cream-catalan ... The list of dishes is so extensive that you can list them for a long time. </p><p>  Wine and other drinks that the owners of HB bracelets ordered for a fee could not be drunk at a meal.  The bottle with the number was put in the refrigerator and put up the next day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahia Principe Coral Playa 4 (Mallorca): reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1554323.jpg" width="600"></div>
