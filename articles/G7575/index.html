    <h2>  General classification </h2><p>  In accordance with the existing rights to OS objects, they can be divided into: </p><ol><li>  Owned by the enterprise as property. </li><li>  Being in operational management, transferred to gratuitous use, economic management. </li><li>  Received on lease, rent. </li></ol><h2>  Accounting </h2><p>  The procedure for its organization and reflection on the accounts of business transactions in non-profit and commercial enterprises (except for banks, other non-bank financial and credit organizations, companies financed by the budget), as well as for individual entrepreneurs, is established by a special Instruction.  Its provisions are approved by the Ministry of Finance.  Based on this Instruction and other industry norms and rules, organizations should independently develop local acts necessary to ensure control over the use and accounting of the operating system.  These papers approve, in particular: </p><ol><li>  Forms of primary accounting.  They represent the documentation of write-offs of fixed assets, receipts, internal movement.  Primary accounting forms establish the rules for the circulation of securities and information processing technology. </li><li>  The list of company officials who are responsible for the transfer, disposal, receipt of fixed assets. </li><li>  The order of control over the safety and optimal (rational) use of fixed assets at the enterprise. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="write-off procedure for fixed assets" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/756783.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><h2>  Accounting objectives </h2><p>  Fixing the movement of the OS provides: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The correct documentation of the write-off of fixed assets, their receipt and internal movement. </li><li>  Formation of costs related to the adoption of assets as fixed assets for accounting. </li><li>  Timely and complete reflection of depreciation of objects. </li><li>  Reliable determination of results from sales and other types of OS disposal. </li><li>  A full assessment of the costs associated with the maintenance and implementation of various types of repairs of facilities. </li><li>  Determination of costs for the implementation of modernization, partial liquidation, reconstruction, completion and retrofitting of the OS. </li><li>  Control over the safety of assets that are accepted for accounting. </li><li>  Obtaining information necessary for disclosure in reporting on the OS. </li><li>  The analysis of the operation of fixed assets. </li></ol><h2>  Special information </h2><p>  The inventory object is the inventory object.  It can come with all accessories and fixtures or be a structurally isolated object.  The object of the OS can be an independent group of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are presented as a whole and are intended to perform specific functions.  A separate complex can be in the form of one or several objects in which common accessories and devices, controls, or they are mounted on a single foundation.  Due to the design features, each element can only perform functions as part of a group, and not on its own.  For example, the price of a vehicle includes the price of a spare wheel with a camera and a tire, as well as a tool kit. </p><h2>  Capital investments </h2><p>  In the case of the presence of parts with a different regulatory term of useful use or service as part of one object, each of them is taken into account as an independent inventory item.  So, for example, capital investments in <span>land plots,</span> on radical improvement of territories (irrigation, drainage and other land reclamation measures) and in water, mineral resources and other natural resources will be considered separately.  Revenues for improving the status of the allotment owned by the enterprise are recorded as part of the facility in respect of which they were carried out.  Capital investments in leased fixed assets are accounted for as separate income if, under a lease agreement, such deductions will be considered the property of the lessee.  An object that is owned by two or more organizations at the same time is reflected in proportion to the shares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="write-off amount of fixed assets" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/756784.jpg" width="500"></div>

On the fact of the operation, the primary act is drawn up (for write-off of fixed assets, receipt or referral of them under any article).  In accordance with these papers, accounting will be carried out OS. </p><h2>  Features of the paper </h2><p>  The write-off of fixed assets is carried out in accordance with the requirements of industry legislation.  The rules are also established in the aforementioned instructions.  The Ministry of Finance also approved a unified form for writing off fixed assets.  It must be filled in accordingly according to the established standards.  In particular, the sample act of write-off of fixed assets contains fields for entering all the necessary details.  After filling out the paper must be signed by the responsible staff.  The act for the write-off of fixed assets may be kept on electronic or paper media. </p><h2>  Inventory number </h2><p>  It is assigned to each OS object, regardless of whether it is used (in operation), mothballed, or sent to stock.  This is necessary to ensure control over the safety and organization of property accounting.  The inventory number is assigned in accounting at the time of acceptance of the object for accounting.  If an item has several fragments with different useful lives and are taken into account as separate, each part will be assigned its own inv.  number.  An object may consist of several elements for which a common period of operation is established.  In this case, he is assigned one number.  The assigned number is retained for the item during the entire time it is in the enterprise.  The inventory number of the retired OS cannot be transferred to the newly received one within five years from the year following that, when the debit certificate was approved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="write-off of fixed assets" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/756785.jpg" width="360"></div>

Legislation has established cases where disposal of the asset may take place.  The reasons for writing off the fixed assets may be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Wear. </li><li>  Royalty free transmission. </li><li>  Sale. </li><li>  Complete or partial elimination. </li><li>  Accident, natural disaster or other emergency situation, which entailed the impossibility of subsequent operation or the inappropriateness of recovery. </li></ol><h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  The write-off amount of fixed assets in the event of a sale is taken into account according to the agreement, in accordance with the securities drawn up in accordance with the rules established by law.  In <span>case of gratuitous transfer of</span> fixed assets between enterprises of the same form of ownership, the residual value (replacement initial cost minus depreciation) and transfer costs by decision of the owner relate to non-operating expenses.  Write-off of fixed assets of budgetary institutions in case of gratuitous transfer is carried out with attribution of expenses to increase expenses of the relevant articles and classification elements.  The costs and gains from disposal are recognized as non-operating or operating in the reporting period to which they are allocated.  The cost of objects is deducted from the balance sheet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="write-off of fixed assets" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/756786.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <h2>  Disposal accounting </h2><p>  There is a certain procedure for writing off fixed assets.  The disposal of fixed assets as a result of exchange, sale, inclusion in the authorized capital and in other cases provided for by law is carried out in accordance with the contract.  In this case, <span>an act of</span> write-off of the fixed assets (acceptance-transfer) <span>is drawn up</span> .  In addition, the bill of lading is filled in (the Ministry of Finance approved its sample).  Write-offs of fixed assets with the filling of TTN-1 are carried out if the OS is moved using transport.  Upon disposal, a waybill may also be drawn up for posting and dispensing of material assets in the form of TN-2.  It is also approved by a decree of the Ministry of Finance and, according to the rules, accompanies an act of cancellation if transport is not used when moving the OS (for example, vacation can be carried out by mail). </p><h2>  Write-off procedure for fixed assets </h2><p>  The disposal of the asset is initially recognized through the related entries.  Based on them, the residual value of items is determined.  In particular, the paperwork for writing off fixed assets is as follows: </p><p>  <em>By debit count.</em>  <em>01, subch</em>  <em>"Disposal of the OS" and the loan account.</em>  <em>01 withdrawal of the restoration (initial) price is carried out.</em> </p><p>  <em>By debit count.</em>  <em>02 "Depreciation of fixed assets" and the loan account.</em>  <em>01, subch</em>  <em>‚ÄúDisposal of fixed assets‚Äù reflects the amount of accumulated depreciation.</em> </p><h2>  Residual value </h2><p>  It is reflected, depending on the reason for the write-off of the fixed asset in a particular line of the balance sheet.  In particular, the following entries are made: </p><ol><li>  In debit with.  91 - for fixed assets that were retired as a result of being paid to the authorized capital as a contribution, exchange, sale.  The result of write-offs from the accounting of residential buildings and other property, the loss of value of which is reflected at the end of the year on <span>off-balance accounts, is</span> not included in <span>operating expenses.</span>  Their cost is fixed at the debit account.  83 "Additional funds" in correspondence with the loan cf.  01. </li><li>  In the debit  94 - for the operating system, retired due to a shortage that was identified during the inventory or in another way. </li><li>  In the debit  92 "Non-operating expenses and income" - in case of gratuitous transfer, except for the transferred objects to the organizations of one owner, if he signed an order to write off or a decision was made to retire an authorized body.  The same line shall reflect the value of the OS that was disposed of as a result of liquidation during an accident, loss due to a natural disaster or other emergency. </li><li>  In the debit  83 "Additional funds" - in case of gratuitous transfer of fixed assets to organizations of one owner in accordance with the decision of the owner or unit authorized by him, as well as objects in state ownership, between unitary state enterprises by decision of the owner or body authorized by him. </li><li>  In the debit  79 "Internal business settlement operations" - when transferring to independent (isolated) units of the enterprise. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sample deduction of fixed assets" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/756787.jpg" width="445"></div></li></ol><p>  Documentation of write-off of fixed assets can be carried out without the use of sub-accounts.  "OS disposal" cf.  01. In this case, the accumulated depreciation may be reflected directly on the debit of the account.  02 in correspondence with a credit account.  01. </p><h2>  Correspondence </h2><p>  Costs associated with the disposal of fixed assets as a result of contributions to the authorized capital as a contribution, exchange, sale are debited to the account.  91, due to liquidation during accidents, natural disasters, emergencies, gratuitous transfer - to debit account.  92 in correspondence with accounts: </p><ol><li>  26 "General expenses", 23 "Auxiliary production" - for transportation and production costs associated with dismantling. </li><li>  44 "Selling expenses" - the amount of costs related to packaging, transportation of sold property, payment of marketing and intermediary services, fees, duties and other things. </li><li>  51 "P / s" - the size of cash payments that are associated with disposal. </li><li>  68 "Calculations on fees and taxes" - the amount of VAT and other deductions. </li></ol><h2>  Disposal income </h2><p>  They are deducted from the credit account.  91 "Operating profit and expenses" in the debit of such accounts as: </p><ol><li>  10 ‚ÄúMaterials‚Äù - for the cost of raw materials at the prices of the intended use obtained when disassembling the items in the process of their disposal. </li><li>  76 "Settlements with creditors and debtors", 62 "Transactions with customers and buyers", 51 "Settlement account" - for the amount of sold objects of fixed assets at selling prices, including VAT. </li><li>  58 "Cash investments" - the value of fixed assets that are contributed to the authorized capital of third parties. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for writing off fixed assets" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/756836.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  The results of disposal are reflected in accounting for debit (credit) account.  91 "Operating costs and income", cf.  92 "non-operating expenses and profit" in correspondence with a loan or debit n.  99 "Losses and gains" for the reporting period to which they are assigned. </p><h2>  Unused OS </h2><p>  The procedure for writing off fixed assets that were not used in the production process and are not subject to subsequent operation for their intended purpose (except for transmission devices, structures and buildings), the residual value for each unit of which is not more than 10,000 basic units, which are on the balance sheet of legal entities subordinate to authorities public administration and other state organizations, is established by the relevant Instruction.  It is approved by the decision of the Council of Ministers.  Write-off of fixed assets of the ‚Äúunused‚Äù category is made as of the 1st day of the month in accordance with the decision of legal entities and in agreement with government bodies and other state organizations. </p><h2>  special instructions </h2><p>  Wastes and scrap of precious, non-ferrous and ferrous metals received as a result of write-off of fixed assets belonging to the category of ‚Äúunused‚Äù should be sent by legal entities for processing in accordance with the rules established by law.  Raw materials are dispatched to organizations that have permits (licenses) for the collection of waste and scrap of non-ferrous and ferrous metals. </p><h2>  Further application </h2><p>  In order to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of the subsequent operation of fixed assets, as well as to draw up the relevant documentation on the write-off of these objects at the enterprise, a permanent commission may be formed by order of management.  Its composition is attended by competent officials.  These include the chief accountant, as well as employees who are responsible for maintaining fixed assets.
