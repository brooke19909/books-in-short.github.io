    <p>  Most of the hotel complexes are focused on family vacations, so they have animation.  Many hotels offer for little tourists children's clubs, special pools, playgrounds and other entertainments.  Modern complexes are equipped with water parks, spa centers and other leisure facilities. </p><p>  The resort has very different beaches in its structure, therefore, choosing a hotel, it is worth specifying the state of the coast separately in each case.  Most of the coast is sandy, but there are pebbled areas.  Sometimes you can even come across cliffs.  The beaches near some hotels are frankly uncomfortable for swimming, as the bottom is strewn with stones. </p><p>  As for the sights, then in the village they simply do not exist.  If you are interested in the cultural component of relaxation, then you should go to Side.  The city is not only a famous resort, but also a place of accumulation of historical monuments.  Kyzylgach can please only with water entertainments on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reviews about Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel 5 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, let's discuss the reviews of tourists who have already rested in this beautiful place.  Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel 5 * in Side is a brand new hotel complex, which was built on the coast of the resort just a couple of years ago.  It has a huge green area on which several new and fresh buildings have been built.  They all look beautiful outwardly.  Each of them has a fairly large number of rooms.  According to tourists, when designing the building, the required number of elevators was not planned.  Those that are in the building do not always cope with the flow of tourists, since there are really a lot of vacationers in the hotel. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunmelia beach resort hotel 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2073825.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The room fund of Sunmelia <span>Beach Resort Hotel 5 *</span> (Turkey) is impressive, the rooms are clean, beautiful and with new finishes.  The apartments are equipped with good appliances and plumbing.  As for cleaning, its quality does not always meet the standards.  Many tourists remain unsatisfied with it, and some guests complain that they were settled in uncleaned and unprepared apartments.  Apparently, a large influx of guests is affecting. </p><p>  Vacationers note that the rooms do not have many attributes that correspond to a five-star level establishment.  For example, in the bathroom there are no slippers and bathrobes. </p><p>  Guests are advised to choose rooms that overlook the coast; beautiful sea views will improve your mood.  The apartments have air conditioning, they have to be actively used, because even at night it is impossible to sleep with the windows open.  The fact is that there is a persistent unpleasant sour smell on the street, which all tourists complain about. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Sunmelia <span>Beach Resort Hotel 5 *</span> (Side) offers the concept of "ultra all inclusive."  With regard to food, tourists have a mixed opinion.  Some people think that its quality is very good, while others say that all the food is very monotonous.  For all vacationers there are not enough children's dishes.  There is nothing in the special menu for kids except sausages, french fries and pasta.  It is unlikely that one of the parents will want to feed their children with such semi-finished products.  From drinks, you can take juices (not freshly squeezed, but from packages) and drinks such as forfeit and cola.  For some reason, natural juices and good foreign drinks are not included in the concept of nutrition.  The bars offer cocktails made from medium-quality local alcohol. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunmelia beach resort hotel 5 turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2073833.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel can eat in several places.  But it is worth noting that the main restaurant is significantly overloaded with visitors.  The waiters do not have time to set and clean the tables, so sometimes it is impossible to find a clean free table. </p><p>  Every day, two hours a day, ice cream is distributed, followed by a long line of volunteers.  Not all hotel guests want to crowd around a portion of a cool dessert on vacation. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Tourists themselves characterize the hotel Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel 5 * (Side) as an average level institution, which has many shortcomings.  Therefore, regarding the five stars on the sign, many questions arise.  The main advantage of the hotel is its good new buildings.  According to the spa, in the complex there is a significant saving on tired staff, which is why there are many shortcomings.  Maids, for example, are not enough, they are overloaded, which affects the quality of their services.  The same can be said of the waiters in the dining room.  With such a large workload, the administration institution should have hired more staff to bring the service to the proper level. </p><p>  Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel 5 * (Side) has a very beautiful and nice pebble beach.  The hotel has free beach towels.  On the territory there are several pools with slides and a relaxation area.

    <p>  Summing up the conversation, it is worth noting that the hotel complex will appeal to unpretentious holidaymakers who will not pay attention to some shortcomings, since they really are.  For spoiled holidaymakers who are accustomed to excellent service and good conditions, it is better to choose a more fashionable establishment.  The rest of the complex is perfect for relaxing a certain category of tourists.  The hotel offers a completely unobtrusive animation, so for a change you can go to Side to admire all its interesting places. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  You can always book sightseeing trips at the hotel or go to Side yourself.  Local dolmushi dominate you.  Lovers of antiquity will surely like the historical monuments of the ancient city.  Along the perimeter of the village are the city walls, which were built in the second century BC.  Separate fragments of the building have survived to this day.  You can also see the ancient aqueduct, thanks to which water previously entered the city. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sunmelia beach resort hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2073824.jpg"></div>
