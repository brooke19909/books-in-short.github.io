    <h2>  When was established </h2><p>  The Order of Friendship of Peoples was born on December 17 in 1972.  The seventies in the history of the great Soviet power were one of the most productive in terms of economic development.  Powerful coal and oil production enterprises were created.  During the crisis, the USSR was actively selling its fuel resources, as well as diamonds.  By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the State, it was decided to create the great Order of the USSR.  This decision was made in honor of the celebration of the 50th birthday of the Union.  On July 18, 1980, the statute of the Order of the USSR changed due to a decree of the government apparatus. </p><h2>  What was the statute </h2><p>  It was not so easy to receive the Order of Friendship of Peoples.  It was awarded only for great services to the Fatherland.  Only those who were not indifferent to the fate of fraternal peoples and friendly nations could receive it.  The Order of Friendship was given only to those who believed in a brighter future and the building of socialism.  The topic of building economic relations and developing the culture of the republics of the Union was also one of the most relevant in this matter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who could be awarded </h2><p>  Orders of the USSR are worthy of the citizens of the Republics, who are leading their power and their people to a brighter future.  According to the same principle, this title can be awarded to enterprises, military units, defense units, institutions and existing organizations, allied, as well as republics of the territory that have retained autonomy, districts and cities.  The Order of Friendship of Peoples could also be issued to persons who are not citizens of the USSR, but who distinguished themselves by special merits to the Soviet state. </p>

    <h2>  How is the order awarded </h2><p>  The Order of the USSR was not worthy of the man who did not make a significant contribution to strengthening the cooperation of friendly peoples of a single socialist union.  Great labor achievements in the development of the country's economy also played an important role.  The Order of Friendship was given only to those who took part in the nation-building of the Union.  Fruitful activities in the field of science and scientific discoveries also gave a chance to receive this award. <br><br>  The process of rapprochement of the peoples of the Union, their cultural interchange and mutual enrichment, the education of citizens in the spirit of genuine genuine Soviet patriotism, according to all the canons of the proletariat, made it possible to receive the Order of the USSR.  But the main rule was loyalty to the motherland.  We will not forget about the merits in strengthening the defense power of a strong state, which also could contribute to obtaining the Order of Friendship of the Peoples of the USSR. <br><br>  The order should be worn in accordance with the rules, which were also registered and officially published.  A valuable reward should be worn on the chest, on the left side.  Usually it is worn near the Order of the Banner of Labor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  External description of a valuable award </h2><p>  Let's talk about the appearance of the Order of Friendship of the Soviet Nations.  It has the shape of a <span>five-pointed star,</span> slightly convex.  The surface of the order is covered with gilding and bright red enamel.  Silvery faces of a pyramidal shape frame a star with five bunches, on which glittering rays diverge in different directions with a golden fountain. <br><br>  The Order of Friendship of the Peoples of the <span>Soviet Union</span> has a gilded coat of arms of the USSR, which is located in its very center.  Separate details of the coat of arms are covered with colored enamel.  Handshakes as a <span>symbol of friendship of</span> peoples also take place on the coat of arms.  This symbol is located in the form of a rim around the coat of arms of the USSR, next to a gilded, dark red ribbon with the proud inscription "USSR".  Laurel branches, which were beautifully covered with smooth green enamel, are one of the oldest symbols of power and prosperity. </p><h2>  About manufacturing materials </h2><p>  This order was made of silver, the content of which as standard reaches <br>  38,998 ¬± 1,388 g. This standard was adopted on September 18 in the year 75 of the last century.  The total weight of the valuable award was 42.9 ¬± 1.8 g. </p><h2>  About the size of the award </h2><p>  Size is usually measured from one end of the pyramidal star to the diametrically opposite one.  So, the original order has a length of 47 millimeters. <br>  All valuable orders in the Soviet Union were connected to a pentagonal block.  It was covered with colored moire ribbon made of high-quality Soviet silk.  The width of the tape, corresponding to the standards of production, was equal to 24 mm.  The red strip, located along the base, had a width of 13 mm and was a kind of symbol of power and was located in the middle of the ribbon. <br><br>  Two narrow longitudinal strips seemed to ‚Äúaccompany‚Äù the red ribbon along the edges.  They were symbols of the endless Soviet fields and the sun, which gave a rich harvest.  Yellow stripes reached a length of 4 mm.  On the edges of the pads were white strips of one and a half millimeters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Award History </h2><p>  The Order of Friendship of Peoples (the price for it sometimes reaches an impressive amount) - this award is quite rare and is of particular value.  A lot of artists worked on the creation of such a beautiful design of the order, which has a rather complex and interesting performance.  The most often awarded enterprises and organizations that worked hard for the good of the Fatherland.  The author of the draft order is Zhuk Alexander Borisovich. </p><h2>  Republics that were lucky to be the first to receive the order </h2><p>  Less than half a month later, as a new, only recently created, order began to award the first lucky ones.  On December 29, 1972, 15 republics, autonomous republics, as well as regions and districts of the Fatherland were awarded.  The first award rightfully belonged to the Russian Soviet Republic, while the second order was given to the fraternal Ukrainian people. </p><h2>  Awarding of citizens </h2><p>  Aviation workers at that time were considered heroes and ‚Äúshock workers‚Äù, so they were the very first people to be awarded this prize.  So, 199 people were awarded on February 9 during 1973.  It was they who fulfilled and exceeded the plan for the implementation of air transportation, mastered new aviation equipment and helped in the reproduction of the national economy. </p>

    <h2>  Awarding organizations and enterprises </h2><p>  Soviet women were very active in terms of public life.  They aspired not only to their direct gender responsibilities.  Everyone wanted to work for the good of the motherland.  Just as a Soviet man defended the honor of his homeland, the Committee of Soviet Women made a huge contribution to the development of relations and the strengthening of relations between fraternal peoples.  For this, this organization was awarded the order.  The award was made on March 6 in the year 73 of the twentieth century. <br><br>  Soviet power saved the whole world from fascism in 1945, therefore, all its citizens knew firsthand how hard the years of the war were and how valuable and important the world was.  That is why young enthusiasts created their own public organization for the protection of peace, which was also awarded the valuable and honorary Order of Friendship in 1974. <br><br>  Of course, not without the leading industrialists who worked for the good of the country's economy and beat one of the "locomotives" of the state.  The Leningrad association "Kirovsky Zavod" made a significant contribution to the development of the public economy of the USSR, for which it was awarded the Order on April 30, 1976. <br><br>  Cultural organizations also made a significant contribution and made it possible for the Soviet people to become accustomed to art, to know the beautiful, to be more educated and comprehensively developed.  The Leningrad Circus, which gave vivid upscale performances, was awarded this order in 1978. <br><br>  Newspapers filled the minds of our compatriots and played an important role in shaping the awareness of citizens.  So, the Moskovskiye Novosti newspaper was awarded in 1980, and the Literaturnaya Gazeta - in 1979. At that time the Moscow Romen Theater was considered one of the most famous, its actors and performances were favorite for the people of the USSR, therefore it was also awarded such an award in 1981. <br><br>  The USSR folk dance ensemble included the best, most talented and experienced dancers who captured, taking them into the magical world of dance.  They were awarded the Order in 1981.  The magazine "Around the World" was one of the most bought, because it contained articles of a cognitive and interesting nature.  They were printed competently and talentedly, liked not only by adults, but also by children. <br><br>  It is not surprising that the journal was awarded the Order of Friendship in 1982. <br>  During the collapse of the Soviet Socialist Power, the Order of Friendship of the USSR lost its Union status and acquired the status of the Order of the Russian Federation.  However, later he was returned the status of the Order of the <span>RSFSR.</span>  <span>This</span> event occurred on March 2nd, 1992.  Since it began to be released anew - the appearance also changed a little.  Symbols of a former power, such as a red ribbon and the inscription "USSR", disappeared. </p>

    <h2>  On the history of the Order of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  The first award ceremonies were resumed immediately after the renewal of the order.  The sensational orbital station "Mir", namely flights there, the study and the courage and great heroism shown at the same time were worthy of the Order of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  River swimming also took place in the economy of the newly born, new country, Russia, because <span>river transport</span> is one of the most convenient and less financially expensive.  In addition, there are many rivers in Russia, and they are actively used for various kinds of transportation.  Therefore, on October 20, 1993, people working at the Volga United River Shipping Company solemnly received the Order of Friendship of the Peoples of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  There are many celebrities who have been awarded this honorary award: </p><p>  - Juna Davitashvili, a healer, whom many influential people from the countries of the former Soviet Union turned to for advice. </p><p>  - UNESCO Director Federico Mayor was also awarded the Order. </p><p>  - Garry Kasparov is known not only as a great grandmaster, but also as a person who deserves the order of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  - Among the artists, one of the lucky winners who received the famous award was Alexander Shirvindt, and among the writers was Mikhail Zhvanetsky, known for his witty jokes, sharp remarks and eloquent statements. </p>
