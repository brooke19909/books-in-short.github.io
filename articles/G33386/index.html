The hotel complex has a large outdoor pool with an equipped terrace for relaxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.secretescapes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Jumeirah Reach Resort 5 Jumeirah" class="if uuid-3167961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3167961.jpg"></div><p>  For sports enthusiasts who can not imagine a day without training, a modern fitness center is working, tennis courts and a squash court are equipped.

Guests can play volleyball at the beach or enjoy water sports. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort Towers, I would like to draw the attention of readers to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  It is worth noting that the opinions of vacationers regarding the complex are very contradictory.  Some tourists are satisfied with the rest, while others note that the hotel has a number of shortcomings, the correction of which the staff should work on. </p><p>  A huge advantage of Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort Towers 5 * is its advantageous location.  The hotel is in a very convenient area, in the center of the metropolis.  If you want to stroll around the largest shopping malls in the city, then you will have the opportunity, because they are in close proximity.  Near the hotel there is a promenade along which all vacationers stroll in the evenings.  There are also city cafes and restaurants, which can also be visited.  The developed infrastructure of the district allows you to eat outside the walls of the hotel, each time choosing a new institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oyster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort 5 UAE" class="if uuid-3167970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3167970.jpg"></div><p>  Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort (Dubai) stands out among other institutions with a huge green area.  Not every hotel in Dubai boasts an abundance of green spaces.  The city is generally sparse with vegetation.  Therefore, the hotel complex looks like a real oasis in the middle of the desert.  The presence of a large garden allows you to spend time with children, not only in the room and on the beach, but also in the recreation areas of the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The most controversial reviews about Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort 5 * (Jumeirah) tourists leave about the number of rooms.  According to vacationers, the hotel apartments have long been in need of updating.  Cosmetic repairs no longer save the situation.  Room stock requires good renovation. </p><p>  Experienced tourists pay attention to the fact that not all apartments are equipped with balconies, although their availability is stated on the institution's website.  When booking rooms, check this moment if this is important to you.  The fact is that in the absence of a balcony there is absolutely nowhere to dry things.  Therefore, during the whole vacation you have to use wet swimwear.  But washing clothes for a child is not at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.secretescapes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort Dubai" class="if uuid-3167962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3167962.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the hotel rooms do not open windows at all.  If your room has a balcony, then this saves the situation.  Otherwise, you will not be able to ventilate the room and you will have to breathe air-conditioned air.  At first glance, this is not a big deal, but this option is completely unsuitable for people with allergies.  Therefore, it is better to pay a little more for a room that has a balcony, so as not to suffer from a lack of comfort during your vacation. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  The hotel rooms are quite suitable for living.  They have everything you need.  Furniture and plumbing, however, are not in the best condition and have long been replaced.  Despite the fact that the hotel is small, tourists note problems with water pressure in the evenings.  The rooms have tea sets.  There is also a minibar, but the drinks in it are quite expensive, so it‚Äôs easier to get them at the nearest store. </p><p>  All rooms have ironing facilities.  Bathrooms include detergents.  Their stocks are replenished daily and in unlimited quantities.  Maids clean rooms and change towels daily.  With the latter in the hotel there are no problems at all.  They are given in unlimited quantities, so there is no need to dry them. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort 5 * (UAE) offers its guests the opportunity to eat in the main restaurant or visit a la carte establishments.  If desired, guests can order half board, full board or breakfast only.  Reviews of tourists regarding food are quite contradictory.  Many note the scarcity of breakfast.  Most often, chicken or sausage is present on tables of meat dishes.  Seafood is sometimes served.  In general, tourists do not appreciate the quality of food and recommend visiting the nearest cafes, which have reasonable prices.  Guests who go out in the evenings to the nearest area usually combine dinner with a walk. </p><p>  Reviewed, Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort has a la carte restaurants if you like Italian cuisine or grilled dishes.  In general, there are no problems with the food in the hotel due to its convenient location. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to reviews, Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort 5 * is located on the coast.  The hotel owns not only a large green area, but also a huge beach.  The coast and the garden are a huge advantage of the hotel complex.  According to tourists, it is the green area and the good coast that distinguish the institution from others.  The beach area is well equipped, there are a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas.  Hotel staff regularly clean the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dubeach.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JSheraton jumeirah Beach Resort Towers" class="if uuid-3167938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3167938.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel's beach is located in a small bay and is fenced off by piers, so even in windy weather, when the sea is worried, you can swim.  The advantages of the institution include a heated pool.  In good hot weather, it is of absolutely no interest, since a beautiful sea splashes in two steps.  But in bad weather, the pool is very relevant, since the water in it is heated to + 28 ... + 30 ¬∞ C.  Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort Jumeirah Beach is a good beach holiday all year round. </p><p>  If you are planning a trip with children, then the hotel complex will definitely suit you, since its gently sloping coast is very convenient for bathing even the smallest tourists.  The sea in this place is small enough that vacationers do not always like, but the beach is convenient for families. </p><h2>  What do tourists say about the hotel? </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the reviews of hotel guests are very contradictory.  Among the tourists there are regular customers of the institution who regularly visit the complex.  They are quite satisfied with the level of service and quality of the rooms.  Other tourists who stay for the first time at the hotel note that it needs a major upgrade.  Indeed, the hotel complex by modern standards has a respectable age.  But, despite this, he continues to receive guests within its walls.  The hotel is small and consists of only one nine-story building, so that there are never crowds of vacationers on the beach.  There is always enough space on the coast for all guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vacances-migros.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort 5 reviews" class="if uuid-3167981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3167981.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel staff are also contradictory.  Some guests note the helpfulness of the workers, while others, on the contrary, hostility.  A deposit is required upon arrival at the hotel, therefore cash must be brought with you.  If you did not use drinks from the bar, money will be returned to you on the day of departure.  Sometimes check-in is very fast, and sometimes tourists have to wait long enough.  Apparently, not all personnel changes are quick in service.  When checking in at the reception, guests are asked to pay extra for a room with a balcony and sea view.  Is it worth it to pay for additional amenities, you decide. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists, the hotel, as in any other hotels, offers all kinds of trips and excursions to vacationers.  The cost of tours is quite high, so many book excursion trips with local guides on the waterfront.  By the way, many of them are immigrants from the CIS countries, therefore they speak excellent Russian.  But at the reception at the hotel there is no Russian-speaking staff, so it is often very difficult to explain. </p><p>  Hotel staff can arrange a transfer for you, but its cost is not included in the ticket.  If you want to save a little, you can order a local taxi yourself.  It‚Äôs better to do this in advance.  Then, at the appointed time, a car will be waiting for you at the entrance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vacances-migros.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort Jumeirah Beach" class="if uuid-3167986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3167986.jpg"></div><p>  In general, the hotel makes a good impression.  Its main advantages are a vast, carefully landscaped area and a large beach, which not every hotel can boast of.  It is these advantages that attract tourists to it.  Of course, the hotel has its flaws.  Its interiors and furnishings are outdated, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Otherwise, the hotel is quite suitable for a beach holiday.  According to tourists, the convenient location of the complex allows you to independently walk around the city.  All the attractions of Dubai are in close proximity, so they can be reached on foot or in a matter of minutes. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the hotel does not correspond to five-star status.  Of course, there are shortcomings that guests mention in the reviews, but they are not so significant as to ruin your vacation.  The hotel complex can be recommended to those people who appreciate the proximity to the beach, convenient location and can close their eyes to minor blemishes. </p>
