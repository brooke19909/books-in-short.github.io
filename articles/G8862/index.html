  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quadcopter Syma X8W: reviews and specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quadcopters "Sima" are traditionally distinguished by balanced characteristics at affordable prices.  The <span>Syma X8W is</span> no exception.  The manufacturer equipped it with a 6-axis gyroscope, Headless mode and auto-rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äã¬∞, took care of a rich configuration and even such trifles as bright lighting.  Moreover, the FPV first-person flight mode is provided, which broadcasts video from the camera in real time, which is unusual for this price category.  However, in order to save money, I had to abandon the GPS and altitude sensor, as users mention in reviews of the quadcopter Syma X8W. </p><h2>  Power and load capacity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.solidrop.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Payload Syma X8W" class="if uuid-2390879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2390879.jpg"></div><p>  The drone is equipped with collector engines.  However, these are unusual motors.  The increased size, increased power and efficiency allow them to accelerate the quadrocopter to a speed of 8 m / s for horizontal movement and 3 m / s when climbing.  The device literally soars up and quickly overcomes tens of kilometers, you just have to press on the direction stick.  At the same time, powerful engines provide not only high speed, but also load capacity.  So, the quadrocopter can be used with attachments - for example, action cameras in aquaboxes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First-Person View (FPV) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cool-things-to-buy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FPV control" class="if uuid-2390880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2390880.jpg"></div><p>  Another advantage that users often mention in their reviews of the Syma X8W quadrocopter is its real-time broadcast support.  The device is equipped with a Wi-Fi module and transfers the image in HD resolution to the smartphone screen.  By controlling the drone, you can observe everything that falls into the camera lens in real time.  With an average price of the device up to $ 100, the presence of such a function is not typical. </p><h2>  Huge selection of spare parts </h2><p>  The manufacturer offers a large number of accessories and spare parts.  All elements of the case and the electronic system are in free sale: replaceable batteries and covers, propeller protection and the screws themselves, the chassis and parts of the case, cameras and receivers.  Any part in the event of a breakdown can be replaced, and this is another advantage that users note in their reviews of the Syma X8W quadrocopter with a camera. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  The presence of Headless mode and a 6-axis gyroscope greatly simplifies interaction with the quadrocopter.  With them it‚Äôs convenient to control a drone that does not change axes, it itself resists wind gusts and keeps the horizontal position inactive.  Beginners who are just mastering unmanned models will be able to lift the quadrocopter into the air in a matter of minutes and perform the first trick.  By the way, directly on the remote control there is a key that is responsible for automatic flips. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Complete equipment and more </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Syma-Quadcopter-2-0MP-Camera/dp/B0126YRF46"><img itemprop="image" alt="Options Syma X8W" class="if uuid-2390881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2390881.jpg"></div><p>  In positive reviews of the quadcopter Syma X8W, users often note the rich content of the set.  Unlike most manufacturers, Sima provides not only protection for propellers, but also a phone holder, spare screws and even a screwdriver.  Also in the package there is a battery, charging, control panel, USB cable for connecting a third-party camera, instructions and a card reader for connecting MicroSD to a computer or laptop.  The only thing you need to buy is a set of four AA batteries. </p><h2>  Lack of GPS </h2><p>  In reviews of the quadcopter Syma X8W, owners note dissatisfaction with the lack of geolocation.  Of course, this is a necessary thing, which allows you not to lose a drone.  However, the range of the control panel specifically in this model is small - up to 150 meters, so the quadrocopter will always remain within sight.  However, GPS is not limited to finding a lost device.  Navigation allows the drone to return to the user when the battery is low or the signal from the remote control is lost, as well as fly along a predetermined path. </p><h2>  Poor shooting quality </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.raidentech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Syma X8W Movie Quality" class="if uuid-2390882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2390882.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Quadcopter Syma X8W</span> with FPV-camera, reviews of which are mostly positive, still scolded for unsatisfactory recording.  A matrix with a resolution of 0.3 megapixels formally shoots HD-video, but the color rendition and detail of distant objects really leave much to be desired.  As noted above, the quadrocopter has enough power to lift almost any action camera in the aquabox, so the problem of poor quality shooting is solved.  It is important to consider that with extra weight the flight time is reduced: up to 12 minutes without load and up to 8 with equipment. </p><h2>  Lack of a barometer </h2><p>  The height sensor is needed to keep the position inactive and more clear video.  Its absence, of course, is not catastrophic, but it was the reason for a large number of negative reviews about the Syma X8W quadrocopter from users who planned to ‚Äúhang in the air‚Äù to create high-quality photos.  Shortly after the release of this model, an updated version appeared with the letter ‚ÄúH‚Äù in the title.  It differs from its predecessor only in the presence of a barometer. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The model has both its advantages and disadvantages.  However, the cons noted by users are quite expected given the low cost of the drone.  Therefore, the Syma X8W quadrocopter with a camera (reviews above) remains a good choice for beginners who want to not only control it, but also shoot from a height. </p>
