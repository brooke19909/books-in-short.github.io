    <p>  So be careful.  Some write that the sea is calm and there are no big waves, since the bay is surrounded by mountains, and there is no strong wind.  Conditions for relaxing on the beach, in principle, are comfortable.  You can ride a banana or a pedalo for a fee, on small boats along the bay.  The places are still very beautiful.  Fans of natural attractions will be satisfied. </p><p>  Some tourists complain about the garbage on the beach, they say that it is full of cigarette butts, no one collects them, although there are staff on the beach, and there are garbage bins.  But there is a way out.  Some tourists write that the beach area is conditionally divided into free and paid beaches.  On a paid - sand cover, and you just need to buy at least one cocktail from the owner in his bar - and sunbathe as much as you like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also near the sea there is a free shower and comfortable changing rooms.  Sunset at sea is quite gentle, so it is convenient for both children and those who cannot swim. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Whoever didn‚Äôt have enough space on the pebble of the beach, can spend the day on the numerous sun loungers of the Marbas Beach Hotel 3 *, arranged around two pools.  The water is clean, the courtyard is cozy, and the expanse of children.  Near the large pool for adults is a small paddling pool. </p>

    <p>  Many more are advised to go to Turtle Island and the Dalyan River.  In addition to the beauty and natural attractions, tourists have seen enough on giant turtles listed in the Red Book.  The tour also includes fishing for blue crabs with their subsequent eating.  One serving will cost 450 rubles.  People complain that the crabs are very tasty, but the portions are small.  To eat plenty, you need to take a few.  I also liked the trip to the island of turtles along the Dalyan River.  Rocky banks surround the river, on which the famous Lycian tombs are located. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In general, after reading a lot of reviews, we can conclude that the hotel corresponds to its three stars.  The beach is nearby, 50 meters away, you just need to go down a small ladder.  The rooms are bright and comfortable.  The hotel is located at the very end of Icmeler, so there is not much noise.  After 23.00 there is silence. </p><p>  See next to what.  The climate is wonderful, the sea is warm and beautiful.  And most importantly, deliciously fed.  So for an inexpensive vacation it‚Äôs quite suitable. </p>
