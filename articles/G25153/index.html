Financial Report to Husband</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern women are increasingly interested in each other how to properly prepare a report for the husband on the state of the family budget.  For some, this issue is extremely important in view of the need to save money, someone simply wants to learn how to manage cash flows, and for some, reporting is a means of manipulation.  This action is not always required for good purposes.  Some spouses thus not only control every step of the second half, but also try to manipulate in every way.  Should I report to my husband for spending?  How to keep a family budget?  Where can the money be spent?  The answers to all these questions will be surely found below.  If you correctly approach the solution of the task, it will not cause any significant trouble. </p>

    <h2>  Reasons for reporting </h2><p>  A report for the husband about the state of the family budget is not always a bad thing.  Although many women perceive this requirement as an infringement of rights and a manifestation of distrust between spouses. </p><p>  Here are the most common reasons men ask for expense alerts: </p><ul><li>  the need to save money (difficult financial situation); </li><li>  desire to save more; </li><li>  control of all purchases; </li><li>  greed; </li><li>  fast expense of funds even with high earnings. </li></ul><p>  In some cases, husbands require reporting to hide their own unreasonable expenses.  But often a similar situation arises in order to save, in order to calculate how much money is required for a normal life and in case of spouse‚Äôs greed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Family Budget Types </h2><p>  How to make a report for your husband?  First, a few words about how people distribute money.  The answer to the question depends on whether it is necessary to report for each purchase at all. </p>

    <p>  The family budget is: </p><ul><li>  joint; </li><li>  separate; </li><li>  mixed. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, all spouses' incomes are collected in one ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù, and then distributed to family needs.  Money is considered common.  With a separate budget, each spouse manages only the means that he earned on his own.  There is no joint budget. </p><p>  A mixed type of family budget is a combination of the previously listed forms.  Spouses put in a common ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù certain (usually equal) amounts from their income, and spend the rest at their discretion.  Of the general finances, all current family needs are paid. </p><h2>  Who is in charge of finance </h2><p>  The financial report to a husband or wife, as we have already said, is often perceived as humiliation and a sign of distrust.  But this is not so bad.  <span>Maintaining a family budget</span> helps control costs, save more for a rainy day and save. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that in modern families, even with a joint budget, spouses can keep track of household finances in different ways.  Most often, this question will be led by someone alone - husband or wife.  Only in some cases, absolutely all purchases and expenses are equally controlled by both spouses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the spouse keeps the home budget, the husband can at any time ask where the wife spends the money.  And vice versa.  This is normal.  But only if the spouse was not originally stingy and not greedy.  Otherwise, full financial statements will be a means of manipulation and submission. </p><h2>  Earning a husband and wife </h2><p>  Home finances give citizens a lot of trouble.  Especially when it comes to couples or people with children.  After all, while a person lives alone, he himself fully controls his cash flows. </p><p>  In a family, relationships often develop in such a way that one spouse makes money, and the other distributes them.  And then the first may require a report.  This will help to understand how much money is needed for a normal life. </p><p>  Some believe that the wife‚Äôs earnings are her personal money.  And the husband‚Äôs income is family income.  Such a model really is.  And she often succeeds.  In particular, if a woman does household work and works in her free time. </p><p>  There are people who believe that a report for a husband, if a woman works, is humiliation.  A similar model is found, as a rule, with a mixed or separate method of conducting home accounting. </p><p>  It happens only occasionally that a husband takes all his money from his wife, and even requires reporting for each purchase.  In Russia, such behavior is not welcome.  Especially given the fact that women do household work and are more familiar with store prices. </p><h2>  Where is the edge of decency </h2><p>  The financial report to the husband is usually done at the end of the month.  Consider several situations that occur in real life.  Suppose a family has a joint budget.  The husband makes money, the wife is engaged in everyday life and children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Reporting to the spouse in this case is the norm.  After all, the breadwinner must well understand how much money is needed to ensure a decent life for the family.  Sometimes it happens that a woman puts "pins" and excesses too much money to the detriment of her husband, children and family needs. </p>

    <p>  The described situation often includes an oral report in general terms.  A woman must tell how much money has been spent: </p><ul><li>  for food; </li><li>  to transport; </li><li>  for lunch to her husband at work (if available); </li><li>  on clothes, shoes; </li><li>  for education; </li><li>  on drugs and medicine; </li><li>  for entertainment and everyday life; </li><li>  for household chemicals. </li></ul><p>  It is such a report that will satisfy a normal husband-earner.  If too much money is spent, the spouse may ask to save on certain categories of expenses.  Especially if the salary is already small. </p><p>  But most often reports are required by a greedy husband.  The previously described option will not be enough for him.  A person will begin to demand all checks, receipts and payments, not trusting his spouse.  This is greed.  In particular, if the family has a normal income and there is no need to observe the economy. </p><h2>  Where does the money go </h2><p>  Savings - this is the main reason why spouses can ask each other to report on purchases.  Both in full and in general terms. </p><p>  If the family decided to take up reporting (this prerogative is passed mainly to the wives), you will have to keep a purchase journal.  It will help to understand where the money goes, as well as how much money is needed for a normal life. </p><p>  Most often it turns out that family finances are spent on: </p><ul><li>  entertainment; </li><li>  cafes and restaurants; </li><li>  snacks and snacks; </li><li>  delicacies that can be dispensed with; </li><li>  medicines; </li><li>  Doctors </li><li>  food bought in stores; </li><li>  transport (gasoline, car service, bus and metro tickets). </li></ul><p>  Women can spend too much money on cosmetics, perfumes, as well as on clothes and shoes for themselves.  If the husband or wife is "ill" with shopaholism, the report will not be superfluous. </p>

    <h2>  Notebook Entries </h2><p>  To properly take into account home finances, spouses will have to spend a lot of time.  This is painstaking work, which not everyone can handle. </p><p>  As a report, people often start a special notebook in which all the expenses of the day are recorded.  They are supported by checks.  At the end of the month, expenses are calculated with further analysis. </p><h2>  "Excel" to the rescue </h2><p>  Also, as a report, you can keep a journal of expenses in Excel.  It should be completed by both spouses by analogy with the previous method. </p><p>  At the same time, it is advisable to keep checks.  You can prescribe every purchase up to apples and milk with prices in order to visually see what the family can do without. </p><h2>  Mobile Software </h2><p>  The next type of report for a husband or wife for expenses is the use of programs for mobile devices.  For example, there is a Home Accounting application.  With it, a person will be able to enter all the expenses and income, and then analyze the data. </p><p>  Most of these applications are free.  The problem is that such a report is painstaking.  And wives may forget to enter in-app purchases.  This means that full control of finances will not work. </p><h2>  How to deal with greed </h2><p>  Does a greedy husband need to constantly report for every purchase?  Doesn't give money for a family?  "Cut back" the amount of finances allocated for family needs? </p><p>  In such circumstances, the wife should not scrupulously collect checks and provide full reporting.  You will have to fight greed.  How? </p><p>  The reports here will not help.  But the spouse can be entrusted with conducting home accounting and making all purchases independently.  As a rule, after a few months, the requirement to submit a report disappears. </p>

    <h2>  Only cashless </h2><p>  There is another option, but it does not provide for detailing purchases.

Purchases can be viewed either through online banking or by ordering an extract from a financial institution. </p>
