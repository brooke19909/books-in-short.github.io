It is less known, but contains more than 1000 works.  His collection covers a large time period, from the 13th century Italian painting to the modern achievements of pop art. </p><h2>  Collection founder </h2><p>  Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza was founded by one of the wealthy art lovers, Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza de Cason, who for many years has been collecting a collection of paintings and sculptures. </p><p>  He inherited the first collection of works of art from his father, Augustus Thyssen, together with flourishing oil-producing and shipbuilding enterprises.  It consisted of a collection of paintings by European masters of the XIV-XIX centuries.  Part of the inheritance in the form of paintings was received by his brothers, but Henry immediately bought them.  Then he continued to replenish the collection, having bought over his life more than 1.5 thousand different pieces of art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripexpert.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum exposition" class="if uuid-2843873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2843873.jpg"></div><p>  Thyssen-Bornemisza had a stormy personal life: he had 5 wives, namely: </p><ul><li>  Austrian princess Teresa Lippe-Weissenfeld, with whom he had a son, and then divorced; </li><li>  the Indian model Nine Sheila Gyor, who became the heiress of lands in Ceylon, received a French estate after the divorce; </li><li>  British model (born in New Zealand) Fiona Camboe-Walter, with whom 2 children were married; </li><li>  the daughter of a Brazilian banker Liana Shorto, who bore him a son; </li><li>  Maria Carmen Server, who won the title of Miss Spain in 1961. </li></ul><p>  After the death of his father, the addition to the collection was taken up by his son and heir, Hans Heinrich (1921-2002), who significantly expanded it by adding works by European artists of the 13th-20th centuries.  Sculptures and other works of art were acquired. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the museum </h2><p>  After moving to Switzerland, the Thyssen-Bornemisza family opened a private gallery, which gained fame in the world.  The art collection was kept for many years in the city of Lugano (Switzerland), at the Villa Favorito, however, gradually growing, it ceased to be placed there.  In addition to paintings, Hans began to buy jewelry and ceramic products, antique furniture, tapestries and other decor items. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theartmarket.es" data-author=": An√≠bal Trejo, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spouses Thyssen-Bornemisza" class="if uuid-2859808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2859808.jpg"></div><p>  To get to the gallery, tourists had to cross the lake by boat.  In the 1980s, the baron announced the search for suitable premises to house the collection, but local authorities refused to help him.  Then the government of Spain came up with a proposal to place all the exhibits in the castle of Villahermos (translated from Italian as ‚Äúbeautiful villa‚Äù), which was located next to the famous Prado Museum in Madrid. </p><p>  For many years there have been musical meetings and salons in the castle, where famous musicians performed: F. Liszt and others. The Spanish wife of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza, model and Miss Catalonia of 1961, fully contributed to this decision.  A $ 50 million long-term lease was concluded, according to which 665 paintings were placed in the castle of Villahermosa (Palacio de Villahermosa) and became the basis of the museum in Madrid, and 72 were transferred to the Monastery of Pedralbes (Barcelona).  At the grand opening of the museum was attended by the family of the Spanish king. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zimbio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza" class="if uuid-2859798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2859798.jpg"></div><p>  In 1993, most of the collection of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum was purchased by the Spanish government for $ 350 million (it is believed that its current value is estimated at $ 700 million). </p><p>  After the death of the wife of Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza is still engaged in the replenishment of the collection.  200 exhibits purchased by her are exhibited in one of the halls of the museum. </p><h2>  New premises </h2><p>  In 2004, after expanding the museum‚Äôs collection, it became necessary to build a new building.  In addition to the 3-story castle, a new one was built nearby, built in a modern style.  This is where regular exhibitions, scientific and educational seminars, and cultural events take place. </p><p>  Thanks to the efforts of the art director and the administration of the museum, strong relationships have been established with other museums located around the world.  So, for many years mutually beneficial cooperation has been established between Madrid and Moscow, allowing cultural institutions of both cities to periodically exchange works of art for exhibiting and holding exhibitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spainessentials.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum in Madrid, 2nd building" class="if uuid-2859818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2859818.jpg"></div><h2>  Collections and exhibits </h2><p>  More than 1 million art lovers visit the museum annually.  Together with the Prado and the Reina Sofia Museum of Art, he is rightfully included in the Golden Triangle, the top three most popular art galleries in Madrid (Spain). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In total there are more than 500 paintings in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum.  They are located in the halls in chronological order. </p><p>  One of the museum‚Äôs symbols is a beautiful portrait of J. Tornabuoni, the Italian master D. Ghirlandaio, who is considered a model of the Florentine quadrocento style.  This also includes famous works that are recognized as masterpieces of the collection: ‚ÄúThe Man with the Clarinet‚Äù (1911) P. Picasso, ‚ÄúThe Painting with 3 Spots‚Äù (1914) by V. Kandinsky, ‚ÄúSt.  Carolina ¬ªCaravaggio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="faculty.philosophy.umd.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of J. Tornabuoni" class="if uuid-2859701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2859701.jpg"></div><p>  The halls feature works by Flemish artists, impressionists and avant-garde artists.  The most expensive painting in the collection is the canvas of P. Gauguin, ‚ÄúFormer Times‚Äù (1892), estimated at 150 million euros.  There are also paintings by S. Dali, ‚ÄúA Dream Inspired by the Flight of a Bee ...‚Äù (1944) and others. </p><p>  The collection of the museum in Madrid includes numerous works of European painting from different eras, from the Renaissance to modern masters.  The canvases are presented in various styles: impressionism, realism, expressionism, mannerism, baroque, primitivism and gothic.  Going around the collection, you can gradually follow the rich history of various art forms. </p><p>  Represented paintings on religious subjects, portraits and landscapes, mystical and realistic stories of world famous artists: El Greco, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Degas, Modigliani, Picasso, Renoir, Salvador Dali and many others.  In 4 rooms there is also a collection of American painting of the 19th century. </p><h2>  Collection management </h2><p>  In the 1960s, Hans Heinrich, expanding the accessibility of art for all spectators, constantly organized visiting exhibitions: the collection was exhibited in many countries of the world, including museums in Australia, Japan and the Soviet Union. </p><p>  By agreement between Moscow and Madrid, in 2006 the Russian Avant-Garde exhibition was successfully held at the museum, where everyone could get acquainted with the origins of this trend in Russia in the first third of the 20th century.  The works of Chagall, Kandinsky and Filonov were presented here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiart.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picasso and Kandinsky" class="if uuid-2859727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2859727.jpg"></div><p>  Many years after the death of her husband, the widow, Maria del Carmen Rosario Server, was the manager of the collection.  Almost 700 exhibits from the collection of Thyssen-Bornemisza with the permission of the widow were transferred to replenish the funds of the National Museum of Art in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãin its hometown.  Pictures are now exhibited in the castle of Willon and will be there by agreement until 2025. </p><p>  In addition to providing an opportunity to admire the works of the art collection, the former Miss of Spain sometimes sells paintings in other private collections (in New York and others) in order to improve her financial situation.  However, under the terms of the agreement with Spain, Maria del Carmen can only deal with paintings within 10% of the cost of the entire collection, estimated by experts at 800 million euros. </p><h2>  21st century in the museum </h2><p>  In the new millennium, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum pursues a policy of attracting all people with the help of new achievements.  Special applications for electronic gadgets, pages on social networks, etc. have been developed. The museum‚Äôs own website has been created, which is regularly updated, informing art lovers about exhibitions and the composition of the collection. </p><p>  All these innovations are designed to interest everyone with a collection of works of art, to please those connoisseurs who cannot regularly visit the museum itself.  For this, the possibility of a virtual inspection of some rooms and paintings is offered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.madridsmartrentals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thyssen Museum new building" class="if uuid-2843856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2843856.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours, address, ticket price </h2><p>  Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum Address: Madrid, Paseo del Prado, 8 (city center).
