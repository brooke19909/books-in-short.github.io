The choice of places to stay here is great: you can come to the calm and warm Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, or you can choose one of the many resorts on the hospitable Black Sea, which, of course, is more popular. </p><p>  It is easy to guess that many tourists during their vacation want to not only swim in the sea, but also enjoy the comfort that various hotels available in the Republic of Crimea can offer them.  All-inclusive hotels with a swimming pool, simpler hotels and numerous guest houses, motels and rest houses, a developed private sector - all this can be easily found in the territory of this magnificent health resort.  It all depends on the needs of vacationers and their wallet. </p><h2>  What is better to choose for a vacation in Crimea </h2><p>  Going to the sea in the summer season, some tourists do not even pay attention to whether their hotel has a swimming pool or not.  Indeed, very close will be a huge body of water, in the presence of which no other body of water, especially artificial, is needed. </p>

    <p>  But the other part of vacationers can not imagine a vacation without the opportunity to plunge into the pool, even if there is a sea nearby.  This is explained by several reasons: it is much harder to go to the beach in the heat, and the water in the sea is sometimes dirty, but in the pools it is always clean.  In bad weather, a storm can begin, and then you can completely forget about swimming.  But if you have a swimming pool, you can‚Äôt refuse this pleasure under any weather conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Republic of Crimea, hotels with a pool and a beach are simultaneously becoming more popular.  Indeed, today many very small guest houses have small pools, but most of them cannot boast of their own access to the sea.  Vacationers in such places have to go to public beaches, and such a path can be very short.  Guests who choose <span>Crimea hotels</span> with a pool, which also has a well-equipped place for swimming in the sea, can quickly find themselves on the beach. </p><p>  Someone does not come to rest in the summer and not in the velvet season.  At this time, you can already forget about swimming in the sea, because the water there is already quite cool.  And in this case, Crimea hotels with a swimming pool, where you can swim enough even in winter, come to the rescue. </p><h2>  The best hotels with a pool in Crimea </h2><p>  Going to visit the peninsula, each vacationer first of all looks through all the possible options for their accommodation.  Based on prices, the proposed service and the location of hotels, tourists select for themselves the most preferred options and go on vacation. </p><p>  For those who know for sure that the Crimea hotels with a swimming pool can offer the most wonderful holidays, there are several places that will be discussed below.  These hotels will delight tourists not only with excellent service, but also with a great location that will leave few indifferent. </p><h2>  Five Star Pearl of Yalta </h2><p>  Only in August 2014 the magnificent five-star complex Mriya Resort &amp; SPA was opened, but it has already managed to fall in love with the guests of the peninsula and even become a laureate of several awards.  This hotel is located in Yalta, in the village of Opolznevoy, right on the Black Sea.  Everything is amazing here: the unique main building, whose bird's-eye view resembles a lotus flower, and exquisite rooms that meet the needs of the most demanding guests, and the list of services available at this hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
