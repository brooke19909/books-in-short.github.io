Perhaps the Abkhazians with the Georgians would have found a common language, if not for the intervention of other countries.  However, history does not know the word ‚Äúif,‚Äù and the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict is far from resolved.  The access to the Black Sea has become a tasty morsel for some countries of the world that will fight for it, despite human casualties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Georgian-Abkhaz conflict" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/57291.jpg" width="462"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Reasons for the conflict</strong> </p><p>  Back in 1991, the first outbreaks of discontent in Georgia occurred, but they were only <span>national in nature</span> and were insignificant.  The United States could not help but take this chance, because the struggle for the primacy in the world of the two strongest states was gaining momentum.  The United States, as a member of NATO, back in 1998 declared the military responsibility of the bloc over what is happening in Ukraine, Moldova and the Caucasus.  Thus, they, approaching closer to Russia, tried to "recapture" one after another the countries that supported it. </p><p>  Then NATO had a need to lay an oil pipe through the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Balkans.  After that, it was decided to build a railway connecting Central Asia, Transcaucasia, the Black Sea, and the West.  Then the United States pay attention to Georgia and thereby provoke the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.  First, the Georgian army switches to <span>American weapons,</span> and Russia is not very profitable to have such a neighbor, even dangerous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhaz conflict" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/57286.jpg" width="450"></div>  Then Georgia strikes Russia below the belt - joins NATO, although this was to be expected.  The United States dominates the country as at home.  The Abkhaz conflict is developing with renewed vigor: the people of this region with pro-Russian sentiments are protesting against the Americans.  Georgia was divided into two camps: some stretching to the West, others to Russia.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Ethnic and Political Conflict</strong> </p><p>  In history, this confrontation is also known as the "ethnopolitical conflict", because it was provoked artificially by two powerful states of the world.  This is a kind of struggle for the distribution of spheres of influence in the world.  Russia does not want to lose Georgia as a peaceful neighbor.  And the USA really needs it.  After all, on its territory you can install <span>nuclear warheads</span> aimed at Russia. </p><p>  The bloodshed there was not beneficial to any state, nor to another.  But still, the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict erupted.  Russia sent its peacekeeping troops to the territory of Abkhazia.  The United States did not like this, and they quickly find a way out of the situation: since Georgia is a member of NATO, it is they (that is, the United States) who must enter their peacekeeping units there.  Well, the allies were forced to retreat, and the current president of the Americans said that they can repeat Yugoslavia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ethnic and Political Conflict" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/57294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  America is afraid to develop serious military operations in Abkhazia, so as not to provoke a war that will violate plans for the construction of the railway.  In addition, any explosion can lead to disaster, since methane accumulated in the old mines of Tkuarchala.  The dust from his explosion will scatter along the entire Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Russia is worried about the emergency condition of the <span>Inguri Hydroelectric Power Station,</span> so the conduct of hostilities is also disadvantageous for it.  She is most interested in stabilizing the situation in Georgia, because it will bring peace to the whole of Transcaucasia.  At present, the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict remains unresolved.  Nobody wants to give up a tasty morsel of land.  Peacekeeping is being undertaken by a special NATO ambassador. </p>
