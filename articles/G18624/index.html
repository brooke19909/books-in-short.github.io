But if the scanners do not need maintenance, then the printers must be refilled and repaired in a timely manner.  And what to do if suddenly the printer does not print well after refilling with fresh toner?  In our article, we will consider the most popular causes of this phenomenon.  After all, most users trust the services that provide cartridge refilling services.  And hardly anyone wondered if the service is provided in a quality manner. </p><h2>  The main elements of the printer </h2><p>  We will not describe the principle of operation of the printer, but only list those elements that directly affect print quality.  Firstly, <span>it is a cartridge,</span> which consists of several shafts (we will talk about them a bit below) and compartments (for new toner and waste).  Secondly, it is a heating mechanism - a Teflon-coated shaft that heats the paper so that the toner adheres securely to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crsprintek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cartridge Appearance" class="if uuid-2645532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2645532.jpg"></div><p>  These elements are responsible for print quality.  But for the functioning of the printer is responsible and the paper feeder, and a set of gears for pulling the sheet throughout the mechanism.  In other words, there are a lot of mechanisms in the design, but they do not affect the quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Toner is our everything! </h2><p>  And now about why the printer does not print well.  The very first reason is low-quality toner.  This is a powder that is refilled in the cartridge hopper and when heated, it is absorbed into the paper, leaving a mark on it.  It is worth noting that only one toner is suitable for each printer model.  In other words, toner for Canon will not work on HP typewriters and vice versa.  The reason lies in the chemical composition of the powders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="secure.partsmart-corp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disassembled laser printer cartridge" class="if uuid-2645539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2645539.jpg"></div><p>  In some toner one metal is contained, in another - another.  And if you refill Canon toner into the HP printer cartridge, it may turn out that after printing, the powder will simply sprinkle from the sheet.  The chemical composition affects the temperature at which the powder can absorb into the sheet of paper.  Therefore, when refueling yourself, you must use at least universal toners.  But it is better to purchase the original. </p><h2>  Paper quality </h2><p>  By the way, if the printer does not print well, the reason may lie in the paper itself.  It is possible that it is of poor quality; toner adheres poorly to it.  The solution to the problem in this case will be very simple - change the paper brand.  A completely different matter, if suddenly the printer began to print very pale.  The problem may lie in several elements of the cartridge, which we will talk about at once. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Drum (photo) </h2><p>  This is one of the elements that is directly responsible for print quality.  We can say that this is such a matrix on a cylindrical shaft.  A voltage is applied to it, which causes the toner to be attracted (and it consists of metals, including).  The drum unit comes in contact with a heated sheet of paper and leaves an imprint on it.  And if the HP printer does not print well, then the reason may lie precisely in this detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cartridgerefillingingurgaon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Refill drums and toner" class="if uuid-2645531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2645531.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of an element in the wholesale markets is from 100 rubles, replacement is not difficult.  Installing a new photo camera is guaranteed to improve print quality.  By the way, quite often the matrix on the drum wears out strictly along the borders of the sheet.  As a result, the voltage does not reach certain areas.  In this case, some sections of the page are not printed.  As for the insufficient toner level, it can also be seen on the outgoing sheet - in the middle there will be a light streak.  In this case, only refueling will help. </p><h2>  Magnetic shaft </h2><p>  The cartridge includes, as a rule, three shafts - one of them is magnetic.  On the outside, it has a smooth dielectric surface, and inside is a permanent magnet.  With it, the toner is transferred to the drum unit.  Moreover, the toner is applied in a thin layer to the <span>magnetic shaft</span> , then some of it is transferred to the photo printable, and the rest is dumped into the waste bunker.  That's just the magnet in it is not quite permanent - it has the property of demagnetizing. </p><p>  Therefore, over time, the toner adheres to the surface much worse, therefore, it is less used for printing.  Only replacing the shaft will help.  But if you want to experiment, then you can try to re-magnetize it.  Although it is unlikely to be effective. </p><h2>  Grab roller </h2><p>  This is one of the three shafts that are available in the cartridges.  By the way, in some models there is no such shaft in the cartridges; it is installed in the printer itself.  It consists of a metal core and a rubber shell, which tends to wear out.  And if the elastic is cracking, then the paper does not capture or it is crooked.  In general, this does not affect print quality.  But the paper feed has a direct impact. </p><h2>  How to refill a cartridge correctly </h2><p>  If, after service centers, a Canon or any other printer prints poorly, is it time to think about doing this procedure yourself?  Indeed, the cost of refueling is sometimes such that for this amount you can purchase 0.5 kg of high-quality toner.  And if you serve immediately a dozen of the same type of printers, then the savings are obvious.  One thing - if the shafts have become unusable, they must be replaced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonerwest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cartridge Repair Procedure" class="if uuid-2645534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2645534.jpg"></div><p>  And sometimes the cartridges wear out to such an extent that it is impossible to restore them.  But let's not talk about sad things.  Let's look at the cartridge refilling algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Remove it from the printer. </li><li>  On the side, unscrew the screws that secure the cover. </li><li>  Depending on which printer model you may need to remove the studs that connect the two halves of the cartridge. </li><li>  When the cartridge is divided into two halves, you need to shake out all the toner from the waste bin. </li><li>  Open the filling hole and pour toner into it.  On some cartridges, you need to fill up new toner through the hole that opens after removing the magnetic shaft. </li><li>  Reassemble everything in reverse order. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that if the Epson printer (color) does not print well, you need to make sure that the image drum is working properly.  Typically, in color printers 3-4 cartridges, each with one magnetic shaft.  A common drum.  And if it becomes worthless, then print quality is deteriorating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="estrategys.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Printer Refill Hole" class="if uuid-2645535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2645535.jpg"></div><p>  There are printers in which cartridges in which the mining hopper and the main are connected.  The result is a high toner resource; it lasts for more pages.  And most importantly, do not forget to change the chip, if it is provided for by design. </p><h2>  Main refueling errors </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tecasinfo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Color cartridges in the printer" class="if uuid-2645536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2645536.jpg"></div><p>  Often, many service centers make two big mistakes - refill cartridges that are not repairable and do not dispose of toner in the waste bunker.  If you do not do the latter, then when printing will appear black bars on the sheet.  The reason lies in the fact that the excess toner has nowhere to go and he eventually remains on paper, and does not enter the hopper.  Try not to make such a mistake so that the print quality of your printer remains the best. </p>
