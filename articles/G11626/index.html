    <h2>  Connection with Russian Sevastopol and Crimea </h2><p>  In Crimea, new telephone codes are already in effect.  To get through to Crimeans, you need to dial a common code and phone number of the subscriber.  A call is made from a landline telephone through the code 8-365, and from a mobile + 7-365.  But if we talk about how to call Sevastopol, it should be noted that a different code works here - 869. Instead of six digits, now you need to enter seven. </p><p>  The mail coordinates have also changed.  We are talking about indices: to the previous combination of numbers, a deuce was added at the beginning.  If the code was, say, 12345, then now it is 212345. </p><h2>  Disconnect communication </h2>

But the problems started the day before: there were problems with making calls, it was only possible to send an SMS message.  Many residents did not disconnect, but only <span>emergency calls were made.</span>  Many callers heard on the other end of the phone that the <span>subscriber was not registered on the network.</span>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is easy to guess that in the morning, alarmed people rushed into services with the aim of buying a Russian SIM card and created a full house in bursts.  Surprisingly, everyone was warned in advance that the connection would be disconnected.  Many switched to the Russian operator at the beginning of summer, when the cards were only imported.  Some naively believed that their current numbers would take on a different look (a combination of +7 instead of +380), but no one thought that this was impossible for technical reasons. </p><h2>  Own operator - myth or reality? </h2><p>  It is worth noting an interesting fact.  At the end of May, <span>Acting</span> Head of the Republic of Crimea <span>Sergey Aksyonov</span> announced that the peninsula authorities are considering the possibility that their own mobile operator will appear in Crimea.  More precisely, a plan was prepared to implement this undertaking.  This idea could be a success, since the mobile market for the entire peninsula is approximately three million people.  But one thing can be stated with certainty: Crimea will not remain without a connection, and you can not worry about how to call Sevastopol - the problem has already been solved. </p>

    <h2>  Mobile systems of Russia in the hero city </h2><p>  You can call Sevastopol from Russia from any number, but you need to clarify something.  So far, the only tariff is valid on the peninsula.  Now residents are spontaneously buying MTS cards.  The tariff is very profitable: 50 rubles are already on the account, the card costs the same.  Almost free!  By the way, ten SIM cards can be purchased for one passport.  Calls in the Crimea and in the cities of the Krasnodar Territory are absolutely free, if the total duration of the call does not exceed 20 minutes.  If the subscriber speaks more, then 1.5 rubles will be debited from his account, and this means that you can talk for a hundred minutes already.  In the event that a hundred minutes are spent, 3 rubles will be written off, and the number of minutes will double. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Calling to Sevastopol from Moscow is more expensive, since the distance between the cities is rather big.  3 rubles per minute - this is the tariff plan.  Touching upon the question of how to call Sevastopol, it is worth noting that if the subscriber has a different tariff, then the call price will be more than 9 rubles per minute.  But due to the location of the regions, this is entirely justified. </p><p>  In general, calls to Sevastopol from Russia are carried out in the same way as to other cities: we dial +7, and then the phone number.  Most Crimeans have numbers starting at +797, which can be considered a hallmark of the Crimean connection. </p><h2>  Special services </h2><p>  If we talk about how to make a call to Sevastopol, it should be noted that MTS offers the connection of a profitable service called ‚ÄúFree Calls to MTS of Russia 100‚Äù.  After its activation, the subscriber will be charged 200 minutes.  This number of minutes will arrive at the room daily.  Of these, a hundred will go to calls in the Krasnodar Territory, Sevastopol and Crimea, and a hundred more - to calls to other Russian regions.  <span>The subscription fee</span> is 1.5 rubles per day.  45 rubles a month comes out, not so much, agree?  For comparison: before 25 days of using the Super-MTS Ukraine package, they cost 40 hryvnias.  If you translate into rubles, then about 120 rubles came out, and this is two and a half months of using the tariff "Calls for free on the MTS of Russia 100". </p>

    <p>  Not surprisingly, subscribers who were previously indignant at the high cost of Russian communications were satisfied.  True, some still cannot figure out the tariff plan, but if you do not want to spend a lot of money, you can turn off some services for which funds will not be charged.  In general, the quality of communication, and the prices that are set for this service, are quite satisfied with Crimeans. </p>
