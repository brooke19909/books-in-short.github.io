    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The Sreda residential complex (Ryazansky Prospekt, metro station as a landmark) is located at a distance of just over five kilometers from the station.  But a few meters away is the Moscow Central Ring, the Nizhny Novgorod stop.  Buyers of apartments will be able to get from the metro station to future housing by several trolleybus and bus routes.  In time it is only about 15 minutes.  There are also several minibuses passing the Sreda residential complex, the new building of which will soon take its place on the avenue. </p>

    <p>  Currently, the walk from the metro station to the complex is somewhat far away, and hardly anyone will be able to overcome it on foot.  You can still get by electric train to the Karacharovo station of the Gorky direction, which is actually across the road from the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Convenience rating </h2><p>  Now ‚ÄúSreda‚Äù (residential complex) is being built in a very convenient place.  Between the lively Ryazan Avenue and the future peace of the residents of the complex there is a business center.  In the future, the structure of the flyover in the immediate vicinity of the complex is forecasted.  To date, the arrival in the complex cannot please the owners of their own vehicles, as it is not very convenient.  It is possible and best to get along Ryazan Avenue, only it is the widest and most convenient for travel.  All other porches are narrow.  And the avenue itself is almost always loaded with cars.  The construction of an overpass has its effect on the slowness of traffic flow. </p>

    <p>  At the moment, it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that the residential complex under construction is very convenient for future owners of apartments in it.  But a metro station is being built nearby, a highway is being created without traffic lights and with underground passages, and this allows us to hope for a future favorable existence in about two years. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  What ultimately will be the ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù.  <span>The residential complex</span> should appear by 2021 on the site of the industrial zone in the Moscow region Tekstilshchiki.  The developer plans to erect twenty monolithic-brick houses of varying number of storeys.  For owners of their own vehicles, underground parking is planned.  So that children can attend preschool and school day care centers, a school and a kindergarten will also be built.  Moreover, the latter is included primarily in construction, and the school will be built later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The first floors of buildings are traditionally reserved for non-residential premises, which will be sold or leased for the placement of various social infrastructure facilities.  These will be shops, banks, and various offices.  This is in addition to the fact that a large business center has been designed in the center of the complex.  And the territory will be decorated with walking areas. </p><p>  The development project itself is very large-scale, 19.4 hectares of land are allocated for it.  There are several phases of construction.  ‚ÄúSreda‚Äù, a residential complex, will be able to populate more than three thousand residents after the completion of construction. </p><h2>  The first phase of construction </h2><p>  The first phase of construction involves the construction of five tower houses, two mid-rise buildings and, as mentioned above, a kindergarten.  According to the <span>project declaration, the</span> deadline for the completion of houses is scheduled for the first quarter of 2018, and apartment owners must receive the keys to them in the third quarter of the same year.  One of the buildings will be 44 floors high.  Others - 25 each. They will be connected by a one-story building, allotted entirely for office premises.  Then, a building of 5‚Äì9 floors and another eight-story building will be erected. </p><p>  Some inconvenience can deliver the tower, or rather, their proximity to each other's location is only thirty meters.  The developer plans to complete the second phase of construction by the time the buyers of apartments in the houses of the first stage receive the keys to their apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  At present, the deadlines for the delivery of houses are not clearly defined even for the second phase of construction, not to mention the third and fourth.  But it is tentatively planned that they will all be completed in 2019.  So far, only a tender has been announced to select a contractor. </p><h2>  Second and subsequent phases of construction </h2><p>  Sreda, a residential complex, will secondarily provide ten more residential buildings.  Of these, there will be three towers and seven multi-sectional buildings with a height of five to nine floors.  Then, with subsequent construction, a park zone will be arranged and three residential tower buildings will be erected.  The park area includes walking alleys, bike paths, the Tennis Park club and a fitness center.  The last phase of construction ("Wednesday", a residential complex), the developer provides for the construction of office buildings.  They will separate the park area from the noise of Ryazan Avenue. </p>

    <h2>  Apartment prices </h2><p>  Various apartments are provided by the project.  Sreda, a residential complex, offers approximately 295 thousand square meters of space for apartments.  The complex offers from studios to three-room apartments, ranging in size from 24 to 96 square meters.  On the upper floors of the apartment with large balconies and panoramic windows.  All apartments are rented out by the developer, which, in turn, allows future owners to significantly save money on repairs and move into apartments that are already fully ready for life. </p><p>  As for the cost of apartments of the Sreda residential complex (new building), the price per square meter of one-room apartments starts from about 145 thousand rubles.  In this case, the most expensive will be the studio, where the cost reaches 200 thousand rubles per meter.  Thus, the average one-room apartment will cost about a little more than 5 million rubles. </p><p>  LCD "Sreda" offers two-room prices a little lower, and they start at 139 thousand rubles per square meter.  But three-room apartments are sold at the one-room level at an average cost of about 145 thousand rubles per square meter. </p><h2>  Developer and developer </h2><p>  The developer (Sreda, residential complex, Moscow) is PSN Group, which has been on the real estate market for more than 15 years.  True, the company previously specialized in the construction of exclusively business centers in cities of federal significance - Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The organization began to deal with the construction of housing relatively recently, and such large-scale projects for the construction of residential real estate for the first time.  According to the developer, this is due to the development of new horizons and new markets for activities.  In addition, the construction of residential real estate, which includes Sreda, a residential complex, has recently become much more relevant and promising than business facilities in which temporary stagnation is observed. </p><p>  Currently, the company is engaged in the construction of elite mansions "Polyanka 44".  But since the implementation of projects for the construction of residential real estate has not yet been completed, it is difficult to assess the quality of construction.  But the plans of the developer is far from the last project.  A vein has already been designed for the comfort class Home complex, the construction of which will be carried out in Maryino.  But the start of sales has not even begun yet. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Currently, there are few reviews on the Global Network, since the project has just begun its implementation.  The official site contains all the necessary information.  On it you can easily find yourself an apartment that meets exactly your wishes, view the project documentation. </p><p>  Potential buyers are not satisfied that the site does not provide information about the options for choosing a mortgage program.  To do this, you need to look in detail at other information provided on the Internet. </p><p>  <span><span><span>The Sreda residential complex (Ryazansky Prospekt) has few reviews, since there is no completed construction, no keys to the apartments have yet been issued, and there are no specific satisfied or negative residents.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, at the moment it is difficult to judge the quality of construction, decoration of apartments and other points.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  A little bit about the environmental situation and benefits </h2><p>  <span><span><span>LCD "Sreda" offers apartments in a complex that will be located almost in the center of the metropolis.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Of course, this will not add points in favor of its location and favorable environmental conditions.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But there are no large industrial enterprises poisoning the air nearby.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Also at some distance is a huge Kuskovsky forest park, whose green massif determines the air quality in the area.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>There are lakes in this forest park.</span></span></span> </p>
