Among them, there is Samsung, whose line is one of the most popular.  However, the first model of this Gear series received a lot of criticism.  And finally, a well-known manufacturer launched a new product on the market, which received a variety of innovations and additions compared to its predecessor. </p>

    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The fragility and vulnerability of the first generation of devices was a serious problem that developers faced.  Therefore, Samsung Gear 2 Neo is waterproof and not afraid of moisture.  For watches, a special <span>Tizen operating system</span> was developed <span>.</span>  Thanks to her, using the device, you can control household appliances in the house.  Interestingly, Samsung intentionally abandoned Android.  Perhaps this is only a temporary solution, since very soon a new version of this popular operating system will be released.  Also noteworthy is the camera with good quality shooting. </p><p>  With a thorough acquaintance with the purchase comes the understanding that the company has carried out effective work on the bugs.  The model is available in two trim levels.  This is the standard Samsung Gear 2 and the improved Samsung Gear 2 Neo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Externally, the novelty is very similar to the first generation of devices.  In particular, the branded metal case remained in place, although it underwent several changes in the details.  The watch has become noticeably lighter and more compact.  Weight has changed from 73 to 68 grams.  This was done for greater convenience - many complained that the first watches of this series rest on the hand and rub.  Samsung Gear 2 Neo spared this drawback. </p><p>  The changes affected primarily the design.  Uncomfortable screws were removed, and the camera got a new place - now it is on the case, and not on the strap, as before.  The back side of the device received <span>a heart rate sensor,</span> which is so popular among other smart watches.  And despite all these innovations, Samsung Gear 2 Neo is very similar to its predecessors.  This is not to be surprised, because Koreans, as a rule, first of all modernize the functionality, and then take on the appearance. </p><p>  Now the buyer has the opportunity to quickly and conveniently change the strap of his watch.  There are three colors on sale: orange, black and brown.  The strap itself is made from a special type of rubber.  It is hypoallergenic, that is, safe for human skin and pleasant to the touch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Strength </h2><p>  Water resistance was one of the main tasks that the developers of the Korean company set for themselves.  A quality and effective IP67 standard was used.  Thanks to this development, the watch can be immersed in water to a depth of about a meter for up to half an hour.  The device is protected not only from moisture, but also from dust, which is also important. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  A dual-core processor was used for the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Gear 2 Neo.  It operates at a frequency of about 1 GHz, which is significantly more than that of a first-generation device.  The operating memory of the watch is 512 megabytes.  This is enough to ensure that all processes on the screen do not slow down or cause inconvenience to the user.  Using the new operating system has improved the quality of battery life news. </p><p>  The battery lasts for six days in economy mode and for two to three days in standard mode.  This figure is much better than the first devices (they were enough for a day or two).  It should be noted that the bright and colorful screen of the novelty consumes a lot of energy, which does not allow to extend the life of the device at least up to a week without charging.  One way or another, but the <span>‚Äúsmart‚Äù watch Samsung</span> Gear 2 Neo set the right direction for the further development of the line.  And it will probably follow, judging by the successful sales of the second generation. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The screen has a diagonal of 41 mm.  It practically did not change compared to the previous variation (it remained color and touch).  With a pinch or double tap, you can interact with all the functionality of the device.  The image on the screen is conveniently scaled, which makes it easy to work with the interface.  The menu on the display is devoid of unnecessary details and as easy to learn as possible.  In order to master this watch, you do not even need to open the instruction.  Everything here is intuitive and accessible. </p><p>  By default, the Samsung Gear 2 Neo SM-R381 watch screen remains off, however, if it interferes, the settings can be easily changed.  However, with constant operation, the battery sits somewhat faster, and this also needs to be taken into account. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera used in the device can record video in HD quality.  At the same time, it has a convenient autofocus function, which allows you to get a good picture even in conditions unsuitable for shooting.  However, there are also noticeable disadvantages.  For example, there is no flash.  However, many users simply do not need it, so some will not even notice this flaw. </p><p>  In the settings, the user can edit the image resolution, caption, sound, as well as focus.  You can tag the finished video with a location tag, which is very useful on social networks.  As a comparison, we can say that shooting on this watch is no worse than on popular smartphones.  However, there are also disadvantages specific to the camera on the Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 Neo.  The review cannot but mention that only 50 pictures can be taken on the watch, after which it will be necessary to send them to a smartphone to free up space. </p>

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The watch has wide functionality.  Using the main menu, the user can turn on applications such as contact list, pedometer, camera, player, etc. In order to answer calls via the clock, you must have a smartphone with you that will be synchronized with the device.  Devices can interact if they are within 10 meters of each other. </p><p>  The watch is equipped with a speaker and microphone.  They are specially designed for Samsung Gear 2 Neo.  W3bsit3-dns.com (a site specializing in reviews in the IT field) praises the quality of communication.  Indeed, if you talk using the clock, the interlocutor will not feel the difference with a regular smartphone.  Using the interface, you can switch the connection to the main device at any time.  The watch also allows you to quickly find a lost smartphone (if it is nearby).  The device will give a signal after starting a special application. </p><p>  Also, the watch can recognize the voice of the owner.  Such sound commands allow you to control the device in a convenient mode.  However, the device did not receive a browser, so it will not work on the Internet. </p>

    <h2>  Applications </h2><p>  The infrared port and a special application in conjunction make it possible to control household appliances.  The developers tried to synchronize the device with the products of various manufacturers.  The search for technology is simple - the catalog is broken down by country and in alphabetical order. </p><p>  Users who prefer an active lifestyle did not stand aside.  They can take advantage of a special training regimen.  This program measures the pulse, makes a jogging route using GPS and gives detailed statistics after the end of the run.  She also gives recommendations to the user.  The mode supports not only simple running, but also cycling, as well as hiking.  The S Health application is available, which analyzes all statistics received by the device. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the new clock now does not work on Android, there was a problem with third-party software.  However, Samsung has prepared a basic package for the new operating system, so that users can not doubt the rich functionality of the device, which is not inferior to analogues on Android. </p>
