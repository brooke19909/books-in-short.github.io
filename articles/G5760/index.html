Citizens regularly come up with offers to borrow, while someone, on the contrary, constantly encounters a refusal for each of their appeals. </p><h2>  Forms of lending </h2><p>  Banks give loans in various ways: </p><ul><li>  issuing money that is used at the discretion of a citizen or for designated purposes; </li><li>  payment for purchases - the bank directly settles with the trading network, and the client receives the thing, then paying the debt to the bank; </li><li>  by credit card. </li></ul><p>  All methods have their advantages and disadvantages.  Market research shows that the first two methods are less expensive.  The interest rate in their case is much lower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ccuky.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card" class="if uuid-2420624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420624.jpg"></div><p>  Card issuance allows you to have constant access to bank money within the limit.  A credit card is generally more expensive, but much depends on the program offered to the person.  Financial institutions tend to offer different options based on the characteristics of clients: their social status, income, etc. </p><h2>  General Credit Card Features </h2><p>  Lending schemes are approximately the same.  Here, the role is played by both state rules and features of the Russian market.  Yes, and banks have accumulated solid experience in working with people.  What do credit card holders face? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  a limit is offered (from several thousand rubles and above); </li><li>  the limit may increase over time if you actively resort to the help of the bank; </li><li>  cash withdrawal is paid by the commission, but the use of bank transfer helps to avoid the need to pay it; </li><li>  the bank may offer a grace period during which interest on the use of the bank‚Äôs money is not charged if the debt is paid off for a certain time; </li><li>  bonuses are offered in case of purchases from partner companies. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="creditcardgenius.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit cards of banks" class="if uuid-2420625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420625.jpg"></div><p>  The cardholder has the right to take any amount in limit crayons at any time (taking into account the fulfillment of the obligation to pay the minimum monthly payments), which is considered a significant plus compared to standard cash loans. </p><h2>  Who is easier to arrange </h2><p>  Bank credit cards are offered mainly to individuals who are already customers.  This includes everyone who receives benefits, pensions, salaries through the bank.  Pensioners and employees are more attractive, because they have an official and quite substantial income.  They periodically receive offers in writing or by telephone.  Even this happens: someone put money on a deposit, and then they call him from the same bank and offer to arrange a loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who else can try </h2><p>  If a person has official income, but they do not go through bank accounts, he can try to get a credit card.  These are entrepreneurs, workers who for some reason did not apply for cards to receive money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="885thejewel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card" class="if uuid-2420632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420632.jpg"></div><p>  Previously, bank advertising noted that cards were issued without income statements, but in reality this was not quite so.  All the same, proof of income or the availability of property was required, due to which then you can return the debt. </p><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Despite a fairly standard approach, there is a significant difference in the rules for using bank money. </p><p>  Banks, within the limits established by the Central Bank, have the right to offer money for a fee called the interest rate.  It varies depending on the project, and, it must be said, significantly. </p><p>  By the way, if the contract is extended with the client, then the size of the bet without his consent does not change, so that over time the card will become more profitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card credit" class="if uuid-2420634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420634.jpg"></div><p>  The grace period is also calculated differently.  In one case, it is better to withdraw money after the beginning of the month, then the grace period is extended to the maximum, in the other, the term is tied only to the date the funds were debited from the account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The commission is established either in a fixed amount or in the form of a percentage of the withdrawn amount in cash. </p><p>  The service charge is taken either in a fixed amount or for a separately rendered service (SMS-information, provision of an account statement, checking the account balance, payment for a new card issue, etc.). </p><p>  In advertising information is given, as a rule, about the maximum size of the limit.  Initially, customers receive not 200, 300 thousand, but a small amount within their average earnings.  The only way to increase the limit is to regularly and accurately use the money provided. </p><h2>  What options does Sberbank offer </h2><p>  Directly on the bank‚Äôs website there is a section that contains information about the relevant products of the organization.  Programs change periodically.  Despite the stated difference, Sberbank credit cards have a number of common features that make it possible to highlight the conditions for their use. </p><p>  At the time of writing, several types of cards are offered: "classic", "gold" and "premium". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="get a credit card" class="if uuid-2420646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420646.jpg"></div><p>  Various bonuses are offered to potential owners.  For example, two types of cards are tied to the services of Aeroflot.  Owners are offered access to discounted or award tickets, as well as accrual of additional bonuses in the form of discounts when they are purchased. </p><p>  Holders of two other cards who bought fuel or paid in cafes and restaurants will receive 10% of the money spent in the form of bonuses. </p><p>  The Bank has set a limit for ‚Äúgold‚Äù and ‚Äúclassic‚Äù cards up to 600 thousand rubles, and for premium cards up to 3 million rubles. </p><p>  The grace period is a single period - 50 days, but it does not appear on all cards. </p><p>  The service and issue fee is taken by the bank depending on the selected card, and amounts to 4900 rubles.  in year. </p><p>  Thus, the terms of a credit card represent a significant variety. </p><h2>  Bonus Programs </h2><p>  Comparing reality with commercials, customers understand that they are not so much deceived as they are not told all the information.  For example, many believe that buying in an affiliate network gives the right to return part of the money spent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greenamerica.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card terms" class="if uuid-2420650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420650.jpg"></div><p>  However, this is not so, the cardholder has the right to buy some products at a significant discount in the future.  Therefore, you should first study the bonus program by choosing a card.  Someone constantly travels, someone regularly visits shops and shopping centers.  Then a credit card loan will be less burdensome, and savings on purchases can be up to half the price of the goods.  And if at the same time you do not stretch the return of the loan for a long time, then the acquisition can become really profitable.  It is more profitable for motorists to take credit cards with bonuses for purchases at gas stations, etc. </p><h2>  Acquisition process </h2><p>  First of all, you should contact the bank through which you receive a salary or pension or with whom you have experience of positive cooperation.  In this situation, banks are willing to cooperate. </p><p>  Standard package of documents: </p><ul><li>  passport or other identity document; </li><li>  documents confirming the existence of income or liquid property (additional real estate or a car); </li><li>  other documents as required by the credit institution. </li></ul><p>  Practice shows that there is almost no reason for persons without official income to contact the bank.  MFIs work with similar clients. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alliancebank.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="order a credit card" class="if uuid-2420653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44629/2420653.jpg"></div><p>  Now banks offer to make applications for a loan or credit card via the Internet.  You need to go to the site, fill out the form, leave your phone or email address and wait for a response from the bank. </p><p>  Directly visiting a branch of a financial organization with documents in hand occurs after the approval of the application. </p><p>  It is possible to order a credit card through special services that work with various types of credit organizations, in particular, with banks. </p><p>  The organization scheme of the portals is quite boilerplate.  It is proposed to choose the most interesting option, fill out a questionnaire and wait for an answer. </p><p>  Some organizations send cards by mail, having previously received a copy of the signed agreement from the client.  An activation code is also sent by mail. </p><p>  Tinkoff Bank operates in a similar manner.  If you do not take into account the very conflicting reviews about him, such a design system was viable and attractive for both bankers and their clients. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Despite the serious limitations of the Russian banking system, the credit card market is quite diverse.  And before contacting the bank, it is advisable to study your favorite options and reviews about the bank. </p>
