    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, Tuana Patong Holiday 3 * is located in the resort center, in the Patong Beach area.  It is surrounded by infrastructure: numerous bars and restaurants, large shopping centers and souvenir shops.  Bangla Road night entertainment street is just a 10-15 minute walk at a steady pace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is quite calm, the noise from the street does not interfere at night.  That is why so often Tuana Patong Holiday 3 * hotel is chosen by couples for their holidays.  But this resort area can hardly be called budgetary: the prices in the cafe are just cosmic, and entertainment on the beach here is far from budgetary.  All those who have already rested in Pattaya and decided to spend their holidays in Phuket should understand that the cost of rest here is 15-20% higher. </p>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  When checking into the hotel room Tuana Patong Holiday 3 * (Thailand, Phuket, Patong) all vacationers will have to leave a deposit of 2,000 baht.  You can exchange money at the nearest point located across the road.  Having a deposit is a common condition for Thailand, so the hotel administration wants to protect itself from not the most accurate guests.  That is why it is so important to check the number when checking in, especially the serviceability of equipment and plumbing.  Otherwise, the hotel may present you with an invoice for damage caused upon eviction. </p><p>  Some tourists note a confusion with the rooms: guests are provided with rooms without a balcony, overlooking the courtyard.  So, if within the framework of your tour you purchased apartments with a balcony and a view of the coast, and you were given the keys to the room without a balcony, you must immediately go down to the front desk and fix the problem within 5 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For access to the room they issue a plastic card - just one.  If you need a second card, you will have to pay 300 baht for it.  Check-out time is 12:00, but even if tourists arrive a little earlier than the specified time, if there is a free room they will be settled within 5-10 minutes.  In the worst case, you can always leave things at the reception and go to the sea. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The room fund of the Tuana Patong Holiday 3 * hotel (Phuket, Patong) is presented by apartments of various categories.  These are standard rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã22 m <sup>2</sup> , Superior with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 m <sup>2</sup> with elegant furnishings and spacious Premier with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã28 m <sup>2</sup> . </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Patong Beach is most often visited by guests of the Tuana Patong Holiday Hotel 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists note that this is the busiest and rave place of the resort and, unfortunately, far from the cleanest.  This is the most popular <span>beach in Phuket,</span> located within walking distance from all infrastructure facilities.  During the day there are quite a lot of holidaymakers, equipment rental for sports and water activities is open.  In general, during the day the beach is not much different from the others, with the exception of garbage, but in the evening and at night it becomes a platform for discos and exciting show programs. </p><p>  The beach stretches for 3 km, the entire coast is lined with sun loungers and umbrellas, the daily rental of which is in the region of 300 baht.  Due to the huge accumulation of budget hotels of categories 3 and 4 stars along this coast, there are always a lot of vacationers, and therefore quite dirty.  But Patong Beach is uniquely cleaner and more comfortable than any Pattaya beach. </p><p>  If you are looking for a calmer place for your vacation, you can go to the <span>paradise islands</span> - from the island of Phuket it is much easier to do than from the mainland.  You can stroll to Freedom beach with crystal clear sea water and white sand. </p>
