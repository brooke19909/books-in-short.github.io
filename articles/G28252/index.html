It can be made from different types of fabrics, both from the thinnest and from dense.  In this case, the length of the product must be taken into account.  Choosing the desired color of the material, you can always please yourself.  After all, it is so important to look stylish, and it is this model of the skirt that emphasizes the feminine image. </p><h2>  What accessories are needed for sewing a product? </h2><p>  In this section, we describe how to sew a half-sun skirt, while applying skill and independence.  If you know a few subtleties in technology, then tailoring such a model design will be quite simple.  What is needed for this?  The first thing that is needed is to prepare a centimeter tape, tailor's scissors, chalk, cloth, a girdle tape for the belt, 2.5 or 3 cm wide, and take accurate measurements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tivax.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.tivax.com/index.php/accessories-1/home-appliances/42-pcs-sewing-kit-fs-042.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing kit" class="if uuid-2765633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765633.jpg"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To determine the size, we need to take the first measurement.  It is removed along the waist line with a centimeter tape (this line is in the area where the belt rests on our body and it is called the waist circumference).  And the second measure is the length of the skirt, which is measured from the waistline to the required length of the product.  They are very important, as they play a major role in the construction and recognition of size.  This flared half-sun skirt is for beginners, so the sewing technology will not be difficult. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sewway.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://sewway.com/free-dress-pattern.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a half-skirt" class="if uuid-2765518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765518.jpg"></div><p>  Here we give an example according to which you can navigate by substituting your numbers on the circumference of the waist and the length of the skirt. </p><p>  On a short half-sun skirt without a fastener, where there is one seam on the back panel, completely stitched from bottom to top, a belt is sewn in the upper part, where a 3 cm wide corsage tape is worn.This skirt can be worn from below, it will pass through the hips to the waist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeit-loveit.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://makeit-loveit.com/elastic-waist-band-skirt-tutorial"><img itemprop="image" alt="corsage tape" class="if uuid-2765673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765673.jpg"></div><h2>  What to consider when cutting </h2><p>  The main thing is the calculation of a half-skirt.  It is important to calculate everything correctly.  We know that the coefficient (K) for the half-skirt is 0.65. </p><p>  Our measure of waist circumference is 79 cm (in the drawing it is indicated by the letters OT): </p><ul><li>  79 cm: 2 = 39.5 cm + (3 cm per seam) = 42.5 cm. </li></ul><p>  That is, the half-waist (ST) is 42.5 cm. </p><p>  The length of the skirt is calculated as follows: </p><ul><li>  49 cm + 0.5 (for hemming) + 0.5 (for attaching the belt with the product on top) = 50 cm </li></ul><p>  In the drawing, these points have the letter designation TH. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the necessary measurements for the pattern: </p><ul><li>  K - 0.65 cm; </li><li>  ST - 42.5 cm; </li><li>  OT = K x ST (0.65 x 42.5 = 27.62 cm); </li><li>  TH: 49 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 50 cm; </li><li>  OT belt: 79 + 21 = 100 cm; </li><li>  elastic band FROM: 79 - 5 + 2 = 76 cm; </li><li>  OT (r) - 27.62 cm; </li><li>  OH (R): 50 + 27.62 = 77.62 cm; </li><li>  fabric length - 87.62 cm .; </li><li>  material width - 155 cm; </li><li>  length of the stripping belt - 100 cm; </li><li>  belt width - 8 cm. </li></ul><h2>  How much material is needed for a short skirt </h2><p>  This skirt took fabric: </p><ul><li>  77.62 cm + 10 cm (on the belt) = 87.62 cm. </li></ul><p>  The width of the material was 155 cm. The product was sewn from a wool mixture.  The material can be selected plain or with a pattern, it is at your discretion.  And you need to determine the density of the fabric, that is, for what season the skirt will be sewn.  There are a lot of types of fabrics, but with all this assortment you need to choose what you like more. </p><h2>  How to cut a skirt </h2><p>  Before you start cutting a half-skirt with your own hands, the fabric must be ironed so that there are no creases. </p><p>  We fold the material in half, face to face, edge to edge, lay out on a flat surface, preferably on a cutting table.  When laying out the fabric, you get a right angle at the top (you can also build it on paper, that is, draw a right angle with the vertex at point O). </p><div class="photo" data-original="infourok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself half-skirt" class="if uuid-2765583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765583.jpg"></div><p>  From a right angle from point O we draw a quarter of a circle with a small radius ‚Äúr‚Äù, which is equal to the segment OT.  We draw a waist line and draw a quarter circle from a point O with a large radius R equal to the OH segment, thus constructing a bottom line. </p><p>  This can be done using a centimeter tape and tailor chalk on the fabric.  The coefficient for a half-skirt is 0.65.  The formula for calculating the segment: </p><ul><li>  OT = K x ST. </li></ul><p>  After building the drawing, you can cut out the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infourok.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://infourok.ru/prezentaciya-po-shveynomu-delu-na-temupodgotovka-tkani-k-raskroyu-raskroy-kleshevih-yubok-1024240.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern building" class="if uuid-2765593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765593.jpg"></div><h2>  How to carve a belt to the product? </h2><p>  For a short half-skirt with an elastic band with one seam, it is desirable to cut the belt along the oblique, this will allow him to sit well on the main product. </p><p>  To find out what length of the belt is needed for your skirt, you need to measure the upper section of the skirt with a centimeter tape, add 0.7 cm on each side to this length, which was obtained by measurement (this is for a one-piece belt).  If you have it striking, that is, it will consist of two parts, then in this case you need to add another 0.7 cm on each side to the number that happened when measuring. </p><p>  The length of one part of 50 cm and the second part of 50 cm has come out of this belt. In general, it‚Äôs 100 cm, since it is perfect for us and lay perfectly on the product when sweeping.  The width of the gum we used 3 cm, so it turns out: </p><ul><li>  3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8 cm (as it folds in half when stitching). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="whatdoesshedoallday.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://whatdoesshedoallday.com/circle-skirt-dress/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a half-skirt" class="if uuid-2765480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765480.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew a skirt </h2><p>  Let's continue the work: </p><ol><li>  We fold the product face-to-face so that the slices are at the same level together, and from the wrong side we sweep it from bottom to top, and then lay overlock stitching. </li><li>  We begin to grind the entire length, departing from the overlock stitch of 0.5 cm. </li><li>  Then iron the seam on one side. </li><li>  We connect the ends of the belt so that the belt is round, but leave a small hole where we will wear the elastic. </li><li>  After this, the seam seams on the belt must be ironed.  It turned out the entrance for the gum, it should be on the wrong side of the product. </li><li>  Then we slouch the belt in half.  Girdle seams should be on the sides of the skirt. </li><li>  We sweep and sharpen the belt with the product. </li><li>  After these operations, we iron the waist seam on the waist line, which goes down towards the skirt.  We insert the gum, stretching it so that it evenly disperses, then we sew the gum together several times back and forth so that it is firmly fixed and does not separate.  Stretch and give uniformity during assembly. </li><li>  We will lay the belt with the steam, trying not to crush the iron. </li><li>  We make belt fastenings along the belt in two or three places, this is necessary so that the elastic band does not turn over while wearing. </li><li>  We process the bottom of the skirt on the overlock and iron it well.  0.5 cm is going to hem the hem. The smaller the hem, the better it will lie on you. </li><li>  We lay the finishing line on the bottom of the product with special threads that are suitable in color. </li></ol><p>  The half-skirt on an elastic band is ready! </p><h2>  Work results </h2><p>  Having measured the half-sun skirt after sewing and seeing that it fits perfectly on your figure, you will certainly be satisfied with the results of the work done.  You will be pleased to wear it, because you created it yourself, with your own hands.  Maybe in the future you will want to sew something else for yourself and your close relatives.  After all, there are many more patterns by which you can create the product yourself. </p><h2>  Famous skirt model </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/-/32849666426.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to wear with half-skirts" class="if uuid-2765698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67695/2765698.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see from the photo, the half-sun skirt is a beautiful product.
