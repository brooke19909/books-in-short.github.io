Spaso-Preobrazhensky Mirozhsky Monastery</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the western part of the Russian Federation is the regional center of the <span>Pskov region, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof Pskov.  Its area is 95.5 km¬≤.  Located on the Great River.  The article tells about the city itself and its main attraction - the Mirozhsky monastery in Pskov. </p><h2>  The name of the city and its legend </h2><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spaso-Preobrazhensky Mirozhsky Monastery" class="if uuid-2579433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579433.jpg"></div><p>  Nowadays, there are two main versions of the origin of the name of the city.  According to the first, the name comes from the Pskov river (the right tributary of the Velikaya river), where the settlement was located, and the name of the river from the word ‚Äúples‚Äù, which is translated from Old Russian, is the part of the river between sharp bends. </p><p>  The second version assumes that the territory of the future city was named after the word "piskava", which is translated from Livonian (one of the Baltic languages) means "resinous water". </p><p>  There is a legend about the formation of the city, which says that Princess Olga (wife of the first Old Russian Prince Igor Rurikovich) saw an omen in 957: three sunbeams brightly illuminated the banks of the Velikaya River, and decided to build a church on this site. </p><p>  So there was a city formed around the cathedral, which later received the name "Trinity".  This legend is not confirmed by historical research, in 957 the city already existed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the city of Pskov </h2><p>  Historians have not established the exact year of foundation of Pskov.  The first mention of this settlement dates back to 903 in the Laurentian Chronicle (the manuscript is named after the monk Lawrence).  Therefore, it is customary to consider this date as the year of foundation of the city of Pskov.  Its history begins precisely from this date. </p><p>  In 1348, the medieval Pskov state was formed on the territory of Russia, which lasted 162 years.  It was the capital of Pskov. </p><p>  Since 1510, the city was part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and until the XVIII century it was one of the major cities of ancient Russia. </p><p>  The <span>Pskov fortress</span> (2.5 km¬≤), built at the time, was a defensive fort of the western borders of the state, surrounded by five belts of stone fortified walls and was considered impregnable for external enemies. </p><p>  Throughout its history, the Pskov defensive structure around which the city grew was captured only once (not counting the occupation during the fighting during the First and Second World Wars). </p><p>  This happened after the German crusaders, having ravaged Yuryev (the city founded by Yuri Dolgorukov in 1152), decided to capture Pskov.  The city was occupied for 1.5 years, after which it was liberated by Russian troops under the command of commander Alexander Nevsky. </p><p>  After the end of the Northern War (1700-1721) between Russia and its allies against Sweden, Pskov lost its defense significance, since, according to an agreement signed in the city of Nishtad (Finland), the borders of the Russian Empire moved to the west. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city became provincial in the Pskov province, and from the 19th century began its development.  Residential wooden one-story houses were replaced by stone three-story buildings. </p><p>  In connection with the development of the economy and trade with other cities of Russia in 1882, construction of the railway began.  The railway line "St. Petersburg - Warsaw" was laid through the city. </p><p>  An interesting fact: at the Pskov railway station, built in 1860, in the tsar‚Äôs car, the Russian emperor Nicholas II signed an act of abdication on March 2, 1917. </p><p>  In 1904, the first power station was built, and 8 years later, the city opened the tram.  During this period, health care, education, the construction of church buildings and cultural institutions developed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirozhsky monastery in the city of Pskov" class="if uuid-2579452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579452.jpg"></div><p>  Now Pskov, where more than 200 thousand indigenous people live, is a modern economically developed city that attracts history buffs with a large number of cultural monuments. </p><h2>  Diocese </h2><p>  The Pskov diocese was created in 1598, in gratitude for the defense of the western borders of Russia from the Polish troops <span>Stefan Batory.</span>  Until 1917, she carried out the construction of churches, monasteries, seminaries, and many other church institutions on the territory of the Pskov province. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After the revolutionary events, the diocese was suspended.  But it began to revive since 1945.  Now, under the leadership of the diocese of the <span>Pskov region</span> , new religious institutions are being built and old churches and temples are being restored. </p><p>  The diocese organizes church cultural and educational events and supports the development of Orthodox art.  In Pskov, tourists can get acquainted with the life of members of religious communities and visit the <span>monastery cloisters:</span> Pskovo-Pechersky Monastery, Snetogorsky Monastery, Krypetsk Monastery.  The Mirozh Monastery is very popular among travel lovers. </p><h2>  History of the Mirozhsky Monastery in Pskov </h2><p>  On the banks of the left tributary of the Velikaya River, which is the Mirozhka River, in the XII century a complex of buildings of the monastery was erected.  The monastery is located near the Pskov Kremlin.  At one time, he played the role of the cultural center of Pskov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mirozhsky-monastery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery complex" class="if uuid-2579432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579432.jpg"></div><p>  In those days, the monastery territory was located beyond the fortifications of Pskov.  Therefore, it was a convenient target for an external enemy.  In 1299, the Knights of the Teutonic Order, having ravaged the commercial and industrial part of the city (this territory was located outside the fortress walls), burned the Transfiguration of the Savior Monastery of Mirozh.  The latter was subsequently restored. </p><p>  After the revolutionary events of 1917, the monastery was closed.  And on its territory the city organization "Pskov Excursion Station" was located. </p><p>  In 1994, the main buildings of the monastery complex were transferred to the local diocese.  After this, the revival of the male Mirozhsky monastery began. </p><h2>  Monastery buildings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.windoftravel.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Pskov?" class="if uuid-2579434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579434.jpg"></div><p>  What to see in Pskov for city guests?  Tourists can visit the monastery territory, get acquainted with the sights, including the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the Savior, the church building of the Apostle Stephen, the winter quarters of the abbot and the building of fraternal buildings. </p><p>  Currently, the temple, erected in the XII century, houses exhibits related to the history of the monastery. What should tourists see in Pskov?  The local population will say that they can get acquainted with the mural (frescoes) of unknown masters of that period. </p><p>  The uniqueness of this type of temple art lies in the fact that they are preserved to our time.  The central part of the painting is occupied by a fresco (Deesis), which depicts Jesus Christ sitting on the throne, Our Lady, John the Baptist. </p><p>  The frescoes survived due to the fact that in the XVII century they were covered with whitewash, during the next restoration.  After 200 years, the restorer Vladimir Suslov, they were restored.  In order to preserve wall painting, the museum works only in dry weather, as the content of the frescoes requires a constant temperature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirozhsky monastery in Pskov" class="if uuid-2579454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579454.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the First Martyr Apostle St. Stephen </h2><p>  History buffs can attend the service of the current church of the First Martyr Apostle St. Stephen, who, according to the Bible, was one of the disciples of Jesus Christ. </p><p>  In the church, built in the XVII century, there is an iconostasis made by a modern icon painter under the direction of Archimandrite Zinon.  Tourists can also see the ancient icons and relics of the clergy, ranked by the Orthodox Church as Saints. </p><h2>  Art workshop </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the city of Pskov" class="if uuid-2579451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579451.jpg"></div><p>  In the Cathedral of Apostle Stefan there is an art workshop where future icon painters are trained.  In 1789, a two-story building was built - the fraternal building and attached to the church of the First Martyr Stephen. </p><p>  The building was built on the foundation of the ancient living quarters of the monks.  Initially, the first floor was a monastic cell, but after the flood they were unsuitable for housing.  Subsequently, the first floor was converted into a kitchen and refectory, and monastic cells were placed on the second floor. </p><p>  The main entrance to the monastery territory is the Holy Gates, over which the bell tower was added in 1885 and now, as in past times, it announces with its ringing the beginning of the service in the church of St. Stephen the Apostle. </p><p>  In the western part of the Mirozhsky monastery in Pskov, the former igumen corps is located.  It was built in 1881 as the winter quarters of the archimandrite.  Now in this building is the icon-painting center of the Pskov diocese.  The territory of the monastery is fenced with a stone wall.  It has remained unchanged since its construction at the beginning of the XIX century. </p><h2>  Icon of the Mother of God </h2><p>  In the Christian religion they worship not only Saints, but also icons.  The main Holy relic of the local monastery is the icon of the Mother of God of Mirozh. </p><p>  In Pskov, she appeared in 1198.  This Christian phenomenon occurred on the Mirozhka River, on which a monastery was already located. </p><p>  In 1596, during a massive infectious disease in the region, Pskov people came to the monastery.  They prayed before the image of the Mother of God and received healing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Icon of the Mother of God of Mirozh" class="if uuid-2579430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2579430.jpg"></div><p>  In connection with these healing properties of the icon, a service was written for the temples of Pskov and the date of celebration (October 7) was set.  In 1922 the monastery was closed.  Then the icon was transferred to the historical museum. </p><p>  After the restoration of monastic life in the monastery, the shrine returned to its former place.  Tourists can explore it by visiting the church of St. Stephen. </p><h2>  How to get to the monastery? </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.8068853" data-lng="28.328562799999986" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/3/3/4933.png"></div><p>  Mirozhsky Monastery in Pskov is a 20-minute walk on foot from the Pskov Kremlin.  From the railway station to the temple (2 km) can be reached using bus routes No. 2, 2A, 5 or minibus No. 2T to the stop "Dam". </p>
