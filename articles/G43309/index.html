    <h2>  Beach, sea </h2><p>  Rafailovici beach (Montenegro) - Becici - has been considered one of the best in all of Europe for several decades.  For the first time, Becici was awarded this honor back in 1935.  Since then, the popularity of the beach has only grown, because the fine sand, the clear azure water of the Adriatic, a picturesque view of the mountains and the presence of all the necessary infrastructure do not leave anyone indifferent.  In addition, it is not as crowded here as on the <span>beaches of Budva,</span> where at the height of the season literally "there is nowhere to fall an apple." </p><p>  As throughout Montenegro, the beaches in Rafailovici are municipal.  Thus, there is no need to pay for entry.  You will have to give money only for renting a sunbed and an umbrella.  However, you can comfortably and completely free sit on a sand that is not occupied by sun loungers, spreading a towel brought with you. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and hotel base </h2><p>  Hotels Rafailovici (Montenegro) are represented by two-, three- and four-star hotels.  Here you can always find housing in accordance with your tastes and financial capabilities.  The cost of living per night in Rafailovici starts from 20 euros and can reach up to several hundred euros.  It is worth noting that a characteristic feature of Montenegro is the lack of hotels with their own beaches (with rare exceptions).  Indeed, almost all the beaches in this country are in municipal ownership.  In this regard, the vast majority of hotels are located on the second and third coastlines. </p>
