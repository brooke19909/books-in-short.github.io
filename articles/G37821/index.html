The ways to create it are simple, easy to learn. </p><h2>  <span>How to weave an owl</span> on the machine? </h2><p>  Required material: machine tool, hook, elastic bands (38 blue, 8 blue, 4 orange, 4 black). </p><p>  Place the machine with the open side of the column toward you so that the center row is farther than the side rows.  To begin to throw gum from above, gradually going down.  Before weaving an owl with your own hands, remember that two gum is almost always used. </p>

    <p>  So, weaving begins with the formation of the head.  Take 2 blue elastic bands and pull them from the first left column to the second middle row.  Repeat these steps in the second row.  Now take 2 elastic bands, put them on a pair of initial posts at the edges, and in the middle row - from the second to the third. </p><p>  To make owl eyes, throw 2 rubber bands from the second to the third column both on the left and on the right.  Take 2 orange elastic bands and put on the third and fourth column in the middle. </p><p>  We continue to shape the head of the owlet.  Throw 2 more elastic bands in each row.  To learn how to give the head a rounded shape and combine all the rows in the process of weaving an owl from gum on the machine, pull a pair of gum diagonally to the center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Body weaving </h2><p>  Throw one elastic band obliquely from the last used column in the middle to the fifth column on both sides. </p><p>  For the formation of the abdomen string 4 pairs of blue elastic bands in the middle row of the machine.  To create wings, you need to pull 3 pairs of elastic bands in the left and right rows. </p><p>  Wrap 1 orange elastic band around the hook three times.  Then take 2 blue elastic bands and put on them a triple loop from a hook.  With this design, obliquely connect the middle and side rows.  Repeat the foot on the other side. </p><p>  Now you can proceed to the main point in how to weave an owl.  On the middle column, pull and pry off the thrice-wound elastic, remove the 2 blue ones and throw them on the last column on the left, and the second pair on the right. </p>

    <p>  In the same way we throw forward the blue gum.  Grab the bottom elastic bands in all rows and throw forward to the base of the body. </p><p>  Now the most difficult moment in the whole process of weaving an owl from gum, since there are a lot of gum on the central column, so it is very important to get the right pair.  Hook the upper gum hooks, take out a pair of blue ones and place them on the corresponding peg.  Do this with all three pairs of elastic bands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the exact same way, continue to weave further.  From the last middle column, remove 2 irises and transfer them to the last left column, then transfer the last 2 pairs to the last right. </p><p>  For convenience, make a loop.  Pull the blue gum through the eyelet and fix it by making a knot.  The weaving process is over, remove the finished figure of an owl from the machine. </p><h2>  How to weave an owl on a slingshot? </h2><p>  Before you start <span>weaving an owl from gum</span> on a slingshot, prepare the material - slingshot, hook, elastic (44 pink, 8 white, 4 yellow, 2 black). </p><p>  This part will be formed with 3 chains.  Three times wrap a pink elastic band around the right pin of the slingshot - it will hold all the rows of the future body together.  Transfer the rubber from three turns to the middle. </p><p>  Move all parts of the weave to the left. </p>

    <h2>  How to weave an owl on a hook? </h2><p>  The owl figurine will consist of nine chains of seven loops connected from above and from below.  This is very easy to do, since only a hook is used in weaving an owl from gum. </p><p>  Take the elastic band of the primary color (purple) and circle three times around the hook.  Then use it to pull 2 ‚Äã‚Äãpieces through the triple loop.  In this way weave 7 pairs of purple gum. </p><p>  Transfer this chain to an additional free hook.  Weave another same detail of an owl using elastic bands of the same color.  Again, release the working tool. </p><p>  The next chain will consist of a part of the abdomen of an owl and an eye.  Take 1 purple gum and wind it three times on the hook.  Now, in a way known already, weave 3 pairs of pink elastic bands.  Then weave a pair of purple. </p><p>  To weave an owl‚Äôs eye, take 3 white elastic bands, put it on a hook, but do not pull it into the loop.  Hold the free edge of the rubber bands with your finger.  On the hook, scroll four times 1 black rubber band.  After that, you can throw white gum. </p><p>  Weave 2 pairs of purple elastic bands.  Transfer the finished part to the second hook.  Throw and scroll on the hook three times 1 purple rubber band.  Weave 2 pairs of pink elastic bands and 1 purple. </p><p>  To make an owl's beak, take 2 orange elastic bands and weave them.  Throw another 3 pairs of purple elastic bands onto the hook.  And again transfer the chain to the additional hook.  Weave a chain of seven loops, in the weaving of which there is a part of the belly and eyes of an owl.  Release the work hook.  Sew another 4 identical chains of 7 loops, use the color purple. </p><p>  To connect all the details of the owlet, take 2 purple elastic bands and hook them.  Then move the finished chains to them.  After that, throw the other end of the elastic bands onto the hook and tighten into the loop, stretching one pair of elastic bands through the other. </p><p>  Connect the bottom of the owl.  Insert the hook into all the loops of the rubber bands with a triple revolution.  Throw 1 purple elastic on the hook and slide all the weaving from the hook onto it.  Then fix it with a knot again. </p><p>  To make owl ears, hook the hook into the first upper pair of elastic bands, in the chain where the eye is.  Then start under the whole loop in the next row, but for the second pair.  Put on the hook 3 pink elastic bands, stretch under the loops and tighten into a knot.  Cut the long ends with scissors.  Make the same eye on the other side. </p><h2>  Wings </h2><p>  Bring the hook into the fourth pair of loops of two adjacent chains from the eyes.  Throw a pair of pink rubber bands, then another, and tighten into a knot.  Cut the ends of the loops. </p><p>  Repeat the wing from the opposite side. </p><p>  To finish and fully master <span>how to weave an owl from gum,</span> or rather, its legs, use 2 orange gum.  Get a hook under the first pair of pink elastic bands and the first pair of purple elastic bands in the adjacent chain.  Throw 3 elastic bands on the hook, then make 1 knot in orange.  Tighten the long loops inwards. </p><p>  Repeat the foot on the other side. </p><p>  Make a ponytail on the two remaining back chains.  Bring the hook into the third loops under one pair of elastic bands.  Throw in 2 pink elastic bands, then a couple more and tighten the knot again. </p><p>  Using this weaving method, you will know how to weave a 3D owl out of elastic bands. </p><p>  Creating these cute figures is a very exciting and creative process.  Owls made of elastic bands can be used as key rings or jewelry on a backpack.  Owl will be a wonderful gift for friends. </p>
