The reason for this is the amazing beaches, the beauty of the area, unique attractions, and a well-developed tourist service.  All these advantages of the resort can be enjoyed while relaxing in the Armas Resort Hotel 5 *.  Reviews about him, however, are not all harmonious.  But as they say, the taste and color ... This hotel can be called a place of relaxation for an amateur.  If the main focus of the trip to Turkey is on beach vacations and sea views from the window, then here you are unlikely to like it.  But if the main priorities are given to a clean environment and relative peace, if you want to stretch a bit before lying down on the beach, if traveling on local minibuses is not considered a problem, then the Armas Resort Hotel 5 * (Kemer) is ideal.  To make sure of this, let's take a little virtual walk around the hotel.  Then everything will become clear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Armas Resort Hotel 5 Kemer reviews" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1004318.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Turkish Riviera - Kemer - is located about 40 km south of the Antalya border.  The city itself is stretched along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, because it was on the shore that houses were built and new areas formed, which later became part of the resort.  Kemer has nowhere to expand particularly deeply, since the Taurus Mountains adjoin almost close to it.  These geographical features determined the location of Armas Resort Hotel 5 *.  The reviews of those who love the beauty of nature about the location of the hotel are excellent.  Far from the center and the bustle of the city, surrounded by orange and <span>pomegranate gardens,</span> it gives its guests perfectly clean air and beautiful views of the mountains.  It is especially wonderful here in the spring, when trees bloom and the air intoxicates with magical aromas.  Near the hotel there is a road along which it is very good to walk, admiring the surrounding beauty.  The mountains and gardens from the hotel are within easy reach, that is, about 7 minutes walk. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the main objects? </h2><p>  The location of the hotel is such that it is convenient for vacationers to walk on nature, while shopping and entertainment facilities are accessible by transport.  To the center of Kemer, from here about 15 minutes by dolmush or 30 minutes on foot.  The road and the stop are almost nearby.  Located on the outskirts of the city, but from the side of Antalya, the institution is convenient for those who are going to make excursions and trips in that direction.  However, the Armas <span>Resort, a 5 * hotel</span> (Kemer), is not very close to the sea.  Reviews of beach lovers must indicate this circumstance.  To get to the beach, you must either use the hotel‚Äôs free shuttle service, or walk for 10 minutes along the street and the territory of the neighboring Armas Beach or Lems Bona Beach hotels.  If you need to travel to Antalya on your own, you can get by bus number 178 very cheaply, which goes from the center of Kemer past the hotel. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Sandwiched between two roads and infrastructure of neighboring hotels, only 7 thousand square meters.  meters occupies "Armas <span>Resort",</span> 5 * <span>hotel</span> (Kemer).  Reviews about the territory are about the same.  According to vacationers, it is small, very compact, but neat and well-groomed.  There is almost no greenery, except perhaps a few palm trees, one lawn and several border flower beds with callas, cannes and some other flowers.  Almost the entire area is occupied by an outdoor swimming pool for adults and a sunbathing area around it.  Nearby is a small children's pool, bar.  On the other side of the hotel is a parking place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Armas Resort Hotel 5 Kemer" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1004319.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Armas Resort has a pretty good infrastructure.  Reviews of tourists on this subject are mostly unanimous.  Reception, as it should be in institutions of this category, works here around the clock.  The staff in Russian does not understand well, speaks even worse.  It is better to solve issues, if any, with a representative of the travel agency from whom the tour was purchased.  There is no left-luggage office at the reception, so not all tourists agree to leave their belongings unattended until the moment they are provided.  Check-in starts at 14.00, but they put on the bracelets immediately, and you are immediately allowed to use the services of the hotel, swimming pool, restaurant, bar.  At the reception you can buy a sightseeing tour, call a taxi, a doctor, order a baby nanny, exchange currency, hand over things for washing or ironing, rent a car. </p><p>  Hotel Armas Resort <span>Hotel 5 * (Kemer)</span> has a well-equipped conference room, equipped with the necessary equipment.  In the spacious and bright lobby there are several shops, a lobby bar, comfortable armchairs, tables, a restaurant with large panoramic windows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Armas Resort Hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1004320.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the hotel building </h2><p>  Very good accommodation options offers its guests Armas Resort.  Reviews about the rooms differ slightly.  The hotel took its first guests in 2006, and the last repairs were made here in 2014.  Therefore, there are no complaints about the equipment of rooms and the work of equipment with plumbing.  But when you check in, you need to consider the architectural features of the hotel building.  There is only one building on four floors.  The first rooms are small in size and without balconies or terraces.  At the last are attic type rooms.  From the upper floors, the views are either from the mountains and orchards (these rooms are calmer), or from the hotel and the pool (such rooms are almost noisy all day and evening).  The sea is visible in the distance, and then only from some of the rooms on the upper floors.  The elevator works, there is no problem.  If you do not want to wait for the elevator, you can go up the stairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Armas Resort 5 Hotel Turkey Kemer" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1004321.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  What kind of food does Armas <span>Resort</span> offer <span>(5 * hotel)?</span>  Reviews in this regard diverge greatly.  All who rested here in the summer, report on food that does not correspond to the category of 5 stars.  But those who rested at the hotel in the fall praise the food, noting a wide variety of dishes on the menu, excellent taste, excellent work of the staff.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Most tourists go to Turkey for its beautiful coast, clean and gentle sea.  In relation to the beach, Armas Resort, a 5 * hotel (Kemer), is rather controversial.  Reviews of how much to the beach and how to get there vary depending on what the person is used to.  For some tourists it is not a problem to walk for 10 minutes on foot, for others this is a significant minus.  A shuttle runs from the hotel to the beach, but not always everyone has enough space in it, and he goes once every half an hour.  The beach itself at the hotel is very good, clean, spacious.  Coating - small pebbles that do not require special shoes.  Sunset at sea is very convenient, the water is unusually clean and warm.  There are no beautiful marine animals in the area.  Sunbeds on the beach in sufficient quantities.  If suddenly they are not enough, soft mattresses are provided free of charge.  Under the awnings from the sun there is enough space for everyone.  There is a hotel bar on the beach where snacks are organized and soft drinks and low alcohol drinks are served. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  ‚ÄúArmas Resort 5 *‚Äù (hotel, Turkey, Kemer) for leisure of its guests has one large outdoor pool with one water slide.  Sun beds in the recreation area around the pool are always available, there are not enough sun umbrellas at all.  There is another fairly decent sized indoor pool in the building.  The hotel also has a sauna, Turkish bath, massage room, where several types of this procedure are offered, there is a gym with exercise machines.  Sports enthusiasts can spend time at billiard or tennis tables, play darts, volleyball, backgammon.  Day and evening, guests are entertained by a team of animators.  In their program - water aerobics, exercises, sports games in the pool, fun shows, parties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Armas Resort Hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1004324.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel for children </h2><p>  For children, the Armas Resort Hotel 5 * (Kemer) offers a small children's pool with a depth of up to 50 cm, a kids' club, where tutors are involved with the kids, cots in the room (on request), a playground.  It does not have many attractions, but it is.  There are no special children's dishes on the menu of the hotel restaurant, but there are dairy products (milk, yoghurts), fruits and vegetables.  For children under 6 years of age, payment is not made, regardless of whether they occupy a separate sleeping place or not. </p><h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel </h2><p>  A huge selection of entertainment pleases its guests Kemer.  Hotel "Armas Resort" (5 stars) offers a wide selection of sightseeing tours, but, according to vacationers, outside the establishment they all cost 2 times cheaper.  In Kemer itself, this is Yoruk park, seaport, famous chapel, dolphinarium, water park, nightclubs "Crystal", "Inferno", "Aqua".  Recall that from the hotel to Kemer - 10 minutes on dolmush or 30 minutes on foot.  Just 8 km away is another famous Turkish resort - the village of Goynuk, where a unique canyon is of great interest.  It is also convenient for guests of the Armas Resort Hotel to make excursions to the ancient cities (more precisely, to their ruins) Phaselis and Olympos, to Mount Chimera, to the village of Cirali, famous for its colorful beaches, and to many other amazing places. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Very ambiguous regarding the provided rest Armas Resort Hotel 5 * (Kemer).  The rating of this hotel "dances" from 3.5 out of 5 possible to 4.2, depending on which tour operators count it.  Ratings of rooms and service during the season are exhibited by tourists about the same.  Evaluations of the work of the staff and, as a result, the cleanliness of the rooms, the catering and the quality of the dishes, the animation very much depend on the professionalism of the staff.  When responsible and conscientious people work at the hotel, there are no complaints about the service and food. </p><p>  Location estimates vary greatly.  Since they are exhibited by people, each of whom has his own concept of what means far, and his own priorities for the environment.  Those looking for a hotel with bars and discos nearby are clearly not here.  Also, the hotel "Armas Resort" is not suitable for people who want to relax on the first coastline.  This establishment is located from the sea about 700-800 meters. </p><p>  One of the important advantages is the reasonable price for tours to this hotel.  In the low season, you can relax here for only 25 thousand rubles for 8 nights with air tickets from Moscow back and forth. </p><p>  The institution operates from April to October inclusive. </p><h2>  Armas Resort Hotel 5 * (Kemer).  Reviews </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that people have different opinions about the hotel.  There are those who recommend it to everyone, but there are also many who believe that there are significant shortcomings in Armas Resort. </p><p>  Noted advantages: </p><p>  - nice rooms, spacious, functional; </p><p>  - low prices for tours to the hotel; </p><p>  - hotel staff always meets, quickly responds to requests and wishes; </p><p>  - location near gardens and mountains; </p><p>  - a wonderful beach; </p><p>  - delicious, plentiful and varied food; </p><p>  - funny animators. </p><p>  Marked Cons: </p><p>  - not 200 meters to the sea, as indicated in the advertisement, but all 700; </p><p>  - expensive Wi-Fi ($ 5 per day); </p><p>  - there is no good cleaning in the rooms; </p><p>  - tasteless monotonous food; </p><p>  - non-initiative animators; </p><p>  - little entertainment for children on site. </p>
