    <h2>  Positive feedback and thanks </h2><p>  Many tourists prefer the quiet hotel Madame Cuc Saigon Emerald Resort 4 * for a quiet and relaxing holiday.  Reviews about it demonstrate the high quality of services, as well as many vivid impressions of the rest: </p><ul><li>  breakfast includes a variety of European and local dishes, and fresh exotic fruits are served daily; </li><li>  due to the secluded and remote location of the hotel, it is completely fenced from the noise of the road and city bustle; </li><li>  the territory of the resort complex, although small, but very picturesque, with lots of vegetation and exotic flowers; </li><li>  the hotel has a very nice clean pool, which has a children's section (and since the weather in Vietnam is windy and the sea is restless, it is very important that there is a place where you can swim); </li><li>  the guest rooms are very bright and spacious, and they are cleaned every day (even though there is no tip, the room will always be clean). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative feedback and comments </h2><p>  Despite the fact that in general the reviews on this hotel are quite positive and approving, there were some negative points and negative comments: </p><ul><li>  in the hotel restaurant the prices are several times higher than in similar institutions in the city center (apparently, the hotel owners are using the fact that getting to other cafes is long and inconvenient); </li><li>  on the beach, as well as by the pool there are not enough sun loungers, because not everyone has enough places (the problem is especially acute in the morning); </li><li>  a lot of insects live in the hotel (both in the rooms and on the territory), which sting painfully (then irritation forms at the site of the bites); </li><li>  When paying in a restaurant, always check the bill, as guests are often cheated; </li><li>  the staff does not speak Russian. </li></ul><p>  This hotel is just perfect for those who are looking for tranquility and privacy.  It is worth noting the pleasant atmosphere of the institution, as well as the high level of service.  Of course, it was not without minor flaws. </p>
