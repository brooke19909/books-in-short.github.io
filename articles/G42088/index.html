We are talking about the little-known brand ARK.  But will a company be able to attract customers and withstand competition? </p><h2>  Appearance of devices </h2><p>  Releasing ARK smartphones, the manufacturer took the path of least resistance and simply copied the design.  This is especially noticeable in the cheapest Benefit H956.  The device is very similar in appearance to Nokia. </p><p>  In Chinese firms, such solutions are found everywhere.  Unfortunately, many manufacturers simply thoughtlessly ‚Äúlick‚Äù other people's devices.  Sometimes the design does not even make changes. </p>

    <p>  In general, ARK do not think too much about their smartphones.  The familiar appearance, the plastic case and the absence of "chips" make the company's devices not particularly attractive in appearance. </p><p>  Of course, there were some exceptions.  There are stylish, solid and simply elegant devices.  One of them was Desire I2, which received a nice appearance.  But even this handsome man looks like market leaders. </p><p>  Justifies the mediocre appearance only the cost of devices.  Apparently, the manufacturer decided to attract not by design, but by attractive price.  The decision was fully justified, since appearance is not the main characteristic of state employees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Smartphones ARK faced a similar problem for many representatives of the Celestial Empire.  The desire to minimize the cost significantly affected the displays of the company. </p><p>  The first problem was the resolution in most devices.  Setting a good diagonal, this characteristic, apparently, was completely forgotten.  Almost all models received a resolution that does not correspond to the diagonal of the screen. </p>

    <p>  For example, Benefit M6 with a display size of 5.5 inches received only 960 x 540 pixels.  Thus, small cubes and granularity are very noticeable to the user.  This is not to say that the situation is critical, but definitely unpleasant. </p><p>  When choosing the company's devices, you should pay attention to the matrix.  Among a small number of models, devices with old TFT technology are hiding.  Such a matrix significantly reduces the viewing angle.  In addition, the brightness of the screen is greatly reduced in the sun. </p><p>  There are also quite successfully implemented smartphones ARK.  One of these was the S502 Plus, which has an IPS matrix and an acceptable resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  ARK smartphones have got another problem side.  Like many state employees, there is a weak camera.  Only two megapixels were installed in cheap devices.  It is these matrices that the M1 and K12 models received. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Middle-class phones have got more decent "eyes."  The same I3 costs 13 megapixels.  Although hoping for a quality similar to Samsung cameras is not worth it.  The company still has room to grow. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Any review of the ARK smartphone will allow us to conclude that it has a low battery life.  Unfortunately, this problem is not only ARK, but also many other companies.  However, the problem is especially acute in these products. </p><p>  Inexpensive and low-power devices, you can still forgive the 1500 mAh battery, but mid-range devices equipped with a 2400 mAh battery cause genuine bewilderment. </p><p>  Even one of the most advanced I3 devices has become a prime example.  It has a 2400 mAh battery and lasts 3-5 hours, depending on the load. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  A pleasant moment was the cost of ARK products.  The price ranges from 2 to 12 thousand rubles.  Quite an acceptable cost for good budget employees. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Not the best impressions are left behind by ARK smartphones.  Owner reviews find many shortcomings not only in the devices themselves, but also in the firmware. </p><p>  The main problem was the housing.  The plastic phones are not of high quality and also very easily soiled. </p><p>  Autonomy also did not appeal to many users.  <span>Replacing the battery will</span> fix the situation, but this is an additional cost. </p><p>  Positive qualities were the price and good performance.  It was they who attracted most of the buyers. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  ARK devices leave behind a double feeling.  It seems functional and inexpensive, phones have a bunch of disadvantages.  Many characteristics are lame and spoil the impression.  Although the advantage was that the company is constantly evolving, and may soon surprise with better products. </p>
