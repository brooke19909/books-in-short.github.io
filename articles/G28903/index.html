Guests regularly praise a surprisingly beautiful place with magnificent nature, a quick solution on the spot of all the questions that arise during the holidays, delicious and plentiful food. </p><p>  For many, Seliger is becoming the place they regularly want to return to. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, visitors to the holiday home most often note unreasonably high prices.  For many, the lack of a store within walking distance, as well as dead roads, becomes a drawback.  In addition, getting here is not so easy, because in bad weather you can stumble on such tracks on which you can easily leave the suspension. </p><p>  Also a disadvantage is not very comfortable bathrooms.  Some people are confused by the strange arrangement of cottages in which many guests stay.  On the ground floor there is a fireplace room, where they set the table, while there are absolutely no windows in the room. </p><p>  Lake Seliger amazes everyone with its beauty, at the same time it terrifies the state of the coast.  He is covered in cigarette butts and rubbish, a nearby rubbish bin filled.  In the heat, a very unpleasant smell appears, which discourages all the desire to return here again and again. </p>
