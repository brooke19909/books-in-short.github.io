To emphasize the dynamics of the strips, you need to choose fabrics that are similar in color.  You can use the material in a small flower or in a box.  Such sewing from satin ribbons will look beautiful if you alternate the front side with the wrong side. </p><p>  For work, a square of the required size is cut out, and then divided into three sections, each of which is cut into five parallel strips.  Fabric details are cut out according to the pattern.  Strips for each section are sewn separately, they are necessarily ironed.  The individual parts are joined together clockwise, starting from the top piece.  From the finished squares, you can sew a pillowcase on a pillow, a wrap on a chair or sofa. </p><h2>  Checkerboard pattern </h2><p>  To complete this pattern, you need a fabric of two <span>contrasting colors.</span>  You can cut small squares and sew them together, but there is a easier way.

Then they are sewn together, alternating in color.  Then the canvas needs to be cut across, not forgetting to leave allowances for seams.  Having laid out the strips in such a way as to make a chess pattern, the master must grind them with a transverse seam.

    <h2>  "Grandma's honeycombs" </h2><p>  This pattern is so called because it is assembled from hexagons.  The assembly scheme is simple: cardboard templates are made according to the number of parts.  Cardboard should be of medium thickness and not too hard.  Then the pattern is placed on the wrong side of the fabric and cut out, leaving allowances for the seams.  They are bent and pulled along the edge with a thread so that the fabric fits tightly around the template.  When all the hexagons are ready, they are folded face down, to each other, and sew together manually with a hidden stitch.  After the cardboard is removed, the seams are ironed, and the finished fabric is sewn with a lining.  The work is painstaking and manual, but the canvas is very beautiful, they are decorated with pillows, napkins and tablecloths. </p><h2>  Crazy Technique </h2><p>  This technique has another name - "crazy shreds."  This is due to the fact that the patchwork pattern of this type, as a rule, is absent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork technique and patterns" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/848496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A triangle or trapezoid is sewn into the square in the center, and then various stripes and shapes of arbitrary shape are tuned around.  Non-standard applications can also be used.  To decorate and mask the seams, you can use lace, beads and buttons.  Such a patchwork sewing is beautiful and easy, even a novice needlewoman can do. </p><h2>  Knitted Patchwork </h2><p>  Naturally, every lover of knitting has many unnecessary balls.  You can make many squares from them and put them together, making a blanket or plaid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork patterns photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36079/847105.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Unlike previous techniques, the squares are not stitched, but crocheted together.  Most often, this type of patchwork is used in the manufacture of plaids, bags and even slippers.  Such a patchwork pattern can be mixed, where both fabric and knitting are used.  To do this, the threads take a similar color with the fabric and tie them with pieces of cloth. </p>
