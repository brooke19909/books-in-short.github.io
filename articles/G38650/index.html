    <p>  Flexible sensitivity adjustment and the data system for RDS radios improve the quality of the search for radio stations, allowing the user to independently determine which sound they like best.  4-digit sensitivity adjustment.  On the one hand, the convenience of tuning is obvious, but there is also the flip side of the coin - the search for channels is time-consuming. </p><h2>  Tuner tuning recommendations </h2><p>  The instruction <span>"Pioneer 88"</span> recommends that all owners of the device use the automatic search for <span>radio stations.</span>  Walking through the range specified by the user, the tuner will find all the channels that have a powerful signal.  Radio stations with a weak signal will have to be searched manually.  Many professionals claim that the quality of the radio signal is directly proportional to the antenna power for the radio, and recommend installing a pin design to improve reception quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To configure the tuner, by repeatedly pressing the "Source" key, select "Tuner" from the proposed list of signal sources.  Press the ‚ÄúBand‚Äù button to select the desired frequency range (FM).  By moving the ‚ÄúMulti-Control‚Äù knob to the left or right and holding it in this position for several seconds, the user will launch an automatic radio frequency scanner.  For manual search, the regulator in the final position does not need to be held.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that this procedure will require multiple presses of the regulator from the owner. </p>

    <h2>  Additional tuner functionality </h2><p>  Broadcast data transmission system (RDS) is present in the territory of any state, but not every owner uses its functionality.  Information is transmitted differently in each country.  One is enough data on signal quality and the name of the radio station.  Others are provided with information about reports on the road, weather conditions and other necessary information on the road. </p><p>  Setting ("Pioneer 88", as it is already clear, a multifunctional device) for the RDS broadcasting system is carried out by pressing the "Multi-Control" knob.  The button must be pressed until the user sees the inscription ‚ÄúFunction‚Äù.  The next step in the setup will be to turn the knob clockwise and search for the desired functionality (for details, see the operating instructions).  Confirmation of a choice is always carried out by pressing a button, and a search is made by rotating or shifting it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Saving the drowning - the work of the drowning </h2><p>  A few words about how the first connection is made.  "Pioneer 88" - radio, which after connecting all the wires will require, by and large, only the implementation of sound settings.  However, professional drivers recommend that beginners take care of their own safety on the road and turn on the PTY alarm interception system on the radio.  Abroad, such a setting saves millions of lives every year, and only on domestic roads everyone hopes for luck. </p>

    <p>  To display the PTY signal in the radio, the Traffic ANNOUNCE reception system must be turned on.  If there is a danger on the road or in case of large-scale emergency situations, ‚ÄúALARM‚Äù is displayed on the radio screen, and the receiver automatically starts broadcasting the message.  Not all radio stations are capable of transmitting a PTY code, therefore it is better to entrust the fine-tuning of this functionality to professionals in the service center of a car workshop. </p><h2>  The cradle of quality sound </h2><p>  <span>The digital audio converter,</span> popularly referred to as the "processor" or "DAC" in the Pioneer 88 radio is the main component that is responsible for sound quality.  The Japanese decided to entrust the work of their device to the well-known microelectronics brand, Burr-Brown.  It is the new generation technology called Advanced Segment DAC that provides the car radio with unsurpassed sound quality. </p><p>  However, the manufacturer used the CD-receiver of its own production, which caused a stir in foreign markets during the presentation.  Everyone knows that the Japanese brand Pioneer seeks to support only licensed audio data formats.  The model of the radio tape recorder participating in the review is completely devoid of restrictions: CD-Audio, MP3, WMA, WAV, AAC - all popular standards, including support for ID3 tags, are supported on the hardware level by a multimedia device. </p><h2>  CD Management </h2><p>  As for the Pioneer 88 radio, the price of which is 10,000 rubles, many owners note too complicated management when working with CD-carriers.  Such extensive functionality is more needed by those who use a professional speaker system installed in the car.  Many owners in their reviews of the radio recommend all newcomers not to use the instructions, but to determine the operability of a CD player intuitively. </p>

    <p>  There is logic in such tips, because for most users, four skills will be enough: insert a disc, start playback, switch to the next track, remove the disc from the tray.  Fans of the finer tuning of the player can use the independent study of the operating instructions for the device. </p><h2>  CD Guidelines </h2><p>  The user guide provides information on how to set up the Pioneer 88 and how to use it conveniently.  However, on the pages of the manual, the reader will not find a list of standard errors made by many owners of the radio.  The fact is that there are several quick ways to break the device with incorrect user actions. </p><ol><li>  Removing a CD from the tray should only be done after the rotating spindle has completely stopped.  That is, the user must stop playback and wait 5-6 seconds before pressing the "EJECT" button.  Failure to comply with these requirements leads to the fact that over time the tray stops returning the disk after pressing the eject button. </li><li>  To insert a CD-ROM face down, even for sporting interest, is not worth it.  Just one pothole on the road will be enough to damage the laser reader. </li><li>  No need to experiment with DVDs, inserting them into a device that does not understand a denser amount of data.  The radio processor from such actions can go crazy (a general reset to the factory settings helps). </li></ol><h2>  More features with a Japanese representative </h2><p>  Car radio "Pioneer 88" is completely devoid of support for USB-devices.  That is, the owner will not only not find the corresponding port on the front panel of the device, but also will not be able to find the necessary wiring on the system board of the radio.  Naturally, for many car owners this is a huge drawback.  But there is one loophole that many owners are quick to share in their reviews.  The radio is equipped with an analog audio input, which is implemented by the Mini-Jack 2.5 interface. </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer in his user manual practically did not pay attention to this feature, indicating only that the radio supports operation with iPod.  In fact, having purchased an adapter for the Pioneer 88 (Mini-Jack 2.5 to 3.5) on the electronics market, the owner can play music in the car from any storage medium, including a laptop, mobile phone or tablet.  It is clear that this option will not replace USB devices, but still it is more interesting than using obsolete CDs. </p><h2>  Expansion Board Features </h2><p>  In the description of the radio, there are references to installing additional devices on the gadget's motherboard.  However, in the instruction manual any explanation is completely missing.  Many owners in their reviews claim that the radio supports work with a TV tuner.  By the way, in the user manual there is a small note by the manufacturer about setting up television channels.  Car radio "Pioneer 88", the price of which is within 10 thousand rubles, this clearly adds credibility. </p><p>  But with the advent of the TV tuner, the owner of the device has many new problems: the choice and installation of the display, connecting and installing cables around the cabin, the search for a universal control panel.  Having acquired a video display device, the owner will certainly want to install a DVD player. </p><h2>  Watch high quality video </h2><p>  Definitely, many car owners will say that acquiring a radio with a pre-installed DVD player and LCD screen will cost less than assembling the entire system separately.  And he will be right, but such a ‚Äúharvester‚Äù requires a fairly large investment (from 50,000 rubles), and, accordingly, is not affordable for most motorists. </p>

    <p>  The universal modification of the Pioneer 88 radio with an expansion board is more reminiscent of a children's designer, when the owner complements the device with additional functionality as far as possible.  The DVD player is the upper stage of evolution for the budget radio.  True, the owner of the device will have to choose between a TV tuner and a DVD player, since there is only one slot for installing expansion cards. </p><h2>  Adjust audio settings </h2><p>  Setting the quality of sound reproduction on the Pioneer 88 radio in a particular car is a whole complex of measures through which every owner of a new device passes.  Almost half of the operating instructions are fine-tuning the audio settings.  In their reviews, the owners of the radio tape recorders recommend that beginners give up studying the manual and entrust the sound quality settings to professionals in car workshops. </p><p>  Simple adjustment of audio parameters will be useful to any owner, because the control of the equalizer does not interfere with the operation of the entire system, as this can happen during fine tuning.  You need to use the "Posi" control, with which you can choose automatic sound adjustment (Auto TA) or manual selection (EQ).  You can call the equalizer curves from the device‚Äôs memory by scrolling the selector in both directions. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The Pioneer 88 radio tape recorder in the domestic market has long been considered a classic, and it is not at all the date of its manufacture.  This is one of the few devices in the budget class that boasts a very high sound quality.  Radio broadcast, music from a CD or MP3 encoded signal from a mobile phone - it doesn‚Äôt matter, the DAC of the radio is capable of processing any source and delivering truly realistic sound to the speakers.  The presence of the expansion card allows the low-cost device to compete with representatives of the business class in the market <span>of car speakers.</span> </p>
