    <h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  Of course, the main attraction for people who came here to relax is to visit the beach with the aim of sunbathing and swimming enough in the sea.

But again, almost all visitors spend time on the beach.  Only towels should be taken with you.  Bathrooms are in rooms, but beach ones are not issued. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of tourists </h2><p>  And now you can pay attention to the reviews that leave about the rest at Tulip Inn Oasis 4 *.  They are mostly positive.  It should be noted right away: you should not expect much from the hotel.  This is quite a comfortable and well-groomed hotel, not a resort class.  Here you can book a room at a low price and live in good conditions.  After all, people come to Agadir in order to study another culture and life. </p><p>  The clear advantage of the hotel is its silence.  Many guests are employees of aviation companies.  Crews, to be more precise, who are populated here during the trip.  However, due to the fact that the hotel is located next to the road, it is still noisy.  But you can close the balcony door, and the apartment will immediately become quieter. </p><p>  Special attention is paid to the level of service.  He is worthy here.  All you need to bring, just ask.  You can not even go down to the reception.  Not without reason, because for communication, an internal telephone was installed in each number. </p><p>  The sea, as already mentioned, is close.  You can go down from the slope along an asphalt path.  It does not require much effort.  Since the descent is comfortable and gentle. </p><p>  And guests are pleased to note the fact that the promenade here is very busy.  There are various cafes, including famous ones, such as McDonald's and KFS. </p><p>  The beaches are clean, despite the fact that from June to August they are filled with locals and tourists.  Fewer people in spring and autumn - it is worth taking this into account if you want to relax in a more secluded setting. </p>

    <h2>  Other nuances </h2><p>  Also, guests leaving <span>reviews</span> about Tulip Inn Oasis 4 * <span>(Morocco)</span> about their stay, note the quality of cleaning.  She is here daily and thorough - the maids are working to their conscience.  Towels are replaced with the same regularity.  And toilet supplies also replenish. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend throwing a few tubes with cream after / after sunburn and an anti-burn ointment into your bag before going on vacation.  The sun in these places is simply incredible, especially in high season. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the lobby of the hotel for tourists are posted memos.  It says: if guests paid "all inclusive", then they do not pay for drinks until 23:00.  Then they pour it for a surcharge.  By the way, staff does not take tips if you leave them on a table or on a bed for maids.  This is considered theft in Agadir.  Therefore, if you want to thank the staff for a good job, it is worth giving money directly to your hands.  Or a note in French can be left. </p><p>  The hotel is recommended for people who want to get acquainted with Morocco, enjoy a beach holiday and local culture.  Couples, friendly companies or solo travelers will love it here.  Traveling with children is not recommended, as this resort and hotel is not for them.  They will be bored here.  But all others can safely go.  The hotel is not bad and also with reasonable prices. </p>
