And the idea comes to open a contribution, and even at interest.  Then the money will, as they say, work for its owner.  The idea is not bad, but first you need to decide on the bank.  Well, it’s worth briefly telling about the services of the most popular financial institutions in Russia. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  Many people decide <span>to open a contribution</span> to the most reliable and trusted organization.  In any case, Sberbank is considered to be such.  Here, potential customers will find several profitable offers.  You can make a jubilee contribution called "The Most Valuable".  It is opened for 175 days.  The rate is up to 8% per annum.  As a gift to the client is an insurance program. </p><p>  There is also a “Save” contribution.  It can be opened for a minimum of a month and a maximum of 3 years.  The annual rate is up to 6.49%. </p><p>  There are also deposits “Replenish”, “Manage”, “Give life”, “Multicurrency”, “International” and “Savings”.  Here is the last one worth telling in more detail, since it is the most popular, because it is unlimited, and also replenished, with unlimited withdrawals and any minimum amount.  The rate can vary from 1.5 to 2.3%. </p>

    <p>  Suppose a person decided to open a deposit in Sberbank for a year and immediately deposited a million rubles into his account.  Each month, he replenishes it with another 20,000 p.  As a result, over the year he will accumulate 1,262,200 rubles, of which 22,209 is net income.  True, with the same “Replenish”, you will earn more.  After all, the rate is 6%.  And with the same conditions, the final income will be 66,800 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  VTB 24 </h2><p>  Many people decide to open a deposit in this bank.  There are also enough offers.  But the best is "Profitable" with a maximum rate of 8.55%.  With an initial contribution of 1,000,000 rubles, the income will be slightly less than 80,000 rubles.  By the way, interest can either be left on <span>the deposit account</span> or transferred to the card.  This is how the client wants.  VTB-24 is also good because it provides an automatic extension of the deposit and preferential terms for early termination. </p>

    <p>  But “Profitable” is bad because the account cannot be replenished.  Therefore, it is convenient for people with a solid income, who can open a deposit for a large amount.  But “Comfortable” and “Accumulative” are rechargeable tariffs.  If you report monthly 20 thousand rubles, then in the end the profit will be 62 and 78 thousand rubles, respectively. </p><h2>  Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  This is another popular financial institution.  Many decide to open a contribution in rubles here.  One of the most popular offers is the Classic tariff.  The minimum deposit amount is 3,000 rubles.  It is not replenished, but the maximum rate is 8.55%.  By the way, you can open a deposit for a period of 31 to 1460 days.  If you make a deposit for the maximum period and make an amount of one million rubles, then the total profit will be slightly less than 335,000 rubles.  But this is too long for many.  However, even if you make a deposit for 395 days, the total profit will be 86,000. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Amur Tiger tariff with a maximum rate of up to 8.1% is also popular.  There are three terms - 395, 540 and 730 days.  The minimum amount is 50,000 rubles.  Interest is paid every month and at the end of the period it is credited to the debit card issued to the client after making the deposit.  She can pay for utilities, mobile communications, purchases in online stores.  And also a person, performing operations with this card, helps protect unique Amur tigers.  Rosselkhozbank transfers part of the proceeds to the Center for the Study and Preservation of these rare animals. </p><h2>  OTP </h2><p>  One cannot fail to note the attention of this organization, talking about which bank to open a deposit in the most profitable way.  There are several suggestions in OTP.  The “maximum” tariff offers a 8.3% rate for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.  The minimum amount is 30,000 rubles, replenishment and withdrawal is not possible.  The interest rate for the Cumulative tariff is 7.6%, for the Pension one - 7.4%, and for the Flexible one - 6.7%.  There is also a <span>savings account</span> with a rate of 6.5%. </p>

    <p>  Well, you can give an example of indicators of potential profit.  If a person has invested a million rubles and every month replenished the account with 20,000, then by the end of the year 73,200 rubles will be collected from him at the Accumulative.  This is net profit.  In the case of the Pension, the amount will be about 83,000. And according to the Flexible tariff, at the end of the term it will turn out to help out 74 thousand rubles.  “Maximum” is suitable for people with large incomes, since replenishment in his case is not provided. </p><h2>  Gazprombank </h2><p>  A certain part of the Russians makes the decision to open a contribution at interest in this organization.  Gazprombank has five offers.  All of them relate to basic deposits.  The first option is “Perspective” with a maximum rate of 8.2%.  The term can be from three months to 3 years.  Replenishment is not provided. </p><p>  There is also "Cumulative."  The rate is less than 8%, but you can replenish the account, as in the case of the “Dynamic” tariff, the maximum rate of which is 7.9%, but partial withdrawal is still available.  There is also a rate of "Rentier" (6.7%). </p>

    <p>  The most common option is Cumulative.  Having invested a million, at the end of the year it will turn out to help out about 74,000 rubles.  But if you use the “Perspective” tariff, having opened a contribution for three years, then in the end you will be able to earn about 210,000 on interest. </p><h2>  Alfa Bank </h2><p>  Finally, let’s say a few words about this organization.  Someone decides to open a deposit in Sberbank, while others are more impressed with Alpha. </p><p>  The first offer is the tariff “A +”.  The rate will be 7.3%.  Having invested a million, at the end of the year it will turn out to help out about 75,000. A similar tariff is called “Victory”.  Only in this case, the rate is 7.87%, and the final profit, respectively, is about 79 thousand rubles.  A deposit, by the way, can be opened for a period of three months to 750 days. </p><p>  Also there is a tariff "Life Line".  The Bank transfers part of the proceeds from clients' income to a fund of the same name, which forms a culture of charity in the society and financially helps children with serious illnesses.  In addition to the above, clients are offered deposits "Potential", "Premium" and "Prime". </p><p>  In general, as you can see, all banks have rather favorable conditions.  In any case, a person will receive a profit, and how large it will be depends on the amount of his contribution and the selected tariff.  Before you go to a particular financial institution, it is better to familiarize yourself with all the popular offers and calculate the possible interest income. </p>
