What do novice masters need to know?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fashion industry offers a whole bunch of interesting and even unusual items of clothing.  Some are in demand for only one or two seasons, others remain in the top for literally centuries.  The stores offer just a huge assortment of goods, but even this does not allow many buyers to purchase the treasured thing.  And then especially creative personalities decide to implement the idea on their own. </p><p>  This article is specially prepared for them.  It describes in detail how to connect a sweater with a lowered shoulder using the selected threads and knitting needles. </p><h2>  Choose a model </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fashionem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater with one shoulder" class="if uuid-3214615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3214615.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that it just seems as if the task is impossible.  In fact, everything is quite simple.  The most important thing is to carry out competent training.  What is its essence? </p><p>  So, the first thing you should think about for what season you need a jacket with a lowered shoulder.  Basically, this wardrobe item is worn in the spring and summer.  Therefore, it is worth considering a fairly airy model of thin yarn, possibly with lace or elements of fashionable hole knitting.  Dense patterns, various braids and harnesses are best left for the winter thing.  Or make these elements small. </p><h2>  Define a tool </h2><p>  There are no strict recommendations regarding what to work with knitting needles or crochet.  The product can be made with both the one and the other tool, and even with two options at once - it all depends on the imagination.  However, if a novice master plans to tie a sweater with a lowered shoulder, it is wiser to use knitting needles.  At the same time, experts give important advice regarding their size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="crochetmarifu6a.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting jacket" class="if uuid-3214613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3214613.jpg"></div><p>  For a lace or a complex pattern, it is better to choose a tool that is equal in diameter to the thickness of the thread.  Those who have only recently begun to learn craftsmanship can be knitted even with single facial stitches along the entire length, but to acquire knitting needles 2‚Äì5 times thicker than the thread. </p><h2>  We get yarn </h2><p>  Another important point that also determines the beauty of the intended product.  The most important thing that experienced craftswomen emphasize is not to try to include in the knitted sweater with a lowered shoulder (or another thing) all the known patterns, the types of yarn you like and the available decor elements. </p><p>  To make the product really spectacular, you should think about the features of knitting in advance.  That is, decide what the focus will be on - on yarn, pattern or decor.  Inexperienced needlewomen it is better to experiment with yarn - to purchase a patchwork or gradient.  As the main pattern, choose an elastic band, garter or hosiery.  If a jacket with a deflated sleeve will be framed with lace, it is better to purchase a plain yarn.  You can bright or even acid color. </p><p>  And if the highlight of the sweater is an interesting decor, it is recommended to knit a simple thing.  For example, facial stitch and plain yarn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for women" class="if uuid-3214608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3214608.jpg"></div><h2>  Take measurements </h2><p>  Knitting any thing is a completely creative process.  Rather, the needlewoman can navigate through ready-made master classes and instructions, however, it should be borne in mind that they are designed for a particular person, taking into account the features of his appearance, physique and even age. </p><p>  Therefore, experienced needlewomen still do not advise beginners to walk along the beaten path.  Better to pave your way, because it is not difficult! </p><p>  Before you start knitting sweaters with a lowered shoulder, it is necessary to take measurements from the person for whom the product is intended.  For this: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a measuring tape, a piece of paper and a pencil. </li><li>  Invite a model.  She should be in tight clothes or underwear - as comfortable. </li><li>  Measure the circumference of the shoulders.  Please note: not the width, but the girth!  In order to get the correct value, the model should stand straight, hands pressed to the sides. </li><li>  Then determine the length of the jacket (from the shoulder to the lower edge), the length of the sleeves (from the shoulder to the cuff), the level of the armhole (from the lower edge to the armpit) and the circumference of the hips (jacket should be free). </li></ol><h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  Now we pass to the most interesting!  Do not be afraid of the title, you do not have to draw a full-size product.  It is required to make a sketch with the exact parameters, according to which it will be possible to navigate when knitting. </p><p>  So, to build a sweater pattern with a lowered shoulder: </p><ul><li>  Take a piece of paper in a box and a pencil. </li><li>  Draw a rectangle, and then figure number 2 (photo below). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a sweater with a lowered shoulder" class="if uuid-3214381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3214381.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Now mark the model parameters on the diagram, indicate the level of the armhole. </li><li>  Calculate the parameter A according to the formula indicated in the photo.  And also indicate on the diagram.  This is the part of the sleeve that should be tied at the end. </li></ul><p>  However, this pattern will be a normal pattern until you translate the centimeters into loops and rows.  To do this is simple, you just need to tie a piece of 10 x 10 centimeters.  But it must be done with prepared yarn and knitting needles. </p><p>  After that, follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Count the number of loops and rows in the sample. </li><li>  Divide these values ‚Äã‚Äãby 10, round to the nearest whole, and fix on paper. </li><li>  Now you know the number of loops and rows of 1 cm and you can translate the parameters of the jacket in the desired units.  To do this, divide the values ‚Äã‚Äãmarked on your diagram into them.  Accordingly, horizontal parameters are loops, vertical parameters are rows. </li></ol><h2>  How to tie a sweater with low shoulders? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.la.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweatshirt" class="if uuid-3214605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3214605.jpg"></div><p>  When the hardest part is over, you can get to work.  The back and before starting to knit separately, reaching the level of the armhole they should be connected, adding air loops and thereby gaining loops for the sleeves.  But first things first: </p><ol><li>  Type 1/2 of the hips on the knitting needles. </li><li>  Tie a flat cloth, the length of which is equal to the distance from the bottom edge to the armpits, tear off the thread, do not close the loops. </li><li>  Put the part aside and, by analogy, tie the same, but do not break the thread, it should continue knitting. </li><li>  Next, calculate the number of loops needed for the sleeve.  Since you should increase the width of the fabric to 1/2 of the circumference of the shoulders, determine the number of additional ones according to the formula: P * = 1/2 of the circumference of the shoulders - 1/2 of the width of the hips. </li><li>  Now you need to connect the back and front together.  To do this, extend the canvas one row and add the calculated number of air loops (P *). </li><li>  Next, carefully knit 1 loop into 2 parts.  Please note - it already fits in as usual, and does not act like a hem.  Tie the row to the end. </li><li>  After that add more air loops, the number of which is also equal to the value of P *. </li><li>  So, you connected the back and before together, added loops for the sleeves and got the total number of loops equal to the circumference of the shoulders.  Next, you just need to knit in a circle, reaching the desired length of the product.  The only clarification is that in the last three rows it is better to make a 1 x 1 gum. </li><li>  Take the hook, on the armhole, dial the loops, transfer to the knitting needles and knit (in a circle) the sleeve to the desired length (parameter A in the diagram above), at the end also adding a single elastic band.  By analogy, make a second sleeve. </li></ol><p>  That's all!  The base of the product is ready.  You just have to add the side seams, connecting the front and back. </p>
