Otherwise, he cannot claim to be a hotel of the indicated stardom.  "Carat", according to the guests, is more like an overnight stay.  It provides a bed and minimal service.  Cleaning took place once a week, and not every day.  Underwear was sometimes not changed at all. </p><p>  The restaurant was dirty.  Public areas also could not boast of cleanliness.  In the hours of eating in the dining room there were huge lines.  They had to stand in them for thirty minutes.  By the time of approach to the distribution counter, the number of dishes demanded by vacationers was rapidly decreasing.  Therefore, products were bought in the local market. </p>

    <p>  If you come a little later, then you risk not only not having a meal, but also without plates.  Sometimes glass glasses were replaced with plastic ones.  The dishwasher often broke.  The waiters washed the saucers and cups by hand.  As for the reception staff, they were always polite and tried to help.  The rooms looked neat.  Air conditioners worked properly. </p><p>  You never need to agree to be placed in an alternative Anex building.  It has cheap rooms.  They are old and dirty. </p>
