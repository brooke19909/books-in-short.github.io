  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organizational and economic characteristics of the enterprise and its preparation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Organizational and economic characteristics of the enterprise is relevant when performing the thesis, and in the case of performance evaluation.  But you need to know how to compile it correctly.  It is usually necessary to describe the company or enterprise where the practice took place.  But any organizational and economic characteristics have common points that apply to any organization.  We present the plan for its preparation. </p><p>  To compile the characteristics, information is required on the structure of the company, its economic indicators and legal data. </p><p>  Initially, it is necessary to make a <span>brief description of the enterprise,</span> that is, the time of its foundation, legal form, etc.  The legal form may be state, private, municipal, mixed, family and so on. </p><p>  The next step is the analysis of the enterprise or several of its areas, which are fundamental to its existence. </p><p>  Then describe the goals of the company and its capacity.  In this case, all circumstances (external factors, type of product and its features or the nature of the services provided) are taken into account.  This item, which includes the organizational and economic characteristics of the enterprise, requires a lot of work and a complex analysis of economic activity. </p><p>  Depending on the requirements, this paragraph may be slightly different for an individual job or organization.  The economic characteristic of the enterprise contains the main performance indicators, financial results, etc. </p><p>  A characteristic can consist of an analysis and description not only of the main production, but also of its branches of subsystems and other units related to it.  This is especially true of modern large enterprises.  These are numerous departments involved in management, analytical work, information collection, distribution of finances and materials, production activities and other types of work.  All this is a complex organizational structure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes the organizational and economic characteristics of an enterprise are compiled to analyze its activities and identify problem areas.  The work of any organization depends on the coordinated work of all departments.  It should be consistent with its goals and production conditions. </p><p>  Characterizing the <span>organizational structure of the enterprise,</span> you can draw up its diagram.  At the same time, the functions and responsibilities of each individual unit and link are described.  The following is an assessment of the effectiveness of each of them by calculating the relevant indicators.  When compiling the characteristics, it is necessary to consider the availability of labor resources.  Their level of training and qualifications are also evaluated.  One important indicator is <span>staff turnover</span> and its causes.  In conclusion, an assessment of the effectiveness <span>of labor management is given.</span> </p><p>  Typically, the staff is divided into <span>staff,</span> employees, workers, specialists and managers.  The structure of labor resources mainly depends on the ratio of these categories. </p><p>  Organizational and economic characteristics of the enterprise should contain a description of the strategy for further development, as well as its adaptability to modern market conditions. </p><p>  Be sure to give an assessment of the state of the enterprise, its viability or level of development. </p><p>  The final part of the characteristic contains an <span>analysis of the economic</span> activity of the enterprise, based on the main indicators.  The main criteria include cost or operating costs, gross profit, net profit, economic effect and some others.  Thus, it is possible to give a full assessment of the enterprise and make it a full organizational and economic description. </p>
