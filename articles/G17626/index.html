He is also a professional chess player, for which he received the title of expert in this field. </p><p>  Sergey was born in Murom, in the Vladimir region.  His family decided to move to Kirzhach, where they started teaching the boy how to play chess.  This section turned out to be really good, because, apart from Sergey Shipov, Vladimir Belov and Dmitry Lavrik, who are famous not only in Russia and the post-Soviet countries, but also abroad, left the hands of these teachers.  These professionals, including Sergey, are appreciated all over the world. </p><p>  Shipov was able to prove himself in early childhood, participating in all kinds of youth tournaments.  A young chess player was quickly noticed in Moscow, where he was invited to a boarding school, which was aimed at educating real grandmasters.  Here Sergey Shipov studied and lived with Yevgeny Bareev and Yuri Dokhoyan, they also achieved great success in this intellectual game. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Shipov biography" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35697/1407955.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How Shipov began his chess career </h2><p>  At first, Sergei chose the path of study, decided to get an education, going to study science at the Physics Department of Moscow State University.  After that, he went to work at the Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics.  No one could have thought that Sergey Shipov would decide to return to chess.  The collapse of the USSR and the corresponding decline in domestic science contributed to this, after which the chess player decided to build his life around this game. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It took Sergei only a year to get the title of master, because in every tournament he showed the highest class of the game, many envied his level.  A few more years passed, after which he became a grandmaster.  The 1998 Russian Championship for Shipov was a success, then he was able to split 1-4 places.  Then the chess player‚Äôs rating exceeded 2600. In the 90s, it was Sergei who became the main partner for the training of the World Cup winner Garry Kasparov. </p><h2>  Shipov about Garry Kasparov </h2><p>  Shipov spoke of his colleague Kasparov in this way: ‚ÄúThis person is constantly hungry for victory, and that was what surprised me in him.  It didn‚Äôt matter to Harry what competition he was participating in, whether it be football or chess, he always set himself only one goal - to win and become the best. ‚Äù  That is why he got his nickname the Great and Terrible, because he forced all the opponents to give all the best, but this was not enough for them to defeat him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Shipov chess" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1407552.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, a person who takes all the prizes and wins in all possible tournaments loses motivation to play, but not Kasparov, because the thirst for victory in him burned constantly.  The best example would be Spassky - this chess player became the best in his field, but he also quickly lost all his awards due to the complete loss of motivation, which can be seen from the defeat at the Reykjavik-72 tournament.  Kasparov decided to take a different path, because winning a new title did not give him the right to stop training, he wanted to continue to move forward.  Kasparov has always put self-development above all victories, for this very reason he has remained the best in his business for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best discipline of Sergey Shipov </h2><p>  Sergey Shipov coped best with his rivals in a quick game, so any blitz tournament for him was that water in which the chess player felt like a fish.  2004 Internet Blitz Championship, open in Troms 2006 - all of these tournaments were fast, where Sergey was able to win a landslide. </p><h2>  Other activities besides participating in tournaments as a player </h2><p>  In the 2000s, Sergey began to engage in journalism, and also covered tournaments.  He was the first person to comment on online chess tournaments. </p><p>  When the sites Kasparov-chess.ru and chesspro.ru were developed, it was Sergey Shipov who was invited as the leading expert.  The chess player created his own portal crestbook.com in 2006, which is popular all over the world.  Sergey‚Äôs voice can be heard on the ChessTV and ChessCast Internet channels, where chess tournaments are consecrated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sergey shipov chess player" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1407562.jpg" width="294"></div>

    <p>  In addition, he decided to engage in writing, works became popular: ‚ÄúThe last intrigue of the century.  Kasparov - Kramnik ‚Äùand‚Äú Hedgehog.  Predators on a chessboard. "  It is interesting that the last of these two books was published in an extended edition in English, consists of two volumes. </p><h2>  Activities as a trainer </h2><p>  Then Shipov began to engage in coaching activities in order to transfer his knowledge and experience to the younger generation of chess players.  Yan Nepomnyashchy, Daniil Dubov, Vladimir <span>Belov, Svetlana</span> Matveeva - all these people received lessons from Sergey.  Now engaged with Grigory Oparin.  On the Internet there is a person under the pseudonym Crest, this is Sergey Shipov.  The biography of this chess player is interesting and fascinating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Shipov" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1407551.jpg" width="600"></div>
