    <p>  A lot of fun is associated with them.  After all, it‚Äôs fun to climb a tree and knock down a dozen nuts, then you have to peel it, and this is a whole art.  Its insidiousness is known to many, since it smudges everything that it touches.  And how fun it is for the guys to extract nuts from the shell.  And, of course, there are them. </p><p>  It is the intact shells from nuts that are the basis of many crafts.  Children's imagination has no limits.  Ideas are often prompted by the child himself, and therefore the craftsmanship of the product should be with him.  Crafts from walnut shells can be made in the form of an insect, fish, bird, animal, boat, mushroom, and much more. </p><h2>  bug </h2><p>  Consider a few ideas for creating products.  It is easy and simple to make crafts from walnut shells in the shape of a beetle.  To do this, plasticine is required in black and <span>brown.</span>  You should also stock up on several thin twigs and two shells.  As a basis, you can take a sheet of green cardboard.  Plasticine should be kneaded in hands and filled with shell.  So it will be attached to cardboard, which can be cut in the form of a sheet and draw veins.  Then the bug will look very believable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The insect can be additionally painted on top, or you can leave it like that.  Having attached the shell to the cardboard, black plasticine must be glued along its edge.  It should fix three branches on one side and the same amount on the other.  These will be the legs of the beetle.  Horns can be made in the same way.  Only branches for this purpose should be chosen more thin and shorter.  You can make a beetle head out of brown plasticine. </p><p>  There is another option for making such a walnut craft.  Everything is done exactly the same, but no branches are used.  The paws of the insect can be constructed from brown or black plasticine. </p><h2>  Turtle and caterpillar </h2><p>  What kind of crafts can be made from walnut shells?  For example, a turtle.  Its shell has a similar color to the shell.  You need to take one half.  The head, paws and tail are attached to it.  They can be made of plasticine, cardboard or colored paper. </p>

    <p>  Out of several shells, a caterpillar will turn out beautifully.  As a basis, you can take part of the branch of medium thickness.  We fix the halves on it with the help of plasticine, which should be painted with gouache in different colors.  Horns can be planted on glue.  We paint the eyes and the muzzle of the caterpillar with paint.  If desired, a pattern can be applied to all segments of her body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Frame </h2><p>  You can make a frame as a crafts from walnuts.  A photo of a loved one or close friend will look great in it.  How to make such a beauty?  To do this, you need transparent varnish and Moment glue.  The nuts should be carefully peeled so as not to damage it.  Then you need to divide it into two parts, after which each should be coated with a transparent varnish.  Next, you need to take the frame for the photo, which is supposed to be decorated.  A drop of glue should be applied to each nut on the back side and applied close to each other to the base.  Having filled the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frame, leave it to dry completely. </p>

    <p>  Small gaps between nuts can be filled with coffee beans planted on glue.  Such a composition will be not only beautiful, but also fragrant.  When the surface of the walnut crafts becomes dry, the photo can be inserted inside. </p><h2>  Tree </h2><p>  What else can you make crafts from walnut shells?  From these elements a lot of interesting things will be obtained for the interior.  For example, a decorative tree.  It can be done using a walnut core.  To do this, you need a straight straight branch, which will act as a trunk, as well as a pot filled with sand, a mixture of earth or small stones.  It is necessary to roll a ball with a diameter of about 10 cm from brown plasticine. Next, we plant it on a branch at a height of about 10-15 cm from the level of the pot and glue it with halves of nuts or shells.  From above, this design will need to be coated with golden spray paint. </p><p>  Next, the craft must be removed from the filler in a pot, toned, allowed to dry and reinserted.  The trunk under the ball can be beautifully tied <span>with a</span> green <span>satin ribbon</span> .  Such a tree can be used as money.  Therefore, it should be put in a prominent place, then it will certainly attract good luck and success. </p><h2>  Christmas tree toy </h2><p>  Crafts made from walnuts can be a wonderful decoration for the Christmas holidays.  You can also create <span>Christmas decorations with your own hands.</span>  A great alternative to a Christmas wreath is a composition of nuts.  The circle can be fully decorated with shells or partially with whole nuts.  The basis of such a wreath is suitable for weaving from coniferous branches.  Also, the circle can be made from glued together wine corks. </p>
