Feedback from their owners, technical specifications and the cost of such solutions will be further considered in stages.  A brief summary of this company will also be provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ram.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv dexp review" class="if uuid-2404695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2404695.jpg"></div><h2>  Company Brief </h2><p>  The DEXP brand appeared in 1998.  This is a Russian company, and initially its headquarters was located in Vladivostok.  Its experimental laboratories, which develop electronic equipment, are located in the Russian Federation.  But the company itself is forced to carry out the production process in China by concluding appropriate assembly contracts for the products. </p><p>  Initially, personal computers were manufactured under the DEXP brand.  But then the range expanded significantly.  In addition to PCs, the company began to produce tablets, smartphones, laptops. </p><p>  Separately, it is necessary to note the multimedia centers of this company.  They have a fairly high quality, reliability, reasonable price and good characteristics.  This is how DEXP TVs characterize reviews.  Who produces them?  In each case, it is necessary to study the documentation.  Most often is China.  But you can also meet both the Russian Federation and Belarus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv dexp customer reviews" class="if uuid-2404693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2404693.jpg"></div><h2>  Economy Solution </h2><p>  Now we have figured out <span>what kind of company is DEXP.</span>  Reviews about the TVs of this brand conditionally divide them into three large groups: entry-level, middle class and premium solutions. </p><p>  The first of these is the DEXP H20C3200C.  It has a display diagonal of 20 inches, and its resolution is 1366 X 768. Also, viewing angles are 160Àö vertically and horizontally.  The frame refresh rate is only 60 Hz.  The brightness is limited to 180 Cd / m <sup>2</sup> , and the value of dynamic contrast is 1000: 1. </p><p>  The capabilities of the software shell of this device are minimized, and it does not support such an option as Smart TV.  The communication list of such a multimedia center consists of an antenna jack and HDMI connectors and, of course, USB. </p><p>  The stereo system is equipped with 2 speakers of 2 watts, and in total this allows you to count on 4 watts of sound. </p><p>  Such an entertainment system is best used as an additional TV in the kitchen, for example.  But to use it as an information panel is extremely problematic for the reason that the screen diagonal is small, and for these purposes it is better to use televisions with diagonals of 32 ‚Äùor more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="dexp.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv dexp customer reviews" class="if uuid-2404116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2404116.jpg"></div><h2>  Mid-level <span>multimedia system</span> : options </h2><p>  Matrices with a resolution of 1920 X 1080 and with the format of the output image FullHD are equipped with middle-class DEXP TVs.  Customer reviews highlight in this case the improved quality of the displayed image.  As an example, consider the model F32D7000B.  She has a diagonal of 32 ".  The type of matrix used is Direct LED. </p><p>  The viewing angles of this multimedia device are increased - by 176Àö.  Moreover, both in the horizontal direction and in the vertical.  The frame refresh rate has not changed and is still the same 60 Hz.  The brightness level has increased and is already 250 Cd / m <sup>2</sup> .  But the dynamic contrast decreased to 800: 1. </p><p>  The operating system, again, lacks Smart TV support.  Therefore, the software features of this multimedia system are minimal.  The list of connections has been increased and now includes three HDMI connectors, a USB jack, one 3.5 mm audio jack for switching external speakers, D-Sub for outputting pictures from a PC. </p><p>  This entire list is supplemented by a single antenna input.  The tuner of this TV is universal.  It is able to work with the usual broadcast signal in digital and analog format.  It can also process cable signal.  But he cannot receive satellite transmissions directly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, the acoustic subsystem is significantly improved.  It, as in the previous case, includes 2 integrated speakers.  But the real power of each of them is increased to 6 watts.  And this one circumstance improves the soundtrack of television programs.  The total power is already 12 watts. </p><p>  The capabilities of this multimedia system have increased significantly.  Therefore, such a device can be used at home as a second television screen installed in the bedroom or in the living room.  Also, such a solution can be used as an information panel in a supermarket, for example.  At least the diagonal increased to 32 ‚Äùallows it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dexp.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd tv dexp reviews" class="if uuid-2404117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2404117.jpg"></div><h2>  Premium Television: Features </h2><p>  Any more advanced DEXP <span>brand television is</span> equipped with even more advanced technical parameters.  Reviews of experts speak of truly advanced technical characteristics in this case.  But their cost increases significantly.  One such model is the U43D9100H. </p><p>  The first important difference in this case is the increased diagonal of the screen, which in this case is already 43 ‚Äù.  At the same time, the image format is 2160p, and the resolution is increased to 3840 X 2160. The type of matrix used is still the same - Direct LED. </p><p>  The viewing angles of such a solution are increased to 178Àö in both possible directions.  The brightness decreased slightly and amounts to 200 Cd / m <sup>2</sup> .  But the dynamic contrast has increased and is equal to 3000: 1. </p><p>  Another important feature of this premium device is the availability of the Opera TV operating system with support <span>for Smart</span> TV <span>technology</span> . </p><p>  The list of connections includes: </p><ol><li>  3 x HDMI </li><li>  Wireless wifi transmitter. </li><li>  1 network port RJ-45. </li><li>  2 USB connectors. </li><li>  1 set of RCA jacks. </li><li>  1 SCART socket. </li></ol><p>  Acoustics includes 2 integrated speakers of 7 watts.  That is, the quality of the sound produced in this situation is significantly improved.  The total power of this integrated system is 14 watts.  The technical specifications of the tuner are identical to those previously given for the mid-range multimedia system. </p><p>  Such a TV can only be used at home when implementing the most advanced multimedia entertainment center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="root-nation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dexp what kind of company tvs reviews" class="if uuid-2404699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2404699.jpg"></div><h2>  Systems cost </h2><p>  A reasonably affordable solution from a cost perspective is any modern DEXP LCD TV.  Reviews this plus is a must.  The youngest of the considered devices is the H20C3200C model, which can be purchased for 5500 rubles.  Mid-level multimedia system - F32D7000B will cost 11,000 rubles already.  Well, a premium U43D9100H TV costs 21,000 rubles. </p><p>  Low cost makes DEXP televisions more affordable for end users.  The feedback of each owner about such devices indicates the presence of a very loyal pricing policy of the manufacturer.  But at the same time, their technical specifications are pretty good.  The result is an excellent combination of price and parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="root-nation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv brand dexp reviews" class="if uuid-2404696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2404696.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A number of advantages have DEXP TVs.  Customer reviews highlight such ones as: </p><ol><li>  Functionality. </li><li>  Energy efficiency. </li><li>  Reliability. </li><li>  Availability. </li><li>  Simple setup and operation. </li></ol><p>  But there are also disadvantages inherent in any DEXP TV.  Reviews of specialists and owners focus on such ones as: </p><ol><li>  The presence of certain ‚Äúglitches‚Äù in the software of such systems, which can be eliminated by updating the firmware of the multimedia center. </li><li>  In the most budgetary decisions, the communication list is significantly reduced. </li><li>  The integrated tuner is not able to work with satellite signal. <div class="photo" data-original="root-nation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TVs dexp reviews who produces them" class="if uuid-2404697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2404697.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Only a few DEXP televisions were listed in the material reviewed.  Owner reviews, specifications, strengths and weaknesses of such multimedia systems will help you with choosing the best solution for your home.  The information given earlier will allow a potential buyer to choose exactly the model that best suits his needs. </p>
