Previously, it did not cause very good associations.  However, at present, this country is economically highly developed and, most importantly for the Russian people, peaceful.  Of course, at the mention of this state, many immediately represent Berlin.  However, this is not the only city.  Almost all the country's settlements are interesting in terms of attractions.  Kassel (Germany) is the same.  Hearing this name, not many will immediately remember what it is.  Indeed, almost every child is familiar with this city in absentia.  There is no such person in Russia who would not read the <span>fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm.</span>  And they just lived in Kassel for a long time.  And it was here that everyone‚Äôs favorite works were born. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cassette germany" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1371002.jpg" width="600"></div>
