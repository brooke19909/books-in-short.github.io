It was in this direction that they embarked on a journey, and there was comic talk among the people that every resident of our country should go or have already visited Turkey.  Solar Antalya is a special place.  Clean air, a long strip of sandy beaches, picturesque landscapes are breathtaking, as soon as a tourist enters the area.  Antalya is rich in luxury hotels, which, however, are affordable for the average Russian.  One of these is Fortuna <span>Antalya 5 *.</span>  Reviews about it and other interesting facts will be considered further. </p>

    <h2>  Relax with a twist </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth saying that ‚ÄúFortuna‚Äù is a whole complex of hotels located in different regions of not only Turkey.  The peculiarity of this program is that the tourist places an order where he indicates the class of stardom, preferences in the type of food, length of stay, and until the very arrival does not know which of the hotels he will be accommodated in.  One thing is for sure: all hotels, including <span>Fortuna 5 *</span> (Antalya), have a high level of service.  You will never regret participating in such an unusual and relatively new program, because for paid money you will not be offered apartments with a class lower.  On the other hand, it is intriguing ignorance that will become your main companion.  You will not have information and will not be able to find out about the hotel in advance, a surprise awaits you directly on the spot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Best examples </h2><p>  There are several hotels on the entire coast of Turkey where you can potentially be accommodated.  Most importantly, they are all part of the Fortuna 5 * Antalya system.  One of the favorite vacation spots for visitors from all over the world is the Joy Hotel.  Its service meets all standards, tourist services are top-notch.  Every day your room will shine with cleanliness and order, and you will sleep on fresh bedding.  The attitude of the staff is always respectful - they will answer you to any question of interest or tell you which sights to start exploring from.  The hotel constantly has a guide ready to provide any assistance. </p>

    <h2>  Convenience and comfort </h2><p>  Agree, guests want the hotel to be located on the seafront.  The Fortuna 5 Star hotel chain is no exception.  Fortuna (Antalya) is always the maximum of amenities for every tourist!  If you go to a hotel located in Marmaris, rightfully considered the most beautiful and graceful area, you will be only a few meters from the hotel to the sandy beach.  In addition, within walking distance is the city center, which is nice to walk along the path to the sea.  The airport is in relative proximity, which allows you not to tire on the way to the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The interior of Fortuna 5 * (Antalya) in Marmaris will charm you with its beauty.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel includes a leafy garden where evening walks are so pleasant.  Some rooms offer a view of the sparkling expanse of water under the sun, while others will present you with picturesque landscapes of the surrounding suburbs.  Each room has air conditioning and a TV.  But believe me, given theatrical performances and shows arranged after dinner, you will not be bored. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  When choosing a trip, comments and ratings of those who have already visited a particular hotel before you using the Fortune system remain important.  Do not forget that the tourist is the first who should build his vacation so that it would not be a pity for wasted time.  Tour operators only help to make a choice, but here their decency and responsibility are especially relevant. </p>

    <p>  Those who used the Fortuna 5 * Antalya program leave mostly positive reviews.  The main advantage, of course, is the material benefit of this system.  It will not be a huge savings, but it will be a pleasant addition to the rest - you can buy souvenirs and gifts for such trifles.  You can visit the Turkish baths or limit yourself to swimming in the pool.  Given the class of hotels (they all have 4 or 5 stars) with service and food, as well as service and attitude towards tourists, you can be sure that the atmosphere throughout the rest will remain at its best. </p><p>  The hotels have a number of additional programs that will impress you.  You will be offered to take a boat trip (in some cases with a transparent bottom that allows you to see the deep sea), fly by parachute, ride a banana and a cheesecake.  Fans of a more intelligent program will be able to choose sightseeing tours, where they will have the opportunity to see firsthand the beauty of the entire area. </p><h2>  Alternative locations </h2><p>  We bring to your attention the most common hotels in Turkey, in which you can be accommodated under the "Fortune" program: </p>
