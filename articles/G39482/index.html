    <h2>  Jomtien Resort Region </h2><p>  When describing Pattaya, it is usually divided into northern and southern parts.  The first is the party and more dirty and noisy center of the resort.  Jomtien belongs to the southern zone.  There are also many different tourist attractions, a clean <span>beach</span> known throughout <span>Pattaya</span> and a more chamber atmosphere.  This resort is considered more respectable.  The local coast is a six-kilometer strip of sand extended in a straight line.  Prices are lower than in the center, and the bars are decent.  Families with children usually enjoy Jomtien more.  The beautiful promenade is a great place for walking, where you can taste delicious dishes at very affordable prices.  The hotels here are very decent, with pools and beautiful grounds.  These include the hotel Ambassador City Jomtien Garden Wing 3 *, the photo of which you see in our article.  Although it‚Äôs far to get to the center, it‚Äôs not very long.  You won‚Äôt get there on foot, but getting there is not a problem, and it‚Äôs inexpensive.  This is a great choice for those who choose Pattaya for holidays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Jomtien Garden Wing 3" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1033511.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach vacation </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the Ambassador City Jomtien Garden Wing 3 * hotel (Pattaya) is located directly on the famous Jomtien Beach, in its southern part.  True, to get to the coast from the building, you need to walk about five minutes near the shopping arcade, but for many tourists this is an additional bonus.  The beach is almost deserted, there are no umbrellas.  But there are semi-sitting sun loungers for everyone.  But sun loungers, umbrellas and other accessories for relaxing on the sea are provided free of charge at the hotel pools (there are six in total: the main one and one near each building).  They are quite deep - from eighty centimeters to almost three meters, with a very comfortable temperature.  Near them there is almost always a place.  <span>Beach towels are</span> issued at the reception with special cards.  The sea itself is very warm and, most importantly, clean, which is very rare for Pattaya.  The water is a little muddy, but it's from the sand.  The length of the beach is about a kilometer.  Rescuers constantly monitor safety, and cleaners - cleanliness.  There are many cafes where you can dine inexpensively.  Since a specific wind rose has developed here, this beach is very popular with surfers. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Their tourists are advised to take it to the office opposite, and not to the Ambassador City Jomtien Garden Wing 3 * hotel.  Reviews say that there they are many times cheaper.  From the islands, guests recommend Samet and Koh Lang.  Speedboat, white sand, clear water - everything is just like in the commercial.  Extreme sports are advised to ride in the jungle on ATVs.  Of long excursions, they often visit <span>the Kwai River</span> and even Cambodia, but this is if you are not sorry to tear off two or three days from a beach holiday.  If you just want to walk around the center of Pattaya and walk along the famous Walking Street, then tourists are advised to sit on a white knock-knock, drive to the Big Sea supermarket, and then transfer to blue - and in ten minutes you will be in the heart resort!  An orchid garden is also nearby.  It is better to go there on your own, in a tuk-tuk.  This is an amazing tropical park where you can walk for hours, forgetting everything. </p><h2>  Ambassador City Jomtien Garden Wing 3 * (Pattaya): reviews </h2><p>  Comparing this hotel with its neighbors, tourists conclude that it is the best on the entire Jomtien coast.  No wonder the guests recommend it for a visit.  Beautiful, clean and inexpensive.  Everything you need is within walking distance.  Affectionate, calm sea.  You can use the services of all buildings, so coming to the "Garden Wing" means not to overpay.  Here, friendly staff, delicious breakfasts, spacious and clean pools and actually your own beach, probably the cleanest in Pattaya.  Here you can swim, while those who stay in the center go only to the islands.  The hotel leaves guests with an extremely pleasant experience.  He is remembered with nostalgia and constant gratitude.  It has a great location, and at the same time there are no crowds.  Unlike hotels in the center of the resort, this resembles an oasis of calm and equanimity.  Europeans and Americans like to relax in it.  Perhaps this complex is not suitable for party people, but family people with children and couples will really like it. </p>
