Now you can pay for utilities and other services without leaving your home.  To do this, it is enough to have a computer or smartphone. </p><p>  But even if you visit a bank branch, it is not at all necessary to take a turn to the transaction officers.  Almost every office has an ATM or payment terminal.  Using remote self-service points, you can make any financial transaction, withdraw money from your personal account or, conversely, replenish it.  The main thing is to know where the <span>Sberbank ATMs</span> are located <span>.</span>  Perm is such a city where it is pleasant to walk.  But I do not want to waste time looking for where to withdraw money. </p>

    <h2>  About Sberbank ATM Network </h2><p>  In times of crisis, Sberbank is perceived as a doubly reliable "store" for money.  Many private individuals use debit cards only from this financial institution, and firms open <span>salary projects</span> in it <span>.</span> </p><p>  An important factor in choosing Sberbank is also an extensive network of ATMs.  This is very convenient when any cash transaction can be made in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  There are a total of 469 ATMs in Perm, including 368 with the function of receiving cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, when you have to urgently find a self-service point, you can get confused.  Few people know where Sberbank ATMs are located exactly.  Addresses in Perm are simply remembered - street names in this city are very beautiful.  In addition, now it is not so often necessary to rush to look for an ATM in order to withdraw money.  Most of the goods can be paid by bank transfer from a card. </p><p>  A universal advice on how to quickly find Sberbank ATMs in Perm might sound like this: ‚ÄúGo to the nearest major shopping center.  He will most likely be there. ‚Äù </p><p>  And if you have a smartphone connected to the Internet, you can go to the official website of a financial institution.  There is a complete list of ATMs with their location on the map.  The site will indicate the offices closest to you and the distance to them. </p><h2>  Sberbank branches in the central part of the city </h2><p>  Most often, an ATM is needed in the city center, where the most shops, markets, offices, beauty salons, medical centers, and catering facilities are located.  Not everywhere accepts payment for goods and services in non-cash form. </p><p>  To quickly find an ATM (Sberbank, Perm) nearby, it is best to go to the nearest additional office.  In total, the city has more than 80 branches. </p><p>  We list the addresses of some of them: </p><ul><li>  St.  Revolution, 60/1.  The office is open in the evening until 19-00, which is very convenient: you can visit it after work. </li><li>  St.  Lunacharsky, 69, Komsomolsky Avenue, 54. These offices are also open until 7 pm. </li><li>  Several branches of Sberbank are located along Gagarin Boulevard, in houses 60 and 65A.  Both work until 18-00. </li><li>  If you work until late, it is best to go straight to the office on the street.  Krupskaya, 41. Operators serve customers until 19-30. </li></ul>

Sberbank ATMs can be found in many shopping centers and some medical institutions.  However, if you go to the address where only one ATM is located, there is always a risk that it will not work or the device runs out of cash.  This is especially true of large shopping centers.  ATMs in stores almost always have long lines.  Therefore, if possible, it is better to go to an additional office or self-service point.  In a specially equipped room at least 5 ATMs and terminals will be installed simultaneously.  Of course, cash in 1-2 ATMs may also be temporarily absent in a bank branch.  However, other devices will continue to function properly.  There are queues at ATMs in bank branches, but they pass quickly.  The waiting time is usually not more than 5 minutes. </p><h2>  Main office </h2><p>  It is best to solve any non-standard issue related to servicing at the bank in the Perm branch No. 6984 located on ul.  Monastyrskaya, 4. The building has 5 ATMs operating around the clock.  Here you can get expert advice on what to do if your additional office cannot resolve your issue.  It‚Äôs infrequent, but there are situations when the branch does not give out a plastic card for a long time or release it with an error in the holder‚Äôs name. </p><h2>  Types of self-service devices </h2><p>  Where are the ATMs of Sberbank (Perm), their addresses are, of course, easy to find.  But not every remote maintenance device is right for you.  So, for example, cash transactions can be performed only through ATMs.  But there are also devices called payment terminals.  They allow only those operations that are not related to cash turnover. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  ATMs in the central part of the city </h2><p>  Many ATMs of Sberbank (Perm), as we have already said, are located not in additional offices, but in shopping centers, markets, medical institutions or hotels.  It is convenient to use freestanding cash machines when they are located on your route. </p><p>  The following ATMs of Sberbank (Perm) work in the center - the addresses are most known such: </p><ul><li>  in the premises of the medical center "Medlife" - st.  Petropavlovskaya, d. 45; </li><li>  in the Vivat supermarket - Komsomolsky prospekt, 11; </li><li>  at the City Star Hotel - Monastyrskaya, 14a; </li><li>  in the shopping center "TSUM" - Lenin, 45; </li><li>  TC "Coliseum" - Kuibysheva, d.16. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantage of these ATMs is that they close simultaneously with the institutions in which they are located. </p><p>  Many are interested in whether it is possible to withdraw money from a card in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Perm railway station.  Many visitors, having barely left the platform, wonder: where is the nearest ATM (Sberbank)?  Perm-2 - the main station of the city.  There is no bank branch in its building.  However, you can withdraw money or conduct a payment operation very close by, at the square ‚Äú250th Anniversary of the City of Perm‚Äù at 119 Petropavlovskaya Street. There are 4 ATMs working in this branch around the clock. </p><h2>  Additional offices of Sberbank in the western part of Perm (Motovilikhinsky, Ordzhonikidze districts) </h2><p>  In the western part of the city, additional points, offices and ATMs are less common.  To withdraw cash or make a payment, you will have to invest a little more time and effort.  Here it is easier to navigate to cardholders who have personal cars.  The following addresses of Sberbank branches in this part of the city are known: ul.  Lebedev, 25B (open until 6 pm), st.  Turgenev, 25 (until 18-30). </p><p>  On weekends, offices are open at the following addresses: st.  Ural, 69/1 (until 16-00 on Saturday), st.  1905, 2 (until 16-30 on Saturday). </p><p>  At a great distance from the city center there are also Sberbank ATMs.  Perm from the western side ends with summer cottages.  There are also branches of the country's largest financial institution in the territories of SNT.  Their addresses: st.  Shcherbakova, 47A (open until 15-00 on Saturday), st.  Academician Vedeneev, 51 (until 16-30 on Saturday). </p><h2>  ATMs in the western part of the city </h2><p>  Single ATMs of Sberbank (Perm) in the western part of the city are also less common.

    <h2>  Self-Service Points in Eastern Perm </h2><p>  In the eastern part of the city there are fewer additional Sberbank offices than in other areas.  But there are enough ATMs and payment devices.  We will name some of them: st.  Cosm.  Belyaev, d. 45, st.  Cherdynskaya, d. 28 (open 24 hours), highway Cosmonauts, d. 395 (open 24 hours). </p><h2>  Sberbank branches on the right coast of Kama </h2><p>  On the right bank of the Kama River, where a significant part of the city is located, plastic card holders also quite often need to find Sberbank ATMs.  Perm, as you know, is expanding more and more precisely to the right-bank side.  So far, there are much fewer Sberbank service points in this part of the city.  But those who are, quickly and efficiently serve customers.  Close to the bridge there are offices at the following addresses: st.  Kostycheva, 42A (until 17-00 it works in the evening), st.  Cablemen, 85a (until 18-00 in the evening). </p><h2>  Sberbank self-service points on the left bank </h2><p>  On the left bank of the Kama, Sberbank ATMs are working properly.  Perm is developing every year and increasing its business activity.  Residents of the city with great pleasure use plastic cards, and, accordingly, often turn to ATMs.  Their addresses in Perm: st.  Svetlogorsk, d. 15A (24 hours), st.  Chistopolskaya, d. 15. The least known, and accordingly, are not loaded by visitors cash machines on the street.  Victory, d. 35, st.  Kalyaeva, d.19. </p><h2>  The round-the-clock mode of operation of branches and self-service devices is temporarily canceled </h2><p>  As you can see from the above lists, the operating mode is different in Sberbank branches and ATMs.  There are many branches that stop servicing private individuals at 16-00.  Some self-service points have a 24-hour mode of operation.  Even if the client has a need to conduct a payment transaction or withdraw cash from the account after midnight, he can do it.  On the official website of a financial institution, as a rule, you can see the operating mode of Sberbank ATMs in Perm and choose a suitable self-service point. </p><p>  However, at present, due to the increasing frequency of crimes (ATM explosions), the operating mode of cash machines is limited.  They close at 22-00.  This is a necessary measure, which, as soon as the threat of explosions passes, will be canceled. </p>

    <h2>  ATM Crimes in Perm </h2><p>  It is recommended to visit the offices of a financial organization during the day.  In Perm, night-time crime related to ATMs became more frequent.  Attackers came up with a new method, how to extract money from the device, using gas.  The first time unknown persons tested this method on April 18, 2016. Criminals blew up a Sberbank ATM in Perm, in the village of Ferma, on Nekrasov Street.  The incident occurred at about 4-00.  The first attempt was not too successful for the "experimenters": banknotes burned out.  However, the attackers continued their criminal activities.  As if deciding to recoup for failure, they blew up an ATM in the village of Komsomolsky in the Kungursky District already on the morning of April 19, 2016.  This time, the criminals managed to make about 1.5 million rubles. </p><p>  On the night of June 28, 2016, three ATMs in the branch were destroyed by explosions at the Cosmonauts Highway 112. In total, more than 4 million rubles were stolen.  The compartment roof was badly damaged. </p><p>  A week later, also at night, an unknown man made an attempt to destroy the Sberbank ATM on the right bank of the Kama at the address: st.  Lazvinskaya, 60. A bottle of detonating substance (presumably with ammonium nitrate) exploded ahead of time, the criminal, scared, fled.  The ATM was not injured. </p><p>  The most recent crime was committed on September 5, 2016. Its details have not yet been disclosed in the interests of the investigation. </p>

    <h2>  Partner banks </h2><p>  If you need to urgently withdraw money, and there is no Sberbank ATM near you, but there are cash machines of other financial organizations, then you will be interested to know that the largest bank in the country has a network of partner banks.  At ATMs ‚ÄúVTB-24‚Äù, ‚ÄúRussian Agricultural Bank‚Äù, ‚ÄúUniastrum Bank‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdmiralteysky Bank‚Äù money can be withdrawn without a commission, with a Sberbank card.  Regarding other banks, it is worth calling the hotline first and clarifying what are the conditions for withdrawing cash using a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  Internet banking and mobile banking </h2>

    <p>  As we have already found out, using ATMs is not always convenient and safe.  In this regard, Sberbank is trying to transfer customers to self-service via the Internet.  In this regard, not only the Sberbank Online program for stationary computers and laptops is actively developing, but also a mobile application with the same name.  The commission for transactions from home is much lower than when contacting the operator or using an ATM. </p>
