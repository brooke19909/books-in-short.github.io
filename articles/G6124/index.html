    <h2>  Material </h2><p>  You can make an item from a branch, a wooden pin.  Then you will get a practically "impertinent" little thing that was owned, for example, by the legendary Harry Potter, a fairy fairy or a powerful magician.  But if you do not want the child to accidentally get hurt by it, then it is better to choose another, less traumatic material.  A sheet of A4 plain <span>paper</span> (preferably thick) of white or black is suitable.  The instruction tells how to make a magic wand step by step.  Acquainted with it, you conclude that crafting a <span>magical item is</span> fun and simple.  Your child will be able to participate in this process.  For work, you will need, in addition to paper, paints (acrylic or gouache, colored and metallized), a gun and hot-melt adhesive, brushes, scissors. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  The paper needs to be rolled into a tight tube, and it is necessary to roll it at an angle.  In the middle or on the diagonal of the sheet, <span>double-sided tape</span> should be glued <span>.</span>  As a result, your tube will not unfold and sticky tape will glue it securely.  The remaining free end of the sheet must be smeared with PVA glue and glued to the stick.  Now it must be left for twenty to thirty minutes, until it dries.  As a result, you get a cone-shaped figure.  Now you need to trim the stick with scissors so that the edges are even. </p>

    <h2>  How to make a stick durable </h2><p>  Consider several options for how to make a magic wand out of paper and give it strength.  To do this, it must be filled.  Initially, you need to glue its narrow end and start filling it with paper balls (napkins or a newspaper will do), shoving them with the end of a brush or pencil.  Also glue from the gun will do.  The fastening composition must be applied carefully, in several steps, so that voids do not form, and fill the stick with two-thirds.  Then you need to leave the craft so that the glue cools down, and then fill it completely.  Finally, a rounded drop of glue forms on the tip of the stick.  For children's paper crafts to have the strength of a real tree, it is enough to make another tube and place it inside the first.  Or, as an option, epoxy can be used.  Silicone will also serve as a filler for the stick.  On the surface of your craft filled with paper, bumps and irregularities may appear that will serve as its decoration and give it more realism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dressing </h2><p>  In order for your wand to become exactly the same as that of Harry Potter, you need to give it the appropriate look.  Using glue from the gun, it is necessary to decorate the little thing with rings, lines, zigzags, spirals, stars.  Try to do this job neatly and beautifully.  Begin to apply glue as a decoration for crafts on the side of the handle.  When it dries, it can be painted.  Describing how to make a magic wand, the instruction recommends using several tones for its design.  The base color is applied first.  He can imitate a tree.  The second, darker, is suitable in order to highlight the pen.  The artifact, which was owned by the evil sorcerer Volan de Mort from books about Harry Potter, on the contrary, has white wood, and the tip of the wand adorns the Phoenix feather.  You can paint such a stick with white acrylic paint.  After it dries, to give gloss it is enough to cover it with a layer of transparent paint.  Her pen can be made "under the bone."  Its role will be played by polymer clay. </p>

    <h2>  Painting </h2><p>  Since making a magic wand from paper is quite simple, this lesson will be interesting not only for adults, but also for children.  Your child will undoubtedly be fascinated by the process of decorating it.  You can stain the little thing with gouache mixed with glue.  After applying the basic tone of the paint, it should dry.  Then you need to take a darker color.  Black will do.  They cover the individual parts of the subject and then wipe.  So you can give the wand a look of "old".  Remains of paint will be visible in separate areas and will make it more realistic.  Now you need to take a metallic paint - silver or gold - and cover them with decorative elements of a little thing.  At the end of the work, the craft can be varnished. </p><h2>  Fairy wand </h2><p>  A pencil or a sheet of black paper folded into a tight cone will serve as the basis of such a little thing.  The further process of making a <span>magic wand</span> out of paper strongly resembles the one described above.  When the stick is ready, its upper, cone-shaped part must be cut.  Cut stars out of <span>gold foil</span> and fix them on its tip.  As decorative elements, shine and tinsel from a Christmas tree are suitable.  Alternatively, you can craft a stick of paper and paint with gouache with glue and sparkles.  Such a little thing will be a great addition to the <span>fairy</span> carnival <span>costume.</span>  There is another option how to make a magic wand: the instruction suggests using culinary foil, a paper tube taken from a fax machine, <span>pencil, glue,</span> silver thread, scissors for its manufacture.  Initially, a rectangle should be cut out of paper, wrapped with a tube in several turns and glued to it.  The protruding ends must be tucked inside the cone.  Now you need to wrap the little thing with silver thread.  For decoration of culinary foil, you can cut various geometric shapes.  Wrap the circle around the tip of the stick and glue it securely.  Place the rectangle on the side of the little thing.  As you can see from the above options, the process of how to make a magic wand out of paper is quite simple, and even a child can handle it.  But fantasy has no limits.  Therefore, feel free to experiment with materials, forms, design options.  For example, in a few minutes you can make a wonderful little thing from a straw for a cocktail.  From cardboard, cut a star seven centimeters high.  Then it must be attached to a plastic tube.  To get a brilliant effect, the star must be painted.  The craft should dry for eight hours.  Now you can cut two ribbons of the same length as the wand.  Both strips need to be fixed under the star and wrap the whole thing with a brilliant "rain". </p>

    <h2>  A few words in conclusion </h2><p>  What else paper crafts can be, photos demonstrate quite clearly.  It can be stars, snowflakes, figures of animals, objects.  Perhaps, looking at them, you will draw inspiration and want to translate your own fantasies into reality.  So that the magic wand that you have obtained has gained real strength, you can advise the child the following: conduct a ceremony of initiation.  To do this, with a little thing in hand, you need to read a magic spell or poetry.  All!  The wand is ready to perform miracles. </p>
