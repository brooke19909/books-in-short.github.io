    <p>  Sights of Vyborg and its environs can be slowly explored in 2-4 days and get real pleasure from contact with such an interesting and ancient history, which lives very close by. </p><h2>  The emergence of the settlement </h2><p>  Vyborg, the history and sights of which today attract more and more attention from scientists and tourists, arose in 1293, when the Vyborg Castle was built by the Swedes here.  There is a version about an earlier settlement in this place.  Allegedly, the Novgorod elder Gostomysl created a city here in honor of his son back in the 9th century.  There are finds of archaeologists who prove that even in the Stone Age there were sites of ancient people.  But the appearance of a permanent settlement for residence is recorded only in Swedish documents, so the end of the 13th century is considered the official date of the emergence of Vyborg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Archaeological excavations confirm that at the beginning of the first millennium, tribes called Karelians lived in this region.  They actively traded with the inhabitants of Novgorod with the Dutch merchants and representatives of the <span>Hanseatic League, and</span> obtained fish.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern Vyborg there was a warehouse - prison, which housed the guards that accompanied the goods.  The very advantageous location of this outpost attracted the Swedes, who built a stone fortress on Castle Island. </p><h2>  The Swedish period in the life of Vyborg </h2><p>  During the third crusade on the land of the Karelians, at the behest of the Swedish king, a castle fortress - Vyborg was erected on the Castle Island.  Photos of the city, sights and architectural monuments today retain the feeling of power that the building had.  This reliable outpost remained unapproachable for several centuries, despite the fact that Novgorodians made repeated attempts to drive the Swedes out of Vyborg.  The castle became habitable, expanded, and in 1403 the Swedish king granted the settlement city status.  The successful location quickly turned Vyborg into a major trading center.  The city was governed by the Swedish governor, he had great independence, the city paid the king linen (tribute), the rest was ruled by the mayor. </p>

    <p>  In 1442, the head of the city was Karl Knutson Bunde, who in six years transformed the city.  Under him, <span>Vyborg Castle</span> became the most beautiful in Sweden.  The mayor added several towers, rooms for knights and receptions, updated the interiors.  In 1525, the city passed to Count von Goya, who was related to the king of Sweden.  Under him, a large flow of inhabitants from the Hanseatic League poured into the city: from Bremen, Hamburg, Lubeck.  The city is growing, becoming prettier and richer.  Russian troops continue to attempt to conquer Vyborg, but each time they fail.  During the Northern War, Vyborg became the main source of threat to the new capital of Russia - St. Petersburg.  Peter the Great in 1706 personally led the siege of the city, but to no avail.  And only in 1710, thanks to the coordinated efforts of the army and navy, Vyborg was taken by Russian troops, and in 1721, by agreement of peace, became part of the Russian Empire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russian submission </h2><p>  Having become part of Russia, Vyborg becomes the center of the commandant district and the new Russian port.  A number of privileges remain outside the city: Swedish laws continue to work here, residents are allowed to preserve their Lutheran faith, there was no serfdom here.  Traders and military immediately rushed to the new Russian city.  The settlement begins to expand.  It builds the St. Petersburg and Vyborg forstadts. </p>

    <p>  The main attractions of the city of Vyborg of that period are residential buildings, new parts of the bastion.  From 1730 to 1741, active construction was underway in the city, new parts of the fortress were being erected.  It is worth noting that the Vyborg fortress has never been able to test its new fortifications in battle.  This is probably why the sights of the city of Vyborg are so well preserved to this day.  The new building, despite the established Russian orders, retained European features.  Moreover, the architects were mainly Swedes, Germans, and Scandinavians.  In 1811, the Vyborg province was part of the Principality of Finland.  By 1910, more than 80% of the population were Finns. </p><p>  The city has been experiencing a mixture of ethnic groups for a long time, which can‚Äôt do without confrontation and flight, but gradually there was a special atmosphere that always distinguished Vyborg from the usual provincial towns of Russia.  After <span>the Decembrist uprising,</span> several hundred rebels were sent to the Vyborg fortress, which also affected the spirit of the city.  In the second half of the 19th century, the railway reached the city, gasification and electrification began.  He is experiencing rapid economic growth and becoming the second largest in the principality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vyborg and Finland </h2><p>  In 1917, after the revolution in Russia, Vyborg actively entered into revolutionary transformations.  After Finland declared independence from Russia, the city departs to the new state.  He is again changing ethnic composition.  The Finnish population now dominates here, while Russian, German and Swedish are greatly reduced.  But the development of the city continues.  Soon, the architect O. Meurman creates a project to unite the city with the suburbs.  So Big Vyborg appears.  Natural attractions are now part of the city.  At this time, the settlement gains the status of the cultural capital of Finland; many sports, cultural, and temple structures are being built here. </p>

    <p>  Sights of the city of Vyborg of this period still make up its fame: the district archive, a new library, an art museum - all this greatly adorned the settlement. </p><h2>  During the Second World War </h2><p>  In 1939, the Russo-Finnish War begins, and the city of Vyborg, whose sights are in danger, becomes a battle zone.  Active military operations of the Red Army led to the fact that the Karelian Isthmus, together with the city, passed into the power of the Soviet Union.  In 1941, war returned to Vyborg, and the Red Army was forced to surrender it to the Finns.  Until the age of 44, the Karelian Isthmus was occupied by the <span>Finnish armed forces.</span>  During fierce fighting on June 20, 1944, Vyborg was released.  A difficult recovery period was coming.  The city of Vyborg, the sights of which were badly damaged in World War II, suffered huge material and cultural losses. </p><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  At the end of the war begins a long recovery of the country.  The same fate befell Vyborg.  Photos of the city, sights and architecture were a terrifying sight - most of the village lay in ruins.  But the authorities and people are making titanic efforts, and the city is beginning to revive.  In 1947, a plan for new development was created, residential areas and industrial enterprises were again being built.  The streets are renamed in such a way as not to remind about the past of the city.  Vyborg acquires features typical of Soviet cities.  In the 60s, microdistricts of multi-storey buildings appeared here, the buildings of the old foundation are being restored, and new cultural buildings are being erected. </p>

    <p>  The castle houses a real gem - the Olaf tower, almost 50 meters high, its base has remained unchanged from the 13th century, the upper tiers were rebuilt in the mid-19th century.  Also in the castle it is worth paying attention to the Commandant‚Äôs House, where Peter the Great once stayed. </p><h2>  Clock tower </h2><p>  Sights of the city (Vyborg) and a description of their history is a real textbook on the architecture and culture of the country.  The clock tower is a bell tower left from the Church of Saints Mary and Olaf, built in the 15th century.  She miraculously survived during the destruction of the temple in a fire of 1793, and during the hostilities of World War II.  At the base of the tower is a large stone, and the clock goes back to the 19th century.  This is one of the most beautiful historical buildings of Vyborg. </p><h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  Monrepos Park - the former residence of the Swedish barons - is one of Europe's oldest and most beautiful landscape parks.  It is a harmonious combination of grottoes, forests, cliffs, waterfalls, lakes.  The magnificent island of the Dead with a decorative castle is located in the middle of the lake and makes an indelible impression.  The main manor house is interesting - a wooden building in the classical style, as well as the Library wing - a rare example of wooden manor architecture.  These miraculously preserved buildings from the 18th century are extremely valuable architectural monuments. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Vyborg there is another natural place worthy of attention - this is Lake Mezhgornoe Maloe.  It is an example of harmonious northern nature, and the beauty of the landscape and pristine silence make this place the best place to relax from the bustle of the city.  You can also have a great time fishing here. </p><h2>  Architectural monuments </h2><p>  Vyborg is rich in other attractions.  These include the Round Tower, the same age as the Castle.  Her appearance has become a recognizable symbol of the city.  The tower was erected in the middle of the 16th century as part of the fortification wall.  The diameter of the structure is 20 meters, the wall thickness is 4 meters.  It is the brainchild of northern Late Gothic, whose samples are extremely few in Russia. </p><p>  Transfiguration Cathedral is another pride of Vyborg.  It crowns the harmonious appearance of Cathedral Square and is a perfect building in the style of classicism.  The architect <span>N. Lvov,</span> when designing, tried in every way to follow the principles of A. Palladio, practically copying his buildings.  The temple was erected in 1786, but was later reconstructed. </p>
