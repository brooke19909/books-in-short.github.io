    <h2>  The advent of the first cameras </h2><p>  At the time the company was founded, it was too early to think about the mass production of cameras.  The first copies appeared only in 1936.  Soon, the company presented its second improved model, Olympus 2, to Japan.  Then began the development of <span>medium format cameras.</span>  This allowed in 1956 to release a line of very high-quality <span>film cameras.</span>  The model "Olympus 35" the world saw in 1955.  After that, a camera with a non-replaceable wide-angle lens was released.  Then came the first models with interchangeable optics.  Their difference was in the location of the shutter.  Now it was already inside the lens, and using the camera was easier. </p><p>  Prices for the first Olympus models were pretty low.  This is largely due to the features of the film, which was attached to them.  On one frame were two shots, not one, and it was extremely effective.  Since 1963, the Olympus company has been manufacturing professional cameras with a compact body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages of Olympus models </h2><p>  First of all, we can distinguish excellent matrices, which are installed in most Olympus camera models.  Additionally, they have good lenses.  On average, optical zoom has a magnification of 24. At the same time, the focal length is approximately 4-100 mm.  In turn, the maximum diagram is at the level of 6 mm. </p><p>  Additionally, some models are equipped with manufacturers of special aspherical elements to improve image quality.  Focusing in all Olympus models is, in principle, not bad.  Additionally, you can highlight the ability to maintain various formats.  This will greatly help when transferring photos to a personal computer. </p>

    <h2>  Instructions for choosing a camera </h2><p>  The camera issued by Olympus (models are presented below) must be selected based on the general characteristics of the device.  First of all, it is important to pay attention to the matrix indicators.  Additionally, it is necessary to check the photosensitivity parameters.  Most manufacturers specify the parameters "ISO 100-6400".  The larger the zoom, the better.  The focal length of the model also plays an important role.  High indicators of this value will allow you to take high-quality photos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, various functions are very much appreciated in cameras.  First of all, autofocus must be set.  At the same time, it should work with the definition of contrast.  There are also modes with tracking autofocus or spot.  Sequential shooting in the camera is not so important.  However, special attention should be paid to the formats supported by this model. </p>
