This is what this small German town is called, which looks more like a farmer than a craft one.  The name of the city is officially registered as a trademark that produces high-quality blades and knives, popular all over the world. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The first mention of the city of Solingen, Germany, appears in 1064.  At that time it was a small German village famous for its masters in metallurgy, smelting and forging.  Three hundred years later, the village assumed the status of a city, and production increased several times.  It is noteworthy that the metallurgical production in the city of Solingen totals about two thousand years, and the first English kings were one of the first admirers of weapons from Solingen.  It was with Solingen‚Äôs weapons that they made their military campaigns and conquered foreign lands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="solingenmagazin.de" data-author=": B. Glumm, "><img itemprop="image" alt="streets of Solingen" class="if uuid-3235594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235594.jpg"></div><p>  During his long life, Solingen in Germany experienced many catastrophic tragedies: several fires that destroyed the entire settlement, the plague that killed the people.  And how many the city survived the raids and wars, do not count.  But the most notorious event in the German town was the event of 1993, when several German teenagers made a series of arsons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result of their right-wing actions, a family of migrants from Turkey died.  Thus, they protested against the law on migrants.  All participants in the case were arrested and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, and Solingen long held the glory of the black city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Solingen, Germany" class="if uuid-3235585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235585.jpg"></div><h2>  Knives and blades </h2><p>  All over the world, the German city is famous for its magnificent blades and knives, which have been produced here since time immemorial.  The traditions of the production of Solingen knives are carefully guarded, transmitted from generation to generation, thereby preserving the status and glory of the city. </p><p>  You can find knives and cutlery for every taste in the craft shops and shops of the city.  Among the huge variety, you can choose not only classic devices for cutting meat and vegetables.  Fans of hunting and fishing will find here special knives decorated with truly German patterns, with engravings and inlays.  All knives are made by hand, undergoing thorough thorough preparation and preliminary processing of metal. </p><p>  Solingen‚Äôs knives are famous for their quality because for such a long history of their existence, the craftsmen deduced the ideal formula for the ratio of all components of the alloy, calculated the ideal length of the base and blade.  Knives and steel appliances fit perfectly in your hand, last a long time and are not subject to corrosion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ma-shops.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swords of solingen" class="if uuid-3235589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235589.jpg"></div><h2>  Burg </h2><p>  You can not get past the sights of Solingen in Germany.  For example, one of the first places that a tourist should visit is called Schlossburg.  This is a stone castle, which for a long time belonged to the famous German family Berg.  Today it has become one of the most interesting museums in Germany.  Rare household items, magnificent weapons of knights, all this can be seen and photographed, walking with the guide through the famous Knight's, Clan and Fireplace halls. </p><p>  One of the interesting details of this ancient complex is the pharmacy building reconstructed according to ancient sketches, as well as the chapel, which is still operating and even holds wedding ceremonies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fhfff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berg Castle" class="if uuid-3235588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235588.jpg"></div><h2>  M√ºnsten Bridge </h2><p>  Solingen is rich in attractions that are amazing.  What is only the M√ºnstensky bridge, which proudly bears the title of the highest bridge for railway transport.  Interestingly, it was originally called the Bridge of King William the First.  And no wonder, because the development of such a unique structure began in 1889.  Then, after the fall of the monarchy, which swept across Europe, the bridge was renamed M√ºngstensky, by the name of a nearby village.  The village has long disappeared, but the name remains. </p><p>  The construction of the bridge in Solingen in Germany was very spectacular, and almost every day a crowd of onlookers gathered at the construction site, who guessed many legends, the most famous of which tells us that the last driven nail was gold.  Attempts were even made to find this golden detail, but, fortunately, to no avail.  In 2010, the bridge was closed for a major restoration, which ended in 2015.  Thanks to this, the service life of the century-old bridge was extended by at least another thirty years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doatrip.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="M√ºnsten Bridge" class="if uuid-3235595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235595.jpg"></div><h2>  Blade Trail </h2><p>  Fans of walking tours are simply obliged to visit Solingen in Germany for one simple reason: to independently check and evaluate the magnificent route laid among German forests and fields around the city back in 1935.  The route was built in such a way that throughout its length there are many cultural monuments and ancient architecture.  The path, named, of course, in honor of the metallurgical skills of the locals, is marked, divided into several identical sections, designed for a day of a leisurely journey.  You can arrive at the beginning of each section by public bus. </p><h2>  Fauna park </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.1652199" data-lng="7.067116100000021" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/8/1/17881.png"></div><p>  If you come with children to Solingen (Germany), be sure to visit the local zoo.  Among the inhabitants there are goats, restless porcupines, deer that are not afraid of people, llamas.  A very large terrarium with a specially built heating system, so that animals are in a natural temperature environment and always awake.  At the box office, when buying a ticket, you will be offered to purchase food.  For a few euros, you and your child will have incredible pleasure when a goat takes a treat from your palm with its soft lips. </p>
