Do you think that we are talking about Germany or Spain?  You are deeply mistaken.  A small country called Belgium, or rather the capital of Belgium, is what really deserves respect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of belgium" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10756/29442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Brussels is a city in which you will find everything that the soul desires.  This is a skillful architecture, and many educational museums, and local gourmet cuisine, and a huge variety of shops.  But first things first. </p><p>  The story of Brussels should begin with its story.  In 979, the Duke of Lower Lorraine built a fortification.  This was the beginning of the formation of the capital of Belgium.  But in those years no one suspected that it would be one of the most beautiful places on the planet.  First heard about the country at the end of the 7th century.  After this, the rapid development of this European state began. </p><p>  Now, by the way, anyone who has bought a tour to Belgium can see the fortress walls that once adorned and defended the city.  Currently, there is the so-called historical center of the capital.  Locals divide the city into two parts: Lower and Upper city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour to belgium" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10756/29443.jpg" width="600"></div>  As expected, in the Lower are various industrial buildings, as well as shops and hotels.  But the Upper is completely given to tourists and the government.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Probably each of you knows that it is in Brussels that the headquarters of such world organizations as the <span>European Union</span> and NATO are located.  Some of the residents of this state called <span>Brussels the capital of</span> the whole of Europe, not only in Belgium.  Of course, there is still no official confirmation of this. </p><p>  Despite the rather long period of existence of the state, many architectural masterpieces were created relatively recently.  We can say that the capital of Belgium is decorated with architectural monuments made in the Art Nouveau style, or as Europeans call it - Art Nouveau. </p><p>  Many buildings are now included in the list of world cultural and natural heritage of UNESCO.  To be more precise, these are the houses of Van Etvelde and Solway, as well as the house of Professor Tassel and the house of Victor Hort, who had a hand in all of the above monuments in Brussels.  The sights of the country are not limited to only one architecture.  Here at almost every step museums and galleries are open. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brussels sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10756/29449.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for museums and galleries, the capital of Belgium can offer everyone something interesting.  Along with the Belgian Royal Museum of Art, you can also see a museum of beer, as well as fossil animals.  Of course, this is only the tiniest part of all such places in Belgium. </p><p>  But, perhaps, the capital of Belgium is famous not only for its museums all over the world.  Everyone who comes here hurries to see the square called Grand Place.  This is the most famous square in the world.  It is surrounded by houses, and thus a square shape is obtained.  The magnificent flowerbeds created at the Grand Place infuriated King Louis XIV himself.  Once visiting Brussels, the king realized how beautiful the capital of Belgium is.  So that she could not compete with Paris, Louis XIV decided to simply destroy her. </p>
