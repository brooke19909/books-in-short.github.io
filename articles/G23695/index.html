How to choose a parking camera?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Car drivers have long been given the opportunity to ease their tasks on the road with the help of electronic assistants.  For safe and convenient parking today, two groups of such devices are offered - parking sensors and cameras broadcasting a rear view image.  And if the first category of assistants is more suitable for beginners, then experienced drivers turn to the second one sooner or later, realizing the value of such a solution both as a means of increasing safety and as a way to save time.  In particular, rear view cameras with parking lines allow you to control the movement of the car without the risk of collision with other objects without distraction. </p>

    <h2>  What is the special feature of parking lines? </h2><p>  The first and simplest models of rear view cameras were equipped with monitors in which this option was missing.  They in a natural "pure" form transmitted the image, allowing the driver to navigate in real conditions.  Modern models, even in standard sets, are provided with the ability to reflect parking lines.  These are pronounced graphic <span>stripes on the display screen</span> that indicate the boundaries along which you can safely continue to move.  The principle of their lining depends on how the rear view camera works programmatically.  Parking lines in the latest models are adjusted depending on the position of the steering column and, accordingly, on the rotation of the wheels.  This solution, of course, facilitates the actions of the driver, but it must be borne in mind that the slightest failure in the lining of lines can lead to a collision.  Therefore, you shouldn‚Äôt completely rely on them - when analyzing the movement, you must take into account the real situation that is transmitted to the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Which kind of camera do you prefer? </h2><p>  The cameras themselves primarily differ in design.  Mortise models are good for their versatility.  They can be integrated into the body of any car, however, for installation, you will need to drill a special hole.  In terms of installation, the best option is an overhead camera.  It does not require destructive intervention in the case and can be fixed with a complete bolt into the license plate light.  But then you‚Äôll have to choose a model that suits the specific design of the mounting point.  Quite wide viewing possibilities are provided by rear-view cameras with parking lines on brackets.  Their distinctive feature is the ability to rotate, changing the angle of view.  They are installed in the cabin - for example, at the rear window. </p><h2>  Performance Criteria </h2><p>  During operation, two main parameters will be important - matrix type and resolution.  They will determine how high-quality the transmitted ‚Äúpicture‚Äù will be.  As for the matrix, today cameras with two modules are produced.  The first option is the CCD system, the main advantage of which is the increased photosensitivity.  That is, for parking in the evening - this is the most suitable option.  CMOS has only one operational advantage, which is the speed of data processing.  Such rear view cameras with parking lines with a monitor are capable of providing good dynamics of the video sequence, but their clarity will be far from perfect.  In terms of resolution, there is practically no choice.  The standard format is 628x582 (0.3 megapixels) and it is completely enough to meet the tasks of the parking assistant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Selection by viewing angle </h2>

    <p>  The range of degrees of visibility is very wide, but their number does not always guarantee good image quality.  Actually, the choice can be between 120 and 170 degrees.  The standard is an angle of 120 degrees.  In such a broadcast, the image is not blurred and will be perceived as detailed on the monitor.  Nevertheless, 170-degree rear-view cameras with parking lines are actively advertised by manufacturers of premium models.  Their advantage will lie in the large coverage of the "working" area, so you should not immediately refuse such a decision.  Before choosing, you must first evaluate where the device will be installed and whether it can provide sufficient coverage at a low degree.  Otherwise, for the sake of review, you will have to sacrifice clarity, and in some cases sensitivity. </p><h2>  Choice of signal transmission method </h2>

    <p>  In this paragraph, we will talk about how the camera and monitor interact.  A typical connection involves laying a wire through almost the entire cabin with a luggage compartment.  Obviously, the use of a video cable will be time-consuming and costly.  Therefore, modern kits are converted to a wireless type of connection.  Such rear view cameras with parking lines interact with the monitor through the built-in radio modules.  The range can reach 15 m, so there will be no communication problems.  However, wireless systems have two drawbacks: firstly, the high cost, and secondly, third-party electromagnetic interference can temporarily disable the device or distort the "picture". </p><h2>  Additional requirements </h2>

    <p>  It will be useful to have backlight in the display.  At the same evening or night time, the image on the screen may not be enough, and infrared illumination will add clarity to the "picture".  Also, external equipment should be well protected from dust and moisture.  Multifunctional rear view cameras with parking lines with a display, for the most part, also support the ability to connect to DVRs and TV tuners.  In addition, a car navigator with video input format AV-IN is connected.  In this case, the dashboard can be eliminated from the presence of individual devices with the above options. </p><h2>  Manufacturer's Reviews </h2><p>  On the market, models are available both from eminent manufacturers of automotive electronics, as well as from less popular electronics developers.  According to consumers themselves, models from AutoExpert, Proline, Blackview and Spark deserve attention.  For example, cameras from AutoExpert are valued for their reliability, body durability, and signal transmission stability.  This is a standard and inexpensive solution, although it does not demonstrate new technological developments.  Conversely, the advantages of modern functionality are praised by users of Proline and Blackview products - these are high-tech, but expensive rear-view cameras with parking lines.  The reviews point to the advantages of video matrices in such models, and to a detailed image - even in the dark.  For example, the model from UC-77 Blackview thanks to 16 LEDs is able to provide good visibility in the coverage area even at night. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Progress in the field of automotive electronics annually masters new technological solutions.  The expansion of the functionality, of course, affects prices, but with them the quality of the product also improves.  Design excellence, new options and more advanced ergonomics are what characterize modern rear-view cameras with parking lines.  How to choose the most suitable kit?  In addition to the above criteria, do not forget about the secondary qualities.  For example, experts recommend thinking through the possibilities for future communication of the device with other components of standard equipment.  Do not ignore the stylistic correspondence of the display to the interior of the cabin.  Manufacturers regularly improve the design advantages of cameras and especially displays, so this parameter also has plenty to choose from. </p>
