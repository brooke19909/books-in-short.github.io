The condition for receiving is the opening of a savings account. </p><p>  The card gives you the opportunity to get up to 15 times more bonus points in the Pyaterochka chain of stores and earn 5000 points in the first year for free.  In the first six months of use, for every 555 rubles in the check, the client additionally accrues 555 points on the Bank Post card.

Card cost - 200 rubles for 3 years. </p><p>  For all purchases on the card, an instant cashback of 1% is accrued, every fifth purchase brings the owner 5% bonus rubles.  The issuer provides discounts from partners up to 70%. </p><p>  The card is tied to an online wallet account: the owner can pay with "virtual money" at any outlet, including online stores.

In the first case, the card is issued on the day of registration, in the second - it is delivered free of charge by courier.  After the expiration of the term, it is automatically blocked.  To use an online wallet account, you must open a new product. </p><h2>  The best cards for seniors </h2><p>  When retiring, Russians want to give preference to the card not only in terms of convenience (withdrawing money without queues at any time of the day), but also the benefits.  Therefore, retirement cards always differ in financial privileges for holders in the form of interest on the balance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank card rating 2019" class="if uuid-3253815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253815.jpg"></div><p>  Pension bank card rating: </p><ol><li>  ‚ÄúPension‚Äù from ‚ÄúBank Post‚Äù. </li><li>  WORLD "Social" from Sberbank. </li><li>  ‚ÄúPension‚Äù from ‚ÄúRosselkhozbank‚Äù. </li></ol><h2>  Pension card terms and conditions at Post Bank </h2><p>  Opening and servicing of the Post Bank pension card is free of charge.  The card is tied to a savings account: when registering a product, the client agrees to open a deposit with the opportunity to receive up to 6% of the account balance. </p><p>  In the rating of pension bank cards, the best conditions for returning points for purchases are with the Bank Post card.  For purchases in pharmacies, cashback is 3%, in addition, users receive 0.5% for paying for goods at other retail outlets. </p><p>  A bonus when opening a card is the absence of a commission for paying utility bills in the amount of up to 10,000 rubles.  No commission is also charged when transferring funds for utility bills in the network of the Bank Post and VTB branches. </p><h2>  Overview of the Social World map </h2><p>  The most popular bank card for senior citizens in Russia.  Sberbank trusts more than 70% of citizens who have retired.  Until 2016, more than 67% of customers receiving a pension at Sberbank used a passbook.  With the advent and popularization of bank cards ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù, the product has become the most sought-after way for calculating pension contributions in the country. </p><p>  The main condition for applying for a pension card is related to the opening period: no more than 3 months before retirement.  Product service is free. </p><p>  On a quarterly basis, the account balance is charged at 3.5% per annum.  Sberbank provides customers with the use of the SMS informing service for free the first 2 months after activation.  Further, the owners of the "Social" card will pay only 30 rubles per month for SMS from 900. </p><p>  In the rating of debit bank cards for seniors, the Sberbank product is inferior in capabilities to the Bank Post card.  But this does not affect its popularity. </p><h2>  Pension card from Rosselkhozbank </h2><p>  ‚ÄúRosselkhozbank‚Äù offers citizens to issue one of 2 card options for receiving a pension: instant and classic.  Instant card is issued in the department immediately after the paperwork.  The term for the production of the classic MIR "Pension" card is 1-14 days. </p><p>  The owners of the Rosselkhozbank card can receive up to 6% per annum on the account balance.  The bank's partners are Promsvyazbank, Alfa-Bank, Raiffeisenbank, and ROSBANK.  At the ATMs of these companies, customers can receive cash from the Pension card without a commission. </p><p>  The product is included in the rating of the best bank cards of the Russian Agricultural Bank.  The issuer does not charge for messages about receipt of funds to the card account.  Product service is free. </p><p>  The drawback of applying for a card, compared to the terms of competitors, is the need for the applicant to apply to the Pension Fund in order to provide a document on transferring the pension to the bank.  Sberbank and Post Bank automatically send information about new retirees to the territorial offices of the PFR of Russia. </p><h2>  Top 3 cashback cards </h2><p>  Cards with cashback allow the holder to receive a refund for purchases.  The rating of the best cashback bank cards includes credit and debit cards: </p><ol><li>  Alfa Bank. </li><li>  Tinkoff </li><li>  VTB. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="altcointoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="debit bank card rating" class="if uuid-3253808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253808.jpg"></div><h2>  Alfa-Bank cashback card </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank's debit product combines the advantages of cards with cashback and interest on the balance.  Therefore, the card tops the ranking of bank cards with a cashback of 2019. </p><p>  Card service will be free if the customer makes purchases worth more than 10,000 rubles per month.  Otherwise, the owner will have to pay 100 rubles monthly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="readwrite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of cash cards with cashback 2019" class="if uuid-3253811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253811.jpg"></div><p>  The size of the cashback for purchases depends on the amount of expenditure from the card.  The maximum cashback of 10% at gas stations is possible if you connect a premium package of services and expenses worth more than 100,000 rubles per month.  Minimum customer receives 5% cashback at gas stations, 2.5% - in restaurants and cafes and 1% - for other purchases from the card. </p><p>  To get cashback up to 10%, you can fulfill an alternative condition of the bank - to keep more than 30,000 rubles on the balance.  Alfa-Bank charges up to 6% on the account balance. </p><h2>  Tinkoff Shopping Return Card </h2><p>  The largest online bank in the country offers a Tinkofff Black card.  Her conditions: </p><ul><li>  Cashback up to 30% of partners. </li><li>  6% in the form of income on the balance.  Interest is accrued once a month.  The maximum balance sheet on which Tinkoff Bank calculates interest is 300,000 rubles. </li><li>  5% cashback for purchases in categories selected by the client.  On a quarterly basis, the owner of Tinkofff Black determines where it is more profitable to pay with a card: for example, cafes and restaurants, gas stations. </li><li>  1% of cashback comes for any purchases that are multiples of 100 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The advantage of the product, due to which Tinkofff Black is included in the rating of the best bank cards, is free service and delivery.  But Tinkoff demands the owner of the product: in order not to pay for the card, you need to leave at least 30,000 rubles on the balance sheet.  Otherwise, 99 rubles will be charged monthly for maintenance. </p><p>  With a Tinkoff Black debit card, customers can withdraw cash without commission anywhere in the world.  This condition allows the product to also be included in the rating of bank cards for travel.  The maximum limit for monthly withdrawals is limited - no more than 300,000 rubles.  Withdraw money is available not only in Tinkoff Bank devices, but also in ATMs around the world: the minimum transaction amount should be 3,000 rubles. </p><h2>  What is attractive about "Multicard" from VTB Bank? </h2><p>  The advantage of the card from VTB Bank is the calculation of cashback in the amount of up to 10%.  Once a month, the owner can choose the category of purchases from the list, according to which an increased cashback will be charged on all products of the corresponding category.  There are 7 options for the choice of the payer.  A client selects a category using a mobile application or online banking. </p><p>  An additional advantage that allowed the product to enter the rating of bank cards in Russia with the most attractive conditions was the issue of up to 5 cards to the main account.  VTB does not charge a fee for the release of additional products to the Multicard.  When making purchases, customers can increase the size of their cashback: bonuses will be awarded taking into account the costs of additional cards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dealbook.nytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pension bank cards rating best conditions" class="if uuid-3253843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3253843.jpg"></div><p>  But the product has drawbacks: if a customer makes purchases in the amount of less than 5,000 rubles per month, then the bank charges 249 rubles for the service of "Multicards".  Subject to the conditions, in addition to the free issue and maintenance, the client gets the opportunity to withdraw cash from ATMs of other banks for free. </p><p>  In the rating of <span>bank cards with cashback, Multicard</span> takes third place, since the process of calculating bonuses in a bank is different.  Bonuses are refunded for a commission that is charged when spent at ATMs of other issuers or transferred to accounts of other banks.  That is, first, interest on the operation is retained from the card balance, which VTB then reimburses in the form of a cashback. </p><p>  The condition does not apply to spending on purchases: here bonuses are awarded depending on the selected option or promotion from partners.  In the categories "Auto" and "Restaurants", a return of 10% of the purchase is possible. </p><p>  VTB, like other issuers from the rating of bank cards, accrues interest on the balance of the card.  The maximum client can get up to 6% of the Multicard account.  The interest rate depends on the number of purchases made: if the expense exceeds 75,000 rubles, the bank sets the best conditions - 6% per annum for the balance.  When spending no more than 15,000 rubles, only 1% is available to the client in the form of a reward from the issuer. </p>
