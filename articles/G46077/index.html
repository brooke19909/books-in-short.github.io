There is probably no country in the world in which such a diversity of historical monuments and architectural values ‚Äã‚Äãis concentrated.  Every city here is an open-air museum, I want to study it, get to know it, plunge into the everyday atmosphere and come back again.  This time in our article we will talk about one of the most famous cities in Italy. </p><p>  Naples sights can surprise even the most experienced travelers.  This city is fundamentally different from the rest, only here the local dialect has gained great popularity, which almost every Neapolitan speaks.  Naples is also full of surprises - in its vicinity you can easily remain without documents and jewelry.  So that every tourist has a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat to do in this beautiful city, let's get acquainted with the main attractions of Naples and the surrounding area. </p><h2>  Volcano Vesuvius </h2><p>  Of course, to start a conversation about important places that should be on the must see list of every tourist, should be from the famous volcano Vesuvius.  The active volcano of the Apennine Mountains system proudly rises above the city and is an important attraction of Naples.  To date, there are over 80 references to the eruptions of the volcano Vesuvius, but the largest, which claimed thousands of lives, occurred in 79.  Several cities immediately plunged into darkness from ash and lava.  As you know, tourism in Italy is an important financial component of the country, so the authorities always try to organize the best conditions for vacationers.  Several attempts were made to equip specialized lifts to the volcano, but as a result of regular eruptions, structures were repeatedly destroyed.  Today, there is only one way - to go up the hiking trail to the top of Vesuvius. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ezmediart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volcano Vesuvius" class="if uuid-2359645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359645.jpg"></div><h2>  Pompeii.  Naples landmark.  Photo and description </h2><p>  When it comes to climbing the crater of the volcano Vesuvius, all tourists must visit the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.  It was he who was completely buried under the ashes as a result of the strongest volcanic eruption in 79, which we already mentioned above.  Excavations of the completely destroyed territory began in the 18th century.  Now Pompeii is a full-fledged museum complex with those exhibits that have been excavated from under the ashes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siviaggia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ancient city of Pompeii" class="if uuid-2359647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359647.jpg"></div><h2>  Herculaneum </h2><p>  Herculaneum is the same ancient city as Pompeii, damaged by the eruption of the volcano.  Most of the population managed to escape, but the city itself suffered serious damage.  It should be noted that many buildings and architecture of that time were well preserved as a result of solidification of lava.  Herculaneum is an important tourist destination today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Piazza del Plebiscito </h2><p>  If you have ever been to Italy, you probably know that the word ‚Äúpiazza‚Äù can be found here at every step.  So, in translation from Italian it is - the area.  Piazza del Plebiscito is a central place in Naples, located within walking distance of the city port.  This square gathered around itself the important buildings of the Middle Ages and the New Age.  The square got its name in 1860, at that moment a referendum was held for entry into the province of Piedmont. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.italyguides.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Naples main square" class="if uuid-2359656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359656.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  The building has a magnificent name, since various crowned persons regularly stayed here.  The Royal Palace acted as a residence for high society.  In 1837, the palace building was seriously damaged, but was subsequently reconstructed.  The facade of the palace is decorated with statues of famous Neapolitan rulers, and the library of Victor Emanuel III is located in a separate palace wing. </p><h2>  Basilica of naples </h2><p>  The Basilica of San Francesco di Paola is made in the neoclassical style of the sample of the XIX century.  The temple was built during the reign of Ferdinand I and is dedicated to St. Francis.  According to the king, it was he who helped recapture the lands captured by the French.  If you look closely at the facade of the building, you can find out in it the outlines of the Roman Pantheon, which served as a kind of model at the time of the construction of the basilica.  If anything can be considered the main attraction of Naples, then this is the church of St. Francesco. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.shoppingviaggi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica of San Francesco di Paola" class="if uuid-2359652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359652.jpg"></div><h2>  Capella San Severo </h2><p>  Previously, the San Severo chapel acted as a private church belonging to the then influential family.  The first duke of their family built a tomb in honor of the Madonna for a miraculous cure for a serious illness.  The interior of the San Severo Chapel captivates the eye of every tourist.  Until the middle of the 18th century, the chapel served as the temple of the Society of Free Masons. </p><h2>  Umberto I Gallery </h2><p>  What comes to mind first when it comes to Milan?  Of course, most of the travelers represent the famous <span>Duomo Cathedral</span> and the no less magnificent Milan gallery of Victor Emanuel.  But what if they tell you about the existence of a double of the original gallery in Milan, which is also located in Naples?  And indeed, on a Neapolitan land is a 19th-century shopping arcade, created according to the Milanese pattern.  This is the rare case when a copy has surpassed the original version.  Umberto I Gallery is an important attraction of Naples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.21secolo.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Umberto I Gallery" class="if uuid-2359658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359658.jpg"></div><h2>  Castle Castell Nuovo </h2><p>  The palace was built by order of Karl of Anjou, but the monarch was not able to settle in it, because he was killed during the uprising.  Today the castle is an important tourist destination, and is also included in the heading ‚ÄúWhat to watch in 1 day?‚Äù  Naples attraction attracts with its majestic views, and also combines a sense of the impregnability of this building and the luxury of a royal residence.  The castle acted as a haven for the Spaniards and the French, and also once visited the hands of a Russian squadron.  Tourists come here to visit the museum and at the same time the headquarters of the historical community. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liberopensiero.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castel Nuovo in Naples" class="if uuid-2359664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359664.jpg"></div><h2>  Fontanelle Cemetery </h2><p>  In Naples, you can not only admire the beautiful, but also the terrible.  On the slopes of the Materdey hill, there is a whole church vault, which attracts many tourists from all over the world.  The first burials were made here at the beginning of the XVII century, since during the period of the plague epidemic, about a hundred people died daily.  Later, the Fontanelle cemetery was used to bury the homeless and the poor.  Beginning in 1837, the cemetery acquired the status of an abandoned one, later it began to be ennobled, and today tourists are allowed here. </p><h2>  Gulf of Naples </h2><p>  Tourists come to Italy not only to enjoy the greatest architectural heritage, but also magnificent beaches.  <span>The Gulf of Naples</span> is one of the most visited seaside resorts in the country.  Holidays on the Tyrrhenian Sea, washing the west coast of Italy, have long been very popular and in demand among tourists.  The most popular places for a beach holiday are considered to be the <span>islands of Ischia</span> and Capri.  In addition, from the shores of the Gulf of Naples offers spectacular views of the city, the famous volcano Vesuvius and other attractions of Naples.  Reviews of tourists say that this is one of the most beautiful embankments in the whole of Italy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viaggi.corriere.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Naples Embankment" class="if uuid-2359669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359669.jpg"></div><h2>  Castell del Ovo Castle </h2><p>  A powerful coastal fortification, majestically rising on the edge of the city at the foot of the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Geographically, the fortress is located on a small island, but at a great distance it resembles a full-fledged cruiser.  At first, the construction served as the villa of the Roman commander, but after it was reconstructed and the walls were fortified in case of an attack from the sea.  Further, the building served as a shelter for the monks, and after the castle was adapted for prison.  Photos of Naples attractions are presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="convivium.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castell del Ovo Castle" class="if uuid-2359650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359650.jpg"></div><h2>  City museums </h2><p>  The next stop in exploring this magnificent city will be museums.  There are two popular places in Naples: the Museum of Fine Arts and the Archaeological Museum.  The first contains the most extensive collection of Titanium.  An interesting fact is that most of the collection was collected by the Farese family, whose native is Pope Paul III.  In order to fit all the work of Michelangelo and Titian, in the XVIII century a separate palace was built. </p><p>  The Neapolitan Archaeological Museum boasts a variety of specimens from the excavations of Herculaneum, Pompeii and Stabia.  Initially, the building, which was later given over to the museum, acted as a university, then a private collection of the Bourbons and Farnese, as well as the royal library were moved here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ilpaese.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archaeological Museum of Naples" class="if uuid-2359672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2359672.jpg"></div><h2>  Cathedral of st january </h2><p>  Saint Januarius is considered the patron of Naples, therefore, they could not do without the construction of a temple in his honor.  Tourists are attracted by the cathedral not only because many unique paintings of the 14th century were preserved inside the chapel, but also the main relic that the walls of the temple keep - a vessel with the frozen blood of a saint.  The Italians have their own ritual: three times a year, when a large enough number of believers gather, the blood again becomes temporarily liquid. </p><h2>  Santa chiara </h2><p>  The place of Santa Chiara is a full-fledged religious complex, named after St. Clara of Assisi.  The territory has two zones: a monastery, as well as a museum and the tomb of the rulers.  As a result of the reconstruction of the complex, baroque became the predominant style in architecture.  Just like the Neapolitan opera, the Santa Chiara complex was badly damaged by bombing during the hostilities.  Ten years later, she was able to completely restore and restore the original appearance. </p><h2>  Visa application </h2><p>  An Italian visa is in great demand among Russian tourists.  Recall that Italy is part of the Schengen Agreement.  Thus, if you are the proud owner of this Schengen, you can freely travel to all European countries, with the exception of the UK. </p><p>  You can apply for a visa directly at the Consulate General of Italy, the visa center or through travel agencies, in the latter case, the cost of the visa will increase significantly.  It is also worth noting the fact that Italians are very loyal to issuing permits to enter the country for a long period of a year.  So you have every chance to enjoy the beautiful city of Naples and other picturesque places. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Naples Airport is located right in the city because of the terrain, so getting from it to the city is not difficult.  Our country has a well-established air service with Italy, but despite this fact, there are no direct flights from Moscow.  Typically, all companies flying to Italy from Russia make connections in Rome, Paris or Amsterdam. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In today's article, we tried to acquaint readers in detail with each of the main attractions of Naples in Italy.  Photos and descriptions of places that should be visited by every tourist, you will be able to find above.  We hope that the information was most useful to you, dear readers.
