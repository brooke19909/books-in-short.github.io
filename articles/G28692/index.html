At the same time, culture arose.  At that time, the communities were small.  Their organization was the most primitive.  Like life.  Therefore, sometimes the <span>lifestyle of a person of</span> that period is called primitive.  Initially, cavemen were engaged in gathering and hunting, making stone devices for themselves for these purposes.  In such communities, equality of rights and duties prevailed, and class discrimination was absent.  Relations were built on the basis of <span>family ties.</span> <br><br>  According to scientists, the caveman appeared about 2.5 million years ago as a result of the evolution of Australopithecus.  The main difference is the beginning of stone processing and the creation of primitive tools from it.  With such tools, cavemen cut branches, butchered carcasses after hunting, chopped bones, dug roots from the ground.  According to the classification of such people, it is customary to call a skilled person.  Their abilities were limited by movement on their feet and the ability to hold a stone and a stick, with minimal logical actions for the manufacture of simple tools for hunting.  The groups were small.

    <p>  About one million years <span>BC,</span> a pithecanthropus appeared, a monkey man.  His brain size was significantly larger than that of <span>homo habilis.</span>  Accordingly, he was able to manufacture more complex tools.  For example, scrapers, chopped regular geometric shapes.  However, the functions of the tools remained the same: digging, planing, hunting and carving the results of hunting.  The beginning of the Ice Age significantly influenced the life and adaptation to natural disasters of cavemen.  Man adapted to life in many climatic zones and zones, and scientists find traces of the Pithecanthropus in areas of Europe, Northern China and Africa.  These signs say that the geography of habitat has expanded significantly.  The emergence of land zones contributed to the migration of <span>ancient people</span> due to lower levels of the oceans. </p><h2>  How cavemen used to live </h2><p>  Pithecanthropus often built its housing near water sources.  The cave man already understood that the sources of water are the habitat of animals and, therefore, the source of food.  A significant number of dangers forced people to gather in large groups to ensure safety, as well as facilitate hunting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The life of a caveman.

    <p>  Neanderthal appeared 250 thousand years ago.  Homo sapiens evolved from Pithecanthropus as a result of environmental influences and the development of work skills.  This stage of human development was named in honor of the valley in which his remains were first found.  Outwardly, he already had a great resemblance to modern man.  A low forehead, a gross physique, a sloping chin - these are the main distinguishing features with which this caveman stood out.  Photos modeled on the basis of the remains provide all the strength and power that these creatures possessed. </p><p>  Neanderthals massively populated areas such as the south of Europe, Asia, and Africa.  The main dwelling was caves.  Often the cave had to be beaten off by bears that came there in hibernation.  The power of the cave people is also indicated by the fact that they could kill these large animals, whose length sometimes reached three meters.  Massive remains of bear bones were found in caves of many European countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland and others. </p><h2>  The mental development of a caveman </h2><p>  Since the mental abilities of Neanderthals were higher than that of the Pithecanthropus, the tools also improved significantly.  Workmanship has improved significantly.  Also, the form has become more regular and diverse.  The technique of processing stone material has accelerated.  The main achievement of Neanderthals was the ability to make fire. </p><p>  The high level of mental development of cavemen is evidenced by the fact that the tools found in different parts of the world were different from each other.  That is, their development took place independently in different regions.  As scientists suggest, in the same period there are racial differences between people.  Also changing the physical data of ancient people, which directly depend on the region of their habitat. </p>

    <p>  The cultural level of cavemen also increased.  In groups, relationships become stronger.  There is an understanding of generational change.  And, therefore, Neanderthals begin to bury the dead with the help of primitive rites.  Often burials were carried out in caves.  Separate attitude of people of that time was to skulls.  Their burials were carried out in special pits, probably due to some beliefs or everyday attitudes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how cavemen used to live" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/828612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unlike pithecanthropus, Homo sapiens did not abandon the sick and destitute.  Probably, people of that time already obtained much more food than was necessary for survival.  Consequently, it became possible to contain dependents. </p><h2>  Ceremonies </h2><p>  Found artifacts of the time say that Neanderthals performed some rites.  So, in several caves, <span>skulls of bears</span> were found <span>,</span> arranged in a certain order.  Such an installation is very similar to an altar for religious ceremonies. </p>
