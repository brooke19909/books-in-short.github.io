This also affected fashion.  Thanks to the events of that time, today we see women in trousers and bathing suits, which was once completely unacceptable, but, I wonder, what fashionable ‚Äúupheavals‚Äù took place at the very beginning of the 20th century? </p><h2>  Fashion features at the beginning of the 20th century </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  By the beginning of the 20th century, the same fashion features remained as at the end of the 19th century.  <span>Women's clothing</span> was not quite comfortable.  By this time, the young ladies wore dresses to the floor, were still fashionable high hats and hairstyles, heavy fur coats.  Ladies, until the turn of the century, still wore low, uncomfortable corsets, which could reach a girth of 45 centimeters at the waist and could thereby destroy health, which was the last straw before giving up this attribute of clothing.  It was necessary to change something, and by that time many changes in fashion had just begun to occur. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian fashion at the beginning of the 20th century" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/1826099.jpg" width="272"></div>  The very first years of the 20th century still retained the echoes of the end of the previous century.  Designers followed the Art Nouveau style, which dominated art.  The woman presented herself as a very feminine, airy and non-earthly creature.

    <h2>  Women's fashion at the beginning of the 20th century </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  But still, some innovations began to appear at the very beginning in 1900.  Whereas earlier women wore dresses that were A-shaped, in the first decade they were replaced by outfits that were more adjacent to the hips.  And uncomfortable corsets with a low waist were replaced by soft corsets with a high waist, and then completely ceased to be used.  Also, until 1906, sleeves very wide from above were popular, which narrowed to the elbows and to the wrist.  Such changes have changed the way women look. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  A very long fashion for the hourglass, which consisted of lush hips, a very narrow waist and a lush chest, the kind of women tried to achieve with the help of clothes, was replaced by a more ‚Äúrectangular‚Äù and simplified silhouette.  Inconvenient, and sometimes sacrificial beauty, was replaced each time by practicality and convenience, so the beautiful half of humanity met innovations with absolute support and interest.  By the second half of the decade, after the disappearance of the corset, the waist was emphasized with ribbons.  Long dresses to the floor shortened to the ankles. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  Fashion designers have greatly simplified the silhouette of clothing for women, making it more straightforward.  Dresses were already sewn with a wide waist or completely fitted. </p>

The motorcycle veil worn when driving a car, and the boater hat for cycling, for playing tennis and much more have also gained popularity. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  Fashion has changed for women's bags.  At the beginning of the century, small handbags were still worn, but after a few years they became larger and more spacious. <br><br>  Particular emphasis was placed on the hat.  Ladies liked to wear models with wide brim with a variety of jewelry in the form of feathers, ribbons, beads.  A hat is an essential accessory of any fashionista.  Towards the end of the century, hats were in fashion with fields hanging downwards covering a little of the face. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fashion early 20th century photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/1828998.jpg" width="364"></div>  The shoes were narrow with low heels and were also decorated with ribbons and various buttons.

In other words, jewelry has become simpler and more restrained. </p><h2>  Hairstyles and makeup </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  There was an aristocratic pallor in fashion, which the girls tried to emphasize as much as possible with the help of powder and all kinds of skin whitening agents (for example, lemon juice).  Makeup was applied to a minimum.  Lipsticks were used, but the color was supposed to be quite dim.  Eyes were emphasized by a small amount of shadows.  Bright makeup was considered bad form. <br><br>  The hairstyle called the "Marseilles wave", which was invented by Marcel Gratot, was very fashionable.  With the help of hot tongs, a neat wave was made on the hair. <br><br>  Thanks to silent cinema, short haircuts became fashionable in 1909, and their popularity lasted long thanks to the First World War, when women, helping the wounded in hospitals, simply could not care for their hair. <br><br>  The beginning of the last century gave the world now known to everyone hairstyles - "square" and "garzon". </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  But long hair was in fashion along with short hair.  Girls loved loose curls (straight or curled) to collect from behind in a knot. </p><h2>  Children's fashion </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  Girls of that time wore dresses to the knees in the same way as in adult women, which very much resembled nightdresses with their trim.  For the convenience of games, sleeves appeared on the elbows on the dresses.  And as shoes they wore black shoes or boots with buttons or sheathed with lace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  They also wore wool stockings or leggings and gloves. </p>

It still remained conservative and comfortable to wear.  Men wore trousers, tailcoats, long coats, which remains universal even today.  Large long-fur coats made of animal hair, which were often worn in the winter in the second half of the 19th century, the fashion of which went along with the "gold rush", also went out of fashion. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  <span>Tailcoats, tuxedos, and</span> butterflies were worn at formal and gala events. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  In this sense, the English king of those times, Edward 7 was considered an icon of the style of men's fashion in the early 20th century.  It is assumed that he introduced fashion for <span>arrows on trousers</span> and upside down. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the silhouette of clothes has become universal for all classes: for workers, for the rich.  But, accordingly, the clothes differed only in the quality of the fabric and tailoring. <br><br>  Hats and top hats remained in fashion, however, the so-called bowler hat, which was worn along with everyday attire, came into men's attributes. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  The man‚Äôs hair was cut mostly short.

    <h2>  Great couturiers </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  Jacques Doucet wanted to become an artist, but when his parents died, he inherited the business of selling underwear.  Thus, having connected himself with this body, at the beginning of the last century he revived the production given to him as an inheritance to the most important fashion house in Paris and thanks to him the world saw many beautiful outfits.  He also helped a lot to become famous for fashion designers such as Paul Poiret and <span>Madeleine Vionne.</span> </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630822" data-peer="158934843">  A significant contribution to the history of fashion was made by the former merchant of umbrellas - the already mentioned Paul Poiret, who later became a great designer.  It was he who simplified the dresses by removing the lining petticoat and corset in them.  And it was he who shortened the skirts to the ankles.  The designer also greatly decorated the outerwear, because before him, with all her quality, she did not differ in variety.  <span>Paul Poiret</span> released a collection of coats in the Slavic style, which differed in styles and differed in the beauty of patterns, decorations. </p>

    <p>  Jeanne Pakin is the first female couturier.  She, together with her husband Isidore Paken, created the Fashion House, which has unprecedented success.  The outfits of her collections were worn by fashionistas around the world. </p><h2>  Russian fashion at the beginning of the 20th century </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  What happened to clothes in the Slavic world of those times?  Women's fashion at the beginning of the 20th century in Russia fell under the significant influence of the Art Nouveau style and as a whole underwent almost the same changes as in Europe.  The silhouette with a narrow waist, but with a magnificent chest, changed to a more rectangular and more tight-fitting one. <br><br>  Fashion magazines such as "Latest Fashion", "Paris Fashion" were popular.  There were even famous Russian fashion houses.  There are many photos of the early 20th century.  Fashion in the Russian Empire kept pace with world fashion. <br><br>  But in addition to the influence of Europe, Russian fashion was significantly affected by Japanese trends due to the Russo-Japanese war.  This is especially noticeable in the hairstyles of fashionistas, who, thanks to their hair, tried to create a high, magnificent lift on the head like hairstyles of Japanese geishas. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  Even the fashion of Russian women differed from the European one in more vivid and diverse colors.  Dresses were quite colored, in contrast to the restrained colors of European outfits.  They still had more decor than western ones.  Dresses could be sewn with a cross, stitch, a large number of lace and many others. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  Furs remained popular.  Ladies often wore couplings in the winter. <br><br>  It is worth mentioning famous personalities who contributed to the Russian fashion.  For example, a Frenchman by birth Rene Brisac created the most famous Fashion house in St. Petersburg.  And Olga Bulbenkova created a workshop where luxurious dresses were made, where even the dresses of the empresses of that time were sewn.  There were many more fashion designers in the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  The beginning of the twentieth century entailed significant changes in fashion.  The heaviness and closeness of the outfits have been replaced by simplicity and lightness.  Ladies stopped wearing uncomfortable corsets, dresses became shorter, lighter, tight-fitting, with a less pronounced waist, but remained the same feminine and beautiful in modern style.  Even jewelry was simplified, but the decor of dresses and hats remained very diverse and interesting: various lace, beads, feathers, ribbons. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a peak when large fashion houses and great designers became famous all over the world, who struck fashionistas from around the world with their collections and outfits. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  Russian fashion adopted a lot from European, but European fashion also took a lot from Russian.  For example, coats sheathed in the Slavic style. </p><p data-ts="1497238628" data-msgid="630823" data-peer="158934843">  Significant changes took place, followed by subsequent fashionable ‚Äúrevolutions‚Äù of the 20th century, thanks to which in our days we see clothes as they are: simple and comfortable. </p>
