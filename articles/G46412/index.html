  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get root rights on Android?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A lot of users of Android smartphones faced the need to obtain root rights.  Not everyone knows how to do this.  There are different instructions on the Internet and on forums, but they are far from suitable for all phone models.  Today I would like to talk about several fairly simple and, most importantly, safe ways to get Root rights on an Android smartphone. </p><h2>  Why Root? </h2><p>  Before we get to the point, it‚Äôs worth a little talk about why, in general, Root rights are needed and what is the use of them. </p><p>  Firstly, with the help of root-rights, you can remove any unnecessary system programs from your smartphone that take up extra space and are of no use.  For smartphones whose memory capacity is not too large, this will be an absolute plus. </p><p>  Secondly, root-rights allow you to use many useful and necessary programs.  Take, for example, the well-known Titanium backup application, which allows you to create backup copies so that they can be restored later if necessary.  So, Titanium backup only works with root rights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="root apps" class="if uuid-2285142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285142.jpg"></div><p>  The third and, perhaps, the last - root-rights allow you to edit and replace system files in every possible way, install third-party or custom firmware as they are called, block ads on your smartphone, configure power consumption and much much more.  Ruth gives full control to the user over the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But, in addition to all the advantages, there are several disadvantages.  The first is that in most cases, users who install Root rights on their smartphones lose their warranty.  For some, this can be very important.  The second minus is that users, due to their carelessness and carelessness, often turn their smartphones into ‚Äúbricks‚Äù.  In other words, the devices stop turning on and reanimating them from this state is very difficult. </p><p>  However, at the moment, the procedure for obtaining root rights has become much easier and safer, so it‚Äôs not worth worrying. </p><h2>  Root rights through applications </h2><p>  The easiest, safest and most effective way to obtain root rights today is through special applications.  There are a lot of them, but here are really good, working and well-written, not more than a dozen.  Below we have selected some of the most effective programs that will help you get Root rights to Android in one click. </p><h2>  Root master </h2><p>  So, the first application on the list is Root Master.  This program has been released for quite some time, but, unfortunately, in 2015 its final version was released and since then there have been no more updates.  Nevertheless, Root Master allows you to install the root in one click on almost all smartphones released before 2016 and for which the firmware version does not exceed 4.4. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidguys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="root master application" class="if uuid-2285152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285152.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, on some devices running "Android 5.0", Root Master also works, but it all depends on the manufacturer and model of the phone.  For devices with OS version 5.1, 6.0 and 7.0, it is better to put another program from the list below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A big plus of Root Master is that at the end of the procedure, it installs the SuperSU application, with which you can issue permission to use root rights for third-party programs. </p><h2>  Framaroot </h2><p>  The next program in the list to obtain Root rights is Framaroot.  Despite the fact that the latest application update was released in 2014, Framaroot is still popular.  It allows you to get root-rights in many smartphones with the version of the Android operating system 2.0-4.2 in just 1 click.  In some cases, operability is also possible on OS version 4.4.  A huge plus of the application is that it supports a lot of devices with different processors, from Snapdragon to Mediatek. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidmag.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="framaroot application" class="if uuid-2285210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285210.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting the presence of the Russian language, the ability to install an additional application for working with access to root rights (SuperSU or Superuser), the ability to completely remove the root and much more.  On the official forums of the program there are many instructions for working with the application, as well as if it did not work.  There is also a complete list of supported devices. </p><h2>  Kingoroot </h2><p>  Kingoroot is already a more modern program, which is actively supported by developers.  With this application, you can get Root-rights to the "Android" version 2.0-5.1.  Also, for some users, the program works fine on newer versions of the OS - 6.0 and 7.0. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the list of supported devices, it is simply huge.  Kingoroot works great on smartphones of all famous brands, as well as little-known ones, for example, XOLO, Konka, Cloudphone, Wiko, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thegeektab.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kingoroot app" class="if uuid-2285212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285212.jpg"></div><p>  To obtain Root rights through Kingoroot, just click on one button and accept the user agreement, the program will do the rest.  Very important: to work you need an Internet connection to download some necessary files.  Upon completion, Kingoroot installs a special KingoUser program in the smartphone - this is an analogue of SuperSU, only of its own design. </p><h2>  Baidu root </h2><p>  Another program for obtaining Root rights on Android smartphones is Baidu Root.  It, like the first two applications, was last updated a long time ago - in 2015, therefore, full-fledged work is guaranteed only on versions of the operating system up to 4.4, all of the above will not work. </p><p>  The list of supported devices is also not very large.  The application works fine on many models of well-known brands, but often with problems with little-known ones.  Owners of HTC smartphones need to unlock the bootloader for proper operation, otherwise the probability of success is small. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thebestfivesite.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baidu root application" class="if uuid-2285214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285214.jpg"></div><p>  The main language of Baidu Root is Chinese, but on one well-known site there is a version partially translated into Russian.  Getting root rights is carried out in one click.  After completing the procedure, you must install the SuperSU application yourself, since Baidu Root does not install it.  Before use, it is highly advisable to read the instructions for the application. </p><h2>  360 root </h2><p>  The 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãRoot app is another good option on how to get Root rights on your phone.  The last update of the program was last summer, but despite this, 360 Root supports more than 500 brands of smartphone manufacturers and about 9,000 models. </p><p>  According to the developer, the application allows you to get 100% result on operating systems, starting with version 1.6 and ending with 5.1.  Performance on 6.0 and 7.0 is not guaranteed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wolfted.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="360 root application" class="if uuid-2285234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285234.jpg"></div><p>  Rooting a device is done all in the same way with one click.  The user just needs to click on the button and accept the agreement.  360 Root has one drawback - it does not allow you to install and does not work fully with the SuperSU application.  Thus, not all third-party programs that need root access can be used. </p><h2>  iRoot </h2><p>  An excellent solution to how to get Root rights on Android is the iRoot program.  Its base of supported devices totals about 8000 models from all known and not so brands.  The version of the operating system on which the application is running is Android 2.3-5.1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dobreprogramy.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iroot application computer version" class="if uuid-2285216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285216.jpg"></div><p>  You can get root rights via iRoot in just 1 click.  In addition to the mobile version, there is also a program for the computer.  To root a smartphone through a PC, you just need to connect it via a USB cable, and then click on the corresponding button in the program. </p><h2>  Kingroot </h2><p>  The latest Root app on today's list is Kingroot.  First of all, do not confuse this application with Kingoroot.  The names are alike, but the functionality is completely different.  Kingroot is perhaps the best and most effective rooting app available today.  Its base includes over 10 thousand phone models, and also supports more than 40 thousand version of different firmware. </p><p>  Kingroot allows you to get Root-rights to 7.0 and 6.0 versions of "Android", which is not so simple.  Of course, not all devices can boast of success, but each time the program is improved, and the base is replenished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beste-apps.chip.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kingroot app" class="if uuid-2285217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285217.jpg"></div><p>  Among the interesting features of Kingroot, it is worth noting the presence of two versions - mobile and PC.  The developer advises using the mobile version, as its functionality is much better and the chance of success is higher.  Also, the application allows you to get root-rights even on those smartphones that have a locked bootloader or no recovery. </p><p>  The only minus of Kingroot is that after the procedure, KingUser is installed in the system - this is an analogue of SuperSU, only much worse.  Users recommend immediately, after rutting, download, install and run the Super-Sume application.  It automatically replaces KingUser with SuperSU, thereby eliminating the disadvantage. </p><h2>  How to get Root rights on Xiaomi and Meizu </h2><p>  Unfortunately, applications do not always get root-rights.  For example, Xiaomi and Meizu smartphones have their own system, which is also worth talking about. </p><p>  In order to get root-rights on Meizu smartphones, you need to go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, then to the section ‚ÄúFingerprints and security‚Äù.  At the very bottom there will be a ‚ÄúRoot Access‚Äù item, in which you just need to check the box, click the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button and enter the password for your Meizu account account.  After that, the phone will reboot and root-rights will be active in it.  For greater convenience, it is recommended to install the SuperSU application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="getting root access to meizu" class="if uuid-2285219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2285219.jpg"></div><p>  As for Xiaomi smartphones, then everything is somewhat more complicated.  To get root rights, you must first unlock the bootloader.  Models released before 2015 do not need this procedure. </p><p>  Then you should <span>install TWRP recovery.</span>  This is necessary in order to be able to flash a special archive that will establish root-rights to the smartphone.  In order not to bore the boring text, it is proposed to look at this video, in which everything is explained in great detail. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="2Cy_hyBKftY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cy_hyBKftY" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/1/6/1016.jpg"></div><p>  You can find the files you need, as well as instructions on the forums dedicated to a specific smartphone model or on the Russian-speaking Xiaomi communities.  There you can ask other users for help in case of problems - they will be happy to help. </p>
