So let's get started. </p><p>  The appearance of the Sony Tablet Z in the Xperia line was not a surprise.  It was only a matter of time.  Inspired by the success of sales of the recently released smartphone Sony <span>Xperia Z,</span> which was able to compete with popular flagships, the Japanese company clearly defined the following task for itself. </p><h2>  Appearance: thin and stylish </h2><p>  The developers awarded the Sony Xperia Tablet Z tablets with excellent looks.  Exactly the same as the previous smartphone.  The device is a rectangle with smooth edges, without rounding, which can be seen from other manufacturers.  The rigor of the design indicates that Sony developers still have ideas, and not bad. </p>

Indeed, with a weight of 495 grams, its thickness is only 7 mm.  It is pleasant to feel the softness of the Soft Touch plastic from which the back cover of the tablet computer is made.  Only in the process of using it fingerprints actively accumulate on it.  Although this is typical only black models.  The front side is covered with glass, on which there is a protective film glued back at the factory.  Traces of touches on it also remain, but appear only with time.

It can be seen that everything possible has been done so that he does not creak or play.  The plugs sit tight, the probability of their accidental opening is excluded.  And this is understandable, because it is assumed that the Sony Xperia tablet is waterproof. </p><p>  The bundle in which the device is sold can hardly be called rich.  It includes: USB cable, charger and user manual.  That's all, they didn‚Äôt even put the headset on.  The smartphone is more fortunate in this. </p><h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  As already mentioned, all the connectors located on the ends of the <span>tablet are protected by</span> plugs.  They are marked on them so that the purpose of each hole is understood.  All buttons have a comfortable placement and are pressed gently. </p>

    <p>  Above are an <span>infrared port</span> and a microphone.  Below are placed speakers, slots for a SIM card and memory card, as well as a hole for a USB port.  The left end is richer than the rest on the connectors.  There is a button to turn on and lock the device, a speaker, an audio output, a charging sensor, a volume rocker and a place for a docking station.  On the right side is another speaker. </p><p>  Interestingly, only two speakers are built into the Sony Xperia Tablet Z tablets, but there are four outputs for them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The ten-inch TFT-display of the device turned out well.  The smartphone could not boast of this.  The main advantage here is Full HD resolution (224 ppi).  The second point is a quality matrix.  Despite the fact that the abbreviation IPS is not present in the list of characteristics, expert opinions boil down to the fact that it is practically it. </p>

    <p>  The colors are bright and saturated.  Black pleases, it looks like a real one.  The Sony Xperia Tablet Z display should be grateful to the Bravia Engine 2 technology for excellent performance. The effect is especially noticeable when watching movies and photos. </p><p>  According to the technical documentation, the screen has <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  But it does not fulfill its main function.  The screen gets dirty instantly, but it does not clean well. </p><p>  If you use the Sony Xperia tablet indoors, there are no complaints about brightness.  But direct sunlight significantly complicates viewing, as the display is very glare.  But this is a problem for many smartphones and tablet computers. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Tablet Z: specifications </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the time of release, the characteristics of the device allowed it to be one of the most powerful on the market.  To make it clear, there is a quad-core Snapdragon with a frequency of 1.5 GHz, an Andreno 320 adapter responsible for graphics, and a module with 2 GB of RAM.  The company releases two versions of the tablet: Sony Xperia Tablet Z 16gb and 32gb.  All this gives the device good performance. </p>

    <p>  The indicators that the device achieves in popular test programs explain the fact that the tablet easily copes with the most demanding applications.  But there is a possibility of strong heating of the device, since the launch of some games, such as Real Racing 3, already led to this.  Although lags and brakes were still not noticed. </p>

    <h2>  Useful programs </h2><p>  Although the tablet is running OS Android Jelly Bean, it has its own shell - convenient and visually attractive.  Some applications can be called instantly, even if the device is locked. </p><p>  Among the useful programs are: Office Suite, a traditional Walkman player, a navigation tool, a Chrome browser, a file manager and an application for managing all kinds of digital technology. <strong> </strong></p><p>  It is also important to highlight the Smart Connect program.  This is the official application from Sony, which is not only worthy of the tablet.  The phone is not deprived of them either.  The program makes it possible to assign a specific action that will be performed when accessories and other devices are connected to the tablet computer.  The SC application not only recognizes devices, but also time. </p><h2>  Tablet features </h2><p>  Like other modern Android devices, Sony Xperia Tablet Z tablets are not without GPS navigation. </p><p>  The joint work of the built-in infrared port and a special program allows you to remotely control televisions, air conditioners, video projectors and other types of devices.  It turns out something like a universal remote control.  If you read the reviews, we can conclude that the function works perfectly. </p><p>  By the way, an FM module is built in here, which many similar gadgets cannot boast of. </p><p>  There is also an interesting ‚Äútablet-phone‚Äù function, with which you can display a picture from the device on the smartphone screen.  This allows you to manage incoming calls. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the device has received compatibility with SP 3, i.e., you can connect a joystick from the console to it.  True, sometimes there are problems with this, but in GTA Vice City you can definitely play. </p><p>  As for the inclusion of Sony Xperia Tablet Z 16gb and 32gb, it can be configured so that to unlock it will be enough just to tap on it. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  The presence of plugs on the holes around the perimeter of the device indicates that it is protected from dust and moisture.  Appropriate standards allow the tablet to hold on to a depth of up to 1 meter for several minutes.  Thus, you can safely use it while lying in the bathroom or on the beach by the sea, without worrying that something will happen to him.  Compared to other similar devices, this moment puts a cut above Sony Xperia Tablet Z. The price of them is almost the same, but there is no such protection. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There are two cameras in the device: 8-megapixel main and 2-pixel front.  The first uses Exmor R technology and supports HDR shooting.  By the number and type of settings, it is no different from the cameras of smartphones.  The shooting quality is not bad, but at the moment there are models that in this regard are significantly superior to the Tablet Z. The camera transmits natural colors, focus can be set according to the mark on the screen. </p><p>  Movies are shot in Full HD format.  During this, you can take pictures, but they will significantly lose in quality. </p><p>  And, of course, the front camera.  Her settings are similar, and the video is shot in the same format, which makes it almost ideal for video calls. </p><h2>  Music </h2><p>  From the moment the Walkman brand appeared, it became clear that Sony pays special attention to the sound in its devices.  And Sony Xperia Tablet Z tablets are no exception. </p>

    <p>  The developers claim that it supports S-Force technology, which makes the sound natural.  This is a merit of the audio system, which includes two speakers with four output channels.  So the sound does not just turn out loud, the stereo effect is well felt in it. </p><p>  There are other sound features.  For example, a mode that makes the sound three-dimensional.  Although few people will be pleased, after all, not everyone will notice this transformation.  But the Xloud mode is perfectly implemented, adjusting the frequencies so that the speakers do not wheeze. </p><p>  In general, the Walkman has many different settings.  There will not be any dissatisfied users.  Everyone will be able to choose the sound that suits him best. </p><h2>  Networking </h2><p>  The tablet computer is equipped with all the necessary network interfaces.  Technologies Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth, DLNA - all of them are present here.  There is also an infrared port and an MHL interface, which is used to transmit videos in HD quality. </p><p>  As for wireless communications, Sony Xperia Tablet Z LTE tablets and 3G versions differ.  Clear business, for the 4G module it is necessary to overpay.  A smartphone is equipped with it, and you can simply connect it to a tablet via a Wi-Fi network. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The Tablet Z tablet is a candy bar, which means the battery is not removable.  Therefore, it must be handled with care.
