A photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Kurgalsky Peninsula, located in the Leningrad Region, has unique natural resources, most of which are listed in the Red Book.  But not only the vegetation and wildlife are his pride.  Here, even the climate, albeit slightly, but differs - spring comes earlier, and summer is warmer and longer. </p><h2>  Peninsula Location </h2><p>  The Kurgalsky Peninsula is located in the southern part of the Gulf of Finland and separates two lips - Luga and Narva.  In the north of the peninsula there is Cape Pitkenen-Nos, in the south the Luga River flows.  Despite its small size, it can accommodate two lakes and even a mountain 43 meters high, and more than 40% of its area is protected by a state reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kurgan Peninsula" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1003647.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  The climate in this area is temperate marine, which means a fairly cool summer at an average temperature of +15 and relatively warm winter at 5 degrees below zero.  Due to the fact that a fairly large part of the land is under protection here, tourists have not yet flooded the Kurgalsky Peninsula.  You can find out how to get here for the rest by looking at the map.  The peninsula is located in Kingisepp district of the Leningrad region, just 120 km from St. Petersburg.  First you need to go along the Tallinn highway to Ust-Luga, and then 4 km to the north.  If you get by train, then from Warsaw station to Kingisepp, and then - by minibus to the reserve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the territory that is not included in the reserve, there are such settlements as Lipovo, Vybie, Ust-Luga, Island and others.  The indigenous population of the peninsula are representatives of the Finno-Ugric peoples (Izhora and Vodi). </p><h2>  Reserve </h2><p>  The reserve includes not only the mainland, where the Kingisepp district, the Kurgalsky peninsula, Lake Lipov is located, but also the small islands and the waters of the Gulf of Finland, the Luga and Narva Bay located around it, totaling 60 thousand hectares of protected state lands. </p><p>  On these wetlands there are not only 250 species of birds, some of which are listed in the Red Book, but also mammals, including seals and seals.  More than 700 plant species grow in these places, about 30 of which are considered endangered and rare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kurgan Peninsula Lipov Lake" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1003668.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <p>  The Kurgalsky Peninsula is a nesting site for peregrine falcons, golden eagles, black-throated loons, ringed seals and gray seals.  Among <span>waterfowl</span> there are swans, such as mute swarm, whooper, tundra, as well as geese, geese, <span>crested black,</span> mallards, pegans, turpans and many others. </p><p>  Founded in Soviet times, the reserve only in 2000 received regional significance.  In the old days, Heroes of the Soviet Union, honored cultural workers, scientists and veterans received plots on the peninsula.  Currently, in addition to the indigenous population, summer residents and relatives of those who received land for their services to the country live here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ecosystem preserved its characteristic ecosystem due to the fact that there are no nearby industrial enterprises, although a military training ground located on the southern side of the peninsula can be dangerous for its flora and fauna. </p><h2>  Peninsula vegetation </h2><p>  Most of the reserve's territory is occupied by forests, in which oaks, elms, maples, linden and ash grow.  Spruce and pine forests predominate on the sea side, and birch and aspen forests dominate in the swampy part. </p>

    <p>  On the islands located on the Kurgalsky reef, the Baltic chinton, tricolor violets, sandy beetle, Ruprecht's lamb, and many others grow.  Among the rare species there are <span>Swedish derain,</span> marsh waxwort, wild garlic, rhizome nodule, Dortmann lobelia and others. </p><p>  Among this vegetation, a large number of amphibians live - grass, muzzle and <span>lake frogs,</span> gray toads, newts, vipers, snakes and spindles.  The Kurgalsky Peninsula, the rest of which is allowed only in specially designated places, boasts a large number of berries and mushrooms, which are allowed to be collected by the population for personal needs. </p><h2>  Forest dwellers </h2><p>  Thanks to the closed territory of the forest, the reserve is full of animals.  Among 40 species of mammals, spotted and red deer occupy a special place, which were brought back in 1975 for breeding.  They have taken root well and are now an integral part of the state reserve. </p><p>  Also, the Kurgalsky Peninsula is famous for the fact that brown bears, roe deer and garden sleepyheads live here.  Among the birds there are such rare "celebrities" as a rockstone, dunlin, <span>river cricket,</span> and cegrave.  Many of the birds have nests here, but even more of them use the peninsula to rest before leaving for the winter quarters. </p><p>  Coastal areas have their own ecosystems other than forests. </p><h2>  <span>Lipovskoe Lake</span> (Kurgalsky Peninsula) </h2><p>  Small sea - this is what the locals call it.  This is due to the fact that a sufficiently large lake has salt water, since it is connected by a channel to the Gulf of Finland, from which water enters. </p>

Among them are perch, lamprey, pike, pikeperch, ide, roach and eel. </p><p>  The most protected territory of the reserve is its coastal zone, since it is here that on the stones rookery of seals and seals are located.

In designated areas, you can put up tents, make fires and cook food.  The pristine cleanliness and beauty of this place have a good effect on vacationers, since here they never leave trash, broken trees or trampled vegetation. </p><p>  The Kurgalsky Peninsula, Lipovskoye Lake in particular is a zone not yet developed by tourists, so its main guests are amateur fishermen, although Lake Beloe is no less famous for fishing. </p><h2>  Lake White </h2><p>  It is located in the middle of the Kurgalsky Peninsula and occupies only 3.2 square meters.  kilometers.  It is also famous for its abundance of fish, which attracts fishermen like a magnet.

    <p>  In the forests you can find wild boar, elk, fox and other animals familiar to the Leningrad region, but hunting in the reserve is prohibited.  The ecosystem of local bogs is very special. </p><h2>  Swamps of the Kurgalsky Peninsula </h2><p>  No wonder the big swamp has such a name.  This is a real complex consisting of marsh vegetation and a large number of animal species.  Among berry plants cloudberries, cranberries and blueberries prevail here.  Mosses growing here are sphagnum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kingisepp district Kurgan peninsula Lipov lake" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1003732.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Since the terrain of the peninsula was not subject to human activity to a greater extent, relic junipers and 96 other plant species that are classified as endangered have survived here. </p><h2>  Protection of the Kurgalsky Peninsula </h2><p>  Due to the fact that in 1975 a significant part of the peninsula was recognized as a unique ecosystem of international importance, the reserve established there became a closed territory for human activity. </p><p>  Since 2000, the importance of the reserve has become regional, so strict control over the few tourists ensures the survival of many plants, animals and birds.  Those wishing to spend outdoor recreation can do this in specially equipped places, and mushroom pickers, fishermen and lovers of berries are invited to the peninsula, subject to all the rules of conduct on its territory. </p>
