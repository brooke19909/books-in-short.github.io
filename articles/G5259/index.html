This wardrobe item looks spectacular at any time - morning or evening, winter or summer - it doesn‚Äôt matter!  Combines very simply with any style of clothing.  And how to sew a pleated skirt, you will learn from this article. </p><h2>  Pleating History </h2><p>  The history of wonderful pleated skirts is deeply rooted in the past.  The first thing of this type was created in Egypt in ancient times.  Queen Cleopatra was madly in love with dressing in clothes made of such a fabric.  Many millennia ago, this style of skirts was an exclusively masculine attribute.  Remember the Scottish kilt.  And only after a long time, this piece of clothing moved into the women's wardrobe. </p><p>  The creator of pleated dresses is Italian, designer M. Fortuni - more than 100 years ago he sewed this feminine skirt. </p><p>  In the twenties of the last century, their popularity began to grow rapidly and gain momentum.  We see this from old movies, remember at least Katherine Hepburn in Philadelphia Story or the famous <span>Marilyn Monroe dress.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sfgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="famous monroe skirt" class="if uuid-2626544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2626544.jpg"></div><p>  Until now, pleated skirts do not leave the pedestal of fashion, the variety of modifications is impressive.  Therefore, many are worried about how to sew a pleated skirt with their own hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pleated fabric at home </h2><p>  Firstly, to create such a skirt, we need fabric.  Of course, in our time of plenty in stores there is everything you need for this work.  However, matter is not always of good quality.  And try to make folds yourself according to the oldest method.  But, firstly, decide how to sew a pleated skirt: with wide or small folds, voluminous or narrower? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chadwicks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright summer skirt" class="if uuid-2626538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2626538.jpg"></div><p>  First, calculate the footage of the fabric.  It is equal to the thigh circumference multiplied by three.  Suppose our girth is 85 cm, respectively, we need a width of 2.6 m. Since the standard width of the roll is 1.5 m, then we buy a piece of fabric that is equal to: 2 skirt lengths + 15 cm for seams and for the belt.  For sewing a skirt, the length of which is 55 cm, you will need 1.25 m of fabric. </p><p>  In addition, we will need: </p><ul><li>  large sheets of thick paper (whatman); </li><li>  threads: </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  iron; </li><li>  rulers; </li><li>  pencils; </li><li>  gauze cut; </li><li>  soap, water, vinegar; </li><li>  needles </li><li>  sewing machine. </li></ul><p>  There is a very interesting creasing technique. </p><p>  We make blanks for the formation of folds - we fold the sheets together and mark the folds on paper along the length from two edges.  We attach a long ruler to the marking lines and use scissors to push, leaving the line.  We put the sheets in an accordion, put one into the other.  The entire structure is ironed through the marlechka.  The forms for the pleated turned out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Between them we place the material, be sure to fix it with needles so that it does not move.  Stroke through wet cheesecloth and leave to dry completely.  Gently remove the paper, sew the folds with large stitches. </p><p>  For the fixing solution, you need to dissolve the soap in two liters of water and pour in a teaspoon of 9% vinegar.  Soak a piece of gauze in this mixture and thoroughly iron the fabric through it.  Repeat these steps several times to give greater clarity to the creases. </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  So how to sew a pleated skirt?  To get started, get everything you need. </p><ul><li>  Pleated material - with a standard width of 150 cm, a length equal to the length of the future product is taken.  Do not forget about seam allowances. </li><li>  Waistband - equal to the waist plus 4 cm. </li><li>  Sewing threads. </li><li>  Needle. </li><li>  Very sharp tailor's scissors. </li><li>  A few pins. </li><li>  Piece of chalk. </li><li>  Needle for a super-stretch sewing machine. </li></ul><h2>  How to sew a pleated elastic skirt </h2><p>  Let's start sewing? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jabong.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn image" class="if uuid-2626534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2626534.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the work, it is necessary to lay out the material on the table, carefully spreading it and folding it in the middle, with the wrong side facing out. </p><ul><li>  We draw a rectangular pattern.  We lay the length of the skirt along the shared thread and add 4 cm to the hem, across - half the volume of the hips, adding 5 cm to the loose fit.  Width depends on the desired splendor of the future product. </li><li>  Cut a rectangular blank.  We process all its sides with an overlock. </li><li>  Sew along the seam on the side - we have one. </li><li>  Sew a wide elastic band into the ring, with pins we attach it to the skirt, slightly stretching. </li><li>  Set the ‚Äúzig-zag‚Äù mode on the sewing machine and insert the special ‚Äúsuper-stretch‚Äù needle. </li><li>  Sew the elastic to the fabric.  Processing the edge of matter with an overlock is not a prerequisite.  If the fabric does not roll heavily along the edge, then you should not worry about this </li></ul><p>  That's all, now you know how to sew a pleated skirt.  And you can wear it with anything - romantic chiffon blouses or large knit sweaters ... </p><h2>  Velvet pleated skirt </h2><p>  Even in the modern fashion world, replete with various interesting ideas of designers and couturiers, such a thing as a velvet pleated skirt never goes out of fashion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="velvet pleated skirt" class="if uuid-2626552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2626552.jpg"></div><p>  Velvet has always demonstrated the refined taste and luxury of its mistress.  It is because of this that long velvet skirts are recommended for special occasions - here clothes from this aristocratic fabric look great. </p><p>  But in everyday life, this wardrobe item fits perfectly.  Combine these skirts with blouses and blouses made of delicate airy materials, and your appearance will be very effective. </p><p>  How to sew a pleated <span>velvet skirt?</span>  Yes, exactly the same as the usual one.  Only the stitch length on the sewing machine should be longer, since the velvet is quite ‚Äúviscous‚Äù, and small stitches will sorb it.  This skirt can be straight cut, or you can sew it flared.  In this case, do not pattern in a rectangular shape, but draw a trapezoid.  The skirt will turn out with two seams on the sides. </p><h2>  Leather skirt </h2><p>  Elegant leather pleated skirts occupy an important place in the wardrobes of women who follow fashion trends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wheretoget.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gentle romantic image" class="if uuid-2626541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2626541.jpg"></div><p>  The length of such clothes does not play a special role, as well as the question "what to wear with?"  - combine it with any style.  But there are absolutely win-win options: </p><ul><li>  A long black skirt is perfectly combined with a short cardigan and high-heeled shoes - it will turn out to be a very elegant, albeit simple, look. </li><li>  A leather skirt in the color of a dusty rose or powder in addition with a gray t-shirt and sandals looks amazing. </li><li>  And, of course, a rock look: a leather skirt plus a jacket and rough grinders on a low platform. </li></ul><p>  So we figured out how to sew a pleated skirt.  And from what you will create it - it is already to your taste. </p>
