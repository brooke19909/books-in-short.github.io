Grace Card Review</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the advent of the economic crisis, banks began to introduce new financial products to attract more customers.  Plastic cards have become especially relevant.  But you won‚Äôt surprise anyone with a standard credit line.  Not everyone will want to overpay interest on the use of bank money.  The most profitable credit card with a grace period is what a modern client needs.  The most convenient conditions for individuals will be described below. </p><h2>  What is a grace period? </h2><p>  Credit cards today offer to issue many financial institutions for free.  At the same time, some make it possible to use the bank‚Äôs finances on a preferential basis.  That is, for a certain period of time, you can take money from the card and do not overpay anything.  A grace period of 30-60 days is standard.  However, some banks go further and offer their customers to use the funds without overpayment for 180-200 days. </p>

But it can be called beneficial only in a number of cases.  The fact is that most customers, seduced by the grace period, continue to use the loan after the end of the "interest-free" period.  At the same time, you already have to pay a rather big commission for using a credit line.

And first, you should study the review of credit cards with a grace period. </p><h2>  Sberbank of Russia </h2><p>  A financial institution is most trusted by citizens.  The bank also offers a credit card with a grace period.  Cash withdrawals are carried out without interest at any ATM.  Despite the fact that the grace period is offered not too long (only 45 days), there are always a lot of people who want to get a financial product.  This is evidenced by numerous reviews.  It attracts primarily the amount of the credit limit.  Depending on the income, customers can receive up to 600 thousand rubles per card. </p><p>  At the end of the grace period, bank customers will have to pay a fee of 25.9% per annum for using credit money.  The overpayment is calculated based on the amount of funds withdrawn from the card on the last business day of the month. </p><h2>  Vanguard </h2><p>  This bank is the most attractive when considering the grace period.  Everyone has the opportunity to issue an account and receive a card from one of the international payment systems.  At the same time, you can use the bank‚Äôs finances on loyal terms for a long time.  Credit cards with a grace period of 200 days are a unique opportunity to make any purchases without waiting for wages.  You can spend money in stores, travel agencies, entertainment complexes, etc. At the same time, it is not necessary to return the entire withdrawn amount to the card within a month.  The minimum payment will be 10% of the amount owed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  VTB Bank </h2><p>  VTB Bank offers to issue several options for plastic cards.  The difference will be in the credit line provided (from 300 to 900 thousand rubles).  A credit card can be really beneficial.  A grace period of 50 days makes it possible to make purchases at the expense of a financial institution and not overpay anything.  At the end of the billing period, the rate for new customers of the bank will be 28%.  Those who have been working with a financial institution for a long time are offered more loyal conditions.  At the end of the grace period, you will have to pay 22% per annum. </p><p>  From <span>VTB Bank, a credit card</span> is really convenient.  Each client can attach up to 5 cards to his account absolutely free of charge, which is very convenient for family use.  In addition, the financial institution has convenient online banking.  It is not necessary to contact the bank to track the movement of the account.  All you need to do is go to your own online account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  This financial institution also offers a reasonably good credit card.  The grace period is 100 days.  Conditions after its completion: rate - 18.99% per annum.  Any client can get a credit line of up to 300 thousand rubles and spend finances for any purpose.

You can also withdraw credit at any ATM.  Unlike the product that VTB Bank offers, Alfa Bank‚Äôs credit card is also a debit card.  That is, the client can not only take the funds of the financial institution, but also deposit on its own account.  This will accrue interest on the positive balance.

    <p>  Good feedback can also be heard on the Alpha Mobile app.  This is a program for smartphones and tablets, through which you can track the movement of the account, transfer money from the card, replenish the cell account, etc. </p><h2>  Promsvyazbank </h2><p>  A credit card with a grace period of 145 days is beneficial and convenient.  It is such a product that Promsvyazbank offers.  Its name is ‚ÄúSupercard‚Äù.  Within four months you can use the credit line absolutely free.  Then you have to pay the amount of debt at a fairly high rate - 34.5% per annum.  Along with this, the bank offers a rather large credit line.  Depending on the official income, each client can receive up to 600 thousand to a credit account. </p>

Customers who have registered the product automatically become participants in the bonus program and can make purchases at a reduced price in stores that are partners of a financial institution.  Using a card will be really beneficial if you return funds to your account during the grace period.  However, 145 days after the withdrawal of funds, unfortunately, the rate cannot be called profitable.
