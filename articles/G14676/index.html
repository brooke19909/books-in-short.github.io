This <span>kind of thread</span> is not used as often as the markets are flooded with synthetic and artificial options.  But if you suddenly have cotton yarn lying around, then we can offer you a couple of really creative and interesting ideas. </p><h2>  Where are you from, friend? </h2><p>  The story of one skein of yarn begins far, far in the field with cotton crops, the very tiny bolls that are known to both adults and children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cotton yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2135395.jpg"></div>

    <p>  They are collected, cleaned, converted into a large skein, from which later thin threads are created on a special spinning machine.  Further production of the thread may end at this stage or proceed to dyeing the material.  Cotton yarn takes colors perfectly, after which simply delicious shades are obtained. </p><p>  If the yarn you purchased was not dyed under production conditions, then you can do it yourself with the help of natural or artificial dyes.  In any case, the result will be successful in all types of needlework and applied art. </p><h2>  Take a thread </h2><p>  Now that we have studied the process of obtaining such a wonderful material a little, we will tell you what can be knitted from cotton yarn.  In fact, there are a lot of options, but we will offer the most interesting and unusual ones.  The main thing is that you can find all the materials at home, as they are considered absolutely basic: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Cotton yarn.  In this case, it will be the main component of any work, and its amount can vary from a large tangle to a small hank.  Best of all, if you get all the available stocks of yarn and, having estimated their volume, decide what exactly you want to get in the end. </li><li>  Paint.  It will be needed to colorize our yarn.  You can take both special dyes for fabric and stock up on natural herbs and other natural coloring ingredients. </li><li>  Glue.  When working with threads, it is best to choose PVA, since it is invisible after drying, but if you need to get a strong and reliable grip, you can‚Äôt do without hot glue. </li><li>  Other additional materials. </li></ul><h2>  The holiday comes to us </h2><p>  Since the New Year is just around the corner, the first idea will be dedicated to him: we will create openwork balls for the Christmas tree.  It is very simple, therefore this work can be performed together with children. </p>

    <p>  Having prepared the materials (threads, balloons, glue and an old garland) and having cleaned the surface for further work, we will begin the process of creating a New Year's decoration.  It is best to pre-lay the table and put on gloves to protect yourself from glue during operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Instruction: </p><ol><li>  Take PVA glue and pour it into a large bowl with low sides.  It should be so large that your skein of yarn fits easily there.  If desired, you can add a little water to the glue, if it has a very thick and inconvenient texture for work. </li><li>  We put a little yarn in a container and leave it so that the top layer of threads gets wet and soaks, and in the meantime we inflate the balls to the size you need.  Do not inflate them too much so that they do not burst in the process. </li><li>  When the ball and yarn are ready, we put on gloves and take the end of the thread, which is already well glued, and put it on the inflatable "frame". </li><li>  Now, winding the thread around the ball and creating a mesh pattern, the yarn will step by step fall into the container and already be sticky on your product.  Thus, the design will be reliable. </li><li>  To later turn all this into a garland, you need to create a very dense grid.  We were lucky, because cotton yarn was simply created for this. </li><li>  When you feel that there is enough yarn on the ball, just cut the end of the thread and leave everything to dry for a couple of hours. </li><li>  And after that, it remains only to insert the garland bulbs inside the balls, and that's all, the garland is ready to decorate your Christmas tree! </li></ol><h2>  Gory star </h2><p>  You can also safely say that cotton yarn for a hook is an ideal basis for any man-made crafts.  And since the topic was about Christmas decorations, today we will create pendant stars that can be made in 10 minutes, or even faster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thick cotton yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2135389.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Having prepared all the materials (yarn, crochet hook, needle, scissors and a special liquid, such as diluted starch to create a stable shape of the toy), you can immediately begin work that will definitely not take you much time. </p><ol><li>  To begin with, we will make an ‚Äúamigurumi ring‚Äù and, tightening it tightly, we will knit 6 double crochet (CCH) into it.  At the end of the row we knit a connecting loop to close it. </li><li>  Then we continue to knit according to this scheme, taking into account all the nuances and features of the work. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cotton yarn for hook" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2135331.jpg"></div></li><li>  When the star blank, more like a flower, is ready, we proceed to the final stage of formation.  To do this, we tighten a regular cardboard strip with cling film and fix the ‚Äústar‚Äù with sewing pins so that its 5 ends acquire a pointed shape.  Thoroughly coat the base of the threads with the prepared solution and allow to dry. </li><li>  After a certain time, the sprocket hardens and becomes stiff.  This means that it can already be hung on the Christmas tree, making in advance ties from ribbons or yarn. </li></ol><h2>  Gift from the heart </h2><p>  Well, finally, we suggest you create a wonderful applique.  We will need both thin thread and thick cotton yarn.  The most important thing is that, in addition to yarn, glue and cardboard blanks, we need nothing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be knitted from cotton yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2135393.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of course, this type of art requires some painstaking and patience, so when choosing a sketch, consider the amount of free time and material. </p><p>  Instruction: </p><ol><li>  Make a pencil sketch on the cardboard, dividing the picture into small tint spots, from which the whole image will be formed.  When everything is ready, you can begin to work. </li><li>  Lightly grease the desired area with glue, after which we apply the thread in distinctive layers so that there are no gaps between them.  When one element is ready, you can proceed to the next, and so, step by step, fill the picture with cotton thread of different colors. </li><li>  After the canvas is fully coated, the painting should be left to dry completely, and then sprayed onto the surface with hairspray to fix the ‚Äústructure‚Äù for sure. </li></ol><h2>  Total </h2><p>  So, quickly and simply, we created as many as three products from long-forgotten material.  Now we can confidently say that cotton yarn for knitting is a wonderful helper for any needlewoman, from which you can create a wide variety of crafts. </p>
