    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  This hotel boasts a very advantageous location.  So, it is located just one kilometer from the center of a large resort city of Turkey - Kemer.  Thus, all the various objects of tourist infrastructure for hotel guests are located within walking distance.  The hotel has at its disposal a private pebble beach.  It is only 200 meters away.  The beach here is small.  However, the hotel can not be called large, so everyone can easily fit on the available sun loungers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The closest harbor to Romeo <span>Beach Hotel</span> is near Antalya.  The distance to it is 55 kilometers.  Thus, after arriving at <span>Antalya Airport, the</span> path to the hotel will take you just over an hour.  If you travel with the assistance of a travel agency, then after boarding you will probably be offered a transfer to the hotel on a comfortable bus with a guide that tells about the history, culture and features of Turkey in general, and Kemer in particular.  If you send on a trip yourself, you can get to your hotel by bus.  However, there is no direct bus route between Antalya Airport and Kemer.  Therefore, first you have to get to the center of Antalya, where you can catch a bus to Kemer.  If this option is not suitable for you, then there is always the opportunity to use the services of a taxi or book a transfer at the hotel. </p>

    <p>  As for the hotel rooms, they seemed to travelers, although small, but quite spacious, comfortable, pleasantly decorated and equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay.  So, the furniture is in good condition, and the equipment is modern and working.  If some kind of breakdown occurs, you should contact the reception, and very soon all the malfunctions will be fixed.  The guests of the Romeo Beach Hotel liked that the maids carried out wet cleaning daily and removed garbage from the room.  Bed linen and towels were changed twice a week.  Also, experienced travelers warn that taking out towels from the room to the beach is not allowed.  Therefore, if you intend to stay at this hotel, take <span>beach towels</span> with you from home or buy them directly on the spot. </p><p>  The hotel itself and its territory were also liked by most of the guests.  So, many found this hotel cozy and comfortable.  Many mention a nice courtyard, where in the evenings there was a cafe where you can order a hookah.  According to many tourists, the location of the hotel is good.  So, it is just a few minutes walk from the city center with all its tourist infrastructure. </p><p>  A big plus of Romeo Beach Hotel Boutique 3 * is the presence of its own beach.  The distance to it is only two hundred meters.  The beach here, although not large, but easily accommodates everyone.  Hotel guests can use sun loungers and parasols for free. </p><p>  As for food in the hotel, here the opinions of travelers are somewhat different.  So, someone found the menu in the hotel monotonous.  Statements of this kind, the other part of the guests counters the fact that it is impossible to get gourmet dishes and expensive drinks for breakfast, lunch and dinner, while paying a mere penny for living.  In their opinion, the food here is tasty and varied enough for a three-star hotel. </p><p>  Quite warmly, many travelers respond about the staff of Romeo Beach Hotel 3 *.  So, all the staff here are very welcoming, friendly and always happy to help guests.  In addition, they are responsible for the performance of their functions.  Upon request, you can also organize trips to nightclubs, the entrance for which for hotel guests will be free. </p><p>  In general, most tourists described this hotel as a great place for economical and comfortable accommodation in the center of a large resort city of Turkey.  Young people who came to Kemer to hang out and relax ‚Äúto the fullest‚Äù will surely like it.  But for older people who prefer a quiet and measured pastime, the hotel, according to our compatriots, does not fit very well.  As for the ratio of the price of accommodation and the quality of the services provided, tourists from Russia found it in Romeo Beach Hotel 3 * optimal.  Many of the travelers who have been here were very pleased with their choice and are ready to recommend this hotel to their friends and acquaintances. </p>
