This is the adapter that will help synchronize the device with the PC.  On the one hand, it is equipped with a standard USB connector, and on the other, with a special connector for the device.  They may vary depending on the model.  When deciding how to connect an iPhone to a computer via USB, it is important to take into account that a significant point is the presence of a USB 2.0 connector on the computer.  What could be the catch?  The fact is that the appearance of USB version 2.0 is absolutely identical to the previous version 1.0.  If you connect the device to USB 1.0, the computer will display a message that the device can work faster.  This will mean that, most likely, it will not be possible to transfer data from the device to the hard disk.  But do not be scared, connector 1.0.  It is used only on older models that are already problematic to find. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Data transfer algorithm </h2><p>  How to connect an iPhone to a computer via USB?

    <p>  After running this algorithm, the question of how to connect an iPhone to a computer via USB should not arise.  But it may happen that the USB version is the right one, the connection also happened correctly, but there is no connection.  What could be the problem?  <span>ITunes ("iTunes")</span> can help solve the problem <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Useful program to solve problems </h2><p>  ‚ÄúITunes‚Äù for iPhone <strong>is a</strong> free application that is easy to find and download on the Internet.  This app helps sync your iOS device with your PC.  Moreover, downloading the utility, you install the basic drivers with it, which will simplify the work with the gadget.  In particular, the application helps to synchronize contacts, install games, download media files, books and many other useful programs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If ‚ÄúAityuns‚Äù for iPhone is installed on the computer, then when connected via a USB cable, synchronization should happen quickly and automatically.  There is an important point: if data is being transferred, in no case can you pull out the cord.  Such interruption may adversely affect the file system of the device.  If there is a need to pause file transfer, you just need to pull the slide, cancel the synchronization, select safe extraction, then disconnect the cable. </p><p>  Sometimes it may be that even after installing "iTunes" the computer may not see the iOS device.  In most cases, such a nuisance occurs after a new firmware of an "apple" friend or after updating a PC.  To resolve this problem, do the following. </p><ol><li>  Install the latest version of iOS. </li><li>  Connect an iFunBox file manager or iExplorer identical in capabilities. </li><li>  Using this program, find the var / mobile / Media section. </li><li>  Copy it to your computer and then delete it from the gadget. </li><li>  Reload iPhone. </li><li>  Connect to a PC. </li><li>  All is ready.  If some of the files are missing after connecting, they can be found in the copied Media folder. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Sometimes, especially at work, there may be a need to connect your ‚Äúbitten apple‚Äù to the computer, and the employer may prohibit installing additional applications on the PC, and Wi-Fi is also not available.  Is there a way out of this stalemate?  And here is also a positive answer: yes. </p><h2>  <strong><span>How to connect an iPhone to a computer</span> as a USB flash drive?</strong> </h2><p>  For this, a free USB Drive for the iPhone application has been created.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developer of this program is that the PC does not recognize the device as a digital camera, but sees it simply as a USB flash drive. </p><p>  It should be noted that there is a problem.  The fact is that the iPhone is initially used to synchronize or to download media.  Therefore, the USB driver conflicts with these features.  We must pay tribute to the developers, they solved the problem quite simply: they introduced three separate modes of the gadget. </p><h2>  Program modes </h2><p>  Default - a mode in which devices are synchronized and photos and videos are transferred.  When you enable this function, the <span>computer does not see the iPhone</span> as a USB flash drive. </p><p>  Drive + iTunes.  On devices with Mac OS, you can synchronize and use the iOS device as a storage medium.  The flash drive does not work on the Windows operating system. </p><p>  Drive Only <strong>-</strong> any operating system recognizes only a USB flash drive and nothing more. </p><p>  Before using the iPhone as a flash drive, you need to create a virtual disk - a special section that will be reserved for space for information.  When connected to a device‚Äôs PC, only this section and its contents will be visible.  It is also important that after this procedure it will be possible to use the iPhone as a USB flash drive on any device without additional drivers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect an iPhone to a computer like a USB flash drive" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40261/1087748.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Application Nuances </h2><p>  Creating a virtual disk, you need to specify the required size and come up with a name for it. </p><p>  After that, you will have to wait a while while formatting will go.  Those who have already done this operation say that it takes quite a lot of time to create such a folder. </p><p>  A big minus of the program is the fact that before switching modes each time the device needs to be overloaded. </p><p>  The following point is also important: if you installed the USB Drive for the iPhone program, and then decided to remove it, then you can remove it only when the Default mode is enabled.  Otherwise, the iPhone may behave unpredictably or even break. </p><h2>  Connect iPhone to PC without a USB cable </h2><p>  Naturally, the question may arise whether it is possible to move information without a cord.  In other words, how to connect an iPhone to a computer without USB?  For owners of the fifth model, there is another way to transfer data from their "apple" to the PC.  This can be done using a wireless network. </p><p>  The algorithm for connecting an iOS device to Wi-Fi is described below. </p><p>  For such a connection you will need: </p><ul><li>  iPhone </li><li>  Personal Computer; </li><li>  router (router) of a wireless network. </li></ul><p>  First of all, you need to activate the Wi-Fi module in the device. </p><p>  Then, in the settings, select the found wireless network that the router issues. </p><p>  After that, the connection should occur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to connect an iPhone to a computer" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40261/1087782.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sometimes a situation arises when the computer does not see the connected iPhone over the wireless network. </p><p>  There can be several explanations for this.  Without delving into all the nuances of such reasons, we will try to correct this situation. </p><ol><li>  Use a USB cable to sync devices. </li><li>  Go to the "iTunes" section, find the "Devices" folder and select the desired gadget model. </li><li>  Open the "Overview" section and select the "Options" folder. </li><li>  In this section you need to select "Synchronization". </li><li>  After that, disconnect the wire from the PC. </li></ol><p>  That's it, now you can connect devices using a wireless network. </p>
