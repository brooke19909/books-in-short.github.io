How to get permission?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Multifunctional gadgets that run on the Android operating system are very popular today.  Such devices are convenient not only for entertainment or communication with friends and relatives, but also for work. </p><p>  As a rule, in all modern devices, additional memory cards are installed - SD Card.  Often it is with such storage media that problems arise.  At the same time, the smartphone system itself has several levels of protection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android on the phone" class="if uuid-3194836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3194836.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, users encounter difficulties when they need to delete a particular file.  The system displays a message stating that there is no permission to delete from Android.  This usually means that the user does not have the appropriate rights.  But if on a regular PC almost everyone knows how to get administrator access, then with a phone or tablet there may be difficulties.  Therefore, we‚Äôll take a closer look at what to do if there is no permission to delete it on Android. </p><h2>  The most common causes of difficulties </h2><p>  Often, certain applications begin to work incorrectly due to user actions.  If the user inadvertently deletes the desired file, this will lead to a failure.  Therefore, some developers are simply trying to prevent such situations.  They increase file security.  Therefore, they cannot be removed for no reason.  The user must have administrator rights.  In this case, the 644th permission to delete files on Android is required.  Otherwise, you can forget about such manipulations with system files. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is another mistake that is very common.  The problem is that the user initially installed the application in the root folder of the phone, and then transferred it to the SD Card.  In the work of such media often failures that prevent subsequent deletion of files. </p><p>  In the first case, there are several methods for solving the problem.  But if the whole thing is the work of the memory card, then you have to use third-party applications.  They can be found in large numbers on Google Play. </p><h2>  There is no permission to delete in Android with SD Card: checking for administrator rights </h2><p>  There are several utilities that can help you verify access levels.  For example, you can download the Root Checker program.  After installing it, just go to the application and select the ‚ÄúRoot check‚Äù item.  Usually after this, you can understand whether the owner of the gadget has the necessary permissions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.infonewtechnologies.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Useful utility" class="if uuid-3194850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3194850.jpg"></div><p>  You can also download the Terminal Emulator program.  In this case, a little more manipulation is required.  To determine the rights of the user, you need to type a short command SU.  If the user has the necessary rights, the # symbol will appear on the screen.  If they are absent, the user will see a dollar icon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If it was possible to find out that the user does not have administrator rights, then you need to solve the problem using other utilities. </p><h2>  Programs for providing access </h2><p>  In this case, you can also find a huge number of utilities on Google Play.  For example, iRoot or WeakSauce is suitable.  All these programs work on the same principle.  It is enough to go into the application after installing it and activate it. </p><p>  Having received the so-called root rights, you can delete any folders or files.  Problems in the future should not arise.  But sometimes, even after such manipulations, the user sees a message stating that there is no permission to delete it on Android.  What to do in this situation?  In this case, you need to resort to drastic measures.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="With tablet" class="if uuid-3194861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3194861.jpg"></div><h2>  Using ES Explorer </h2><p>  If there is no permission to delete on Android with an SD Card, then experts recommend that you first use the built-in solutions of this operating system.  Third-party programs are not always able to make changes to root folders.  Therefore, it is most convenient to use the ES-conductor. </p><p>  Just find the program on your mobile device.  It will display all folders and files.  Through the ES conductor, they are usually deleted without difficulty.  But sometimes, even in this case, such manipulations remain impossible.  Then you should use another method. </p><h2>  Removing programs through a computer </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth noting that in this way you can only delete files that were installed during the use of the gadget.  This means, if we are talking about system, protected files that were already present on the device at the time of purchase, then you can‚Äôt get rid of them using this method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Via pc" class="if uuid-3194854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3194854.jpg"></div><p>  To uninstall programs through a PC, just use the USB cable and connect the gadget to the computer.  At the next stage, you need to go to the device folder through the PC and try to delete the files manually.  Separately, you can find the SD Card section and see which files may require uninstallation.  But far from always after connecting the gadget to the PC, the user gets appropriate access.  Therefore, you will have to make a few more manipulations. </p><h2>  How to get permission to delete on Android </h2><p>  This method will not only display the gadget folders on the PC, but also delete unnecessary files directly on the device itself.  In this case, it is about gaining developer access and activating debugging via USB. </p><p>  To do this, find the ‚ÄúAbout phone‚Äù (or about the tablet) item in the settings.  After that, you need to find the line ‚ÄúAssembly number‚Äù and click on it at least 5-7 times.  After that, the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù item should appear in the general settings of the device.  This means that the user has received the desired access level.  Now you can connect the gadget to a PC or uninstall programs and folders that previously could not be deleted. </p><h2>  Checking and Correcting SD Card Errors </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, if there is no permission to delete in Android, then perhaps the problem lies in the additional memory card.  Therefore, it is worth checking whether there is any damage on the external drive.  Often users very casually use such tiny devices, which leads to barely visible damage.  Sometimes the problem lies in internal errors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vida-it.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sd card" class="if uuid-3194845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3194845.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, it is worth carrying out the procedure for full formatting of the drive.  To do this, the card through a special adapter must be connected to a PC and perform this procedure.  Just click on the right mouse button and select "Formatting". </p><p>  To prevent such errors from occurring in the future, it is worth making changes to the settings of the map cache.  The easiest way to do this is to download an application called SD Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãIncrease from Goggle Play. </p><p>  There is another way to check the card for possible errors.  To do this, reconnect it to the PC and, right-clicking, select the line "Properties".  They will need to go to the "Service" section, in which it is enough to activate the button responsible for checking the disks for possible errors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern telephone" class="if uuid-3194848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3194848.jpg"></div><p>  Some also install the SD Tools utility.  It is installed directly on the gadget, so connecting to a PC is not required.  This utility independently finds errors on the map and provides all the information on how to solve them. </p><h2>  Flashing the system </h2><p>  If all else fails and there is still no permission to delete it on Android, then the problem may be in the device‚Äôs operating system itself.  This means that even with developer rights, uninstalling some files remains impossible.  In this case, you will first have to return the device to the factory settings, and then try to reflash it.  But you need to understand that such a method can lead to serious failures, especially if the user has never performed such manipulations before. </p>
