Crochet for girls</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The <span>crocheted crochet</span> for a <span>children's dress</span> simply looks unsurpassed <span>.</span>  The scheme of this part of the clothes is not always complicated, but, of course, gives unsurpassed results.  The main thing is to carefully understand it and try it at performance, and then each baby will become a real princess in a handmade dress. </p><h2>  Purpose of the coquette </h2><p>  Quite often, crocheting is used in the manufacture of children's clothing.  Schemes for girls offer models that are interesting in the variety of patterns and the possibilities of their repetition by masters of different levels of knowledge of this technique. </p><p>  The construction of the pattern on the basis of the coquette allows you to simulate both elegant and <span>casual dress.</span>  With this part, it is easier to design the sleeves and neck.  In addition, this is a good decorative element with which you can focus on the upper or lower part of the clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet for baby dress crochet pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913795.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  A beautiful openwork coquette does not fit very difficult.  But the effect of it far exceeds the time that is spent on its manufacture.  And all because the practical and decorative role of the coquette is difficult to overestimate.  For this reason, the vast majority of blouses and dresses for girls are knitted exactly on the yoke. </p><h2>  Elegant simplicity </h2><p>  As you know, any crochet pattern is a combination of posts and air loops.  Consider knitting a round yoke, which does not require special skill, and the scheme of work is extremely simple and understandable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We start work from the top.  We collect the required number of air loops and knit in succession 2 single crochet stitches through 1 loop, making 2 air loops between them.  The next row consists entirely of single crochet stitches in each stitch.  We knit the third row, like the first.  Next - 5-6 rows with a single crochet.  At this moment, you must not forget that you need to gradually add loops, otherwise we will get not a yoke, but a stocking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913796.jpg" width="467"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  A further pattern consists of alternating two rows.  First, we repeat the first row, with which the coquette for the children's <span>dress</span> begins with a <span>hook.</span>  The scheme of the second is even simpler: a series of single crochet columns. </p><p>  This dress is made of several colors of yarn, and the coquette itself is decorated with simple but expressive knitted flowers, which makes the overall composition complete and harmonious. </p><h2>  White crochet dress for the little ones </h2><p>  The next model is also uncomplicated in execution.  It is suitable for the smallest girls.  This can be a great christening outfit.  The work will not take much time, but the effect will be simply amazing. </p><p>  To begin with, we note that it is better to start knitting not in a circle.  This will make the back closure.  Otherwise, the neckline will turn out to be too large, and the dress will look sloppy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet white dress" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913797.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Knitting starts from a series of single crochet stitches in each loop of the base chain of air loops.  Next, we make 2 <span>double crochet,</span> 1 air loop and 2 double crochet into the same base.  Through the loop of the previous row, repeat this pattern.  The next row fits under an air loop, which is located between the columns.  After 3-4 rows, we expand.  To do this, we knit 8-10 times on the pattern element between two elements of the previous row.  In this model, the wider the coquette, the more beautiful it is. </p><p>  After the crochet for the children's dress is crocheted, the scheme of which is described above, we knit a little in a circle with the same pattern and then we switch to a more spectacular one.  His choice remains with the knitter. </p><h2>  Unusual pattern </h2><p>  Next, consider how to knit a yoke small, but wonderful and uncomplicated.  It consists of several sections, which eventually form beautiful rounded teeth. </p><p>  This scheme uses columns with one double crochet and without it, air loops and columns with a common top.  The latter are knitted as follows: first we make 1 double crochet, but do not knit it, then 2 more in the same way, and then connect all 3 vertices with one loop. </p><p>  For greater expressiveness of the pattern, the upper chains of air loops are tied with crochets.  The central element of the diagram shows how to make transitions from one row to another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting round yoke" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913798.jpg" width="580"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  You can continue <span>knitting dresses</span> for girls with the pattern presented in the second diagram.  It is also done in a circle.  Armholes are formed by a chain of air loops, from which they continue to knit. </p><p>  To make the product neat, try to make the columns of the transition to a new row appear on the side.  There they are least visible. </p><h2>  Floral pattern with rhombuses </h2><p>  Quite often, various plant patterns reproduce crochet.  Schemes for girls allow you to create especially elegant things in this style, so let's consider one of the unusual options. </p><p>  We collect a chain of air loops, a multiple of 4, plus 2 lifting loops.  In the third loop from the end we knit a double crochet, make one air loop and two more of the same columns.  We continue knitting to the end.  Thus, we make 6 rows in which the columns are strictly above each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork coquette" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/914836.jpg" width="208"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In the seventh row, between the groups of columns we knit 3 air loops, while one of the groups is cut so that the pattern begins to converge on the wedge.  In the eighth row, we begin to form an external blade.  Following the presented scheme, we close one of them, and expand the second one, and then close it.  When this pattern is over, we go on knitting rhombuses with the help of fans of three columns, which are staggered under chains of air loops.  Thus, you can adjust the size of the coquette in accordance with the pattern of the future dress. </p><h2>  Sirloin coquette </h2><p>  The white dress crocheted in fillet technique looks beautiful.  Its essence is to create patterns from cells.  The proposed model has a slightly complicated form. </p><p>  Here, the pattern is formed not only by painting over the cells, but also by knitting other elements inside the resulting rhombuses.  The coquette does not fit in the vertical direction, but in the horizontal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="square yoke" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913800.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The core of the rhombus is formed from the gradual addition and reduction of double crochet columns and an increase in the number of air loops from two to 5. In the first row of the pattern, we knit 1 column, in the second - 3, in the third - 5, in the fourth - 3, and in the fifth - 1. </p><p>  If suddenly it is not possible to beautifully design a round neck, it is made square or then tied with an openwork edging.  The main fabric of the dress can be continued both in the loin technique and in any other arbitrary pattern. </p><h2>  Square motifs </h2><p>  In the event that a square coquette is needed for the dress, you can knit it from individual motifs.  For this, any scheme that is in the collection of the craftswoman is suitable.  Consider one of these. </p><p>  It is based on a four-pointed flower, which is knitted from columns without a crochet on a ring of air loops.  Between the petals, air loops are also performed, serving as the basis for the next row.  In it, on the tops of the previous petals, one crochet column is knitted.  It is divided by the same air chains. </p><p>  The following rows are knitted in loin technique in a circle.  In the corners of the motif, 2 double crochets are made so that the shape remains square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a yoke" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913801.jpg" width="333"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If desired, this pattern can be varied with lush columns, filled cells or other elements at the discretion of the craftswoman. </p><h2>  Scope for creativity </h2><p>  You can find a suitable pattern anywhere or come up with your own to get an original crochet for a <span>children's dress</span> crocheted.  The scheme is built on the basis of different alternations of columns and air loops.  In all the described models there is scope for creativity. </p><p>  A beautiful coquette will turn out if you take a round napkin and start knitting not from its central part, but somewhere from one third of the edge.  You can take the central part in the same pattern and draw round motives from it, which later turn into the necessary detail of the future outfit. </p><p>  The main thing in crocheting is not to be afraid to experiment and create.  The result of this process will be a unique dress for a girl of any age. </p>
