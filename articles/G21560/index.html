  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is conformism and conformal human behavior</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Conformism is a term of social psychology that is directly related to the behavior of a person in a small group and means a form of adaptation, submission and compliance with the norms and rules established in the group, regardless of how they comply with ethical, cultural and legal norms and rules in society in whole.  Accordingly, a conformal personality is a type of person who, in the external attributes of life, in clothing, appearance, and also in all its other spheres, in every possible way avoids manifestation of individuality and fully accepts the rules of behavior, tastes and lifestyle of the environment.  Sociologists and psychologists often define conformism as a style of behavior that is characterized by ‚Äúblind‚Äù acceptance of someone else‚Äôs opinion in order to avoid unnecessary problems and difficulties, gain authority, and achieve a goal. </p><p>  In the process of socialization, conformal <span>human behavior is</span> inevitable and plays both a positive and a negative role.  On the one hand, it often leads to the correction of certain errors when a person accepts the majority opinion, which is correct, on the other hand, excessive conformism interferes with the affirmation of an individual ‚ÄúI‚Äù, one‚Äôs own opinion and behavior.  Success in the process of socialization is associated with a reasonable degree of conformism, when it is combined with adequate self-esteem and sufficient self-confidence. </p><p>  In a negative sense, conformal behavior is characterized by three main aspects: </p><p>  A pronounced lack of one‚Äôs own views and beliefs, <span>behavior of adaptation</span> caused by weakness of character. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Orientation in behavior to full compliance with the views, values, rules and norms of the majority in order to achieve a specific goal. </p><p>  Submission to the pressure of the group, and as a result, the complete adoption of the rules of conduct of other members of the group.  Under pressure, the individual begins to think, feel and act like a majority. </p><p>  <span>Human</span> conformal <span>behavior is</span> divided into two types: internal and external submission to the group.  External subordination is always associated with the conscious (sometimes forced) adoption of regulatory rules and adaptation to the majority opinion.  It, as a rule, gives rise to a deep <span>intrapersonal conflict,</span> although it happens <span>that such a</span> conflict does not arise. </p><p>  Internal subordination is the perception of the opinion of the group as its own, and the observance of the rules and norms of behavior not only within the group, but also outside it, and the development of its own logical explanation and justification for this choice. </p><p>  In accordance with the types, conformal behavior of a person is divided into three levels: the level of submission that limits the influence of the group on the individual to one specific situation, which does not last long and has only an external character;  level of identification, when a person partially or fully likens himself to others, or group members expect specific behavior from each other;  the level of internalization, when the personality value system coincides with the group value system and it is relatively independent of external influences. </p><p>  The conformal behavior of a person is always associated with a number of certain factors that give rise to it.  Firstly, it manifests itself only in the presence of a conflict between the group and the individual.  Secondly, it manifests itself only under the psychological influence of the group (negative assessments, general opinion, offensive jokes, etc.).  Thirdly, group factors, such as its size, structure and degree of cohesion, as well as the individual and personal characteristics of its members, influence the degree of conformity. </p><p>  So, conformal human behavior is far from always to be considered in a negative aspect.  Reasonable submission to the norms and rules that have been established in society, but at the same time maintaining your own self, adequate self-esteem and assessment of what is happening around it contributes to the process of socialization.  But such a thing as non-conformism - the denial and rejection of all the norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãthat have been established in society, is not an alternative to comforism, but only a manifestation of negativism. </p>
