Where to change it?  How to get it initially?  Why is this document needed at all?  All this remains to be understood further.  After all, the subject of our conversation is included in the list of mandatory that every citizen of the Russian Federation should have.  You can‚Äôt do without it in principle.  It will not work to qualify for most public services.  For example, to receive a pension or free medical care.  So what document are we talking about?  What is he like?  Why is SNILS needed?  When and in what order do you need to replace this document?  About all this - further!  Every citizen should know the answers to these questions.  Otherwise, he will have certain problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snls where to change" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1398957.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What it is </h2><p>  Before you understand the procedure for registration and replacement, you should understand what is at stake.  SNILS is the insurance number of an individual <span>personal account.</span>  It must be with every citizen located in the country. </p><p>  SNILS in paper form looks like a small laminated green card.  It contains information about the owner, as well as the personal account number in the mandatory pension insurance system.  The combination of numbers is individual. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For what </h2><p>  Does SNILs need a person?  Yes, and not only because the laws of the Russian Federation say so.  The fact is that SNILS is an extremely important document.  He appears in most operations and public services.  For example, using it you can use the following rights: </p><ul><li>  employment (if there is no SNILS, it is drawn up by the employer for the employee without fail); </li><li>  registration of a pension; </li><li>  receipt of pension payments; </li><li>  the appointment and receipt of benefits and other cash payments from the state in support of the population; </li><li>  receiving free medical care; </li><li>  registration of maternity capital; </li><li>  issuance of a compulsory medical insurance policy. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, the list does not end there.  But it is already clear that SNILS is indispensable.  Most public services and social opportunities will be inaccessible to humans.  Important: the document should only contain relevant information about the citizen.  Otherwise, SNILS is considered invalid. </p>

    <h2>  Receiving and replacing </h2><p>  It should also be noted that recently, it is made out even for newborns.  Where to get SNILS?  There, where to change it. </p><p>  Speaking about specific places, it is very difficult to determine.  Indeed, today citizens are given the freedom to choose the place of treatment with a particular request.  There are a lot of opportunities.  Where to get SNILS?  Among the possible organizations issuing this document are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  <span>Pension Fund of</span> Russia; </li><li>  district FIUs; </li><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  portal "State services"; </li><li>  employer (company in which the citizen works). </li></ul><p>  Where exactly to apply?  Here, everyone decides for himself.  By the way, it is not recommended in Russia to use a shift or primary receipt of SNILS from an employer.  Many simply refuse this.  Now most often the population seeks help from the FIU, as well as from the MFC.  In these organizations, clearance is the fastest. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of circulation </h2><p>  And what are the deadlines for replacing or receiving a document for the first time?  In fact, the deadline as such is not set.  Especially when it comes to the second case. </p><p>  The fact is that without SNILS it is not even possible to obtain a compulsory medical insurance policy.  This means that a newborn citizen will not be able to use the services of the clinic.  Therefore, you need to apply for a certificate to one or another authority as soon as possible.  As practice shows, citizens are advised to draw up SNILS within a month after discharge from the hospital.  More precisely, after about 10 days from the date of receipt of the birth certificate. </p><p>  This is if we talk about children.  But what about the "adult" SNILS?  Where to change this document is understandable.  But in what time frame to do this?  It is recommended not to delay the process.  About 30 days from the date of determining the invalidity of the document is allotted for the submission of an application of the established form.  Legislative dates for obtaining SNILS have not been established.  But after a month of delay in the Pension Fund, certain problems may arise due to the changed information about the owner of the personal account.  Therefore, you should not delay the process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  How long does </h2><p>  And how long does the SNILS of an individual take?  This question is also of interest to many.  In fact, a lot depends on where exactly the citizen turned for help.  And from the age category. </p><p>  In general, about 14 days are allotted for the initial production of a document and its replacement.  In practice, a citizen is called a period of up to 30 days, or even more.  But on average it is half the month that you have to wait.  This is when it comes to replacing SNILS or primary receipt of a newly born person. </p><p>  But with newborns, the situation is somewhat different.  As a rule, they must be issued SNILS first and replaced (especially in case of detection of errors) immediately.  That is, you will not need to wait.  Just a few minutes - while the card is made and laminated. </p><h2>  How to get a document after production </h2><p>  What is required if a person should already receive SNILS?  That is, the card is ready.  Any documents you still have to bring with you to prove your identity?  Yes it is.  But you can not worry - a large package of papers will not be required. </p><p>  Only one thing is asked from citizens - any identification card.  SNILS on the passport can be taken from one or another body by children who have reached the age of 14 years (independently), as well as adult citizens. </p><p>  What about children who do not yet have such an identity card?  First, legal representatives take SNILS for them.  Secondly, an identity card in this situation will serve as a birth certificate.  Do not forget about presenting the passport of the parent.  This is necessary to make sure that it is the legal representative who takes the child's SNILS. </p><h2>  When to change </h2><p>  Sooner or later, the moment comes when you have to change certain documents.  You can issue SNILS in Moscow or any other city in one of the previously listed institutions.  There is also a replacement document.  But when is it required? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get snls in Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1398960.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The legislation establishes the following cases: </p><ul><li>  change of surname; </li><li>  change in the personal data of the insured person; </li><li>  loss of previous insurance certificate; </li><li>  the presence of an error in the document; </li><li>  damage to SNILS. </li></ul><p>  These are the most common cases.  As a rule, SNILS when changing a surname changes most often.  Mostly by girls - marriage or divorce have an impact on the person‚Äôs data.  Therefore, the former SNILS is invalid from the moment legal relations are formalized or terminated. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to children.  For them, the procedure for changing and initial issuing of SNILS is as simple as possible, if we exclude the process of writing an application of an established form.  What documents does a parent need to bring with them?  It all depends on the situation. </p><p>  During the initial execution of the document required: </p><ul><li>  application (filled out in one or another body); </li><li>  minor birth certificate; </li><li>  parent ID </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is needed.  Even the presence of a newborn is not a must.  When it comes to a citizen who draws up SNILS for the first time after 14 years, the application is drawn up on behalf of the recipient.  And parents are no longer needed.  However, the child must present his passport. </p><p>  But what if, for one reason or another, you need to change the SNILS?  What documents are requested when it comes to children?  It: </p><ul><li>  Statement. </li><li>  Identity card (parents, if the child is less than 14 years old, or the youngest citizen is older than this age). </li><li>  Birth certificate. </li><li>  Old SNILS (if any). </li><li>  Base document for replacement. </li></ul><h2>  For adults </h2><p>  If we are talking about changing the studied document to adults, the process is simplified.  The fact is that a citizen will have to write a statement on his behalf.  And documents in one case or another need less. </p><p>  Initial receipt requires: </p><ul><li>  statements; </li><li>  identity cards (passports). </li></ul><p>  This ends the list of documents.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to get SNILS.  Where to change it - too.  And what about the documents in this situation?  What papers will be required from a citizen in a particular case when receiving SNILS (where to change it - people choose it)?  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  previous <span>insurance certificate</span> (required if there is no loss of the document); </li><li>  passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  Documents-grounds for changing SNILS (usually a marriage / divorce certificate). </li></ul><p>  Of course, one should not forget about the statement.  Another caveat - when changing personal information, you first need to change your identity card.  And after that, apply for the change of SNILS.  Reception takes place only in person, upon presentation of a passport.  In fact, the procedure for replacing the document under study is not so difficult. </p>

    <h2>  Over the internet </h2><p>  How else can I change SNILS?  "Public services" - a portal that will help bring the idea to life.  Recently in great demand.  How to use this service to bring the idea to life? </p><p>  The first step is to register an account.  It is this process that causes the greatest difficulties.  You need to contact the tax authorities or the Russian Post Office for help.  They will help you get a password to enter.  After registering an account at the State Service, you will have to wait 2 weeks - after this time the profile will be activated.  Only then it will be possible to use the offered opportunities. </p><p>  The second step is to search for a service.  In the search bar after authorization should write "Replacement SNILS."  In the window that appears, select the appropriate line, then familiarize yourself with the information provided and click on the "Get Service" button. </p><p>  The third step is to fill out an application.  This will require SNILS and a passport.  No different from the paper version.  Only on the Gosuslug portal the application is filled in personally by a citizen.  Mandatory fields are marked with *. </p><p>  The final stage is obtaining SNILS.  An email will be sent to your account informing you that the document is ready.  The citizen must bring the originals of the documents indicated when filling out the application.  Where to come?  The place will be indicated in the letter.  This is usually the FIU.  So you can arrange SNILS.  "Government services" will help in this. </p><h2>  For residents of the capital </h2><p>  How to be the residents of the capital?  Many do not know where exactly to apply in Moscow for a replacement or initial receipt of an individual insurance account.  What can be advised to such citizens? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snls what documents" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1398962.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To issue SNILS in Moscow there is an opportunity, as has already been said, in various bodies.  For example, on the website "State Services".  You can also contact any MFC in a particular area.  Or come to the FIU.  It is located at the following address: Moscow, Stasovaya Street, Building 14, Building 2. This is by no means the only department, but they are most often contacted there.  Now it‚Äôs clear what SNILS represents.  Where to change it is also not a mystery.  If you approach the issue correctly, no problems with the replacement will arise. </p>
