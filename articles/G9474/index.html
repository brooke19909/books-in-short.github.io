    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel complex under consideration is located on the second coastline in the Al Quseir area.  The city called Marsa Alam is 18 kilometers away.  The hotel is only 600 meters from the sea.  According to the guests, the coast can be reached in 10 minutes at a leisurely pace.  On the way you will need to cross the road.  There are few cars here, and a traffic controller is constantly on duty.  The nearest airport is 45 kilometers away.  However, many domestic tourists fly to Hurghada's air harbor, which is 265 kilometers from the hotel.  Therefore, it takes them several hours to get to the hotel.  In this regard, experienced travelers are advised to look for tickets to the airport, which is located a bit further than Marsa Alam, if possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
