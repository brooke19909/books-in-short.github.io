Currently, in many countries it is forbidden to use mobile phones while driving, and these devices offer a legitimate way to make calls and drive a car at the same time.  They are also indispensable in the office or in other situations when you need to have both hands free during a telephone conversation. </p><h2>  Price and quality </h2><p>  The best Bluetooth headsets cost from 6 thousand rubles.  Nevertheless, you can find models that are cheaper, sometimes significantly.  They provide decent voice quality, but have less functionality.  These include both new base-level headsets and older, but still available, retail models. </p><p>  Nevertheless, these days even cheap devices often support functions that not so long ago could be found only in the most expensive wireless headphones.  For example, all of the products in this Bluetooth headset overview can be controlled by both voice commands and physical controls.  Most of them also offer multi-point connection, i.e., simultaneous connection to two cell phones. </p><p>  However, for example, for the advanced A2DP audio distribution profile, which allows the headset to serve as a speaker for audio streaming, you still have to pay.  This feature allows you to switch between playing music and making phone calls, but most models are smart enough to automatically turn off music when you receive an incoming call. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sound quality of the smartphone‚Äôs Bluetooth headset, although not bad, cannot be compared to headphones specifically designed for audiophiles.  If you need first-class sound and do not need a microphone, then it is better to look for a suitable model among cordless headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flanco.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plantronics Voyager Legend" class="if uuid-2543558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2543558.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose a bluetooth headset? </h2><p>  According to users, the best models should have the following qualities. </p><ul><li>  Clear sound.  First of all, the headset should ensure a normal conversation on the phone.  The voices of the user and the interlocutor should sound loud and clear, without the metallic shade that cheap headphones sin.  The Bluetooth headset should ideally filter out ambient noise, such as wind or clatter. </li><li>  Convenience.  Comfort is just as important as sound quality.  The size, shape, and weight of the headset affects how long it can be worn.  It is also important that the earbud is of a suitable size, especially if it is an in-ear earphone.  Since it is usually impossible to try on in advance, it is better to find a model with a set of inserts of different sizes. </li><li>  Long battery life.  The best Bluetooth headsets allow you to make and receive calls throughout the day without recharging.  Some models come with a stand-alone charger that allows you to charge your headphones on the go, extending the time between recharging from the mains. </li><li>  Ease of use.  The owner does not have to wonder how to connect a Bluetooth headset.  If commands or controls are difficult to use, many of the functionality of wireless headphones becomes useless.  The buttons should be located where they are easy to find with one hand, but hard to get by accident.  Voice commands, if available, should be easy to remember, and the device itself must accurately interpret them. </li><li>  Convenient charging.  Some wireless headsets charge with a regular micro-USB cable, while others use non-standard connections.  The latter are less convenient because you always have to carry them with you, especially if the battery life is relatively short.  Cable length is also important because it determines where you can install the headphones while charging. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="xiaomi-mi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Mi Bluetooth Headset" class="if uuid-2543557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2543557.jpg"></div><h2>  What to look for? </h2><p>  Do I have to call in a busy environment?  If the user is alone in his office, then noise reduction is not so important.  But if you often have to make calls from the main streets or from the airport, then the ability to filter background sounds is key.  You should pay attention to the fact that headsets that work well in some situations experience problems with suppressing wind noise in a moving car.  Therefore, those who often talk on the phone in the car should look for a headset that can handle this particular situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Does the user intend to listen to music?  Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) technology allows you to transfer audio from a mobile phone, smartphone or music player to a wireless stereo headset.  But before looking for a model that supports this feature, users recommend making sure the phone is compatible. </p><p>  Should the headphone look stylish?  Some of the best bluetooth headsets provide comfort through appearance.  If the owner needs to maintain an image, then experts recommend paying attention to small headphones with a stylish finish that look like a fashion accessory, rather than an ugly outgrowth on the head. </p><p>  Do you have to go far from the phone?  Headsets vary significantly in how far they allow you to move away from the signal source before the sound starts to distort.  Some models limit the user to a radius of 4‚Äì5 m, while others allow you to move 15 meters or more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proheadset.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plantronics M55 Bluetooth Headset" class="if uuid-2543774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2543774.jpg"></div><h2>  Purchase tactics </h2><p>  No matter how carefully the Bluetooth headset has been tested in the store, one cannot be sure of what the user will feel after a day of making calls and listening to music.  Therefore, before buying, experts recommend that you familiarize yourself with the return policy to make sure that it is possible to return the wrong device.  Some manufacturers offer a 30-day money back guarantee on products purchased through their websites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Plantronics Domination </h2><p>  Until recently, there were 2 major players in the wireless headset market: Aliph Jawbone and Plantronics.  The best choice was the 2014 Aliph Jawbone Era.  However, recently its availability has become limited.  Although it can be bought from the manufacturer, but only in the basic black version, and not in the many chic colors that once were the main marketing difference of this model.  Most retail sites do not offer this model at all. </p><p>  With this in mind, Plantronics has become one of the best-known manufacturers of wireless headsets.  She offers more than a dozen models, and her offers receive consistently positive reviews from specialized websites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plantronics voyager edge" class="if uuid-2538810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2538810.jpg"></div><p>  Users call Plantronic Voyager Edge (worth about 5 thousand rubles) the best in the <span>ranking of Bluetooth headsets</span> .  This is the best choice for the reason that it is among the top-rated models.  All users agree that the headset provides first-class communication quality, clearly transmits voices and blocks background noise.  The only thing she is unsure of coping with is calls from a moving car, since the sound of the wind is poorly suppressed. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Bluetooth headset is very convenient.  It is incredibly small and light - just over 63 mm in length and weighs about 9 g. Since the earphone is not at the ear hole, it is more difficult to position it correctly than in-ear models like the Jawbone Era. </p><p>  Experts and owners find it easy to use Voyager Edge.  The physical controls and voice commands are intuitive, and the headset can easily pair with two devices at the same time.  Users respond differently about its range.  If in some tests voice transmission becomes unstable already at a distance of 4.5 m and completely disappears at 7.5 m, then in others they talk about confident support for connections at a distance of up to 15 m for calls and an impressive 26 m for streaming music through A2DP . </p><p>  The Edge battery lasts 6 hours on talk time or 7 days on standby.  This is a good result, although not the best.  However, the headset comes with a charging case, which can give up to 10 additional hours of talk time. </p><p>  A rather large difference in user reviews is probably due to the fact that some suppliers sell gray models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plantronics Voyager Legend Headset" class="if uuid-2543559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2543559.jpg"></div><h2>  Plantronics Voyager Legend </h2><p>  The best Bluetooth headsets provide convenience, comfort, functionality and performance, but if the user is willing to make some modest concessions, he can save a little and find a good alternative at a more modest price. </p><p>  The older Plantronics Voyager Legend model shows similar results with Edge in professional tests and is no less popular among buyers.  It supports most Edge features, including voice commands, A2DP, and multipoint connectivity.  But it is 17 g heavier, significantly larger and does not look so stylish.  If the Edge is held in place by a tiny loop that rests under the ear cartilage, then the Legend is equipped with an old-school connector that spans the entire ear.  Therefore, the device is much more noticeable when worn.  Nevertheless, a larger loop provides ease of management, and most users find it comfortable to wear even with glasses. </p><p>  In terms of performance, Legend pretty much matches Edge.  The headset has problems with wind noise, but otherwise the sound transmission is excellent.  As for battery life, the battery lasts longer.  The battery provides up to 7 hours of talk time or 11 days of standby time. </p><p>  On the other hand, unlike Edge, Legend does not have a stand-alone charger, so when the battery is exhausted, the user must find a power outlet, which is sometimes difficult.  For charging Legend, a non-standard connector is used, with which many owners have problems.  According to reviews, the magnet that must hold the cable sometimes does not cope with its task, so the headset does not always charge.  Worse, the cable is only 30 cm long, so if there are no free sockets on the desktop, you have to put the earphone on the floor.  But if the user is ready to put up with these troubles, then he will get the same performance and comfort as with Edge, but at a lower price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tech1iptv.bestservicez.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset" class="if uuid-2543783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2543783.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Bluetooth Headset </h2><p>  The design of the wireless headset of this well-known Chinese company received the prestigious IF Design Award of 2015. For the decoration of Xiaomi Mi Bluetooth Headset, resistant Japanese paint with grease repellent properties is used.  The manufacturer offers 3 types of silicone earbuds, created on the basis of the analysis of 2000 forms of ears. </p><p>  Xiaomi Bluetooth headset measures 5.6 cm in height and 1 cm in diameter, weighs 6.5 g, provides 5 hours of talk time and a week of standby time.  The battery is fully charged within 2 hours. </p><p>  Supports simultaneous wireless connection to 2 devices.  For crisp and clear sound, a special speaker design is used that improves the human voice and sound in general.  Narrowing the outlet to 3 mm increases the quality of the automatic noise reduction system. </p><p>  Xiaomi Mi Headset with Bluetooth version 4.1 is compatible with 4G networks and does not cause mutual interference.  Silicone microphone provides much better sound than conventional models. </p><p>  The device supports voice commands of the navigator.  With music turned on loudly, the navigation directions will be clearly audible. </p><p>  The working range of the headset is 10 m. </p><h2>  Plantronics Explorer 500 </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the biggest drawback of Legend and Edge is that they do not work well in a moving car or other places where a strong wind noise is heard.  If this problem occurs, then you should pay attention to the Plantronics Explorer 500. According to the owners, the headset is superior to all other models in this indicator, including those that are 2-3 times more expensive.  It maintains a stable signal at a distance of 16 m for voice calls and 29 m for streaming music.  The battery lasts more than 7 hours, about one hour ahead of Edge. </p><p>  However, in other respects, Explorer 500 is not as impressive as other models of the same manufacturer.  Voice quality is good, but not outstanding.  Separate background noises are heard, and some users complain that the volume of incoming calls is too low.  The model supports only the most basic voice commands, and it does not come with a stand-alone charger.  On the plus side, the Explorer 500 is charged via the microUSB connector, so the owner does not need to carry a non-standard cable with him everywhere. </p><p>  The headset is even smaller than Edge, and has the same type of headphone and loop placement.  It is suitable for most users, but some complain that it is inconvenient or even painful for prolonged use.  The offer of the model is a bit limited, but you can buy it directly from the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="macsources.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jabra talk 2" class="if uuid-2543563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2543563.jpg"></div><h2>  Jabra talk 2 </h2><p>  The Jabra Talk 2 Bluetooth headset, although it does not have all the functionality of high-end models, provides the essentials: excellent sound at both ends of the communication line, convenient design and sufficient operating range, allowing you to move away from your smartphone if necessary.  One of the opportunities to sacrifice is ANC technology, although the device does a good job with background noise. </p><p>  One charge is enough for 9 hours of conversation.  In addition to features such as answering and ending a call, dialing the last number, changing the volume, muting the microphone and voice dialing, the Jabra Talk 2 Bluetooth headset offers communication with Internet assistants Siri or Cortana. </p><h2>  Plantronics m55 </h2><p>  Users who are too financially constrained should consider purchasing the <span>Plantronics M55.</span>  This amazingly inexpensive headset supports many features, including A2DP, voice commands, and multi-point connectivity.  And the battery life is hard to beat.  According to user reviews, paired with the iPhone model provides 8.5 hours of conversation.  In standby mode, it can last up to 16 days thanks to a special Deep Sleep mode, which saves battery power. </p><p>  However, the performance of the M55 is not so impressive.  The voices are clear in quiet situations, but, according to reviews, a lot of background noise is heard on a busy street.  Users like the M55's sound quality, compact size and amazing battery life.  However, many are unhappy with the fact that the headset comes with only one earbud, so people with different ear sizes should order it separately.  In addition, owners are calling for a rather limited range of Bluetooth.  But if you need to have a cheap and reliable device that will be used indoors, then the price of M55 is 1850 rubles.  hard to beat. </p>
