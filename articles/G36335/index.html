    <h2>  General tips and tricks </h2><p>  To make the race reliable, high-quality and durable, all the nuances should be considered in advance before starting its construction.  In this case, you should pay attention to the following factors: </p><ol><li>  If the house on the land has not yet been built, then you should carefully consider its location. </li><li>  If the building is not located at the very border of the site, then entering the site through a ditch (in St. Petersburg, for example) can be built in any convenient place, since this will not affect the convenience of its operation.  If the house will be built on either side of the land, then the race should be erected in the opposite direction. </li><li>  Check in width.  To move through it conveniently and safely, it must be at least six meters.  In this case, the width of the pipe should also be taken into account.  Its edges should be 1-2 meters beyond the limits of the race.  If this rule is not provided, then the pipe will constantly clog, and its cleaning will be very problematic. </li></ol><p>  There are some other nuances, but they are secondary, so they can be ignored in the construction of the race. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Do-it-yourself phased construction of the race through the ditch </h2><p>  Check-in should be convenient and reliable, therefore it is very important to adhere to the general building rules.  Indeed, you will agree that it will be very unpleasant to fall into a ditch by car when crossing through it.  To make a reliable approach to the site through the ditch, it is necessary to strictly observe a certain sequence of work that is carried out in stages. </p><h2>  Stage 1: building a pillow </h2><p>  The first step is to pour a pillow, which will provide water drainage and create reliable stability for <span>concrete pillars.</span>  To do this, you need to clean the ditch well, and then lay a concrete pipe 2.5 meters long and 0.5 m in diameter on its bottom. A plastic corrugated pipe with a diameter of 460 mm and a length of six meters is placed inside.  A pillow of crushed stone is poured on top of the pipes.  Such a device to enter the site through the ditch is not only reliable and durable, but will also prevent clogging of the ditch with garbage. </p>

    <h2>  Stage 2: installing backwater </h2><p>  To prevent water from eroding the embankment, it is necessary to erect two retaining walls, one on each side of the ditch.  To do this, sand or granite plummet is first poured, after which metal reinforcement is mounted, which is poured with concrete mortar.  It is very important to choose a suitable day for pouring concrete.  The air temperature should be at least 5 degrees, and also there should be no precipitation.  After pouring concrete, it must be allowed to stand for about six days, so that the mortar is completely dry and strong. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Stage 3: completion of work </h2><p>  After concrete hardens, the ditch is covered with gravel on both sides.  So that the water does not wash out the sand, the entrance to the site through the ditch is covered with geotextiles from above.  On this, all construction works are considered completed, but it is not recommended to immediately start operating the race, since it needs at least three days to shrink. </p>

    <h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Check-in to the summer cottage through the ditch, the construction process of which is described above, is very strong and durable, but how much will its construction cost?  If you carry out all the work yourself, without involving specialists, then the purchase of all the necessary materials will require about 20,000 rubles.  At the same time, you can save some money if you build a race with your neighbors.  It is not recommended to reduce the cost of construction by purchasing cheaper and lower-quality materials, since they have low durability, and such a design will last relatively short. </p><p>  Despite the fact that 20 thousand rubles seems to be a rather large amount, nevertheless it is much cheaper than ordering a check-in at the site through the turnkey ditch at companies specializing in such installation.  Such a race will cost you at least 30,000 rubles, which is much more expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Check in from the sleepers </h2><p>  Railway sleepers have a special impregnation, which gives the tree excellent resistance to negative environmental factors and excellent durability.  Thanks to this, sleepers are widely used in construction for the construction of various structures.  This also applies to arrival at the summer cottage, which will turn out to be very reliable and will last quite a long time. </p>

Arriving at the site through the ditch from the sleepers will be much cheaper than the option discussed earlier.  However, it should be borne in mind the fact that sleepers also have some disadvantages.  Firstly, the resin, which is impregnated with wood, has a very sharp, strong and unpleasant odor, and secondly, sleepers do not belong to the most durable types of materials, therefore it is impossible to use them for trucks, since they may not support the weight of the vehicle and break or go apart.

    <h2>  Reinforced concrete structures </h2><p>  Access to the site through the ditch can be equipped with reinforced concrete slabs.  However, this method is only suitable if the soil has a high hardness on a site.  Otherwise, over time, the entire structure will sag very much and it will be impossible to pass on it normally.  With a sufficiently solid base, reinforced concrete structures can withstand even freight transport. </p><p>  However, if reinforced concrete slabs are used, it is worth considering the fact that, despite their high strength and durability, they also have certain disadvantages, among which are: </p><ul><li>  for transportation and installation of the structure in place, special equipment is needed; </li><li>  very high cost of material; </li><li>  the need to perform a special analysis of soil rocks before the construction of reinforced concrete race, which requires additional financial costs. </li></ul><p>  Thus, before the construction of the reinforced concrete race, you should very well weigh the pros and cons, so as not to regret later.  Too high cost of materials and complexity of construction make this option not the most successful solution in most cases. </p>

    <h2>  Advice on how to enter the site </h2><p>  So, now you know how to make a trip to the site through the ditch, so it's time to talk about its improvement.  This should be approached very seriously, since the entrance is not only used to transport vehicles across the ditch, but also creates the first impression of the owner of the site.  Therefore, the race should be not only reliable, strong and durable, but also beautiful. </p><p>  In most cases, the refinement is carried out at the stage of laying tracks, however, this process can be independent in nature.  Many people stop only at the construction of the race, believing that its arrangement is very problematic and too expensive.  If you hire specialists, this entails additional costs, since their services are not cheap, but if you do everything yourself, you can do with minimal investment. </p><p>  In order to best determine how the race should be arranged, you need to take into account the construction technology that you will use when building the race.  It should also be considered for what purpose the race will be used. </p><p>  Most often it serves to perform the following tasks: </p><ul><li>  delivery to the country plot of land and sand; </li><li>  garbage removal; </li><li>  unloading on the site of furniture, household appliances and other interior items; </li><li>  import of building materials. </li></ul><p>  Especially in a reliable race need people involved in the garden.  The presence of an entrance in this case greatly simplifies the performance of many tasks. </p>

Therefore, before starting any work, you should carefully consider all the little things, and only after that start any construction work.  If you act in accordance with a specific instruction, then no problems in the process of building a race will arise.
