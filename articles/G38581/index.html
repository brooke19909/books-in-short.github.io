    <p>  In this article, we will consider what services are provided by this company, how its work is conducted, and what customers think about it. </p><h2>  OPS </h2><p>  <span>Compulsory pension insurance</span> is a system by which the state directly engages in the formation of a source of financing for the pensions of its citizens.  At the same time, those people who are subject to the OPS may be called insured persons, and in the event of an insured event, such as disability or simply reaching the appropriate age, the Concord Pension Fund is involved in further payments to citizens.  Customer reviews suggest that at the moment, the fund basically does not violate its obligations, despite the fact that some people have certain problems. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who are the insured? </h2><p>  In this case, the insured is any citizen of the Russian Federation or a person who lives temporarily on the territory of the Russian Federation, if he: </p><ul><li>  works in accordance with a drawn up labor or civil law contract; </li><li>  has independent job support (lawyer, notary, farmer or private entrepreneur); </li><li>  It works outside the country, but at the same time steadily pays insurance premiums to the fund. </li></ul><p>  If the person is indeed an insured person, he must have a corresponding certificate stating his personal data, as well as an individual insurance number.  The issuance of <span>an insurance certificate is</span> carried out after applying to the Pension Fund or in the case of the first employment.  Today, more than 100 million people in Russia are insured. </p><h2>  Insurers </h2>

    <p>  Of course, the dominant administrator in this case is the <span>Pension Fund of Russia,</span> which manages all pension funds.  But in fact, in parallel with this fund, non-state pension funds or the corresponding management companies can also act as an insurer, but exclusively for the formation of the so-called funded pension.  The insurer is engaged in the gradual accumulation of insurance premiums by insured persons, and at the same time, they invest these funds through specialized management companies. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The insured person, who provides himself with a funded pension, has the opportunity to completely independently choose an insurer who will manage the funds, and many choose the Consent Pension Fund.  Customer reviews note not only stable payments and capital growth, but also a professional service that provides support to each client. </p><h2>  Co-financing </h2><p>  In accordance with applicable law, since 2009, the Russian Federation has been implementing a program for co-financing of accumulative pension capital.  Thanks to this, citizens have a unique opportunity to significantly increase their own pension in the future by drawing up an agreement with an organization such as the Pension Fund ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù.  Customer reviews often mention this service, as it allows you to simultaneously receive payments from state and non-state pension funds. </p><p>  In accordance with this program, any citizen has the right to transfer individual contributions to the funded part.  If you participate in this program, you will have the opportunity to significantly expand the amount of the funded part of the future pension.  It is worth noting that all additional contributions will double over the next 10 years, but the only condition in this case is to make at least 2,000 rubles a year.  There is also one limitation - the surcharge can be no more than 12,000 rubles annually.  In this regard, the maximum possible addition to the <span>funded part of the pension</span> from the state is 120,000 rubles. </p><p>  In accordance with federal law, the deadline for accepting applications was expired at the beginning of 2015. </p><h2>  Work with non-governmental fund </h2>

    <p>  The non-state pension fund ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù also allows you to take part in a voluntary financing program that allows you to significantly expand the total funded part of the pension, using not only an increase from the state, but also investment income, which will be constantly charged by the fund to your account. </p><p>  Clients often ask whether this program is available to those pensioners who are not working or are currently working.  In accordance with changes in the current legislation, the state will co-finance contributions of only those participants who have not previously received a pension through the Pension Fund of Russia, but this rule does not affect people who entered the program before the beginning of October 2014. </p><h2>  What are the advantages of this service? </h2><ul><li>  Contributions made will continue to grow over time; </li><li>  in the end, you can get a very, very good increase in your pension; </li><li>  you receive a constant investment income, which is provided to you by the Non-state Pension Fund ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù; </li><li>  there are no restrictions on what the size of the deductions may be; </li><li>  the period and amount of contributions made, as well as the period of your participation in this program, you can determine completely independently; </li><li>  it is possible to receive a special tax deduction from each amount that you will pay to your funded part of the pension within the framework of this program; </li><li>  accumulated funds can be inherited by successors both during the accumulation process and after the insured person retires. </li></ul><h2>  How effective is this fund? </h2>

    <p>  According to customer reviews, it is impossible to determine in terms of how efficiently the Concord <span>Non-State Pension Fund</span> works.  Feedback from lawyers is another matter, as these people conduct a thorough analysis of the activities of modern companies, and may also intersect with them in the course of various legal proceedings. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that the Expert RA rating agency assigned this company an extremely high level of reliability, which already indicates a good reputation of this company in the insurance market. </p><h2>  Non-state fund or state? </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting the accumulated profitability of the company, equal to 30.55% over the past three years.  This indicator significantly exceeds that which is observed in the state management company, since in it over the same period the accumulated yield is only 15.95% in accordance with the securities portfolio, as well as 19.68% in accordance with the expanded investment portfolio. </p><p>  9.84% per year the company receives from investing pension savings funds, replenishing the accounts of its customers.  At the same time, 11.44% is the profitability that was distributed across various pension accounts at the time of the end of 2013.  It is worth noting the fact that at that time it was one of the highest rates among all companies working in this field.  At the same time, in 2012, the yield was 12.7% and represented the highest rate among all similar organizations. </p><p>  Being a successor, in the process of work, the joint-stock fund uses the most effective practices that ensure a consistently high quality of service, as well as sufficiently high and at the same time stable rates of return on invested pension savings, which made it possible to form a loyalty and trust loan from clients to how the Concord Non-State Pension Fund works.  Feedback from lawyers suggests that any legal proceedings with this organization are much less frequent in comparison with many other financial institutions. </p><h2>  How are payments made? </h2>

    <p>  Clients are given the opportunity to receive a pension if they have already reached retirement age, but in addition to this, it is also planned to pay the funded part of the pension earlier than this period.  This category includes citizens whose work is associated with harmful types of production, or those who live in rather harsh climatic conditions.  It should be noted right away that this list is regulated by the current legislation, so you should familiarize yourself with it before engaging in clarifying the various nuances. </p><p>  A one-time payment of the entire accumulated amount is possible in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  a person receives a retirement pension due to the loss of a breadwinner or because of a disability; </li><li>  the pension is obtained in accordance with the state pension, but there is no right to determine a retirement pension due to the lack of necessary insurance experience; </li><li>  the total amount of the funded part of the pension does not reach 5% of the total amount of labor retirement pensions. </li></ul><p>  Urgent payments after less than 10 years are possible if the person is a member of the pension co-financing program and at the same time forms his own pension savings thanks to participation in this program (in other words, he made additional insurance contributions for the funded part).  Also, if the savings were formed through the use of family capital or a certain part of it, you are provided with an urgent payment by the Non-State Pension Fund ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù.  Whether it‚Äôs worth joining the program under such conditions is already a personal choice of each person, since for many these conditions are quite acceptable, while others are absolutely not suitable. </p><h2>  How to make a payment? </h2><p>  Pension registration is initially carried out directly at the main office, which is located on Leningradsky Prospekt in Moscow, but for those people who are not able to do this, there is the possibility of sending the application by mail or through the corresponding pension terminal, which can be found if you go to the site owned by the Non-State Pension Fund "Consent".  Is it worth joining in this case - the choice is entirely yours, since everyone has different concepts about the quality of service. </p><p>  Immediately it is worth noting the fact that you can significantly speed up the general procedure for registration in the event that you make a call to the company first.  Thus, you will have the opportunity to consult in advance regarding the various nuances regarding the application, as well as the timing of their adoption. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of working with this fund? </h2>

    <p>  Of course, people often think about whether or not to work with NPF Soglasie at all.  Someone already out of habit does not trust any financial institutions, while others show a desire to invest in such a company, but at the same time doubt which one to choose the best.  That is why it is worth considering several advantages of working with this fund. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  Of course, the total size of your future pension will directly depend on the profitability of NPF Soglasie.  Even if the difference is only a few percent per annum, over the course of 20-30 years you can increase your own pension by more than two times.  According to the results of the last three years, the organization‚Äôs profitability is 30.55%, which is a very, very good result, especially when compared with the successes of other organizations. </p><p>  Everyone understands that the worst thing that can happen for the fund and all its customers is the lack of growth in savings, but current statistics so far indicate that NPF Soglasie does not threaten, therefore, there are practically no people among the reviewers, wishing to terminate the contract. </p><p>  The company is trying as carefully as possible to choose the direction for investment in order to provide its customers and, accordingly, to themselves the maximum possible income.  It is far from a secret that modern state funds are created by specialized financial and industrial groups, as a result of which investments are made primarily in the interests of such companies, and not investors.  At the same time, the management team and chairman of the board Yevgeny Dobrovolsky (NPF Soglasie) have no ties with such structures, so they try to invest savings in joint interests with clients. </p><p>  Having vast managerial experience, as well as thoroughly understanding their fields of activity, specialists choose the best areas for investment, as evidenced by the consistently high level of profitability of the organization in comparison with competitors. </p><h2>  Convenience </h2>

    <p>  Working with this company, even according to customer reviews, is extremely convenient, and first of all, many respond to professional service.  Simply call or write a letter so that managers begin to deal with your issue.  The founders of NPF Soglasie are constantly trying to ensure that the company provides the highest quality service and increases profitability.  If you are going to become a client of the company, professional specialists will instantly take upon themselves any worries about your future well-being, while you can control your own funds through the phone or a specialized pension terminal. </p><p>  Branches of NPF Soglasie are located throughout the country, so anyone can come and get advice or become a client of the company, regardless of where they live.  It is also a rather important advantage for many. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  Of course, this indicator is the most exciting for the majority of modern citizens who are interested in proposals from the Consent organization.  <span>The Pension Fund,</span> whose <span>rating</span> is today one of the highest among similar organizations, has been operating since 1994 and at the same time retains a reputation as a truly reliable financial structure that provides extremely successful services related to non-state pension provision in various companies.  As of 06/15/15, the total amount of pension savings in this organization reaches 21 billion rubles. </p><p>  Also, the Non-State Pension Fund Concord OJSC has a registered capital of 150 million rubles. </p><p>  All retirement savings are guaranteed.  To date, the Non-State Pension Fund ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù is also included in the register of state pension funds.  The contract that you conclude with this company is insured by the state, since the company is a member of the guarantee system of the rights of each insured person. </p><h2>  License revocation </h2><p>  It is worth noting the fact that many people believe that the work of this fund was officially discontinued, but in fact it is not.  At NPF Soglasie, the license was canceled voluntarily, as management decided that the development of two funds at the same time was not practical.  After the cancellation of this license, a joint stock fund with the same name began to work in the same mode.  All duties and rights related to mandatory pension insurance from non-state pension funds were transferred to him, and no decision was made to terminate the contract with anyone. </p>
