    <p>  The city of Kropotkin, the administrative center of the Caucasus region, is located on the Kuban-Priazovskaya lowland of the Krasnodar Territory in Russia. </p><p>  Its exact area is 85.2 km¬≤.  Taking these figures into account, we can confidently state the high density of the population living here, and this is today more than 80,000 people. </p><p>  It can be called an important transport hub of the Kuban.  Here the most important automobile and railway routes of our country intersect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But in general, the modern city of Kropotkin, whose sights cannot but bewitch, is a beautiful, quiet, well-maintained and actively developing city.  Without meeting him personally, it‚Äôs even hard to imagine that in terms of the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãall green spaces he occupies an honorable second place in the region after Anapa. </p><p>  It should also be noted that it has a rather rich distinctive history and many archaeological sites. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2>

    <p>  The activities of A.V. Suvorov in the Kuban are inextricably linked with the history of the foundation of a settlement called the city of Kropotkin (Krasnodar Territory).  It was on his instructions that here, on the banks of the river, the first Cossack guard post was established, initially fortified by a small redoubt. </p><p>  The settlement of the adjacent territory has been active since 1778, when the Romanovsky post was established. </p><p>  On June 18, 1874, the first train was sent from a well-equipped railway station. </p><p>  And finally, in 1894, the first census was conducted in the Romanovsky farm, according to which, there were already 959 yards and 8147 inhabitants in this territory. </p><p>  However, the mass resettlement here, of course, did not end there, and in 1905 there were already 1,619 yards and about 20 thousand people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On February 4, 1921, the Romanovsky farm was renamed the city of Kropotkin.  The Krasnodar Territory was replenished with another territorial unit, which received its name in honor of the then famous scientist, geographer and geologist, anarchist theorist P. A. Kropotkin. </p><h2>  City symbols </h2>

    <p>  Not so long ago, on June 30, 2005, the local emblem was approved.  It is based on the glorious history of the origin of the village. </p><p>  The purple emblem depicts Cossack golden tiled spears with tassels and a sentinel tower.  Color symbolizes fame, dignity and nobility.  It was also once used in the form of Don Cossacks, who were the first inhabitants and defenders of these places. </p><p>  Between the gold spears, two green stripes are distinguished, also crossed among themselves.  They symbolize the intersection of roads, because the city of Kropotkin (Krasnodar Territory), as mentioned above, is a large transport hub where many railway lines and motorways intersect. </p><p>  A flag was developed on the basis of the coat of arms, which was approved on November 24, 2005.  The banner is purple with a slanting green cross below, crowned with four golden spears with tassels, and a sentinel tower of the same color at the top. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Local Attractions </h2>

Tourists always admire its picturesque landscapes and the beauty of green spaces.  Of course, in this case, the main merit belongs to the amazing, almost unique climate of the area.  Winters here are quite mild, and in summer the air warms up to a mark of +30 <sup>o</sup> C. This is what makes the city comfortable for visiting throughout the year.  Even in rainy autumn, a lack of guests, as a rule, is not observed.
