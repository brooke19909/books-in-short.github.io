    <h2>  Choosing a satellite tuner: basic parameters </h2><p>  What characteristics are most significant when choosing a device such as a tuner for a <span>satellite dish?</span>  First of all, it is a signal transmission interface.  Most modern <span>satellite receivers are</span> digital.  But there are analog devices, as well as those that operate when using a combined interface such as D2-MAC. </p><p>  Many users and experts believe that T2 is one of the standards that a modern digital tuner must support.  That is, the devices must be compatible with the second generation of a highly efficient multimedia stream compression algorithm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Very important from the point of view of <span>ensuring the quality of the</span> image in satellite tuners is such a component as a satellite position fixation chip, as well as a module for automatically selecting the position of the antenna.  If the tuner for satellite TV is equipped with the appropriate hardware component, the owner of the TV will be able to view more programs. </p><p>  Another significant characteristic of the device in question is the size of the intermediate frequency band read by the receiver from the converter microcircuits, which converts the frequencies related to high to low.  The larger the value of the parameter in question, the more programs can be viewed using a TV tuner for satellite dishes.  A figure between 900 and 2150 is considered to be quite decent. Satellite tuners that support the corresponding bands are compatible with a large number of converter models. </p><h2>  Tuner selection criteria: appearance and support for connectors </h2><p>  There are quite a few criteria according to which you can choose a device such as a satellite tuner.  These include the appearance of the device, as well as the number and variety of supported connectors.  A significant factor in choosing a device such as a TV tuner for satellite dishes is the appearance and the convenience of controlling the device.  It is highly desirable that the receiver has its own display, which will display various data on the current tasks solved by the device.  For many users, a significant factor when choosing a tuner is the presence of buttons for controlling channels, adjusting volume, and also accessing the menu, moreover, directly on the front panel of the device.  They may come in handy if at some point the remote is unavailable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, on modern models of receivers on the front side there is a connector for installing access cards to paid channels, various decoding interfaces, USB ports used to connect flash drives and external hard drives to which you can record broadcasts.  On the rear panel of the receiver, the presence of such interfaces as: </p><ul><li>  RS232, used to connect the device to a PC (most often used when updating the receiver's firmware). </li><li>  S / PDIF, which is used to connect the tuner to various audio devices, as well as to home theaters. </li><li>  HDMI - interface for transferring pictures in high definition. </li></ul>

    <p>  Thus, a TV with a satellite tuner, which has the characteristics listed above, in terms of appearance and connector support can be considered quite consistent with modern trends in the market of devices in question. </p><h2>  Satellite tuner selection: functional </h2><p>  The next group of criteria for choosing a device of this type is related to its functionality.  Which ones deserve special attention? </p><p>  First of all, it is a supported standard for transmitting television pictures.  There is a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù format, which many experts consider outdated, but quite relevant, - MPEG2, and there is a more technologically advanced - MPEG4.  The main difference between them is the resolution of the transmitted image.  So, a satellite tuner supporting MPEG4 standard HD-image transmits without problems, but one that is compatible only with the MPEG2 format, can hardly provide the necessary bitrate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The next most important characteristic of the device in question is the presence of an Ethernet port, with which the device can be connected to the Internet, PC or LAN.  Thanks to this function, receivers can be used as a standalone element in a network infrastructure, for example, to provide shared access to broadcasts. </p><p>  Many modern users believe that their satellite tuner should support the CI standard, which allows you to connect decoding modules.  The corresponding hardware components are characterized by universality: they can be used to receive a signal from both open and closed broadcasts. </p><p>  Another remarkable feature of the satellite receiver is the presence of a built-in hard drive.  The appropriate medium can be used primarily for recording television programs. </p><p>  But in many models of receivers it is recommended that you use an external hard drive, rather than an internal one.  The satellite tuner in this case is equipped with a high-speed port for connecting the corresponding hardware components, usually USB. </p><p>  Other popular functions of modern receivers include: </p><ul><li>  support for card sharing options; </li><li>  compatibility with the Multiboot function, which allows the device to be downloaded both with the help of the factory software, and with the help of interfaces written to external media; </li><li>  <span>spectrum analyzer,</span> which allows optimizing the procedure for detecting satellites, as well as tuning the reception of signals from them; </li><li>  the function of monitoring bitrate and other information about the broadcast picture; </li><li>  the presence of additional tuners that allow you to simultaneously view one channel and record another (or several); </li><li>  the presence of an internal network card that can provide the operation of a highly efficient local area network; </li><li>  Wi-Fi connectivity </li><li>  the ability to play video files, photos and other multimedia files on the TV screen; </li><li>  Support for online broadcasts from major video hosting sites. </li></ul>

    <p>  The device‚Äôs functions such as noise reduction, sound effects generation are also very useful.  Their presence can significantly increase the broadcast of audio data via satellite.  Many users believe that satellite tuners should have such mandatory options as a timer, parental control, and displaying channel information on a TV screen. </p><p>  Thus, we can distinguish, relatively speaking, the basic functions of receivers, as well as those that can complement them and at the same time be in demand due to modern market trends.  However, the level of their support directly affects the cost of devices.  This pattern is typical for most electronic devices, satellite tuners are no exception.  Prices for devices of the corresponding type to a certain extent depend on the range of technologies they support. </p><p>  How expensive can a satellite receiver be?  Modern models of devices of the corresponding type cost about 3-7 thousand rubles.  There are more expensive models - for 10 thousand rubles.  There are premium devices for 30 thousand rubles or more.  As many experts note, the price difference between receivers from different brands, in general, is quite logical, taking into account the functions supported by each model of the tuner, the build quality of the device, as well as the level of technology implemented in it. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  Another group of receiver selection criteria is the characteristics of hardware, hardware components that are responsible for the performance of the device.  Among them - the processor clock speed.  In modern models, through which high-definition satellite TV is broadcast, the presence of chips operating at a frequency of 400 MHz and higher is required.  A significant factor in tuner performance is the amount of RAM.  It is desirable that it be more than 256 MB. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Modern manufacturers of satellite receivers install a variety of types of software firmware on manufactured devices.  Among the most popular are those based on the Linux kernel.  The main advantage is the ability to refine the corresponding software due to its openness.  Also, many manuals on how to configure a satellite tuner are often compiled with the expectation that the Linux OS is installed on the device used by the reader.  This OS allows developers of software for devices of this type various plug-ins.  In addition, the ability to adjust the OS program code installed on the receiver facilitates the repair of satellite tuners. </p><h2>  Top Tuners: Brand Overview </h2><p>  Now consider what brands you can focus on when choosing a receiver.  The most popular in Russia include devices that are issued by companies such as: </p><ul><li>  Openbox </li><li>  World Vision. </li><li>  Gi. </li><li>  General Satellite. </li></ul><p>  We study their specifics in more detail. </p><h2>  Openbox Tuners: Key Features </h2><p>  Good satellite tuners supplies the Openbox brand to the market.  Among the most common of its modifications is the X 800/810/820 receiver.  This device is characterized by low cost and good functionality.  The considered satellite tuner works with the use of DVB-S interfaces.  Using the devices in question, you can comfortably watch satellite TV of the most popular Russian providers, such as NTV Plus, Rainbow, and Tricolor.  The device in question can be connected to a computer, as well as to a router. </p>

    <p>  Another noteworthy line of satellite tuners from Openbox is the S5 / S7 / S8 line of devices.  What are their most noteworthy features? </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that satellite tuners of this series can function in the DVB-S2 standard and reproduce the picture in HDTV format.  You can also pay attention to the fact that the devices of this line are equipped with hard drives. </p><p>  The SX4 Base HD satellite tuners from the brand in question are quite effective and reliable.  Among its most remarkable features is the presence of a built-in power supply, as a result of which the dimensions of the device are noticeably larger than many other models.  The device supports Internet connection via Ethernet port.  In addition, you can use a Wi-Fi adapter that connects to a USB port.  The receiver does not have a built-in Wi-Fi module.  The device is controlled by the Linux OS, so developers of specialized software for receivers can create the necessary plug-ins for the device.  The tuner supports the <span>HDMI connector</span> in version 1.4a, has the function of recording broadcasts. </p>
