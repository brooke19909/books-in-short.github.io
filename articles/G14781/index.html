    <p>  The design of HTC Desire 300 is quite similar to previous devices released by the company.  The corps did not undergo drastic changes.  Still, the smartphone is made of high-quality plastic, without any metal elements. </p><p>  The device is quite compact and fits comfortably in the hand.  With its dimensions, the device weighs only 120 grams.  Accordingly, working with the phone with one hand will be more than convenient. </p><p>  The HTC Desire 300 phone is manufactured in the usual colors for the company, namely black and white. </p><p>  In front of the device is a screen, a speaker, sensors, a camera, a logo and two touch buttons. </p><p>  The back of the device sheltered the speaker, the main camera and the same company sign. </p><p>  The bottom line has got a USB connector and a microphone, and the top one has a headphone jack and a power button.  On the side is the volume control. </p><p>  In general, the design without any frills.  The case of the device is very well assembled, and it may seem that it is complete. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  Installed display HTC Desire 300 has a diagonal of 4.3 inches.  The screen has nothing to boast of.  Resolution 800 by 480 does not add image quality.  If you look closely, you will notice pixels.  Smooths the impression of good behavior in the sun, as well as the brightness of the display. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In principle, the screen is relatively good due to the use of an LCD matrix.  The multi-touch and sensor response also live up to expectations. </p><p>  The company took care of the protection of the display by installing <span>tempered glass.</span>  Of course, the quality does not reach <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> but also acceptable.  If you recall that the device was released back in 2013, then many shortcomings will be written off by themselves. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The features available on HTC Desire 300 allow you to take pictures of good quality.  Despite the fact that the camera is only 5 megapixels, the resolution in it is 2592 for 1944. Photos will be slightly better than average quality. </p><p>  But the video recording leaves much to be desired.  The resolution is only 800 by 480, so using this feature will be one disappointment. </p><p>  In dark places, working with the camera will not work.  The lack of a flash makes itself felt.  It is strange that the company did not bother to install such an important part. </p><p>  The front camera has only 0.3 megapixels, which is suitable only for video communications and no more. </p><h2>  Filling </h2>

    <p>  The hardware is not able to provide proper performance.  Although HTC Desire 300 has a dual-core SnapDragon processor, this does not solve the problem.  Despite the performance of 1 GHz, the device copes only with the good work of the interface, but it provides very poor functioning of applications, and especially games. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another painful place of HTC Desire 300 is 512 MB of RAM.  Even for the 2013 device, such a characteristic is critically insufficient.  Actually, you should not expect advanced programs to work. </p><p>  The phone has 4 GB of memory, but in reality - 2.5, because part of it is installed system.  To increase the capacity, of course, you can use a memory card.  With it, the device works stably, without freezes and problems. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  For a smartphone with the Android operating system, the speakers work perfectly.  You won‚Äôt have to wait for an amazing sound, but there will be no wheezing either. </p><p>  The speaker will allow you to easily hear the interlocutor, it does not differ in special volume, but it is difficult to call it quiet. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The device HTC Desire 300 is served by "Android" with version 4.1.2.  This is an excellent choice for a device, although most applications will not work stably.  Moreover, the RAM is not enough to fulfill all the requests of such a new ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù. </p><p>  System update is also available.  4.3 will be installed without problems, and possibly a more modern version.  Of course, this will not bring much changes in terms of performance. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  Even a standard player does a great job with most music formats.  In fact, the smartphone player has a lot of useful features that make it easier to manage the playlist. </p><p>  But to run the video, especially in HD quality, you need an additional program.  Demanding clips are played without excesses.  Even with HD viewing, the device can easily cope. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The native battery is not able to provide long-term operation of HTC Desire 300. The battery capacity is only 1650 mAh.  Maybe with such a filling, such a capacity looks acceptable, but in reality, everything is fundamentally wrong.  The load on the smartphone empties the entire battery capacity in three hours.  In standby mode, the device can live for 15-20 hours.  Reducing the brightness of the display and sensitive supervision of the working functions will help to slightly alleviate the problem.  In this case, the work can be extended up to six hours. </p><h2>  Cost </h2>

    <p>  The price is worrying about HTC Desire 300 - about 7000-8000 rubles.  The device was produced as a budget, but in reality it got the price of a middle class model. </p><p>  Comparing the device in terms of specifications with other smartphones, you can seriously think about the feasibility of acquiring a phone.  Devices similar in parameters are almost two times cheaper.  Given that the device is hopelessly outdated, the price requested for HTC Desire 300 does not justify itself. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Along with the Desire 300 device, it is charging, a <span>USB</span> cable <span>,</span> pretty good quality <span>headphones</span> , a manual and a battery.  The device is delivered in an interesting, rounded box, which gives solidity. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  There are many sore spots in the Desire 300.  Start with a smaller battery.  The owner of the device will be very dependent on charging using a native battery. </p><p>  No less unpleasant fact was the camera without a flash.  Of course, the problem is not very big, but significantly reduces the effectiveness of the device. </p><p>  But the most painful place is the RAM.  By default, the phone consumes 200 MB, and there are only 512 of them. There is absolutely no performance left on applications, and even a good-quality processor does not save. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Oddly enough, even in an outdated device you can find its advantages.  Naturally, there are not many of them, but they exist. </p><p>  For example, despite its resolution, the screen provides a good picture.  For 2013, there is quite a decent display protection and its work in the sun. </p><p>  The dubious advantage is the use of not the oldest ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  It's nice to have an advanced system, but it‚Äôs not possible to realize this plus because of the filling. </p><p>  The advantages include the camera.  In light, the photos are pretty decent.  The camera installed in the device even now surpasses some budget models. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  At one time, the HTC Desire 300 smartphone received reviews full of enthusiasm for functionality and design.  Many people opted for this HTC device.  Even the high price did not scare buyers. </p><p>  Now, with the advent of a mass of new products, the impression of the device faded.  Nowadays, people prefer similar smartphones that have a lower price than HTC Desire 300. Reviews indicate that the device is outdated and no longer relevant. </p><p>  To come to a certain opinion, judging only by the characteristics, is rather difficult.  Only using the device, you can make your own impression of his work. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Although HTC Desire 300, the characteristics of which we reviewed, was popular, now it has been replaced by cheaper and more functional counterparts.  Even among HTC there is a worthy replacement for the device in its price category. </p><p>  Comparing the phone with modern state employees, we can say with confidence that the new products are many times superior to the device in all respects. </p><p>  Minor flaws of the Desire 300 in total do not create the best impression of the device. </p>
