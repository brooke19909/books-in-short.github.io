Yalta - although one of the most popular resorts of the peninsula, does not have its own airport terminal due to its geographical location.  The close proximity of mountains and the sea practically does not leave enough space for construction, and the project is unprofitable in cost.  As a result, the government continues to develop land communications between the cities of the peninsula. </p><h2>  Flights to Simferopol </h2><p>  Since the spring of 2014, the only Crimean airport has communication only with Russian cities.  International flights are prohibited due to the fact that after the annexation of Crimea to Russia, the territory of the peninsula is considered controversial. </p><p>  Russian carriers operate flights between Simferopol and major Russian cities.  Most departures to the Crimea take place from the capital, and there are both regular and charter flights.  Airlines flying to Crimea: Aeroflot, Globus, Siberia, Russia, Ural Airlines, Red Wings, Wim Avia. </p>

    <p>  The flight Moscow - Simferopol lasts from 2 hours 15 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes, such a short route is well tolerated by children, because they do not have time to get bored.  The cost of a round-trip ticket starts from 8,000 rubles, it all depends on the dates, carrier and other factors.  It is interesting that direct flights are even cheaper than those that operate with transfers.  And always keep track of promotional offers, for example, early ordering tickets (a few months before the trip) or, conversely, the latest offers (on the eve of departure). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simferopol Airport - Yalta: how to get there </h2><p>  In the beach season, the number of sides increases several times.  This maximally enlivens the <span>Simferopol airport.</span>  Yalta, Alushta, Feodosia, Alupka - any seaside resort will require several more hours on the road.  Numerous buses, minibuses, even trolleybuses leave for all cities, not to mention numerous taxis and private carriers.  Part of the transport leaves from a stop located 100-150 meters from the terminal building, the rest run from city bus stations.  The bulk of flights starts moving from the Kurortnaya station, located near the railway station. </p><p>  It is most convenient to get from the airport to the bus station at the station by tranexpress.  They appeared in mid-May 2015 and are represented by buses and trolleybuses plying between the airport and the station without intermediate stops.  Due to the absence of delays and the frequency of movement (every 10 minutes during the day, 20 minutes at night), tranexpress will get you to the city almost as fast as a taxi.  But the fare is much lower: a bus ticket costs 50 rubles, a trolleybus ticket is half the price. </p>

    <p>  When, at the end of your vacation, you are interested in the Yalta ‚Äì Simferopol airport route, you can also first get to the Kurortnaya bus station, and from it by express to the air port. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Way by car </h2><p>  The most comfortable type of transfer: left the airport, got into the car, arrived at the entrance to the hotel or any other necessary place.  No transfers and expectations at the bus stop, the ability to stop at any time and other amenities are more expensive than traveling by other means of transport. </p><p>  The cost of the car for the entire journey "Simferopol Airport - Yalta" starts from 2300 rubles.  Such a price is possible with a preliminary order, which can be done even in Russia or already upon arrival in the Crimea.  Carriers offer different levels of cars, there are both cars and beads for large families and companies.  For 2300-2500 rubles, Volkswagen Golf, Ford Focus, Opel Astra and similar cars will be served.  Want a more comfortable car?  It will cost 3300-4000 rubles: Volkswagen Passat, Toyota Camry, Skoda Superb and others.  Premium models cost 9-10 thousand rubles (Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7 Series, <span>Audi A7,</span> Lexus GX).  The price of a bus for 4-7 passengers will be in the range of 3500-7000 rubles, depending on the model.  Minibuses for 10-20 people will cost 5.5-7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Another advantage of an individual transfer is that the provided driver knows very well how to get from the airport to Yalta.  You just have to relax and enjoy the views of the peninsula.  The road will take an hour and a half, if you do not get into rush hour. </p>

    <h2>  The road as a tourist attraction </h2><p>  The routes of intercity trolleybuses connecting Simferopol with Yalta and Alushta can be taken as a separate excursion.  By the way, this trolleybus line was awarded the longest in the world, which is confirmed by the corresponding note in the Guinness Book of Records. </p><p>  There are two trolleybus routes from Simferopol to the <span>Yalta bus station:</span> No. 52 leaves from the station (Kurortnaya station), and No. 55 runs in the directions "Simferopol Airport - Yalta".  The fare is 98 rubles, the journey takes 3-3.5 hours.  The first flight leaves at 5 in the morning, the last at 8 in the evening, the frequency of movement is 15-30 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Bus - the most popular Crimean transport </h2><p>  Most of the transportation in the Crimea is carried out by bus.  There are many bus stations on the peninsula, through which hundreds of routes cover each local town.  There are direct flights to the Yalta central station from the airport terminal, but they do not go as often as we would like.  In order not to wait for the next flight, you can get to the railway station, and from there continue the route "Simferopol-Yalta Airport".  How to get to the station was described above (best by tranexpress). </p>
