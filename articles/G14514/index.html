It is known that already in the middle of the eighteenth century the Nokhchi (Chechens), united with the Ingush, completely formed their ethnic group.  Until that time, it is not known how long a kind of military-economic alliance, that is, Chechen teips, took shape. </p>

    <h2>  Legend </h2><p>  Legends say that the ancestors of the Chechens had a bronze cauldron with the names of the first twenty teip forged on it, but the cauldrons not included in this list were melted.  Nevertheless, the names of the original twenty have been preserved: Sesankhoi Ilesi-nekye, Benoy, Mlli-nekye, Yubak-nekye, Centora and the other fifteen. </p><p>  Chechen teips were united among themselves.  These large formations were called tukhums.  Already in the middle of the nineteenth century, nine Tukkhums were united by Chechen teips, of which there were one hundred thirty-five.  Today there are more of them, and they are divided into mountain, of which more than a hundred, and plains, of which about seventy.  Each teip inside is divided into branches and last names (Gar and Neki).  The chapter is the council of teip elders, where the most experienced and respected representatives rule the law, in addition, the post of commander-in-chief is mandatory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Clean and mixed </h2><p>  Chechen teips were called, the list of which will be presented as completely as possible, according to the locality where the clan lived, or the business the clan was engaged in.  For example, teip Kharachoy (translated into Russian - ‚Äúcave‚Äù) or teip Sharoy (translation - ‚Äúglacier‚Äù) are clearly named according to the first type, but teip Peshkhoy is teip tepniks, teip Khoy - guards, teip Deshni - jewelers for gold . </p><p>  There are teips pure and mixed.  Nokhchmakhoy - as any pure teip is called - formed purely from the Chechens, other blood was mixed with the rest.  Guna, for example, is related to the Terek Cossacks, Kharacha - to a large extent with Circassian blood, Dzumsoy - with Georgian, and Arsala - with Russian.  Thus, mixed Chechen teips are distinguished.  Their list is more extensive than nohchmakkhoy. </p>

    <h2>  The main thing for teip - the beginning </h2><p>  Since this is a tribal union, the personality of each Chechen is formed here and all moral and ethical standards are instilled in him.  These Chechens call postulates the beginnings.  Just started twenty three.  Some will be listed here.  The inviolability and unity of customs for all members of the teip, without exception, is the first beginning.  The second gives the right to land ownership on a community basis.  The third beginning is unlikely to correspond to the ideas of the rest of the civilized world - it prescribes blood feud for the murder of a relative by teip, and this does not even depend on the proximity of kinship.  To this day, pure Chechen teips are jealous of the laid principles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fourth beginning prohibits incest, that is, marriage between teip members is impossible.  Fifth, for mutual assistance, if necessary, the entire teip is obliged to provide assistance to its representative.  The sixth beginning, the Chechens call to honor the dead: if a member of the teip dies, mourning is worn for some period of time, holidays and entertainment are forbidden.  The seventh principle is about the council of elders, the eighth one is about choosing a leader and military leader, not a single post is inherited.  The ninth principle is about representation, which is also decided by the council of elders, and the tenth is that posts in the council of elders are lifelong, but the history of Chechen teips also tells about cases of deposition of the representative. </p>

    <h2>  Blood feud </h2><p>  The third principle, professed by Chechen teips and tukkhums, requires a wider disclosure.  So, the chir is a <span>blood feud</span> for any person from the representatives of this genus.  This is a custom with unusually deep roots.  Even in the recent past, in the event of a murder, a whole family name, and sometimes a teip, was forced to flee to foreign lands.  Qi - blood - passed over many decades from generation to generation until the last representative of a given surname, branch or teip was euthanized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In later times, blood passed only to one family, but earlier the council of the elders of neutral teips determined the borders of the chir. </p><p>  Immediately after the murder, the councils of elders gathered in the teip where the misfortune happened and in the fault through which it happened.  In the first, they made a decision about revenge, and in the second they looked for opportunities for reconciliation.  Further negotiations went on.  If the tape of the murdered person did not agree to reconciliation, then neutral councils of elders joined in.  If they did not win peace, then they began to develop conditions for revenge: how widespread revenge would be, what weapons.  Under no circumstances can a krovnik be killed in the back and without warning, during the holy month of Ramadan, as well as during other holidays, and one cannot kill in a public place, and even less so at a party. </p><h2>  Start decomposition system </h2><p>  Civilization takes its toll.  Researchers are confident that today the teip system in Chechnya is gradually dying.  Large teips - for example, Tsentaroy and Benoy - have grown so much that even consanguinity is forgotten and marriages within teips are possible.  Many of them are gradually divided into an increasing number of births, and the initial teip becomes tukhum. </p><p>  Many Chechens remember the time when the youngest of them could name more than twenty tribes of their own direct ancestors.  Now even not every young Chechen will answer about belonging to teip.  Adults and older people are noticeably worried, since kinship in Chechen society is fundamental.  People without tribal tribes cannot be Chechens. </p>

    <h2>  Noble Chechen teip </h2><p>  Ialkhoy, or rather, Yalhoroy, is a very famous teip.  It was from him that the name of Dudaev came from, and also this is one of the few teips in which there were newcomers hired workers, and according to other sources - slave labor.  The origin is connected with the caste professional organization, the soldiers of Yalhoroy even earned, guarding the borders of other teips. </p><p>  They lived in the village of the same name, as well as throughout Chechnya and in Ingushetia, where they founded the village.  The Yalchorites were the most loyal supporters of Johar Dudaev.  There is still a cult of militancy in this clan and many other purely mountain values: hospitality, veneration of women.  They have a decisive disposition and in their ancestors consider themselves to be people of princely dignity. </p><p>  Only a few Chechen teips have been studied quite well.  Their origin is established and confirmed by numerous studies of scientists.  There is much less known about the rest, and the information differs in view of the fact that it is collected most often from oral legends and traditions. </p><h2>  Chechen teip Devil (Chart) </h2><p>  This is an extremely interesting clan, most notable for the fact that the Chartoevites almost never fought, but on the contrary, they were peacekeepers and often acted as mediators in any intra-Chechen affairs.  Consisted either by himself, or in the tukhum by Nokhchmakhmakhoy - information is different. </p><p>  They had a generic village in Chechnya - Chartoi-yurt, but also lived in a dozen other towns in Chechnya and in Georgia.  Of the famous representatives was Naib Imam Shamil and a colonel in the guard of Alexander the First.  According to Chechen teips - of Jewish origin only the teip Chart, this explains the many differences of this clan from others. </p>

    <h2>  Belgata, Belta (Bilt) and Cherma </h2><p>  The rather large and famous throughout Chechnya teip of Belgoy once itself existed as part of the teip of Belta.  The legend of origin is very beautiful.  Once upon a time, it happened that the epidemic mowed almost the whole of Belgatoi, but only a few surviving units multiplied again and made their clan even more successful than it was before.  This is confirmed by the name itself: bel - ‚Äúdie‚Äù, gatto - ‚Äúrise‚Äù.  Among Chechens, Belgatoys are considered to be very energetic and efficient people. </p><p>  Beltoy (or Biltoy) is also a large and famous clan.  From here came the politician Beibulat Taimiev, a contemporary of Pushkin, whom the poet wrote about during his trip to Arzrum.  Belta‚Äôs people are everywhere, and in the old days they lived in the Nozhayyurt district, in the east of Chechnya.  Famous family that the whole <span>Chechen Republic</span> knows <span>.</span>  The teip is inhabited by diverse, but here the most prominent politician and oilman Tapa Chermoev came out of here.  They settled mainly in Mehkety and near the ancestral mountain Chermoy-Lam, and in antiquity, according to legend, all Chermoys lived deep in the mountains. </p>

    <h2>  Chechen teip Alleroi (Aleroi) </h2><p>  The name of this teip was stored on the legendary bronze cauldron brought by the ancestors to Nakhsh.  It is here, in a country settled throughout the country, but based on Eastern Chechnya, that <span>Aslan Maskhadov, an</span> ex-president who became a bandit, was born in this clan.  This teip is clean, along with others written on a bronze cauldron, is included in nakhchmakhkahoy.  Settled in Nozhai-Yurt and Shali regions. </p><p>  The story of allergy sufferers has been around since the fifteenth century, after the invasion of Khan Timur, who killed many local residents and left his deputies in Chechnya from the Kabardian princes, Takrov, Nogai, Jai Murz and khans.  The Chechens quickly multiplied and began to make daring attacks on the Timur vassals, trying to make a reconquista - to recapture their lands.  The first alla founded the village of allergies, united the compatriots remaining after the invasion of the Tatar-Mongols to protect their lands.  Allera is divided inside another five teips, as the genus has become numerous, and is still considered pure. </p><h2>  Benoy </h2><p>  It must be the most numerous of the teips in Chechnya, at least in second place in terms of numbers.  Benoevets billionaire Malik Saydullaev claims that out of the million remaining Chechens, three hundred and sixty thousand belong to teip Benoy.  They are settled throughout the republic, divided into nine genera.  In all wars they took an active part, where they gained unfading glory.  For example, Baysangur Benoevsky did not leave Shamil to the very end, despite military fortune turned away from the hero. </p><p>  A huge number of Benoevites live in the diasporas of Western Asia, from where terrorism spreads around the world.  And in Chechnya, on the contrary, the Benoevites are considered clumsy and rustic in their cunning.  However, here they are fearless, faithful to the word and duty.  Many centuries ago, they formed the backbone of the peasant strata of the people, who threw off the power of the Dagestan and Kabardian rulers.  These are the fathers of mountain democracy, which has become the foundation of an ethnic mentality.  Among the clans of teip Benoy there is both Russian and Georgian blood. </p><h2>  Gendargenoy </h2><p>  The teip is also extremely numerous and famous, moreover, the center one, from the historical Nokhchiymokhk, widely spread throughout Chechnya.  The diplomat and politician Doku Zavgaev hails from here.  Here the granary is for Chechnya, and for Dagestan, and much more distant places.  It was here that the pre-Islamic Nashkha existed as a cultural, political, ritual and religious center. </p><p>  The Council of the country (Mehk khelov) was founded here, from where pure Chechen teips appeared, among which, of course, was Gendargenoy, whose representatives in the entire history of the country occupied one of the most prominent places.  Soviet power allowed the Gendargenians to learn what they were doing with greater success than members of other clans.  That is why this teip gave the country many leaders, party members and business executives. </p>

    <h2>  Harachoy and Cheap </h2><p>  This teip is famous for its representatives - <span>Zelimkhan Kharachoevsky</span> and <span>Ruslan Khasbulatov,</span> who lived in different centuries, but gained approximately equal fame.  Information about this clan entered the written Russian documents very early, and the Chechens say that it was the Kharachoyites who were the first to marry the Russians, which did not prevent Zelimkhan from becoming an outstanding fighter with the tsarist government when the Caucasus was conquered.  Chechnya respects this teip, considers it the most intelligent. </p><p>  Deshi - a mountain clan, southeast of the country, refers to pure teips.  Here are still preserved princely surnames.  One of those who wore this many years ago was able to marry the Georgian princess, giving the Mount Deshni Lam, which belongs to the entire teip, to its own.  Now Deshi live everywhere, even in Ingushetia. </p><h2>  Nashkhoy and Zurzakhoy </h2><p>  Nashkho - the birthplace of pure teips, is the entogenetic center of the Nokhchimatians of the Middle Ages, mentioned by Armenian geographers of the nineteenth century.  Lived in the southeast of the country.  Some researchers completely attribute the entire population of this area to one teip.  Others are subdivided. </p><p>  Zurzakhoy is a teip from the ancestral, even in its own name preserving the medieval ethnonym - dzurzuk, as the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush called themselves.  This teip did not enter the Tukhums, always taking an independent position.  He was not alone like that, but Sada, Peshkhoi, Maista. </p>
