High standard of service, proven comfort - and no unpleasant surprises.  In addition, avid fans of chain hotels, as a rule, have bonuses for regular customers in the form of discounts or one free night.  Lineups such as Hilton, Melia and Hayat have their own hotels in all the key resorts in the world.  Sometimes their representation is not limited to one hotel.  In some resorts there may be two Hiltons or Sofitels at once.  After all, hoteliers are trying to please both budget and picky customers. </p><p>  This picture is also observed on the famous beach of De Muro, which is located near the city of Alcudia, on the <span>island of Mallorca.</span>  There is a four-star hotel Iberostar Playa de Muro and a luxury hotel with almost the same name.  Only one word is added to her name - "Village".  In this article we will look at both hotels.  It makes no sense to compare them.  One has four stars, the other five.  Accordingly, the prices are more attractive in the first hotel: from ninety-two US dollars per person per night - against one hundred twenty-three in the second.  But in both cases tourists are very satisfied, and the reviews about both hotels are extremely positive.  After all, this is sunny Mallorca, and legends are made up about rest here.  Therefore, the level of service here does not correspond to low prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Playa de Muro" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1392618.jpg" width="600"></div>

And two of them - Iberostar Playa de Muro Village and just ‚ÄúPlaya de Muro‚Äù - are located on one of the best beaches on the island of Mallorca (Balearic archipelago, Spain).  You can evaluate the difference between the hotels on the spot.  After all, they are located next to each other.  Closer to the town of Alcudia and a little north is the Quartet.  The five-star "Village" is located a couple of tens of meters south.  Both hotels are on the first line of the beach.  At the same time, you can evaluate the conditions in another hotel of the Iberostar line - Alcudia Park.  It is located on the second line and closer to Alcudia, in fact, in its southern suburbs.  From <span>Palma de Mallorca airport</span> to hotels you have to get no longer than an hour.  Ancient Alcudia is located on the cape.  To the south of the city, immediately behind the Hydropark, begins the spacious beach of De Muro, stretching for several kilometers.  It is completely built up with hotels.  So we can talk about the resort "Playa de Muro" with all the relying infrastructure (restaurants, shops, entertainment).  Both of the hotels we describe are surrounded by Mediterranean pine trees.  Nearby lies the natural park "Albufera".  In a quarter of an hour you can walk to the Estany Gran Lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Playa de Muro 4 Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1392619.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Iberostar Playa de Muro Village 5 * (Mallorca): hotel grounds </h2><p>  It was the turn to consider a five-star hotel.  The word "Village" itself means "village."  Indeed, the hotel buildings are tuned in a bucolic fashion.  These are seven two-story cottages where guests will feel calm and solitary - like in a village in nature.  These cases are decorated in a Mediterranean style and stand among the pines.  As in the more budgetary counterpart, Iberostar Playa de Muro, in the "Village" is a very beautiful area.  Reviews mention palm trees, flowers, and professional landscaping. </p><p>  Alcudia (the northern coast of Mallorca) has been hosting the island‚Äôs International Cycling Tour for more than a year.  And its participants invariably stay in two hotels of the Iberostar chain.  The Village also has all the necessary infrastructure to meet the specific needs of athletes (parking, repair shop, gym, special menu).  But here it will also be comfortable for other categories of vacationers: families with children, lovers of privacy and nature, newlyweds, who came to Mallorca to spend their honeymoon.  The high status of the Iberostar Playa de Muro Village 5 * hotel is evidenced by the sunbathing area near the pools.  In addition to ordinary sunbeds (with mattresses and beach towels), there are Balinese beds with sunshades and hammocks.  Here you can feel like on a very exclusive vacation. </p><h2>  Rooms at the Iberostar Playa de Muro Village </h2><p>  The five-star status of the hotel is clearly visible in the equipment of guest rooms.  There are no standards.  The rooms in the hotel Iberostar Playa de Muro Village 5 * are divided into the categories "Superior", "Family", "Suite" and "Suite +".  The design of the rooms is carefully thought out, they combine style and comfort.  Bright, spacious rooms are equipped with a TV with LCD screen, air conditioning, a minibar (it is charged for filling), a safe.  Upon arrival, the guest will find a welcome gift in the form of a glass of wine.  In the closet there is a set of various pillows, slippers and a bathrobe, and in the bathroom there is a hairdryer and toiletries in branded bottles. </p><p>  Each room at Iberostar Playa de Muro Village Hotel of any category has a balcony or terrace with a table and chairs overlooking the pool, garden or sea.  Reviews say that even in the superior microwave installed.  This category of rooms is one-room.  All the others consist of a bedroom with a large double bed and a living room with two sofas.  The suites have a bath and shower, an electric kettle, and their spacious terraces are furnished with a sofa and two armchairs with a table.  Maids do not just carefully clean the rooms and change towels - they also beautifully fold the sheets.  At the request of guests, cots are provided in the room, and an iron and ironing board are provided. </p><h2>  Meals at Iberostar Playa de Muro Village 5 * </h2><p>  Exclusive cuisine, dishes prepared by the best chefs of Mallorca, are what awaits the guests of the five-star hotel.  But that is not all.  Visitors to the buffet restaurant can personally see the cooking process, and this is a real show.  As in Iberostar Playa de Muro 4 *, in a five-star hotel, tourists themselves can decide which system to eat.  Those who plan to travel around the island and do not want to be bound by meals can choose ‚ÄúBed and Breakfast‚Äù.  The latter is simply magnificent.  Those who are used to eating plentiful and satisfying in the morning will also be satisfied.  Breakfast includes juices, natural coffee, tea, various types of pastries, fruits, vegetables, cold and hot dishes.  Adherents of healthy food will not be offended.  At their service will be yogurts, cereals, toasts, cereals.  For athletes, <span>isotonic drinks</span> and energy nutrition are provided. </p><p>  For those vacationers who wish to go on excursions, reviews are recommended to book half board.  Very popular among Russian tourists is the third option of food - ‚ÄúAll inclusive Premium‚Äù.  It differs from the usual ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù in that the carriers of a special bracelet can visit all restaurants, including a la carte, both in the territory of the Village and the neighboring Iberostar Playa de Muro 4 *.  For them, ice cream, cocktails and all drinks in bars of domestic and foreign production are served for free.  Also, for such guests, a late breakfast is served in the beach restaurant, as well as endless and unlimited snacks throughout the day.  The All Inclusive Premium program has other benefits.  For example, the use of tennis courts, daily replenishment of the minibar in the room, a ten percent discount on all types of massage in the SPA Sensation hotel health center, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Playa de Muro Village 5 Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1392627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services at Iberostar Playa de Muro Village </h2><p>  As in Iberostar Playa de Muro 4 *, guest reviews of the five-star hotel claim that all rooms have free and very fast Wi-Fi, so you can chat with relatives and friends on Skype.  But the hotel of a higher class has a number of exclusive services.  Various conferences are held here - for this there is a fully equipped room and a business center.  The cigar salon is waiting for gentlemen, and the shopping center is for shopaholics of both sexes.  Children's rest here is at the forefront, as well as in Iberostar Playa de Muro (Mallorca).  But unlike the budget counterpart, the Village also has a club for teenagers (from thirteen to seventeen years old).  And the restaurant has a children's menu. </p><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  <span>Chain hotels</span> often place the "five" on the first line of the beach, and more budgetary offices - on the second and third street.  But the Iberostar at the northern tip of Mallorca did otherwise.  Both Iberostar Playa de Muro hotels (5 * and 4 *) are almost on the beach.  The sea can be reached from the buildings and cottages in two minutes.  Playa de Muro beach stretches for five kilometers and is common to many hotels.  But in the ‚ÄúVillage‚Äù on the coast there is a special area ‚ÄúBeach Club‚Äù.  There are hammocks and tent beds in the style of "relaxing in Bali."  Beach towels and mattresses on sun loungers in the Village are included in the price of the stay on the beach.  Four guests can use them only at their pools.  On the beach all the ammunition - sunbeds and umbrellas - for a fee.  As for the pools at the Iberostar Playa de Muro Village and Iberostar Playa de Muro, the reviews call their number (two in each) sufficient.  Children have their own safe "paddling pool".  In cold weather and from September to June, both hotels have an indoor swimming pool for adults. </p>
