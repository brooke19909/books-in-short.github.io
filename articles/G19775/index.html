    <p>  The resort region of South Vietnam was developed taking into account the attraction of travelers of all categories.  There are secluded and quiet places suitable for a relaxing family vacation, for example, a small hotel Ocean Bay Hotel 2 *, designed for only 38 rooms. </p><p>  Fans of diving come here from all over the world, as they know not only about the beauty and richness of local reefs, but also the affordable prices for tours. </p><p>  Fans of outdoor activities will enjoy sporting events, and for those who choose health tourism, the doors of cosmetic and massage parlors with a wide range of services are open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Exciting rides are organized for children, which will allow you to have fun, and party lovers are waiting for discos, night clubs and numerous bars. </p><p>  Thus, Nha Trang today is the most sought after and popular resort, providing its guests with a wide selection of entertainment and good time. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Ocean Bay Hotel 2 * is a fairly young hotel (opening year - 2009th), but it immediately began to position itself as a vacation destination for couples without children, business people and elderly travelers.  For those who want entertainment and nightlife, it is not suitable.  Here, those who value silence and solitude with nature feel good. </p><p>  The hotel is located 40 km from the airfield and 4 km from the center of active spa life.  The privacy gives this place a special attraction, given that the beach is only 150 meters away, and to diverse entertainment and services - 10 minutes by taxi. </p><p>  The hotel is located in a picturesque area in the north of Nha Trang, not in the resort area, so you go to bed early, but there are many non-tourist cafes and restaurants where you can taste real Vietnamese cuisine. </p>

    <p>  In each room vacationers are waiting for: </p><ul><li>  TV (there are even Russian-language channels); </li><li>  electric kettle; </li><li>  comfortable upholstered furniture; </li><li>  chairs and a coffee table; </li><li>  mini-bar (paid service); </li><li>  a safe for storing video and audio equipment and valuables; </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  slippers, towels and all necessary bath accessories; </li><li>  bathroom, toilet and wash basin. </li></ul><p>  According to the reviews, cleaning in the room of the Ocean Bay Hotel 2 * (Vietnam) is carried out daily, but bed linen is changed once a week or more often upon request with extra charge.  The hotel does not have beds for small children, which should be considered when planning a vacation with the whole family. </p><p>  If the child is under 12 years old and does not need extra bed, the staff will provide free pillow, bath and bedding. </p><p>  Some rooms have panoramic windows that overlook the bay, beach and city. </p><h2>  Beach near the hotel </h2><p>  For many tourists traveling to relax on the sea, the beach, its location and infrastructure are important. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach near the Ocean Bay Hotel 2 *, judging by the reviews, is not yet fully equipped.  It could be called wild if there were no sun loungers and umbrellas.  Using them is not included in the price of the permit, so you have to pay extra, although it costs a penny. </p><p>  Clean sand, good entry into the sea with a gentle slope, convenient for swimming - all this is noted by reviews.  For people accustomed to beaches with a more developed infrastructure, there were not enough bars with their refreshing and alcoholic drinks and light snacks, as well as showers and pools. </p>
