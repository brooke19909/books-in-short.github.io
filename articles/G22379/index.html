However, it is possible that there are people who want to master this rather simple process, because today almost everything goes in trousers, and buying a finished product that is ideally suited in length is far from always possible, so there will always be plenty of such work in the house. </p><p>  How to <span>hem pants?</span>  Before giving advice, I would like to clarify what kind of trousers in question.  The bending technique directly depends on the style, fabric structure, style, as well as whether they are male or female.  As for jeans, there are secrets here, because if you cut them in the usual way, the spectacular corporate edge will disappear, without which they will not look.  Work will also depend on how much they need to be shortened. </p>

You need to do this in the shoes with which you will wear these pants.  It is necessary to take into account the fact that when they are worn, they “pull up” a bit, as we constantly sit down and bend our knees.

Now the trousers must be removed and laid out on the table.  Take a ruler, measure the required number of centimeters from the bottom of the legs and draw lines - this is the length in the finished form.  It is necessary to leave an allowance for bending and draw a second line along which we will trim.  We draw it at a distance of 4 cm below the first. </p><p>  On finished products of this type, the edge is usually wrapped and sewn with a blind stitch.  Most likely you do not have an overlock, since those who have it are unlikely to be interested in the question of how to hem pants.  Such equipment is usually available from experienced seamstresses or tailors. </p>

If you have a sewing machine, then process it using the zigzag operation.  This, of course, is not a proprietary finish, but for such a case it will fit perfectly, especially since on dense fabrics the “zigzag” turns out tolerably well.  Here you can do two ways.  First trim the legs, then overcast, or first sew along the second bottom line, and then carefully trim so as not to damage the threads.

At the same time, try to drive the iron only along the very edge so as not to erase the hem line drawn with chalk or soap. </p>

On thick woolen trousers, <span>machine stitching,</span> as a rule, is not laid.  How to hem pants manually?  It will require accuracy and diligence.  If the fabric is loose and uneven in color, then it will be easier to work, since the traces of punctures on the front side will not be noticeable.  If the fabric has a pure color and smooth surface, then there is a risk of dots appearing on the “face” in the places of stitching.  Therefore, we choose the thinnest needle and thread, while the second should be strong.

    <p>  Now, directly on <span>how to hem pants</span> with a hand in a <span>blind seam.</span>  You need to start at any vertical seam and move from right to left.  Keep your trouser-leg away from you.  First, fix the thread on the vertical seam allowance, then insert the needle under the zigzag stitch from the wrong side by about 1 cm, pull the thread and hook one needle of the leg in the place where the allowance is adjacent to it, pull out and re-insert the needle by the thread zigzag. "  Continue to do so until you are completely sewn.  In this case, the thread should not be tightened - the allowance should not be pressed snugly against the leg.  So the punctures will be less noticeable, and the hem will be more accurate. </p><p>  Finally, iron allowance and arrows must be ironed.  Through a damp cloth, we hold the iron along the edge of the fold, without going into the bent section of the leg, otherwise it will print on the “face”. </p><p>  You will have to do such work if you cut off your trousers much, for example, by 10 cm. If you need to shorten it by 1.5 - 2 centimeters, then the task is greatly simplified, since the legs can not be cut.  For tight trousers, a fairly wide hem is allowed.  Thus, you do not have to overcast the edge, and it will remain branded.  In this case, it is necessary to tear off the existing allowance, steam off the bend, outline a new bending line, stitch it, sew it by hand with a hidden stitch and iron it. </p><p>  As you can see, hemming trousers at home is not difficult.  It will take a couple of workouts from the strength, and then the process will improve. </p>
