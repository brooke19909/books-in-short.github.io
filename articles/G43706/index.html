This very interesting and cozy place is located on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory and is part of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGelendzhik.  This is a fairly quiet and very picturesque place, hidden from prying eyes (near the M4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù highway, 56 kilometers from the village), with the absence of any special attractions.  But here at the same time you can swim in the Black Sea, which is very clean in this place, and soak up the beach, getting your piece of heat from the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rasfokus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankment of Arkhipo-Osipovka" class="if uuid-2318581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2318581.jpg"></div><h2>  Resort offer that will make your vacation unforgettable </h2><p>  When choosing a vacation for all family members, we naturally take into account all the wishes, but for this it would be nice to analyze the offers of the resort itself.  Arkhipo-Osipovka offers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Gorgeous beaches, fully prepared for the arrival of tourists (needless to say, the beach for comfort is in second place after the bed). </li><li>  The resort infrastructure itself is very diverse and meets the highest requirements of guests.  It includes a sufficient number of hotels and hotels. </li><li>  Of course, if the vacation is declared as family, then increased attention is paid to places for active recreation - both children and adults can have a great time visiting such a place, for example, as a water park. </li><li>  Rest is a great thing, but I would like to plunge carefree into the sea, and not in debt upon returning home.  That is why the resort's pricing policy is very loyal, which allows you to completely disconnect from the financial sector. </li><li>  There are not many sights, but those that exist can be viewed on excursions or on their own (we hope that you will not get lost).  You will enjoy the scenery and the atmosphere in general. </li></ul><h2>  When to come and where is better to settle? </h2><p>  Rest time is not always regulated only by our one desire, but also by the climatic conditions of a particular place.  In this case, it is better to come to the resort in the standard summer months (unless, of course, you practice winter swimming), that is, June, July or August - for lovers of the velvet season, and, therefore, a small number of people.  In our article, we give advice on family vacations, respectively, and housing will be such as to suit the price and quality.  We do not aim to advertise specific holiday homes, but we want you to still master the average information about them.  You should first look at the private sector by the sea in Arkhipo-Osipovka. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Guest houses - from 1300 rubles per day, you should be prepared for the fact that there will not be your own beach, animators and breakfast in bed.  Private houses - from 600 rubles per day.  There are nice bonuses - free accommodation for your children (depends on your ability to negotiate).  The hotel, too, as an option, is possible, but the average price of the issue is 3000 rubles, per child - 1000-1200, its own beach, there are animators.  This is all very generalized.  It is impossible to put a rich vacation of tourists in one article, but practical advice is quite!  In any case, keep in mind that the best option for a comfortable stay is the private sector in Arkhipo-Osipovka near the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="plus21vek.jimdo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central promenade" class="if uuid-2318585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2318585.jpg"></div><h2>  Fairytale place, how to find you? </h2><p>  Like everything fabulous, you need to look a bit, so is this wonderful place.  Well, firstly, we draw your attention to the fact that it is better to take tickets to this place in at least two weeks. </p><p>  It is always possible to get by train to Arkhipo-Osipovka from any city in Russia.  The advice is: take tickets to the town of Goryachigo Klyucha.  There is an option to Tuapse, but then you will have to take a bus or taxi for a long time, which in the resort area costs, as usual, fabulous money.  So it‚Äôs worth buying a ticket to Goryachiy Klyuch, and on any train.  From Hot Key - 3000-4000 rubles by taxi, but you can always bargain for 1500-2000 (depends on your abilities).  A bus or minibus will cost 100-500 rubles.  But having arrived by train to Tuapse, you have to overpay, the price of the issue is 1-2 thousand more expensive, unlike the Hot Key.  And go, mind you, longer.  There is a very ‚Äúlight‚Äù option, this is a train from Moscow: trains to Adler, Sukhum, Olympic Park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.n_ata.photosight.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The nature of Arkhipo-Osipovka" class="if uuid-2318586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2318586.jpg"></div><h2>  Private sector in Arkhipo-Osipovka </h2><p>  It is quite popular among tourists to stop on the Black Sea coast not in cramped apartments, but in spacious houses, where absolutely everything is provided for the convenience of vacationers.  Here you can at any time prepare a delicious barbecue on the grill or have a dinner in the fresh air in the courtyard.  The private sector by the sea in Arkhipo-Ospiovka is the best option for companies and large families.  Of course, at the height of the season, you can find completely different prices here.  The first coastline is usually quite expensive, but if you rent a whole house for a family, you get a profitable option.  Holidays in the private sector in Arkhipo-Osipovka are more suitable for young people, because these tourists are mobile and often like to spend nights all day in companies in the fresh air. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.3716397" data-lng="38.534673699999985" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/1/9/1419.png"></div><h2>  Trains at sea </h2><p>  There are also many different trains coming from different parts of the country to the Black Sea.  In Moscow, trains from both Kazan and Paveletsky stations move in this direction.  The cost of tickets depends directly on the class chosen by the passenger, a reserved seat is about 3,000 rubles, and a coupe is about 5,000. Here you need to do a bit of calculations, adding up the amount of the train ticket and then by taxi.  And perhaps consider an air option, a ticket for which costs 5,000 rubles.  to Gelendzhik, and from there you can already take a taxi or bus.  You can get there by rail during the day, or even more, so the air way for many is a great alternative.  We shared information, the choice is always yours, but whoever is warned is armed, always remember this! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.tripadvisor.ru/SmartDeals-g2619407-Arkhipo_Osipovka_Gelendzhiksky_District_Krasnodar_Krai_Southern_District-Hotel-Deals.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach in Arkhipo-Osipovka" class="if uuid-2318583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2318583.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We hope that the tips and our observations will help you choose the most profitable and comfortable option to get only bright and positive emotions from the trip!
