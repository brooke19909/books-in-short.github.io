  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Healthy Food Helper - Mulinex Yogurt Maker</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yogurt is deservedly popular as one of the most useful sour-milk products.  <span>Pure</span> bacteria <span>cultures</span> ferment heat-treated milk - and thus yogurt is obtained.  The beneficial properties of this product were known many centuries ago.  For modern yogurt, sourdough from a <span>Bulgarian stick</span> and thermophilic streptococcus is used. </p><p>  What is the benefit of yogurt? </p><ul><li>  High <span>nutritional value,</span> because dairy products contain enzymes, minerals, vitamins, valuable proteins and fats. </li><li>  Healing effect on the work of the stomach and intestines: stimulation of digestion, suppression of the pathogenic flora, normalization of acid-base balance. </li><li>  Immunostimulating effect, participation in the body's production of folic acid and B vitamins, lowering cholesterol, neutralizing and eliminating toxins. </li></ul><p>  In addition, yogurts are widely used as a treatment for dysbiosis and allergies. </p><p>  In stores you can find a very large selection of this product - with and without additives, fat-free, sugar-free, with a different percentage of fat content.  Always only one thing is alarming: natural yogurt can be stored for no more than 7-10 days, and on store packages are terms of three weeks or more.  This means that the beneficial properties of yogurt are almost lost due to the presence of preservatives, thickeners and the like chemistry. </p><p>  Home appliance manufacturers have already made sure yogurt can be easily cooked at home.  <span>Yogurt mulinex does a</span> great job with this process.  What are the benefits of self-cooking yogurt? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, <span>homemade yogurt</span> will contain only natural ingredients, without any preservatives, dyes, thickeners and other things.  The quality of the finished product is the main plus. </p><p>  Secondly, in such a yogurt, beneficial bacteria are really alive, which makes the product extremely useful. </p><p>  Well, and thirdly, homemade yogurt is much cheaper than any store. </p><p>  Do not forget that sour milk and a natural fermented milk product are two different things.  Milk can easily sour due to the large number of <span>pathogenic bacteria.</span>  And then it becomes uniquely harmful.  Therefore, milk that has turned sour and curdled in the refrigerator should not be called curdled milk and eaten at all.  Better to pour and forget about it. </p><p>  Another thing is natural homemade yogurt, prepared in compliance with all technologies.  Milk for such yogurt should be boiled or super-pasteurized.  Leaven is best taken dry in a pharmacy or supermarket.  Milk is fermented at a certain temperature, so that bacteria can multiply and not die. </p><p>  So, to prepare healthy yogurt you will need: </p><ul><li>  milk - boiled and cooled; </li><li>  culture of special bacteria; </li><li>  yogurt maker. </li></ul><p>  Mulinex yogurt maker works extremely simply: it maintains the required temperature for the allotted time.  The temperature cannot be changed on its own - it is set at the factory during the production process.  Therefore, only cooking time can be programmed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Yogurt is prepared very easily: you need to mix warm boiled milk with a bacteria culture according to the instructions, pour the mixture into jars and place them in the yogurt maker.  Turn on, set the cooking time - and that‚Äôs all, then the Mulinex yogurt maker will do everything herself.  The timer will work, the device will turn off automatically, so you do not need to constantly monitor the process.  Most often, a yogurt maker is loaded in the evening, and in the morning the finished product is taken out.  On average, the cooking time of yogurt is 6-8 hours, depending on the external temperature of the room.  Jars of ready-made yogurt should be slightly cooled and put in the refrigerator, be sure to put the date of manufacture on the lids so that you do not have to use an expired product.  Recall that yogurt is valid for up to 10 days. </p><p>  Choosing a yogurt maker is not so difficult - there are only a few manufacturers. </p><p>  For example, the Mulinex 230 yogurt maker is great for the price-quality ratio.  It is sold complete with seven cans of 140 grams each, on the lids there is an expiration marker.  The yogurt mulinex gives a <span>sound signal</span> about the end of work and turns off automatically.  Her color is silver, manufacturer - China. </p><p>  <strong>Yogurt mulineks reviews</strong> </p><ul><li>  When turned on, it does not emit buzzing or other signs of life.  The power indicator only lights up.  But from that moment on, the jars will slowly warm up, and the temperature will rise to 45-47 degrees. </li><li>  Mulinex yogurt maker is also suitable for non-native jars without any problems.  The main thing is that the containers are glass. </li><li>  Do not move or shake the yogurt maker during work.  Therefore, it is best to leave her to do business at night. </li><li>  Be sure to pour over the dishes and cutlery with boiling water.  Hygiene for yogurt is essential. </li><li>  The temperature of the yogurt maker should not exceed 50 degrees, otherwise all beneficial bacteria will die. </li></ul>
