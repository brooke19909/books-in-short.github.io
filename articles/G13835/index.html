    <h2>  Cultural heritage </h2><p>  "City on the Oka" - so affectionately their beloved land is called by those who consider themselves to be the indigenous inhabitants of such a beautiful city as Oryol.  The population here honors its history and constantly supports the cultural development of the regional center.  Residents respect the writings of Russian writers, such as Turgenev, Bunin, Fet, Andreev, Rusanov, Granovskaya.  After all, these names are known to everyone.  In Orel there is a famous cultural monument - the Noble Nest (Turgenev's estate).  Here the largest source of the Volga originates - the Oka River.  The city is also famous for the fact that in 1943, on August 5, the first salutes thundered in Orel and Belgorod in honor of the liberation from German occupation.  This indicates the courageous character of the inhabitants. </p><p>  Eagle is considered a "green" city.  Both in the center and beyond, the level of vegetation exceeds 7% of the occupied area. </p><h2>  Oryol city today </h2><p>  In 2016, the Eagle celebrates a major date - 450 years from the date of foundation.  Currently, the city has turned into a developed regional center, providing employment for more than 80% of the region‚Äôs population.  The main activity is trade.  The chains of the largest supermarkets in Russia successfully operate in the local territory.  Industry is slowly declining.  But earlier, it was thanks to her that the city of Oryol was promising.  According to the 2012 census, the population was more than 318 thousand people, which, compared to previous years, shows a decrease in growth dynamics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
