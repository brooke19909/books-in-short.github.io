The transfer of the English crown to the Germans was the decision of Queen Anne herself, the last of the Stuart dynasty.  However, the heiress Sofia died two months before the death of Anna, and her 54-year-old son Georg Ludwig came to the throne, initiating the reign of the Hanover dynasty.  The change of dynasty in 1714 became one of the most significant events in England, affecting the state‚Äôs domestic and foreign policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King George I" class="if uuid-3138801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3138801.jpg"></div><h2>  King George I (1660-1727) </h2><p>  Georg Ludwig of Hanover arrived in England in the early fall of 1714 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey, after which he faced a rebellion of Jacobites - supporters of Catholic Jacob, brother of Anna Stuart.  The rebels captured the cities of Perth and Preston, but after the Battle of Sheriffmur, which did not give the expected victory, they lost their fighting spirit, and the uprising began to decline. </p><p>  The new monarch showed no interest in politics, signing important government papers without any familiarization.  The only moment where he managed to somehow have a hand was to reduce the number of the Privy Council (established in 1701) to thirty members, of whom the Cabinet of Ministers and the Internal Cabinet were formed.  Behind these people, in principle, will be all the decisions that determined the further development of Great Britain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  King George I was never able to fall in love with the state over which he was placed, and the British reciprocated.  He invariably preferred Hanover to London, where he recklessly indulged in revelry and pleasures away from all the anxieties and unrest that Britain abounded.  Georg remained faithful to his land until the last.  A heart attack interrupted his life on the night of June 11, 1727, when he was on his way to Hanover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royal.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ruler George II" class="if uuid-3138930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3138930.jpg"></div><h2>  The reign of George II (1683 - 1760) </h2><p>  Having ascended the throne in 1727, the monarch was no different from his father in terms of meaningless burning of life, devoting himself more and more to the Hanover Elector, and not to the English kingdom.  However, despite the similarities, he also had a clear advantage over the parent in the person of his faithfully loving wife Carolina Brandenburg-Ansbach, a very smart and decisive woman.  Also, for all his shortcomings, the king of Great Britain was not without positive qualities: he paid a lot of attention to the country's armed forces and military duties, personally taking part in some battles, where he distinguished himself with extraordinary courage and courage. </p><p>  In politics, George did not shine with skill, but still was a prominent figure in domestic and international affairs.  During his reign, the country's economy strengthened significantly, rapidly developing industry led to dominance in world markets.  Serious expansion of the colonies in America and India also occurred.  Nevertheless, the king‚Äôs reluctance to participate in political issues led to an increase in the influence of ministers, while the monarchy was losing power.  George II died of a stroke at the age of 78, and his 22-year-old grandson reigned on the throne. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.allaboutlean.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King George III" class="if uuid-3138950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3138950.jpg"></div><h2>  George III (1738 - 1820) </h2><p>  George III, who entered the throne in 1760, was a complex and controversial figure.  As a teenager, having lost his father Frederick (the eldest son of George II), who died on the tennis court as a result of an injury, the future monarch was brought up under the strict care of his grandfather.  Having come to power, he proved himself to be a ‚Äúreal king‚Äù, directing his efforts to weaken the position of the leading Whig party (the party of the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie), so as not to be a toy in the hands of parliament and not repeat the fate of his grandfather. </p><p>  The rule of this monarch was distinguished by inflexibility and aggression, all those who disagree without hesitation were dismissed.  His tough policies led to war with the North American colonies, where in the end the British troops were defeated.  At the same time, he was one of the most devout kings of the Hanoverian dynasty, and urged his subjects to follow the ways of the Lord and remain good Christians.  Georg surrounded himself only with loyal people - ‚Äúfriends of the king‚Äù, not sparing for them titles, allotments and material content. </p><p>  Since 1788, the ruler of England began to experience bouts of mental distress, which over time became more frequent, until in 1810 he finally lost his mind.  The regent was appointed his eldest son-heir, the Prince of Wales, who showed himself to be a man of not the most noble manners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  George III died at the end of January 1820, being in complete isolation from society.  The most important outcome of his reign was the merger of Ireland and Great Britain into the United Kingdom (January 1801), which unofficially became known as the British Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royal.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King George IV" class="if uuid-3138974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3138974.jpg"></div><h2>  The reckless life of George IV (1762 - 1830) </h2><p>  Having ascended the throne in 1820, King George IV of Great Britain began his reign with the persecution of his legal wife Carolina of Braunschweig, with whom he had long been in fierce public strife.  The severe parenting he received, often accompanied by numerous punishments and restrictions, fashioned a man of unbridled temperament with developed immoral tendencies.  The people disliked the Hanoverian for his continuous drunkenness and endless revelry, which so greatly violated royal dignity.  He became the object of constant ridicule of the press and, consequently, of all of England. </p><p>  The monarch‚Äôs entertaining life was taking place against the backdrop of significant events in Europe, which he did not want to be interested in.  In his reign, England expanded its borders, in particular, expansion began in Central Asia, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the country had great authority in Europe itself, becoming one of the leading powers. </p><p>  Destroyed physically by his idle and dissolute life, King George IV died in 1830.  At the age of 65, England, his brother William, the third son of George III, ascended the throne of England. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.npg.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="king wilhelm iv" class="if uuid-3139074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3139074.jpg"></div><h2>  Wilhelm IV (1765-1837) </h2><p>  Compared to his extravagant brother, George Wilhelm looked much simpler and more unpretentious.  His coronation cost the treasury only 30 thousand feet.  The years given to service in the Navy made him a direct man, an opponent of all conventions, so that the order at court established during the reign of the previous kings quickly lost. </p><p>  Wilhelm ascended the throne in a very troubled time.  The need for reforming the electoral system, which has not changed for several centuries, was growing in the state.  The king was forced to side with the Whigs and accept the overdue changes.  Passions raged fervently over whether to give the Catholic believers of Ireland freedom of action or not.  On the basis of the divergence of the crown-bearer with the cabinet, a number of government crises are emerging.  As a result, the king formed another cabinet, the opposition to parliament, but both sides managed to come to an agreement. </p><p>  William IV did not leave such a significant trace in the history of the country.  Nevertheless, he was a fairly diligent family man, without discrediting himself with special vices, and in this sense became the "springboard" for the rule of his legendary niece - Queen Victoria, daughter of Edward Augustus (fourth son of George III). </p><div class="photo" data-original="avonctlibrary.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Queen Victoria" class="if uuid-3139103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3139103.jpg"></div><h2>  Queen Victoria (1819 - 1901) </h2><p>  Young Victoria's accession to the throne in 1837 was an important event in Britain.  The country joyfully welcomed the newly made ruler: after a string of eccentric kings of the Hanover dynasty, a chaste girl carried hope for a change for the better.  The short and fragile monarchy person possessed genuine royal greatness.  She quickly became the darling of the whole people, especially the middle layers of society.  Victoria lived up to the aspirations of her subjects: she managed to rehabilitate the dubious reputation of the monarchy and to construct a different model of the relationship between society and the royal family. </p><p>  The reign of the last English monarch of the Hanover dynasty is often represented by a golden period in the annals of England.  The trading industry was experiencing an unprecedented boom, industrial production was progressing, cities were rising everywhere, and the borders of the British Empire were spread all over the world.  Queen Victoria has become a true symbol of the nation. </p><p>  The indomitable ruler of Great Britain died in the year 64 of her reign at the age of 82, working until the last days and realizing her monarchial will. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="industrial development of england" class="if uuid-3139140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3139140.jpg"></div><h2>  The role of the dynasty in the history of England </h2><p>  Hanover kings sat on the throne of Great Britain until 1901.  With them, the British participated in several major military conflicts, where most of the opponents were France.  The loss of colonial domination in North America (1783) was compensated for by the expansion of English territories in India and the appropriation of Dutch possessions in South Africa, as well as the earlier accession of Acadia, Canada and eastern Louisiana under the Paris Treaty of 1763. </p><p>  The years of rule of the Hanover dynasty were marked by a special strengthening of parliamentarism, the formation of democratic movements and a significant limitation of royal power.  Also, this period went down in history thanks to the accomplished industrial revolution and the beginning of the rapid development of capitalist relations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flavorwire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kings of Hanover" class="if uuid-3138888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63354/3138888.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The following historical facts are associated with the reign of the Hanover dynasty: </p><ul><li>  For a long time, King George I was considered a stupid and uneducated man, despite the fact that he was fluent in Latin and French, and also understood Dutch and Italian.  This erroneous opinion was formed due to the fact that the monarch did not like the country that he was forced to rule after the death of Anna Stewart. </li><li>  George II was a lover of opera singing and music.  Under his special patronage was Georg Friedrich Handel. </li><li>  For his excessive enthusiasm for gardening and gardening, King George III earned the nickname "George the Farmer." </li><li>  Ruler George IV was noted as a person with good taste: he preferred not to follow fashion, but to shape it himself.  By inspiration, he came up with new styles of clothing and built extravagant buildings. </li><li>  Queen Victoria, thanks to a large number of offspring, received the title of "grandmother of Europe."  Among its descendants are the Windsor (Great Britain), the Hohenzollern (Germany), the Bourbons (Spain) and the Romanovs (Russia). </li></ul>
