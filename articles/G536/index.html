And most of all, tourists do not like the attitude of the staff towards hotel guests, which cannot be called respectful. </p><p>  Noisy street on which the Rafee Hotel 2 * hotel (UAE, Dubai) is not conducive to a good rest.  The city wakes up around three in the morning, and the noise outside the windows will not allow you to enjoy a sweet dream.  In the evening, music that rumbles in night clubs will not let you fall asleep for a long time.  Guests who rise to the pool can also wake up, although it is not allowed to use it after eight in the evening.  The hotel does not very carefully monitor compliance with this rule. </p><p>  Tourists who visit the hotel recommend that not very demanding young people who spend all their free time on excursions or on the beach settle here.  Because of the noise, living with children here will be problematic.  Also, the hotel is suitable for a business trip. </p>
