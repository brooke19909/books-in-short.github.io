What is this actually connected with?  Noise can have both positive and negative effects on human health.  For example, recently it has become popular to use white noise to calm a child and normalize his sleep. </p><h2>  The negative effects of noise on the body </h2><p>  The negative influence depends on how often and for how long a person is under the influence of high-frequency sounds.  The harm of noise is absolutely not inferior to its benefit.  Noise and its effects on humans were studied in ancient times.  It is known that in ancient China torture was often used by sound.  Such an execution was considered one of the most cruel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Noise is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1117296.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Scientists have proven that high-frequency sounds adversely affect mental development.  In addition, people who are in constant noise stress quickly get tired, suffer from frequent headaches, insomnia, and loss of appetite.  Over time, such people develop cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, metabolic disorders and the thyroid gland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="production noise" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1117256.jpg" width="600"></div>  In large cities, noise has an irreversible negative effect on the human body.  Today, a huge number of environmentalists are trying to cope with this problem.  To isolate your home from the noise of the big city, install soundproofing.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Noise level </h2><p>  Decibel noise is the power of sound that a person‚Äôs hearing aid perceives.  It is believed that the human ear perceives sound frequencies in the range of 0-140 decibels.  Sounds of the least intensity affect the body in a favorable way.  These include the sounds of nature, namely rain, waterfall and the like.  Acceptable is the sound that does not harm the human body and hearing aid. </p><p>  Noise is a general definition for multi-frequency sounds.  There are generally accepted standards for sound levels in public and private locations.  For example, in hospitals and residential premises, the available sound norm is 30-37 dB, while the production noise reaches 55-66 dB.  However, often in densely populated cities, sound vibrations reach a much higher mark.  Doctors believe that a sound that exceeds 60 dB causes a person to have nervous breakdowns.  It is for this reason that people living in large cities experience <span>chronic fatigue</span> and <span>frequent headaches.</span>  Sounds in excess of 90 decibels contribute to hearing loss, and higher frequencies can be fatal. </p><h2>  Positive effects of sound </h2><p>  The effect of noise is also used for medicinal purposes.  Low-frequency waves improve mental and psychological development and emotional background.  As mentioned earlier, these sounds include those made by nature.  The impact of noise on humans has not been fully studied, but it is believed that the hearing aid of an adult can withstand 90 decibels, while baby membranes withstand only 70. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ultra and infrasound </h2><p>  Infra- and ultrasound have the most negative effect on the human hearing system.  It is impossible to protect oneself from such noise, since only animals hear these vibrations.  Such sounds are dangerous in that they affect internal organs and can cause damage and rupture. </p><h2>  The difference between sound and noise </h2><p>  Sound and noise are very similar words.  However, there are still differences.  Sound means everything that we hear, and noise is the sound that a certain person or group of people does not like.  It can be someone's singing, barking of a dog, the sound of <span>a jackhammer,</span> production noise and still a huge amount of annoying sounds. </p><h2>  Varieties of noise </h2><p>  The noise is divided, according to the spectral characteristic, into ten varieties, namely: white, black, pink, brown, blue, violet, gray, orange, green and red.  All of them have their own characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="noise damage" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1118099.jpg"></div>

    <p>  White noise is characterized by a uniform distribution of frequencies, and pink and red increase them.  At the same time, black is the most mysterious.  In other words, black noise is silence. </p><h2>  Noise disease </h2><p>  The impact of noise on a person‚Äôs hearing is colossal.  In addition to persistent headaches and chronic fatigue, noise sickness can develop from high-frequency waves.  Doctors diagnose it to the patient if he complains of a significant hearing loss, as well as changes in the central nervous system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The initial signs of noise sickness are ringing in the ears, headache, and unreasonable chronic fatigue.  Hearing damage in contact with ultra- and infrasounds is especially dangerous.  Even after a short interaction with such noise, complete hearing loss and rupture of the eardrum may follow.  Signs of damage from this type of noise is a sharp pain in the ears, as well as their congestion.  With such signs, you should immediately contact a specialist.  Most often, with prolonged exposure to noise on the auditory organ, a violation of the nervous, cardiovascular activity and vegetovascular dysfunction are observed.  Increased sweating also often signals a noise disease. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Noise and its effects on humans" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1118091.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Noise disease is not always treatable.  Often, only half of the auditory capacity can be restored.  To eliminate the disease, experts recommend stopping contact with high-frequency sounds, as well as prescribe medications. </p><p>  There are three degrees of noise disease.  The first degree of the disease is characterized by instability of the auditory apparatus.  At this stage, the disease is easily treatable, and after rehabilitation, the patient can again come in contact with noise, but he must undergo an annual examination of the auricles. </p><p>  The second degree of the disease is characterized by the same symptoms as the first.  The only difference is a more thorough treatment. </p><p>  The third stage of noise disease requires more serious intervention.  The cause of the disease is individually discussed with the patient.  If this is a consequence of the patient's professional activities, the option of changing work is considered. </p><p>  The fourth stage of the disease is the most dangerous.  The patient is recommended to completely exclude the effect of noise on the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decibel noise" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1123202.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Prevention of noise disease </h2><p>  With frequent interaction with noise, for example, at work, it is required to undergo an annual medical examination by a specialist.  This will allow you to diagnose and eliminate the disease in the early stages.  Adolescents are also thought to be subject to noise disease. <br>  The reason for this is visiting clubs and discos, where the sound level exceeds 90 decibels, as well as frequent listening to music with headphones at a high volume level.  In such adolescents, the level of brain activity decreases, memory worsens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="noise exposure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1123186.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Industrial sounds </h2><p>  Production noise is one of the most dangerous, because <span>such sounds</span> accompany us most often in the workplace, and it is almost impossible to exclude their effects. <br>  Industrial noise arises from the operation of production equipment.  The range of <span>sound waves</span> ranges from 400 to 800 Hz.  Specialists conducted a survey of the general condition of the tympanic membranes and auricles of blacksmiths, weavers, boilers, pilots and many other workers who interact with industrial noise.  It was found that such people have impaired hearing, and some of them were diagnosed with diseases of the inner and middle ear, which could later lead to deafness.  To eliminate industrial sounds or to reduce them, an improvement of the machines themselves is required.  To do this, replace the noisy parts with silent and unstressed.  If this process is not available, another option is to move the industrial machine into a separate room, and its remote control into a soundproofed room. <br>  Often, noise protection is used to protect against industrial noise, which protects against sounds whose level cannot be lowered.  This protection includes earplugs, headphones, helmets, and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Human Exposure to Noise" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1123203.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The effect of noise on the children's body </h2><p>  In addition to poor ecology and a host of other factors, noise also affects a vulnerable child and adolescent organism.  As in adults, children experience hearing and organ impairment.  An unformed body cannot protect itself from sound factors, so its hearing aid is most vulnerable.  To prevent hearing loss, a specialist should be examined as often as possible by the child.  The sooner the disease is detected, the easier and faster the treatment will be. </p><p>  Noise is a phenomenon that accompanies us throughout life.  We may not notice its effects and not even think about it.  Is it correct?  Studies have shown that the headache and fatigue that we usually associate with a hard working day are often associated with noise factors.  If you do not want to suffer from constant ill health, you should think about your protection from loud sounds and limit contact with them.  Follow all recommendations for preserving and <span>restoring your hearing.</span>  Be healthy! </p>
