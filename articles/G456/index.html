    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  "Elizar-Hotel" (St. Petersburg) gives the guests a number of negative impressions: </p><ul><li>  the quality of the cleaning in the room is just disgusting - dust and rubbish everywhere </li><li>  quite often there are incidents when the rooms do not change bed linen after previous guests; </li><li>  sockets are very poorly fixed, which not only causes inconvenience, but is also unsafe; </li><li>  if you book a room with a double bed, then most likely you will be offered to accommodate 2 shifted; </li><li>  if in other hotels room cleaning is an obvious duty of the maids, then here you have to literally demand it; </li><li>  very few channels are broadcast by a satellite dish; </li><li>  very hard mattresses on the beds; </li><li>  the rooms are just terribly audible both from the street and from neighboring rooms; </li><li>  due to the lack of mosquito nets in the rooms there are always a lot of mosquitoes; </li><li>  the cafe is full of unsanitary conditions, as well as an unpleasant smell (apparently, hoods do not work well); </li><li>  despite the fact that smoking is prohibited in the hotel, there is a smell of cigarettes in the corridors; </li><li>  the bathroom is incredibly cramped; </li><li>  the same thing is served for breakfast every day. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Elizar-Hotel is a rather interesting establishment, which occupies a restored historical building.  As a result, the atmosphere of antiquity was preserved, as well as a feeling of complete comfort.  Nevertheless, employees are not very careful about the number of rooms.  this is manifested in the disgusting quality of cleaning, and it is especially unpleasant to detect stale bedding when checking in. </p><p>  The main advantage of the hotel is its convenient location near cultural attractions, as well as business facilities.  In addition, an absolutely free shuttle to the nearest metro station is provided in the mornings.  But many do not like the fact that the hotel is located in the courtyards of multi-storey buildings.  Nevertheless, many prefer to use this territory in case of lack of space in a private secure parking. </p><p>  Thus, it can be said that Elizar Hotel is a great option for unpretentious tourists.  But if you are used to paying attention to little things, then this option will not suit you. </p>
