Innumerable star clusters, mysterious planets, dangerous black holes are permanent residents of the world, the conditions of which are destructive for earthlings.  The cosmos and everything connected with it, for many centuries, attracted and excited inquisitive minds.  The result of research and scientific research has been extensive knowledge about this huge and absolutely alien world for us.  Of course, developments in this direction are ongoing, since the laws of space can be studied forever.  People who have dedicated their lives to such work are certainly worthy of respect.  These are astronomers, cosmologists, astrophysicists and astronauts. </p><h2>  Moscow childhood </h2><p>  Lebedev Valentin Vitalievich - Soviet cosmonaut, <span>Ph.D.,</span> professor and master of sports.  This man faithfully served the worthy cause of space science, and therefore firmly entered the history of world cosmonautics.  In the world registry, he was assigned No. 70, and according to the Soviet census - No. 29. During his career, Valentin Lebedev made two flights outside the Earth and once in a rather long time (more than two hours) went into open space. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valentin lebedev" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1309060.jpg"></div>  The future cosmonaut was born in Moscow.  His date of birth is known: April 14, 1942.  He was brought up in an ordinary family.  His mother, Antonina Fedorovna, worked as an accountant, and his father, Vitaliy Vladimirovich, chose a military career.  It is likely that the genes of his father influenced the boy‚Äôs decision to choose this courageous profession.  Studied Valentin <span>Lebedev at</span> Naro-Fominskaya secondary school number 4, which he graduated in 1959.  At this time, the young man decided on the vector of movement and life priorities, deciding to choose the path of the pilot.

Training there allowed the guy to establish himself in the thought of the correctness of the chosen road.  Unfortunately, in those days there was a reorganization and reduction of the Armed Forces of the USSR, therefore, frequent changes took place in this area.  In the end, the aviation school in which Lebedev studied was disbanded.  Valentine decided not to change his dream and entered the Moscow Aviation Institute at the faculty of aircraft.  But the young man did not limit his studies, but at the same time began to master the difficult task of managing aircraft.  He flew on such devices as the <span>Yak-18, IL-29,</span> met with the MI-1 helicopter.  And he began work with the development of gliders (KAI-12).  Thus, Valentin Lebedev felt power over metal aircraft, subjugating them to himself. </p><h2>  Work in the Central Design Bureau </h2><p>  While still studying at the Moscow Aviation Institute named after S. Ordzhonikidze, the guy filed an application for admission to the cosmonaut corps.  And in 1963 he received a recommendation from the institute's party cell.  Now this sounds amazing, but in Soviet times it was impossible to get access to activities in serious organizations without such accompaniment.  After graduating from the institute, Valentin Lebedev obtained permission to work in the Central Design Bureau.  This organization was then headed by the legendary S.P. Korolev.  Later, in 1979, the institution was renamed and became known as the NPO Energia.  In this organization, Valentin Lebedev, whose biography made his decisive turn, went from being an ordinary engineer to a senior researcher. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Lebedev Valentin Anatolyevich increasingly linked his activities with space and developments in this field.  This is indicated by the further milestones of his biography: </p><ul><li>  He improved the development of rescue equipment for space crews during landing on water and land. </li><li>  He participated in flight design tests of such ships as Progress, Soyuz, Salyut orbital stations (from the fourth to the sixth). </li><li>  He worked at the Baikonur Cosmodrome as the head of the operational-technical group. </li><li>  He was an instructor and methodologist at the Cosmonaut Training Center, where he prepared the crews of the Soyuz spacecraft (4‚Äì9) for flight. </li><li>  Developed documentation on manual docking and rapprochement techniques, as well as ship and orbital station control. </li></ul><h2>  Flight preparation </h2><p>  Having gained the necessary experience, being engaged in such versatile activities, Valentin Lebedev came close to the goal.  In 1969, an outstanding engineer received admission to special training.  It was issued by the Main Medical Commission after a thorough and comprehensive examination of the future astronaut.  This happened within the walls of a reputable organization called the Institute of Biomedical Problems.  In connection with this significant event in Lebedev's life, he had to interrupt his training at the school of test pilots.  During his studies, he managed to master the piloting of the Mig-15 and Mig-21 fighters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Lebedev's first space journey </h2><p>  The flight started in 1973, in the winter (December 18).  Valentin Lebedev was in the crew of the Soyuz-13 ship as a flight engineer.  His callsign is Kavkaz-2.  The flight was short-lived - about 7 days, but was of great scientific importance.  The fact is that the spacecraft was equipped with a new system of Orion-2 telescopes, thanks to the coordinated work of the latest equipment and professional engineers, the most important astrophysical observations of the ultraviolet spectrum in vacuum began. </p><p>  Two years after the end of his first flight, Lebedev defended his thesis on the topic of crew training with the help of a training stand and teaching methods that contribute to this.  All this time, the astronaut continues to work in the NPO Energia.  The Ph.D. thesis, brilliantly defended by him, offered a fundamentally new, improved look at training before going out into space.  Especially important was the maximum realism of their conditions: starry space, the nuances of rapprochement, docking, space routes. </p><h2>  Flight engineer with the call sign "Elbrus-2" </h2><p>  Lebedev‚Äôs second flight, which took place in 1982 on a space complex called Soyuz-T-5 (besides it, included ships such as the Progress cargo ship and the Salyut-7 orbital station), was included in the Guinness Book of Records by duration of stay in space (more than 211 days). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salute 7" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1309068.jpg"></div>  The flight went down in history not only in terms of duration, but also due to the fact that during this time Lebedev conducted many experiments and introduced an extensive research program.  It is interesting that the flight engineer spent this flight without being separated from the call sign "Elbrus-2."  During the flight, Lebedev went into outer space and stayed there for more than two hours.  As a result, he was awarded the title of first-class test instructor-astronaut.

    <p>  By the way, the Salyut-7 orbital station, which is part of the complex, designed for scientific, medical, and technological research in a vacuum, has become the latest model in this series. </p><h2>  Priceless science experiments </h2><p>  During two space trips, a talented flight engineer conducted about three hundred necessary experiments in various fields of science and technology.  Many of them were unique.  Measurements of the composition of the atmosphere near the station were made, the level of vibration inside the space complex was clarified, methods for obtaining sterile biological samples were developed.  And finally, for the first time in the history of astronautics, a plant called ‚ÄúArabidopsis‚Äù was grown on board the spacecraft, which underwent a complete development cycle. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronaut Lebedev" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1309059.jpg"></div>  In addition, it was possible to develop a methodology for autonomous control of the Salyut-7 orbital station in order to detect tectonic-geological structures on our planet.  Thus, a hint was given in which direction it is necessary to search for oil, polymetallic and gas fields in the Altai region.

    <p>  After the flights, Valentin Lebedev continued to work in the Design Bureau and engage in scientific activities.  So, in 1985, an engineer defended his doctoral dissertation on the topic of methodological developments that facilitate the activity of orbital complexes and increase their effectiveness.  This work became to some extent revolutionary - in it, Valentin Vitalyevich suggested optimizing the crew‚Äôs work, saving him from unnecessary routine, and also made adjustments to the location of the shooting equipment. </p><h2>  Valentin Lebedev: astronaut's diary </h2><p>  In addition to scientific works (193), which are still taken as a basis by students of many universities of a specific orientation, Valentin Vitalievich wrote books.  For example, ‚ÄúMy Dimension‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaterials of Scientific Research of Flight Engineer‚Äù.  But these works were created using the materials of the legendary "Cosmonaut's Diary".  The uniqueness of the recordings is that they were not made for publication, but simply to pour out their feelings and feelings on paper.  Ignoring the style, the astronaut described the days before the start, during it, as well as being on board the station.  The oath given by Lebedev to himself immediately before the flight is noteworthy.  In it, he promised not to get excited, not to offend his partner, to be responsible for the decisions made and to give himself completely to work. </p>

Between the lines there is a longing for relatives and the Earth.  Also included in the record is information about the physical difficulty of adapting to extraterrestrial conditions: insomnia, nausea, persistent headaches.  There were unfavorable psychological moments - it was difficult to establish contact with a partner due to the accumulated stress.

    <p>  "Cosmonaut's Diary" for the first time opens the veil and shows the everyday life of these people, their thoughts and feelings.  These notes are very informative for those who are interested in space activities. </p><h2>  Awards found a hero </h2><p>  The outstanding cosmonaut Valentin Vitalievich Lebedev made a significant contribution to space, astrophysical, navigation and geological surveys.  This man, sincerely dedicated his life to science, could not fail to be awarded numerous awards and distinctions.  He did not aspire to become a celebrity, but simply carried out his work with high quality and soul.  For example, even while on vacation, Valentin Vitalievich could not be idle - together with his students he went to help build the legendary BAM, for which he received another award - the medal ‚ÄúFor the construction of BAM‚Äù.  In addition, the astronaut was awarded the following titles and distinctions: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúHero of the Soviet Union‚Äù (two-time). </li><li>  Order of the IV degree "For Merit to the Fatherland". </li><li>  <span>Order of Lenin</span> (two awards). </li><li>  ‚ÄúFor merits in space exploration‚Äù - a medal. </li><li>  In France, the astronaut received the Legion of Honor. </li><li>  Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation. </li></ul>
