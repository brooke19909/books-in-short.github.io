The history of the small population of the city covers several eras, and the sights that have survived to this day attract a significant number of tourists.  In this article we will also get to know some interesting sights and virtually visit unique places in Perugia and the surrounding area. </p><h2>  Unknown Italy </h2><p>  How does an ordinary tourist represent Italy?  Most likely, this will be a description of such world famous tourist cities as Venice and Rome, Tuscany and Sicily.  But the cities listed above are not the whole of Italy, but there are places outside the usual tourist routes, and it will not be difficult to get to them.  One such place is the city of Perugia, which Italians call the green heart of the peninsula.  The city <span><span>is located about 164 kilometers (102 miles) north of Rome and 148 km (92 miles) southeast of Florence</span></span> . </p><p>  Since the time of the Holy Inquisition, ancient monuments, gloomy arches and houses have been preserved in the city.  The Middle Ages awarded the city two symbols: a lion and a vulture.  These creatures confirm the warlike spirit of Perugia, in which inter-clan passions and wars with neighboring cities were in full swing. </p>

    <p>  The city is more like a Spartan without masterpiece frills and architectural delights.  It was built in a hilly area with multi-tiered stairs and bridges.  And wherever tourists make a promenade, they always fall on small platforms, from which you can see the sights of Perugia (Italy) and the lower quarters of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Tourists can fly to Sant Egidio Airport, located 12 kilometers from Perugia.  There are buses and taxis from the airport to this city.  You can come from any city in Italy by train to the suburban station of Perugia, from where there is a mini metro to the described city.  Riding it is a pleasure.  It is a narrow gauge railway that glows purple in the evening, and small cabins - without a driver.  Automation works. <span><br></span> </p><h2>  Main square </h2><p>  Arriving in Perugia, what to see from the sights?  Perhaps it is better to start exploring the city from its main square, which hosts festivals, celebrations and city events - Piazza IV Novembre.  Why does she have such a name?  In Italy, November 4 is a day of remembrance for all those who fell for their homeland.  On the square is the Palace of Priorov (Pallazzo dei Priori), which is the business center of the city, the palace of the Captain and the Cathedral.  The imposing Gothic temple is located in the center of Perugia.  It does not enter the main square of the city, but on the side.  It is the latter that is considered complete.  It partially preserved ancient ornaments in the form of geometric patterns of white and pink marble.  On this wall is an attached loggia. </p>

    <p>  The decoration of the square is the Fountain of Maggiore (Fontana Maggiore).  It was built in 1278 in honor of the completion of the construction of the aqueduct, which provided water to the whole city.  The skillful work of sculptors Nicola and Giovanni Pisano is presented in bas-reliefs on two marble tanks.  The characters of fables and legends of the Old and New Testaments are captured by sculptors on the upper marble bowl, and on the bottom - scenes from rural life of the Middle Ages.  The fountain is crowned with figures of nymphs.  You should definitely go to the street, which used to be an aqueduct that supplied the fountain with water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Etruscan Monuments </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">From the central square of the city piazza IV Novembre, the road leads to piazza Danti, which contains the attractions of Perugia related to the Etruscans.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is a deep Etruscan well, which was the main source of water for the city.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It was built in the III century BC.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Further the path lies to the next attraction - the arch of the Etruscans.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It is also built in the III century BC.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">and served as a gateway to the city.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perugia Italy Attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2053281.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The list of interesting sights of Perugia include the chapel of San Bernardino.  It is built in memory of a wandering preacher.  His name is given to this chapel.  When this roving preacher appeared in the city, hostility and quarrels ceased everywhere.  It was a shame with a holy man to sort things out.  But the truce ended, as soon as he left the city.  So this chapel stands as a reminder to people how far they are from holy unconditional love. </p><h2>  Basilica of St. Domenico </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Half an hour walking from the cathedral, in a small square dedicated to Giordano Bruno, is Italy's famous landmark of Perugia - the Basilica of St. Domenico.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It was erected on the foundation of the Dominican church in 1304.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This is the first church building in Italy with a European hall form with 3 naves of the same height.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At the</span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">end of the XIV century, it was necessary to shorten the bell tower to 100 meters for its stability, and at the beginning of the XVII century.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The basilica was rebuilt and consecrated.</span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Currently, one can observe the ornamented entrance to the basilica of the late 16th century and the Baroque staircase.</span></span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The small courtyard and the former monastery of St. Domenico are adjacent to the territory of the basilica.</span></span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The former monastery houses the Archaeological National Museum of Umbria.</span></span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It is famous for the fact that all the finds and artifacts of the territory of Umbria related to the prehistoric period are collected here.</span></span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Viola Street </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">For a variety of impressions of the city, you should go to its northeastern part, on Viola street.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In tourist routes this street is not, but it is very interesting.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In the quarter where it passes,</span></span> small workshops and galleries are concentrated.  A street feature is its creativity.  On the walls of the buildings are drawings and graffiti, interesting installations made by residents of the quarter and local artists in the form of spatial compositions are found at every step.  The paintings of artists are hung right on the streets.  Residents of the street spend together holidays and festivals.  An informal bohemian atmosphere is the norm for street residents.  In this way, it is not like the other streets of Perugia. </p><p>  And even here, walking along Viola street, you can meet another rarity - the old long-closed church - Chiesa di San Simone del Carmine, built in the 13th century.  They closed it due to severe damage during the earthquake.  They open it a couple of times a year as part of projects conducted in the city, such as Invisible Perugia, or in an excursion program to interesting places in the city.  Of particular interest is the 1602 organ donated to the church by the local aristocrat Della Cornya.  The frescoes and paintings of this temple have long been in the National Art Gallery. </p>
