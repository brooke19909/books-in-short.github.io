That is why it is no longer surprising anyone with the active use of seemingly completely unsuitable materials for the manufacture of both everyday clothes and evening dresses. </p><h2>  Metallic fabric </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metallized fabric radiation protection" class="if uuid-3008616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3008616.jpg"></div><p>  This material came into the world of fashion not so long ago, however, it has been used in industry for quite a long time.  A very durable fabric with a characteristic metallic luster, which has insulating properties, is indispensable in conditions of increased heat or radioactivity.  But what brought this material to the world of haute couture?  In order to answer this question, it is necessary to consider in more detail the composition of this fabric and its characteristics. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  There are two types of metallized fabric, they differ in the manufacturing method. </p><p>  The first is direct weaving from already <span>metallized threads.</span>  Thus, the entire structure of the fabric is metallized. </p><p>  The second way is applying a thin layer of a metal (usually an aluminum film) to the finished canvas.  To date, there are several options for this technique, however, scientists continue to struggle on the question of how to metallize fabric without harming the environment.  For a long time, this process was carried out by soaking the tissue in solutions of electrolytes, it is quite simple, but it is very toxic.  In addition, this fabric is very stiff and has a poor presentation.  A vacuum-technical evaporation method was also used, however, this method is not particularly popular, since in this case it is very difficult to control the uniform distribution of metal on the entire surface of the sheet.  At the moment, the most environmentally friendly way is magnetron sputtering, but this technology is not yet common in the textile industry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Metallized fabric is famous for its ability to insulate thermal and electromagnetic radiation.  Such material is resistant to tearing, bending, stretching at the places of tearing, has a characteristic metallic luster.  Depending on the base material, it can be both light enough and flexible, but at the same time strong, and coarse, tough, which allows it to be used for the manufacture of protective screens.  Care for such a fabric should be careful so as not to violate the integrity of the outer metal coating. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the material is quite specific, its use is widespread in many areas of industry.  It is also applicable in everyday life. </p><h2>  Overalls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mountainside-medical.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metallic fabric for clothes" class="if uuid-3008624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3008624.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main areas of use of the material is the manufacture of workwear.  Due to its function of protection against radiation, metallized fabric has become a leader among other heat-resistant fabrics for tailoring the special uniform of employees of the fire service, as well as protective suits used in factories with high temperature, radio and electromagnetic radiation.  For example, this material was widely used in hospitals.  Clothing made of metallized fabric for medical personnel is used in physiotherapy departments, as well as departments of functional diagnostics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Insulation </h2><p>  For the manufacture of insulating screens using several types of metallized fabric.  They can be either translucent - if necessary, to ensure visibility, or dense.  Such screens are used in the same areas in which overalls from this material are used. </p><h2>  Interior </h2><div class="photo" data-original="horizonyc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metallized raincoat fabric" class="if uuid-3008674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3008674.jpg"></div><p>  Today, metallic fabric can be found in interior solutions.  For example, curtains made of this material reflect ultraviolet radiation, so the room remains not only darkened, but also does not heat up.  In order for the curtains to perform this function, it is better to choose the style of the two-layer product, where the decorative fabric suitable for the interior of the room will be used on the front side, but the side facing the window will be made of metallized fabric.  It is this combination that will not only take care of security, but also decorate the interior of the room. </p><p>  You can also often find roller blinds with a <span>metal coating,</span> they are quite dense, with a dimming parameter of 85% or higher, are great for children's rooms, protecting not only from sunlight, but also from harmful radiation from the street. </p><p>  In addition, household metallized fabric is used to make decorative pillows and upholstery, which allows you to create a somewhat cosmic image of the room. </p><h2>  Fashion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bobobobo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to metallize fabric" class="if uuid-3008629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3008629.jpg"></div><p>  But world podiums were conquered by this fabric not so much with its insulating and protective properties, but with its appearance.  For sewing clothes, a fabric is used, based on which is soft synthetic or combined weaving, less often - natural fabrics.  Household cloth can be either continuous spraying or partial, made in the form of an ornament or classic peas, cages and stripes.  The gloss intensity of such fabrics also varies - from the saturated brilliance of nickel or New Year's tinsel to the aristocratic glow of pearls.  That is why this material is readily used both for creating holiday dresses, especially relevant on the eve of New Year's celebrations, and for sewing everyday clothes, including business suits.  However, even fashion designers could not completely ignore its protective properties, therefore, metallized raincoat fabric is actively used for the manufacture of outerwear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shein.tw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metallic fabric jacket" class="if uuid-3008694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3008694.jpg"></div><p>  A jacket made of such material not only looks spectacular, but also has heat-insulating, dirt- and water-repellent properties, and also reflects harmful radiation. </p><p>  In addition, the method of metallization of fabric is actively used in the manufacture of shoes and accessories: handbags, belts and gloves. </p><p>  High-tech fabrics, often intended only for use in industry, organically fit into the lives of ordinary people.  The cosmic charm of metallized fabric will not only make a woman visible in any environment, but also protect her from the harmful effects of the modern world. </p>
