After filming the film Glass Eye, Veronica was invited to run by her husband Lily Brick.  There she first saw Mayakovsky.  Later they met visiting Kataev.  And after that they began to see each other more often. </p><p>  After a while, Veronica began to visit his apartment in Lubyanka often.  There was a poet‚Äôs study.  Mayakovsky showed Veronica many books.  He captivated her by reading his poems and interesting stories about foreign countries.  Often they walked around the city and talked.  Veronica Polonskaya and Mayakovsky became close after a short time after meeting.  The apartment on Lubyanka became their place for love meetings. </p><h2>  How did the romance of Polonskaya with Mayakovsky develop? </h2><p>  Polonskaya and Mayakovsky met secretly at the apartment.  Polonskaya‚Äôs husband did not know about this.  In one of the meetings, Mayakovsky confessed to Veronica in love.  She responded to his feelings, but was very jealous of other women.  Polonskaya did not leave her husband.  Perhaps she foresaw that the connection with Mayakovsky would not last long.  Veronica came to him almost every day for several hours to the theater.  And then she went to work. </p>

    <p>  Mayakovsky did not like actors, but Veronica was an exception for him.  Although over time, he began to demand that she leave the theater.  But Polonskaya refused.  After his declaration of love to her, Mayakovsky began to affectionately call her "bride". </p><p>  At the same time, he tried to meet his former love - Tatyana Yakovleva, but rumors reached her about his new affair with Polonskaya.  Yakovleva got married.  Mayakovsky was storming this event.  He immediately began to demand from Veronica to legalize their relationship.  But Polonskaya was married and was not going to admit to her husband that she was cheating on him. </p><h2>  Sharp angles in relations with Mayakovsky </h2><p>  Mayakovsky has always been very complex and difficult.  The poet was haunted by frequent mood swings.  It was rumored in society that he was sick.  Recently, their relationship with Veronika Polonskaya has been very strained in an emotional sense.  He either affectionately persuaded her to marry him, or tried to get her a positive solution by threats. </p><p>  In 1930, Polonskaya had many difficult rehearsals, and there was less and less time for frequent meetings.  Because of this, he insisted with even greater fervor that Veronica left the theater.  They often quarreled, often over trifles.  Veronika Polonskaya was often late for meetings or appeared at them with her husband.  Sometimes it didn‚Äôt come at all. </p><p>  Mayakovsky was previously very quick-tempered.  And some time before the suicide, he became even more angry, irritable.  April 12 Mayakovsky decides for the last time to speak with Polonskaya.  He called her at the theater, they made an appointment.  On this day, Veronica asked him to leave for a short rest, for a couple of days.  Mayakovsky promised, but stayed home. </p><p>  The next day they met again.  The conversation turned into another showdown.  It was then that the veil fell from the eyes of Veronica.  She saw a tormented and sick man in front of her, tried to calm him down.  But Mayakovsky took out a revolver and promised to kill Polonskaya, even pointed a muzzle at her.  But he didn‚Äôt shoot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Veronica Polonsky actress" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/970337.jpg" width="600"></div>
