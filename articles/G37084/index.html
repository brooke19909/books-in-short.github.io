It is famous for its long beaches with soft white sand and a first-class level of service.  Of course, rest on this island can not be called budget, so save on travel will not work.  If you are looking for a respectable hotel, then pay attention to the beach resort Dreams La Romana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * in the Dominican Republic.  A detailed description will be presented in this article. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  This complex has a favorable location.  It is built directly on the coast, so tourists can walk to the beach in 2-3 minutes.  Hotel Dreams La Romana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * in the Dominican Republic is located in the resort of Bayahibe near the city of La Romana.  It is worth noting that it is completely surrounded by a tropical garden, so there are no walking promenades and other infrastructure facilities near it.  This hotel assumes accommodation on an all-inclusive basis, so often tourists almost never leave its territory during the holidays.  If desired, the center of La Romana can be reached by calling a paid taxi.  There are no historical attractions near the complex either. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.3769027" data-lng="-68.8453968" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/8/4/9/11849.png"></div><p>  20 km from La Romana is a small airport.  But it does not accept flights from Russia, so it is usually used only by local residents.  Most often, tourists from Russia who come to rest at this hotel fly to Punta Cana International Airport.  You can get to the resort from it in about 45 minutes.  The easiest way to get to the hotel is by taxi.  Also, if necessary, transfer payment can be included in advance in the price.  Then a comfortable bus equipped with air conditioning will pick up tourists from the airport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The beach complex Dreams La Romana Resort &amp; Spa 5 * can offer tourists a huge territory, most of which is occupied by a lush tropical garden.
