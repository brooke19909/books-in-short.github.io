    <p>  The term "form of government" refers to a certain system of organization and interaction of the highest authorities of the country.  There are two types of systems: republic and monarchy. </p><p>  The word "monarchy" is of Greek origin and literally means "the power of one" (autocracy).  This form of government is characterized by the concentration (partial or full) of power in the hands of one person - the head of the country (the shah, emperor, king, king, etc.).  As a rule, power is transferred under such a system by inheritance. </p><p>  Absolute monarchy is characterized by autocracy of the head of the country.  In this case, the ruler is the only sovereign of power, he independently makes laws, administers the court, appoints the government.  Today, this form of government can only be observed in some countries: the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Brunei, Saudi Arabia. </p><p>  The constitutional monarchy has several other features.  This form of government is characterized by a certain limitation of the power of the <span>head of state.</span>  As a rule, this restriction is reflected in the Constitution.  The <span>constitutional monarchy is</span> developing in the conditions of the formation of bourgeois society. </p><p>  In accordance with the degree of restriction of power, two forms of government determine: dualistic and parliamentary. </p><p>  <span>The dualistic monarchy</span> provides for the preservation of executive power by the monarch.  The head of the country also retains the right to form a government, dissolve parliament and veto. </p><p>  The parliamentary monarchy is characterized by a <span>separation of powers.</span>  The government is formed at the expense of representatives from the party (or from several parties) of the majority.  This form of government is also characterized by the presence of government responsibility not to the monarch, but to parliament. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among countries with a parliamentary monarchy, Britain, Sweden, Japan, Spain and others should be singled out. </p><p>  <span>The republican form of government is</span> characterized by the election of the head of state.  The concept of "republic" is literally interpreted as a "public affair."  With such a system of <span>government</span> , the people act as a <span>source of power</span> .  The republican form of government was formed for the first time in 5-4 centuries BC.  e.  in Athens. </p><p>  In accordance with the method of organization and interaction of branches of government, there are three types of republic. </p><p>  The first, presidential form of government is characterized by the fact that the president is both the head of the state and the government.  In this case, usually such a position as the Prime Minister is not provided.  The election of the president is also characteristic of this system.  The head of state has a number of powers.  First of all, he can form a government that is not responsible to parliament.  With this form of government, a strict separation of powers is noted.  Such a system of government exists, in particular, in the United States. </p><p>  A republic may also be parliamentary.  In this case, the parliament has all the supreme power in the state.  In such circumstances, the president usually has purely symbolic power and does not have a significant influence on political life in the country.  Parliament is elected by the people.  A government is made up of representatives of a coalition or a majority party in parliament. </p><p>  There are also atypical forms of government in the state.  Such systems include the monarchist, semi-parliamentary, semi-presidential republic, republican monarchy. </p><p>  <span>Mixed republics are</span> characterized by the presence of features of both a parliamentary and presidential system of government.  This form is expedient and effective, provided that the parliamentary majority and the head of state adhere to one political direction, and not the opposite. </p>
