Moreover, every year such products are becoming increasingly popular.  They are loved by men, women and even very young children.  They look really gorgeous.  However, not all knitted products are considered trendy.  Therefore, in the material presented below, we will talk about how to make fashionable knitted things with your own hands. </p><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  Before you start knitting, you need to carefully consider what in the end you want to get.  After all, you can knit truly everything that your heart desires.  Original bags, sweaters, dresses, skirts, hats, scarves and coats - this is not a complete list of interesting things.  But to fulfill many of them, you need to measure the model. </p><p>  For sweaters, dresses and coats, the following parameters are needed: </p><ul><li>  length of the product; </li><li>  chest girth; </li><li>  armhole level; </li><li>  sleeve length. </li></ul><p>  For the skirt, the following: </p><ul><li>  length of the product; </li><li>  hip girth. </li></ul><p>  For hats, other: </p><ul><li>  girth of the widest part of the head; </li><li>  product height. </li></ul><h2>  Stylish jacket </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="fashionable knitwear" class="if uuid-2942252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2942252.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, knitted items decorated with large viscous have gained immense popularity.  They are performed very simply.  You just need to prepare a suitable yarn.  You can also use old clothes.  Which must first be cut and wound into a ball.  Then we take large knitting needles and knit the product with a garter stitch.  The jacket shown in the photo consists of the following parts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  one large rectangle is the back; </li><li>  two smaller rectangles - front shelves; </li><li>  two more rectangles - sleeves. </li></ul><p>  When the rectangles of the right size are ready, we collect them into a single product.  On the main part, we make lateral and shoulder seams.  Then we sew the sleeves and connect with the resulting vest. </p><h2>  Spectacular dress </h2><p>  Another trendy knitted thing (the photo is presented in the article) must be settled in the wardrobe of every fashionista.  For its implementation, it is required to prepare a sufficiently dense yarn, hook, ring knitting needles.  After that, we gain the number of loops equal to the length of the skirt.  We knit a flat cloth, focusing on the splendor of this detail.  Then close the loops and sew the skirt.  Using the hook, we collect new loops along the upper edge.  We transfer them to the knitting needles and knit the upper part of the planned knitted thing, moving in a circle.  We‚Äôre not tearing it out, but we share in front and back.  Each part is completed separately.  Then we sew on the shoulder seams.  That's the whole technology of work. </p><h2>  Interesting round clutch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitwear step by step" class="if uuid-2942263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2942263.jpg"></div><p>  Another spectacular thing is crocheted with a hook.  We get the yarn of the color you like and proceed to the execution.  We make a thread several revolutions around the finger.  Then we tie the resulting loop with a crochet, gently tighten.  After that, we knit in a circle, alternating one simple column and two knitted from one loop of the previous row.  Thus, we form the part of the desired size.  By analogy, we carry out the second.  We sew them, complement with a zipper or a chain and any decorative element.  As a result, we manage to do with the help of a hook a knitted thing, which all fashionistas of the district will envy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unusual plaid </h2><div class="photo" data-original="awebic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting knitwear" class="if uuid-2942265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2942265.jpg"></div><p>  The next thing, which quickly became popular and in demand, can not be put on yourself literally.  But in it you can bask all winter.  In addition, it will be a great gift for loved ones for the New Year.  To knit a Fishtail plaid, you will need a hook, circular knitting needles and yarn of your favorite color.  When everything you need is at hand, we take the hook and start with the same manipulations that we studied in the previous paragraph.  After that, we knit the conceived product, moving in a spiral.  Gradually add new loops to expand to the top.  Having reached the desired length, we knit several rows, occupying only half the resulting circle.  Separately, we knit the second part of the tail.  We use knitting needles and pick up an arbitrary number of loops.  The idea is fancy, so the size of the lower part of the tail can be any.  After that, we knit an elastic band, alternating five to eight front and back loops.  Then we pass the thread along the upper edge of one side and gently tighten the canvas.  Sew to the second part.  And we finish the performance of a spectacular knitted thing with our own hands. </p><h2>  Fashion bag </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitwear ideas" class="if uuid-2942268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2942268.jpg"></div><p>  Lots of fans of this product have also recently appeared.  However, implementing an idea is much easier than it seems at first glance.  The product can be knitted in two ways.  The first involves a set number of loops equal to the entire circle.  After that, the bag fits in a circle.  And then it is complemented by a bottom made with a hook.  A simpler version of the product implies other actions.  For him, you need to dial half the loops from the intended diameter of the bag.  Next, tie the fabric.  Which after we fold in half and connect at the side seams.  Any fashionable knitted thing needs to be supplemented with pens.  They can also be knitted or used by those left over from the old bag. </p><h2>  Original scarf hood </h2><div class="photo" data-original="videismo.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitwear for children" class="if uuid-2942269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2942269.jpg"></div><p>  The idea depicted in the photo appeared recently, but has already managed to disperse all over the Internet.  To prepare such a gift for your daughter for the New Year or another holiday, you should purchase black yarn, white and rich red in the store.  Ring spokes are also needed.  After that, we collect the number of loops equal to two girths of the head, and we knit the fabric, moving in a circle.  Having connected the lower part of the desired height, we divide the "pipe" in the middle and knit it, moving back and forth.  Having risen to the height of the cap, which we measured earlier, we add a few more rows, since the scarf-hood should be voluminous.  Only then does it look spectacular.  Then close the loops and make a single seam.  Then with the help of a hook we tie the ears.  Sew on additional details and set aside the hook and knitting needles.  Knitted thing will surely appeal not only to the baby, but also to the schoolgirl. </p><h2>  Trend hat with gradient </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitwear pattern" class="if uuid-2942274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2942274.jpg"></div><p>  Another fashionable fiction is rightfully considered the product shown in the photo.  Repeat it at home can not only professional needlewomen, but also beginners.  It is only necessary to prepare yarn in two shades.  In the photo above, it is black and emerald.  Also needed are circular needles of three different sizes and a fur pompom.  Better than black.  When everything you need is at hand, proceed with the implementation.  We collect on the largest knitting needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the head.  We knit a double elastic band of the desired width.  Further, guided by the scheme, we knit an interesting pattern with braids.  After a while, you should switch to variegated yarn.  To do this, separate the black and emerald threads and reel into a new ball.  We use it for knitting the middle part of the cap.  Then we switch to pure emerald color and middle knitting needles.  For ten rows to the end, we again change the knitting needles.  This time we use the smallest.  Having tied the product to the desired length, we break off the thread and thread through all the loops, gently pull it together and fix it from the wrong side.  This ends not only the description of the knitted thing, but all the work on the idea. </p><p>  In the presented article, we introduced the reader to the most fashionable products.  As you can see, even novice masters can perform them.  The main thing is to have a corresponding desire. </p>
