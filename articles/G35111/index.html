Some tourists who choose this country as the place to spend their vacation, think that they will meet unbearable heat here, because it is located on the African continent.  Nevertheless, in the resort areas of <span>Tunisia, the climate</span> is quite mild and comfortable.  Of course, if you keep your way inland, you can find yourself in a hot desert. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest in Tunisia </h2><p>  There is a category of tourists who, having arrived on the coast and staying at one of the seaside hotels, for example, at Sun Beach Resort Borj Sedria (Sun Beach Resort 4 *), go from there on a journey through the desert.  Others are more interested in historical sights: excursions to the ruins of ancient cities, visits to museums, etc. In short, Tunisia is perfect for mixed tours: educational (sightseeing), beach, extreme, health, etc. </p><h2>  Tunisian Resorts </h2><p>  In this exotic country there are many wonderful resort areas for every taste and budget.  However, for Russians, the most popular are Hammamet, Monastir and Mahdia.  This is where hundreds of thousands of tourists from various cities of Russia annually keep their way.  They dream at least once in their life to plunge into the exotic atmosphere of the African continent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Each of the resorts has its own characteristics.  Hammamet, which houses the aforementioned Sun Beach Resort Borj Sedria, is considered the most calm, conservative and at the same time respectable.  Tourists of retirement age, as well as <span>couples,</span> love to come here <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Hammamet </h2><p>  Although this Mediterranean resort is located on the African continent, it fully complies with European standards of service.  It is here that thalassotherapy centers are concentrated - the direction that came here from France.  Despite the fact that the resort is considered the most tranquil of all Tunisian, the nightlife here is also in full swing.  There are many bars, restaurants, nightclubs and discos.

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to Hammamet by direct flight from both Russian capitals, and during the season - even from other major cities of the Russian Federation.  The resort does not have its own airport, so you will have to fly to either Monastir or Enfid (by the way, it is the closest, located 110 km from the resort).  And from there already by car: minibus, bus, taxi or rented car;  or by rail.  Buying a tour at the Sun Beach Resort Borj Sedria, do not skimp and pay a transfer from the airport to the hotel and back.  Upon arrival, you will be met at the airport and comfortably delivered to the hotel. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  This hotel is located in a quiet location on the beachfront in Borj Sedria, which is part of the Hammamet resort area.  The hotel is designed to relax all members of the family.  As already noted, from the nearest airport to the territory of the hotel Sun Beach Resort Borj Sedria 110 kilometers, but to the city center - 25 km. </p><p>  The hotel has its own private beach.  By the way, this hotel is part of (or rather, one of the buildings) of the giant resort complex "Caribbean World Boyed Sedia", located near the famous international golf club.  Once in the complex, you feel as if not on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, but somewhere in the Caribbean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the brochures, the last reconstruction at the hotel was carried out in 2013.

    <h2>  Tourist reviews of Sun Beach Resort Borj Sedria 4 * </h2><p>  Unfortunately, tourists do not always leave positive reviews in their comments about this hotel.  Although, if you look from the other side, it becomes clear that not every review can be considered true, because the information contained in it is almost always subjective.  What one does not like may be liked by another. </p><p>  Of course, some negative assessments are supported by photographs taken by tourists during their vacation, which are proof of what is described in the comments.  For example, among the reviews you can find complaints of dirt and untidiness prevailing at the Sun Beach Hotel, that is, staff not observing hygiene rules.  However, this also needs to be treated with understanding and not to blacklist this hotel.  After all, unscrupulous personnel can always be replaced, and then everything can fall into place. </p>
