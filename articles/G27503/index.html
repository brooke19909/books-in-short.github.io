    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Rest on the Volga with children provides for food only with environmentally friendly and natural products.  Many bases and resorts have their own land, where they grow fresh vegetables and fruits.  Often they collaborate with farmers to supply fresh fruits, vegetables, as well as meat, fish and dairy products.  And local cuisine will surprise even gourmets with its sophistication and simplicity. </p><h2>  The opportunity to merge with nature </h2><p>  Rest on the Volga with children provides for special conditions.  Guys, unlike adults, do not always so carefully study the interior of rooms or meals during their holidays.  But they are always not averse to admire nature, take a walk through the forest, swim in the river.  That is why the resort places along the Volga are perfect.  In addition to the fact that playgrounds are equipped in the territories of tourist centers and sanatoriums, here nature will open its wonderful world for them.  A walk along the forest paths will provide kids with an introduction to squirrels, bunnies, hedgehogs and other forest inhabitants.  And since there are always a lot of tourists in this part of Russia, the animals very often get used to visiting people and become almost tame.  Often they come to the territory of health centers and get acquainted with their inhabitants.  In addition, a huge number of different shrubs are growing here: blueberries, raspberries, strawberries.  Why take away the opportunity from children to enjoy fresh forest berries? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the banks of the Volga" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/463551.jpg" width="600"></div>
