This process requires a lot of time, effort and investment.  If you plan to make equipment for yourself for one evening or want to make such a <span>surprise for a child,</span> you can create a simpler version of the outfit.  For example, there is nothing complicated in making a helmet of a hero with your own hands. </p><h2>  Using paper mache </h2><p>  There are many options for working on this craft.  So, you can use the papier-m√¢ch√© technique.  For this you will need: </p>

    <p>  - round base; </p><p>  - ordinary children's plasticine; </p><p>  - several sheets of paper; </p><p>  - PVA (as an option - starchy paste); </p><p>  - cardboard; </p><p>  - cord for ties; </p><p>  - silver paint; </p><p>  - a grid for a burgundy (back). </p><p>  To make some details of a fancy dress, it is often necessary to use unusual means.  You can make a helmet of a hero with your own hands precisely with their application.  To solve this problem, there are a variety of ways. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  To get started, find the right foundation for your creation.  It should be round and convex.  Make sure that its diameter matches the <span>size of the head of the</span> future hero.  As a base, you can use a globe, a ball or a latex balloon.  Separately fabricate the pointed tip in the shape of a cone.  Blind it from plasticine and attach it to the sphere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now search for the right paper.  Choose enough thin material.  These can be, say, standard A4 <span>sheets</span> .  Despite the prevailing opinion about papier-m√¢ch√© newspapers, it‚Äôs better not to use them.  The fact is that the surface of such paper is very loose, and the printing ink on it will be quite difficult to mask. </p><p>  For the top coat you will need wipes.  Tear all the material into small squares with a side of two centimeters.  Pour water into a bowl and moisten one sixth of the base paper in it (do not touch the napkins yet). </p><h2>  We form the body <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a do-it-yourself helmet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/817114.jpg" width="333"></div></h2><p>  To create a beautiful helmet of a Russian hero with your own hands, draw on the base and cut its outlines.  The front of the craft should be shorter than the back. </p><p>  Cover the breadboard with any oily ointment.  With it, later you can easily remove the finished helmet from it. </p><p>  Spread soft paper evenly over the surface of the workpiece.  Make sure that the edges of adjacent fragments overlap each other. </p><p>  Do not leave empty spaces between them.  Then, according to the same scheme, lay out the next layer and cover it with glue. </p><p>  It is best to apply it with a soft brush made of squirrel wool or a foam sponge.  Upon completion of the work, the tool must be thoroughly rinsed under the tap. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Form the helmet of the hero with your own hands from seven such paper layers, gluing them through one.  Then let the product dry well.  This process usually takes three to five days. </p><h2>  Additional items </h2>

Among them is a protective plate on the nose.  You can use cardboard or papier-m√¢ch√© as material.

    <p>  If you choose the second option, you will need a plasticine base.  It must be covered with paper according to the same principle as the entire body. </p><p>  A special mesh is attached to the back of the helmet.  It can be cut out of fabric or crocheted from threads with a shiny coating.  When the hero‚Äôs helmet, made with his own hands, dries, you will need to remove it from the base. </p><p>  Using extra pieces of paper, glue the nose plate to it.  Using an awl, drill several holes in the lower part and fix the finished mesh in them. </p><p>  Now you can proceed to the final stage of work - painting.  Spray acrylic evenly from the spray can. </p><p>  To get a beautiful intense color, apply the paint in two or three layers.  Before proceeding to the next run, wait until the paint applied the previous time is completely dry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bottle to help </h2><p>  How to make a warrior helmet from other materials?  You can use, for example, a five-liter water bottle.  In addition to it, you will come in handy: </p><p>  - a large disposable glass made of plastic; </p><p>  - a bag that is used to wash laundry; </p><p>  - silver acrylic in the form of a spray; </p><p>  - double sided tape; </p><p>  - scissors. </p><p>  Cut off its upper part from the bottle and make the basis for future crafts out of it.  You can make its front area even or cut out on it an oblong plate covering its nose.  Make a cone-shaped nozzle on a helmet from a glass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself helmet of a Russian hero" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/817116.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  To this end, cut off its bottom and upper bent part.  Twist the desired shape from the remaining walls.  Fasten its sides with double-sided tape, and get rid of excess with scissors.  Using the same lock, attach the element to the main body of the product. </p><h2>  We are engaged in design </h2><p>  Now we move on to working on the mail part.  It can be cut out of a washing bag.  This material is optimal for this case, it is easy to get it, but it costs not at all expensive.  A dense mesh, which is used for its manufacture, has an expressive texture, which is clearly visible.  Paint the future chain mail with silver spray acrylic. </p><p>  Do the same operation with the main body of the craft.  After the first paint application, you will notice that the workpiece has become less transparent.  To enhance this effect, apply a couple more layers.  Do not start work on a new layer until the previous one dries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a warrior helmet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/817117.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Now mark on the product the places where you will attach the grid.  Glue <span>double-sided tape</span> to them and attach the finished chain mail.  Try on the resulting hat.  This is where your work ends. </p><h2>  We work with fabric </h2><p>  A do-it-yourself helmet can also be made of fabric.  To do this, you will need three of its types: a dense, adhesive, as well as a silver mesh.  In addition, we will use braid, cardboard and acrylic in the spray. </p><p>  First make four to eight wedges from the base material and sew them together.  As a template, a Budyon pattern is suitable.  The do-it-yourself helmet of the hero is very similar in form to this cap of the Red Army soldiers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself warrior helmet pattern" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/817113.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To give the product extra density, cover the inside of the workpiece with adhesive cloth and sew the braid around its edges.  Now cut out the mesh of the strawberry - chain mail for the back of the craft.  Having formed small folds on it, attach the part using an adhesive gun. </p><h2>  We make cardboard </h2><p>  You can also make a cardboard helmet of a hero with your own hands.  A photo of your baby in this accessory will delight you for more than one year.  In addition to the main material, for work you will need a silver self-adhesive and mesh. </p><p>  For this model, the pattern below is useful.  Cut several wedges from this template and glue them from the inside of the product.  Use a regular adhesive tape or strips of paper greased with glue as a fixative.  Previously, each part of the helmet must be covered with a layer of shiny paper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a warrior helmet" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/817180.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Full equipment </h2><p>  If you want, upgrade this headwear model with additional elements.  For example, attach cardboard backboards to the bottom. </p><p>  You can craft armor from the same material, decorating them with a shiny coating.  Sew chain mail on the body from the grid for the strawberry.  To create a complete image of a hero, cut a shield from the wall of a large box.  Use the handle of an old mop as the material for the spear.  And make a sword from a dense cardboard, giving it shine using self-adhesive. </p>
