Such a set has one of the representatives of Fly with an inconspicuous name 4413. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  In appearance, the Fly 4413 phone resembles a huge number of its Android counterparts.  The standard edging made of plastic tries to disguise itself as metal, and the softly rounded sides for more convenient use do not distinguish the smartphone from the rest. </p><p>  Navigation buttons are located at the bottom of the display, and a proximity sensor, lighting, a speaker and a two-megapixel camera are located on top. </p><p>  Light weight, only 150 grams, and rounded edges allow the phone to comfortably lie in your hand when working or making calls.  <span>A protective glass</span> covers the entire front of the device, keeping the display from damage and dust. </p><p>  On top of the Fly 4413 device are USB and a standard headphone jack with a 3.5 mm jack. </p><p>  On the back of the device is the main camera with 8 megapixels and a dual flash.  Below, next to the company‚Äôs logo, is the smartphone speaker grid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the right is the power button, but on the left is the volume control. </p><p>  The back panel of the smartphone is attached to a large number of grooves, which, in general, is a plus, but there is a chance of damage.  Underneath the panel hides a slot for a flash drive, a removable battery and two slots for SIM cards. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The indisputable advantage of Fly 4413 is the camera with the usual 8 megapixels for such devices.  The camera resolution of 3840 by 2160 will also please photo enthusiasts.  Such advantages will allow you to take not only high-quality pictures, but also record video in Full HD format.  Separately, it should be noted the high resolution video in 1920 by 1080 pixels.  These advantages are reinforced by a dual LED flash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The camera from the front panel can also please with a good resolution of two megapixels. </p><p>  These camera features look nice against the backdrop of many similar devices. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  In the Fly 4413 phone, the specifications are also not inferior to many modern counterparts. </p><p>  A pleasant surprise will be the MT6582M processor, which has four cores and allows the phone to cope with difficult tasks.  The processor frequency in this model has as much as 1300 MHz. </p><p>  One gigabyte of RAM looks a little faded against this background, but in principle this is quite enough.  With light load, the smartphone will confidently perform its functions. </p><p>  The phone is equipped with a Mali 400 Mp2 video accelerator, which processes content very soundly. </p><p>  It spoils the overall impression of the Fly 4413 with its small amount of memory, only 4 gigabytes.  However, this drawback can be corrected by the usual addition in the form of a flash drive.  Memory expansion with microSD is possible up to 32 gigabytes. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  The active use of all the advantages of the device significantly affects the state of the smartphone‚Äôs battery.  A modern phone, equipped with a 1800 mAH battery, looks very mediocre.  It is this amount of battery that the Fly 4413 has. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Providing the phone with a good filling and a huge bright display, manufacturers did not bother to equip the device with a more powerful power source.  The consequences are manifested in the form of not so much time of the smartphone without additional recharging. </p><p>  Under certain restrictions on the screen brightness and additional functions of the phone, the battery will provide approximately 6-7 hours of operation with constant use. </p><p>  However, with minimal work with the Fly 4413, the battery may well last about a day. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  The device uses one of the new versions of Android - 4.4.2, which is an indisputable advantage when choosing useful applications and working with the phone.  It should be noted that after installing the system, only 2.34 gigabytes of available memory remains on the device.  The current situation makes the need to supplement the memory with a flash card extremely necessary. </p><p>  The installed system is not overloaded with additional programs, which makes working with the phone more pleasant and simple.  The version of "Android" allows you to supplement the basic package of applications with free and useful programs.  The smartphone without delay will work with Skype and similar programs or process video over the Internet. </p><p>  Also, the device can be flashed to a newer version or assembly of Android. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  It is necessary to separately note the dynamics of the smartphone.  The sound is very high quality and loud on both speakers.  Problems with missed calls due to extraneous noise should not occur. </p><p>  Working with headphones also causes a positive feeling, however, we are not talking about headphones that come immediately in the kit. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Many pleasant functions will help brighten up leisure time or facilitate the work of the device owners.  To work with the Internet, the Fly 4413 smartphone has both regular mobile Internet and Wi-Fi function. </p><p>  Small functions like radio, video, as well as audio players, a voice recorder and bluetooth are also present in this model. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Fly 4413 is a budget smartphone, it has two slots for SIM cards.  Unfortunately, having only one module for communication, when making calls, the phone automatically sends a second SIM card to standby mode.  The phone works with both GSM and 3G connectivity. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The smartphone has the usual equipment for everyone.  The most common USB cable, a network device, the smartphone itself, a battery, headphones and, of course, instructions. </p><p>  In addition, you can sometimes get a booklet with advertising of some applications and information on the programs already installed in the package. </p><p>  As in most budget smartphones, the headphones from the kit are not worth much attention.  In addition to fairly quiet operation, there is also poor sound quality. </p><p>  The instructions included with the Fly 4413 will allow you to easily deal with most of the phone's features and features without too much difficulty. </p><h2>  Device Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Naturally, before purchasing such a device, you should study Fly 4413 itself, reviews from people who bought and tested the phone. </p><p>  For those who bought Fly IQ 4413, reviews about the same functions can be radically different.  This makes it difficult to determine the choice and creates a slight misunderstanding. </p><p>  First you need to decide on the functions of the smartphone that are of interest and only then proceed to study the personal experience of people.  It is advisable to view reviews on already verified or official sites. </p><p>  Most people using the device did not like one or another function of the device.  This is due to prohibitively high expectations from a pretty good, but still budget smartphone.  However, most often speak of several tangible shortcomings of the device, already mentioned in the article. </p><p>  In any case, you will have to make an opinion about the device from the personal experience of using a smartphone. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2>

    <p>  Actually, a budget phone with a very good set of functions looks already a huge advantage.  It is difficult not to note the excellent camera - both the main and the front.  High-quality images with excellent resolution and Full HD-video will appeal to photo enthusiasts.  Do not forget about the front camera. </p><p>  The impressive size display makes working with the device a pleasant pastime and allows you to enjoy both video and photo materials. </p><p>  The user-friendly design of the device with soft angles and the service of two SIM cards complement the comfort of using the phone.  In addition, work on the new ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù with a nice shell and a lot of useful applications is a definite plus for the phone. </p><p>  Iron in Fly 4413 looks very good, as for an inexpensive smartphone.  The processor has four cores and a gigabyte of RAM, a good filling that allows the user not to fear braking. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there are tangible disadvantages of the device. </p><p>  Without a doubt, the most noticeable drawback is the meager amount of internal memory, as for a modern smartphone.  The presence of four gigabytes, almost two of which are occupied by the operating system, is a huge drawback. </p><p>  Also, a battery with a capacity of 1800 maH does not correspond at all to even an inexpensive device and is not able to provide long-term operation. </p><p>  In addition, touch buttons for control located at the bottom of the device are highlighted only when working directly with them.  In poor lighting, you will have to use them from memory. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Since the phone is made of plastic, and the protective glass cannot boast of good shock resistance, you should secure your device with a protective case. </p><p>  To increase the duration of the device, you can reduce the number of active programs and reduce the brightness on the device‚Äôs display.  In addition, it is possible to solve the problem by simply replacing the battery with a more powerful analogue. </p>
