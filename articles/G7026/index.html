The answer is simple: choose an amusement park that can amaze not only with stunning attractions, but also impress with its beauty and unique design.  The best <span>amusement parks</span> in Germany keep their doors open all year round.  There are many similar institutions in the country, which are referred to as world leaders in this market.  In children's amusement parks in Germany, you can spend days full of interesting events and vivid emotions. </p><p>  The rating is compiled according to the popularity of the parks, from the most famous to the least popular. </p><h2>  1. Hansa Park </h2><p>  This amusement park in Germany is located in Sierksdorf, where a resort on the Baltic Sea is open.  It got its name thanks to L√ºbeck, which is very close by.  It is the capital of the Hanseatic League.  The territory of this complex is divided into eleven branches, each has its own theme.  Hanza itself was a community of European urban settlements of the Middle Ages.  On 46 hectares of the coastal zone there are more than a hundred attractions for visitors of all ages.  The local roller coaster rails are 1.2 km long.  Their speed can reach 127 km / h. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themeparks-eu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hansa Park" class="if uuid-3209171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3209171.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory of the complex there are also buildings in the spirit of the famous sights of the cities of the Hanseatic League, a rope park, a room of mirrors and open-air venues, where spectacular shows are held, children's master classes are organized.  Younger visitors can compete, take a dip in the huge pool with balls, or follow in the footsteps of James Cook and make their way through the thick Tahiti jungle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This amusement park in Germany is open from April 1 to November 1 from 9 to 18 hours.

A couple of years ago, another country appeared at the disposal of the guests, created based on the cartoon "How to Train Your Dragon."  Numerous trampolines, slides, carousels and Viking boats are open in it. </p><p>  On the territory of the institution there are hotels; here you can relax in the spa or in tents.
