It has a pleasant climate, many <span>balneological resorts</span> and attractions.  Last-minute tours to Serbia are a relatively new area of ‚Äã‚Äãtourism, but despite <span>this, the demand</span> for them is already quite large.  The possibility of a health and sightseeing holiday attracts a large number of people, in addition, this country has a rich historical and cultural heritage. </p><p>  Holidays in Serbia are attractive due to the local nature.  Unique reserves, more than a thousand mineral healing springs, healthy mountain air and the most comfortable climate create an extraordinary atmosphere here. </p><p>  There are several undeniable arguments in favor of the fact that you need to choose a vacation in Serbia.  Firstly, last-minute trips to Serbia are very simple to obtain, because you can get to this country from Russia without applying for a visa.  It will be enough only to have a foreign passport.  Secondly, the Serbian language is in many respects similar to Russian, therefore there is no language barrier.  Thirdly, you will have the opportunity to try the rich Serbian cuisine with a large selection of wines and dishes.  Well, and fourthly, the beauty of the local nature will leave an indelible mark on your soul. </p><p>  Despite the fact that this country experienced enough in the process of its historical development, in particular, numerous wars, a large number of historical and cultural monuments were perfectly preserved.  There are hundreds of ancient cities and <span>medieval monasteries,</span> many kilometers of beaches of the Montenegrin Riviera, hospitable locals and stunning <span>natural complexes.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, it is definitely worth a visit to Belgrade.  The heart of this city is <span>the Kalemegdan fortress,</span> which is considered one of the oldest in Europe.  And around it is a delightful park.  Not far from the fortress is the oldest part of Belgrade.  Here, museum lovers will find something to their liking.  Be sure to visit the Skadarlie quarter, Ethnographic and National Museums, Ada Siganliya Park, the Old Palace, the Museum of Modern Art and the Bayrakli-Jamiya Mosque. </p><p>  And in the so-called New Town, you can see a large number of boulevards, alleys, parks, modern buildings.  Here you need to visit the Museum of the Revolution, the Orthodox Church of St. Mark, the building of the People‚Äôs Assembly, a sports center and much more. </p><p>  A trip to Serbia is impossible without visiting the crossroads of eastern and western cultures - the city of Nis.  Religious buildings located not only in the city itself, but also in its vicinity can be safely called its main attractions.  Local churches and monasteries are represented in large numbers here. </p><p>  Holidays in Serbia are good because you can come here all year round.  Some prefer winter, namely a trip to Mount Kopaonik, which is the pearl of the country.  It is declared a <span>national park</span> for its amazingly rich flora and beauty.  Panchichev peak is the highest peak of this mountain, it offers stunning views of the unconquered ski slopes and pristine snow for many kilometers around.  On Kopaonik, 60 km of pistes and 24 ski lifts are at the disposal of tourists, so skiing is only a pleasure.  In addition, there is a very fun and active nightlife.  Numerous restaurants, cafes and nightclubs await guests.  Thus, in this ski resort you can relax perfectly at any time from November to April. </p><p>  Holidays in Serbia will leave you with a lot of vivid impressions.  You can not only relax, but also improve your health in numerous institutes equipped with modern technology and studying various diseases. </p>
