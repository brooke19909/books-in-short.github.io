The UNESCO World Heritage Site can be easily reached from Madrid in the morning and return back in the evening.  Many tourists daily make this journey between the modern and former capital of the Kingdom of Spain.  Most public transport routes from Toledo to other cities run through Madrid. </p><h2>  On the map of Spain </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="39.86283160000001" data-lng="-4.02732309999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/4/0/4940.png"></div><p>  The road to Toledo leads from Madrid to the southwest.  The distance between cities in a straight line is 65 kilometers, along transport routes - seventy or more.  A dead end railway line and highways lead to Toledo.  There are no sights worthy of attention on the way between cities, it is not advisable to travel with transfers. </p><h2>  How to get from Madrid to Toledo on your own </h2><p>  The road will take from half an hour to two hours, if you choose from three main methods: </p><ul><li>  bus; </li><li>  Railway; </li><li>  car. </li></ul><p>  You can leave from Madrid from the city center or from its southern part.  If the starting point is located in the north, it may take extra time to get to the train station or bus station or get off the ring road by car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can even get to Toledo by bike, in which case you will have to avoid freeways and the travel time will be more than four hours.  Unlike other methods, cycling requires a long preliminary preparation.  Travelers choosing this method, as a rule, do not consider alternative modes of transport. </p><h2>  Bus service </h2><div class="photo" data-original="laintermodal.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfortable bus" class="if uuid-2588898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94033/2588898.jpg"></div><p>  The fastest route is covered by Alsa direct buses departing from the Plaza Elliptic station in Madrid and arriving at the Toledo bus station, located near the city center.

An alternative Samar route may deviate from the main road, entering small towns.  Traveling in this way can take up to two hours with a little.  This option is more expensive - a ticket costs six euros eighty-one cents as of June 2018.  Buses can end the route in the suburbs of Toledo Asukaike, located five kilometers from the city, in which case you will have to use a local bus or take a walk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is another interesting way to get from Madrid to Toledo and get back.
