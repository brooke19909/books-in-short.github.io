  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The beginning of World War II: the main reasons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most grandiose, bloody and terrible war in the <span>history of mankind,</span> called the Second World War, did not begin <span>on September 1, 1939</span> , on the day when Hitlerite Germany attacked Poland.  The outbreak of World War II was inevitable since the end of the war in 1918, which led to the redivision of almost all of Europe.  Immediately after the signing of all the treaties, each of the redrawn countries, from which part of the territories was taken away, began its own little war.  While it was conducted in the minds and conversations of those who did not return from the front as victors.  They again and again experienced the events of those days, searched for the causes of defeat and passed on the bitterness of their own loss to their growing children. </p><p>  It was this hatred of enemies cherished for decades, the insult from the oppression of new owners of cities and villages, the need to get used to another, unusual life that made the beginning of World War II possible.  But all these reasons to resume the war were in the field of psychology.  There were real historical preconditions that led to the outbreak of hostilities, in which almost the entire <span>globe</span> was involved <span>.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Official reasons for the outbreak of World War II</strong> </p><p>  According to historical studies, scientists distinguish the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  <strong>territorial disputes</strong> arising as a result of the redivision of Europe by England, France and the <span>allied states.</span>  After the collapse of the Russian Empire as a result of its withdrawal from hostilities and the revolution that took place in it, as well as due to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 9 new states appeared on the world map at once.  Their boundaries were not yet clearly defined, and in many cases disputes were fought literally for every inch of land.  In addition, countries that lost part of their territories sought to return them, but the winners, who had joined new lands, were hardly ready to part with them.  The centuries-old history of Europe did not know a better way to resolve any, including territorial disputes, except military operations, and the beginning of World War II <strong> </strong>  became inevitable; </li><li>  to <strong>olonial disputes.</strong>  Here it is worth mentioning not only that the losing countries, having lost their colonies, providing the treasury with a constant flow of funds, certainly dreamed of their return, but also that a liberation movement was growing inside the colonies.  Tired of being under the yoke of certain colonialists, residents sought to get rid of any submission, and in many cases this also inevitably led to armed clashes; </li><li>  <strong>rivalry of leading powers.</strong>  It is difficult to admit that Germany, deleted from world history after its defeat, did not dream of taking revenge.  Deprived of the opportunity to have its own army (except for a volunteer one, the number of which could not exceed 100 thousand soldiers with light weapons), Germany, accustomed to the role of one of the leading world empires, could not accept the loss of its dominance.  The beginning of World War II in this aspect was only a matter of time; </li><li>  <strong>dictatorial regimes.</strong>  A sharp increase in their number in the second third of the 20th century created additional prerequisites for the outbreak of fierce conflict.  Paying great <span>attention to the development of the</span> army and weapons, first as a means of suppressing possible internal unrest, and then as a way of conquering new lands, the European and Eastern dictators did their best to bring the start of World War II; </li><li>  <strong>the existence of the USSR.</strong>  The role of the new socialist state that arose on the ruins of the Russian Empire as an irritant for the United States and Europe can hardly be overestimated.  The rapid development of communist movements in a number of capitalist powers against the background of the existence of such a clear example of victorious socialism could not but inspire concern, and an attempt to wipe the USSR from the face of the earth would inevitably be undertaken. </li></ul>
