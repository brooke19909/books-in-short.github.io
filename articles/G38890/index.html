So cigarette packs did not go unnoticed by the masters.  They are in the form of bricks, of which they make a variety of crafts: houses and cars, tanks and furniture for dolls. </p><p>  A robot made from a pack of cigarettes is considered the most popular craft.  Which of us did not make it in childhood?  Probably everyone once tried, especially children whose parents smoke.  But they were simple robots, no complaints.  Adult masters show more imagination, and their crafts are original, especially now there are many films about transformers that can be used as samples for creativity. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a robot out of packs of cigarettes, how to connect parts together, how to portray a character in motion, with his mouth open and on tracked wheels.  Let's start with simple options and show a masterpiece of creativity.  Photos of products will help to do the work on their own at home. </p><h2>  A simple copy with teeth </h2><p>  To work, you need 24 packs of cigarettes, all of them should be the same size, better than one firm.  You can glue parts together in several ways: </p><ul><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  double-sided tape. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="robot with teeth" class="if uuid-2677341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2677341.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the robot mouth to have teeth, cigarettes should be left in one of the packs.  In order for the craft to stand steadily, you need to install your legs on horizontally lying packs.  The broken lines of the hands are performed by opening the lid.  Consider how to make a robot, in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work on the figure </h2><p>  The execution of the crafts begins with the torso.  Put 8 packs on the surface of the table: 4 of them make up the bottom layer and 4 are on top.  In this case, we will fasten the parts with PVA glue, which will perfectly hold paper bundles.  Glue them to the body, smearing the surface of the box completely. </p><p>  Next we attach the hands.  The upper box is glued to the front plane of the lid, and on the elbow, to the upper part.  Similarly, we make the other hand.  You can make palms, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make robot hands" class="if uuid-2676178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2676178.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, work with the legs.  First, 2 packs are connected with an end part.  This is a robot foot made from packs of cigarettes.  The legs themselves also consist of 2 boxes, but they are connected by wide sides, and the narrow lower ones are attached to the prepared feet. </p><h2>  How to make a head </h2><p>  The head is done last.  Two packs are glued together: one with the lid up and the other down.  The front pack depicts the front of the robot.  She is left filled with cigarettes.  When opening the lid, rows of teeth-like filters are visible. </p><p>  Lids are cut from two packs and attached to the sides of the head.  They will represent the ears.  You can attach a wire antenna to the top of the robot‚Äôs head from packs of cigarettes, then it will be able to catch radio signals.  You can add eyes and nose from plastic covers, choosing the necessary colors.  Here is already a matter of your imagination. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Robot with epaulettes </h2><p>  Consider another version of the craft.  How to make a robot, you already know.  Various details can be added to the main figure, completely changing the appearance of a mechanical person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.taringa.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="robot with epaulettes" class="if uuid-2676237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2676237.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo above, the legs of the robot are made of three pairs of packs so that it is taller.  Legs will be more stable if two packs are attached between them.  The chest is made wider, and the arms are more bent at the elbows.  Shoulder straps are attached with a shift to the middle of the underlying pack. </p><h2>  Painted robot </h2><p>  When constructing a robot, cigarette packs can be left in the form in which they were sold, or can be pre-pasted with white paper.  This is necessary in order to add to the figure of originality and similarity with a real robot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme of the robot from packs of cigarettes" class="if uuid-2678423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2678423.jpg"></div><p>  Then, according to the scheme, the robot is packaged together from packs of cigarettes and begins to paint its ‚Äúbody‚Äù with gouache or markers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="robot from packs of cigarettes" class="if uuid-2676176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2676176.jpg"></div><p>  The sample above shows that the robot is painted like an iron lumberjack from the famous fairy tale by A. Volkov ‚ÄúThe Wizard of the Emerald City‚Äù.  The gray background depicts metal, there are green geometric elements with rivets. </p><h2>  Crawler Super Robot </h2><p>  It is not easy to come up with such a cool robot from packs of cigarettes, you will need artistic abilities and bright creative thinking.  However, using the photograph of the robot at our disposal, you can create an exact copy at home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cool crawler robot" class="if uuid-2677343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2677343.jpg"></div><p>  Additionally, in addition to cigarette boxes, you need to prepare rubber tubes, toy rockets, plastic bottle caps for the image of caterpillars.  You will also have to buy a can of yellow and black paint for uniform coloring of both cigarette boxes and plastic elements. </p><p>  In order for the parts to hold tight, because the fasteners are located on bends and thin edges, it is best to use a glue gun in this case.  Hot glue will make the robot strong, you can play with it without fear that something will fall off the figure. </p><p>  An opened pack depicting a mouth needs to be painted black from the inside.  As eyes, you can use black caps from felt-tip pens or markers.  An inscription in beautiful font is made on the chest of the robot.  If you do not have the talent of an artist, then you can simply stick a picture from a magazine or attach a bright sticker.  If you are a patriot of your country, then you can depict the flag or coat of arms of the state in a prominent place. </p><p>  As you can see, a robot from cigarette boxes can be made in different ways.  If you are a beginner, then try the simple option first.  The main thing is to adhere to the assembly diagram shown in the photo in the article.  Over time and with experience, you will be able to create the coolest robot.  Bring your children to work, it will be interesting for them to create their own toy. </p>
