    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the region </h2><p>  Many tourists from the Russian Federation and other <span>CIS countries</span> fell in love with Alanya.  This is a major resort in the Mediterranean Sea located in the Antalya region.  The nearest airport is in Antalya, and a transfer to the hotel takes about two hours.  It is about 150 kilometers.  Most of the villages of Alanya lies on a rocky cape 250 meters high. These places have gained popularity as a tourist resort relatively recently, only 15 years ago.  The city has a long history, and in addition to the standard eastern bazaar for all Turkish cities, it also boasts ancient sights such as the Red Tower, for example. <br><br>  Over the 15 years that the resort has been actively developing, many modern hotels have appeared in Alanya, and a modern tourist infrastructure has been built.  The development of resort infrastructure was also facilitated by the picturesque area around the city.  The coastal strip of Alanya is very open, and small mountains are located far from the coastline, creating an incredible view.  The shallow sea and wide beaches are the best suited for families.  Note that the beaches are sandy, as opposed to the pebbled Kemer.  The tourist season begins in early April and ends in mid-November.  In winter, during the low season, this is a favorite place for elderly tourists from Germany. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortuna alanya 5 turkey alanya" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/770586.jpg" width="590"></div>
