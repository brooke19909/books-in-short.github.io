  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a drum at home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order for your baby to arouse and develop interest in music, you need some kind of musical instrument.  For children, a handmade gift will be much more valuable than a gift bought in a store.  The simplest and most understandable tool for a child will be a drum.  How to make drums at home to cause indescribable delight in a child?  Consider a few simple manufacturing methods. </p><h2>  Can drum </h2><p>  An idea without costs and not requiring special skills.  How to make a drum? </p><p>  So, we proceed to implement the crafts called "drum".  We will need: </p><ul><li>  tin can; </li><li>  colored matter, and in its absence colored paper; </li><li>  a piece of leather, laces from it; </li><li>  glue, wooden sticks and cotton wool. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pearldrummersforum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Model drum from a barrel" class="if uuid-2733623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733623.jpg"></div><p>  Tool manufacturing steps: </p><ol><li>  We glue the jar with colored matter, if not at hand, then use colored paper. </li><li>  We draw the bottom of the can on a piece of leather, add another 10 cm in diameter and draw another circle. </li><li>  We puncture holes, not forgetting to step back 1 cm from the edge of the skin. </li><li>  Through the holes we pass leather laces, tighten strongly on one side of the tin.  We do the same with the bottom of the can.  Then we pass the cords along the diagonal, which should pass under the lower and upper laces. </li><li>  To beat the drum, you need sticks.  We take them, put them on the bead, glue a tight ball of cotton wool over the bead, without leaving any voids. </li></ol><h2>  Drum - Coffee Can </h2><p>  The easiest way to make a drum is to find a tin can of coffee.  Such a can with a nylon cover is found in every home.  Getting started: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  We glue the lid with the can itself so that it does not fly off. </li><li>  On one edge of each stick, we wind the cotton wool tightly with glue, making a ball. </li><li>  The main difficulty is the tape for the drum, so you need to tie it around the can so that it does not slip and snug very tightly against the can.  A bow or belt from your favorite dress is ideal for this. </li></ol><p>  A plastic bucket with a lid is also a drum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crafty-couple.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drum at home from under the can" class="if uuid-2733635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733635.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a drum so that it can even be painted with paint or decorated with some intricate decor?  It all depends on your imagination and your child.  You can even make a professional drummer out of a kid by making him several instruments from buckets of different diameters, and then you get a whole drum set.  Chopsticks can be ordinary pencils or felt-tip pens. </p><p>  The lids of these buckets sit very tight, so nothing needs to be done with them.  Hanging it around the neck will not be difficult: remove the bow and thread the tape into each hole and tie it.  Do you think it is possible to come up with a better drum than this?  Not unless it's real.  But it takes so much costs and difficult materials that it’s better for the child to play this drum.  Simplicity of manufacture, sound - all this makes it the best self-made drum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Corrugated Drum </h2><p>  How to make a cardboard drum?  It is not intended for playing, most likely, for various scenery.  Used as crafts, exhibit in kindergarten.  It looks very nice, but such an exhibit will not last long for your child. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade drummer" class="if uuid-2733628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733628.jpg"></div><h2>  Drum as a Christmas decoration </h2><p>  To stand out with originality, bring a fake made with the baby.  Among the uniformity of products: from Christmas toys, various snowflakes, your instrument will fit beautifully.  You need to decide what size the future drum will be. </p><ol><li>  Normal size, then it can be put under the tree. </li><li>  Small size, then it can be given into the hands of some soft toy. </li><li>  Large, then it can be used as a museum exhibit. </li></ol><h2>  Paper drum </h2><p>  How to make a paper drum?  This requires paper, cotton buds, an empty roll of tape, wire, thread and your imagination.  It is also worth noting that the thicker the paper, the better the sound of a similar drum will be.  A4 paper is good, but not quite thick, so an album sheet can be ideal, it uses thicker material, which, by the way, better withstand moisture and dampness.  Glossy paper shows itself worse than anyone else, since the sticks can slip off when you hit it, which will make the sounds distort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade drum with sticks" class="if uuid-2733627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733627.jpg"></div><p>  If, after reading what is written, you take up the manufacture of a drum with your own hands with your child, you will feel the difference between when the child watches a cartoon or does a craft with you.  Where do you think there will be more delight, surprise, pride and, most importantly, joy?  And that means that we worked not in vain, either. </p>
