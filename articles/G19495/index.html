The city is located between Girona and Barcelona.  It is famous for its vast beaches of many kilometers and the azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  Pineda de Mar was once just a fishing village.  But since the mid-twentieth century, the coast began to be intensively built up, as a result of which the city has now turned into a resort on the territory of which many hotels of various levels have been built.  There are budget establishments and expensive hotels.  In our article we want to talk about the three-star hotel Sumus Hotel Stella Spa. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  umus Hotel Stella Spa was founded in 1963.

    <p>  The animation team entertains not only young tourists, but also their parents.  Themed parties and entertainment shows are held throughout the week.  And in the daytime vacationers can take part in sports and events organized by a team of animators.  In the evenings, guests are entertained with live music, karaoke.  Fans of gambling can play billiards, table tennis or try their luck on slot machines. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Sumus Hotel Stella Spa 3 * (Spain) is located near the coast.  The road to the beach at a very slow pace takes no more than five minutes.  The coastal zone is sandy.  The beach is municipal and very clean.  It has sun loungers and umbrellas, which can be rented if necessary. </p><h2>  Sumus Stella Spa Hotel 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I certainly want to turn to the reviews of tourists who have already managed to visit it.  Sumus Stella Hotel Spa (Spain) is located in a very calm and measured resort.  If you are looking for active entertainment or vibrant nightlife, then you should consider other coastal cities of Spain as an option.  Pineda de Mar in terms of entertainment may seem to young people very boring and uninteresting.  In general, it is worth noting that a lot of pensioners from Germany and Spain rest in the hotel, and in the resort itself. </p><p>  The hotel has a very good location.  Nearby is a train station with which you can quickly get to Barcelona or Girona on your own.  And the beach is literally a five minute walk.  Near the building there are cafes, restaurants, and shops.  Therefore, at your side there is everything that tourists may need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sumus stella spa hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1775391.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel reception offers friendly and attentive staff.  There are even Russian-speaking workers.  But in their absence it is difficult to explain, since the Spaniards do not know English at all.  In all establishments and cafes, everyone speaks only Spanish, so often have to be explained in sign language. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  Sumus Hotel Stella Spa, which we described in the article, offers guests accommodation in apartments of various categories.  It is worth noting that the hotel rooms are very modest in size, especially with regard to the Standards.  If you do not plan to spend a lot of time in the room, but are going to come only in the evening, then the hotel will suit you. </p><p>  In general, tourists recommend taking rooms of a higher category than standard, since such apartments have several advantages.  Firstly, they are more spacious, and secondly, their guests do not need to pay for the Internet and a mini-fridge. </p><p>  If you still prefer to take the standard, then it is also quite good.  It has a large and roomy wardrobe, a double bed and a large terrace.  In general, all rooms in the hotel are equipped with spacious furnished balconies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sumus hotel stella spa 3 spain" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1775393.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to guests, the hotel staff does a great job cleaning.  It is produced daily (at about 11.00).  Tourists have no complaints about cleanliness.  The hotel is always clean and tidy.  Linen and towels are changed regularly according to the schedule. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  How is food organized at Sumus Hotel Stella Spa?  Reviews of tourists regarding food are always controversial, no matter how chic the hotel is.  However, this does not apply to our hotel.  According to vacationers, the food here is up to the mark. </p><p>  First, a few words about the restaurant itself.  It has a very original design, interesting paintings in the style of Pablo Picasso are placed on its walls.  The tables are always clean white tablecloths, everything is clean and very neat. </p><p>  The restaurant practices a buffet.  If you want to order dishes on the menu, then this is possible, but you will have to pay for them.  Guests can pay half board or take advantage of All Inclusive.  Whatever option you choose, you will certainly be satisfied with the quality of food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sumus stella hotel spa spain" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1775394.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The restaurant staff is well prepared and does its job well.  The food is always varied and tasty.  There is a good selection of meat on the tables.  There is chicken, pork, jamon and beef.  Daily fish is offered, sometimes snails, mussels and other seafood are served.  Visitors can also enjoy the sausage and cheese variety.  Well, the variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as salads, is out of the question.  In general, the guests of the establishment are very satisfied not only with the quantity, but also with the quality of food. </p><p>  As for children, there is no problem with their nutrition.  On the tables you can always find what the child will like.  And in the morning there is always milk porridge.  Not for nothing that the hotel is aimed at couples with children. </p><p>  There is a bar on the street where you can enjoy drinks and snacks throughout the day.  Those tourists who prefer half board can always dine at one of the nearest restaurants or cafes to appreciate the culinary abilities of local chefs. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  In general, the hotel makes the most pleasant impression.  Of course, as in any institution, there are some minor flaws.  But is it worth paying attention to them ... </p><p>  The hotel has a fairly vast and beautiful area with a good pool, which has a children's area and a jacuzzi.  There are always few people in it.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the sea is very close.  And, of course, tourists prefer it over an artificial pond. </p><p>  An on-site spa is available for guests over 15 years old.  Treatment fees are not included in the Sumus Hotel Stella Spa.  Services of such a plan must be paid separately.  Our compatriots do not practice visiting the spa, because the cost of services is a little expensive.  So, for example, one massage session costs 30 euros. </p><p>  Periodically, the restaurant hosts theme nights.  Then the waiters dress in the appropriate clothes, according to the subject.  On such evenings, there is especially a lot of food on the tables, a variety of seafood and interesting dishes appear. </p><p>  The bar plays live music in the evenings, sometimes animators organize Spanish evenings and other shows.  In general, the animation is not too active, but quite acceptable.  But the kids club is very popular with children, it has Russian-speaking staff. </p><h2>  Minor hotel flaws </h2><p>  A big minus of the hotel is the Internet.  It is difficult to say at all whether he is or not.  It is believed that in all rooms, except for standards, it is free.  It can also be used in the bar.  But in fact, his speed leaves much to be desired, and he himself often disappears.  Therefore, communication with relatives can be forgotten.  You need to either pay extra for the Internet, or be content with little. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sumus hotel stella spa reviews" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1775397.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The disadvantages of the hotel include mass smoking.  Almost everywhere on its territory, all vacationers smoke, including in a bar.  For non-smoking guests this is unacceptable. </p><p>  The rest of the hotel is quiet and measured. </p><h2>  Beach and Entertainment Reviews </h2><p>  The proximity of the beach is the main advantage of the hotel.  The road to the sea does not take more than five minutes.  The local coast is very clean, it has a sand cover.  According to tourists, the sea is very clear and clean.  But periodically there are waves.  Calm water depends on the season.  So, for example, in June the sea has not yet warmed up, and therefore it is quite cool, often storming. </p><p>  There are practically no marine activities on the coast.  Also there is no wide variety of coastal cafes and bars.  The beaches are always spacious and there is no influx of tourists.  Pineda de Mar is a very calm resort, designed for those vacationers who are not looking for noisy and stormy entertainment.  Along the sea there is no luxury promenade, as in other resorts in Spain.  But this does not deprive tourists of the opportunity to walk in the evenings along the sea. </p>
