It’s impossible to go past such beauty.  But you can make flowers from paper with your own hands so that they are just like real ones. </p><p>  If you use crepe paper for crafts, the similarity will be so perfect that you want to bend to the flower to catch a delicate aroma.  Do-it-yourself <span>paper flowers</span> are made by both adults and children.  This is a very exciting activity that does not endure haste, helps to relax and rest. </p><p>  Even beginners can make <span>flowers out of paper</span> with their own hands.  The main thing is to do everything slowly, carefully.  Such flowers made with a soul can be an unusual and original gift.  Roses look especially beautiful from paper. </p><p>  <span>DIY paper</span> roses can be done in several ways.  Very beautiful roses come from corrugated paper or fabric.  But if neither one nor the other is at hand, paper flowers can be made with your own hands even from an ordinary napkin.  For work, you still need scissors and a stapler.  From a napkin that you do not need to unfold, cut a circle with a slightly wavy edge, six to seven centimeters in diameter.  Then roll up with a small bag and fasten it in the middle with a stapler, placing the mount across.  Now the lower part needs to be bent and turned up. </p><p>  You can stick the finished rose on cardboard, stick the stem and leaves - you get a beautiful postcard.  And if you glue several of these colors, you get a whole bunch.  These roses can decorate a gift box. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For work, it is better to take colored napkins.  Very <span>beautiful flowers</span> are obtained from red napkins.  To paint white napkins in any color is not so simple, a certain skill is needed here.  If you paint the napkins with paints, they will simply tear or become uneven. </p><p>  You can try to color the napkin with a sponge and a marker: apply ink to the sponge and dye the napkin by blotting so that when folding the most intense color has the sharp end of the bag, and closer to the edge it is almost white, as if dissolved.  After a short workout, the color of the flower will be more natural. </p><p>  It is not at all difficult to make such flowers from paper with your own hands, and it will take a little time, but they are good only for gluing on cardboard, they can not be put in a vase, since they do not have stems. </p><p>  A rose from paper with your own hands on a leg is made in different ways.  Here is the easiest way.  Take double-sided colored paper, such as red, and cut a 4 by 4 centimeter square out of it.  On the square you need to draw a spiral and cut with scissors, starting from the edge to the center.  Then you need to fold the flower, starting from the outer edge and moving to the inner.  So that the rose does not unfold ahead of time, it must be held tight.  Several ready-made roses need to be attached to the twig with glue and put in a vase.  Get an original bouquet. </p><p>  Here is another, easier way, <span>how to make flowers from paper</span> with your own hands on a leg.  The difference is that you need to twist a straight strip of toilet paper or a 25-centimeter long napkin folded along. </p><p>  We wrap a strip on a wire slightly adding and forming petals.  X-shaped sepals are cut out of green paper and put on a wire.  Double leaflets are cut out of the same paper, and a long narrow strip is glued between them, which will wrap the stem.  Having made several of these flowers, you can get an original bouquet. </p><p>  You can wrap such roses on a toothpick and then attach a few pieces to a tennis ball.  Such a ball can be attached to the wire.  And from several of these flowers you can <span>make a bouquet.</span>  No matter how the roses are made, made with the soul with their own hands, they will always cause a smile and uplift. </p>
