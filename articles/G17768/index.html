    <p>  In the southwestern side of the <span>Pacific Ocean</span> lies the amazingly beautiful country of Papua New Guinea.  It includes the eastern territory of the <span>island of New Guinea, the</span> Louisiana and Bismarck archipelagos and other islands.  This is a corner of wildlife with impenetrable jungle, magnificent waterfalls, centuries-old swamps and coral reefs. </p><p>  Like everything created on this earth, <span>Papua New Guinea</span> has its own history.  Until the middle of the 16th century, the island was simply called Papua.  Translated from Malay, this word means curly.  He got this name from the Portuguese navigator Menezes, who landed on the island in 1526 and saw that all the natives are curly.  Only in 1545, the Spanish navigator named the island of New Guinea, as the locals had great similarities with the African natives.  The peoples living in this country are diverse.  There are a huge number of tribes, so there are more than 850 languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the territory. </p><p>  And what is the beauty of a unique nature!  To describe it is simply not enough vocabulary of the Russian language.  You can evaluate all its greatness only with your own eyes, and for this you need to make a trip to a corner of the world hidden from civilization - Papua New Guinea.  A tour to this country will allow you to plunge into the distant past, see Aboriginal people, get acquainted with their way of life and culture.  In addition, you can see the <span>rarest birds</span> and animals, the existence of which, perhaps, did not know. </p><p>  Tourist trips in the state of Papua New Guinea include beach vacations, cruises, boat trips, hiking in the mountains, walks in nature reserves and zoos and much more.  Active holidaymakers are offered diving, windsurfing and kitesurfing.  All this will not let any of the vacationers get bored. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Along with all this, there are many attractions that you can start exploring from the port capital of Port Moresby.  This is a small town, which includes both architectural buildings belonging to the colonial period and modern offices.  In the historical part of the city is the Art Gallery.  Here you can visit the National Museum.  One of the attractive buildings is the old building of the United Church of Al, built in 1890.  The historical part of the city is sharply replaced by the Baroko district, where modern buildings of expensive hotels and a large shopping center rise.  Almost all restaurants and bars are concentrated in the same area. </p><p>  Among the visited attractions of Papua New Guinea, which are located in Port Moresby, there is the National Botanical Garden, which contains amazing <span>birds of paradise</span> and a huge collection of beautiful orchids.  In the mountainous surroundings of the city, the Varirat National Park is located, from the territory of which the whole Port Moresby is visible.  For a comfortable stay in the park there is a camping area.  Small cozy houses are installed here, where tired tourists, whose strength is running out, can spend the night.  There is a barbecue bar.  In addition, it is recommended to visit the military cemetery of Boman, to explore the magnificent waterfalls of Rowan. </p><p>  Among the natural attractions, an uphill to Wilhelm Mountain will be interesting.  For vacationers, several routes are offered, varying in degree of difficulty.  Knowledgeable tourists do this on their own.  However, in order not to take risks, it is better to take a walk in the presence of a guide.  And do not forget to visit a paradise called the Gardens of Eden. </p><p>  Well, what kind of vacation in Papua New Guinea can do without visiting one of the local villages.  This is where you can learn about local culture and traditions.  An unforgettable sight is a sing song.  This is dancing to the drums in clothes made of palm leaves, in which all residents participate. </p>
