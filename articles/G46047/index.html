The first thing we observe after buying a phone is its box, which contains all the necessary accessories.  Included with the Nokia 735 are the most standard things that come with any smartphone: a charger and instructions.  If you need any headphones, then you have to buy it yourself.  The box is quite dense, but the information on it is very scarce, if you want to know the details about the phone, you will have to look at the instructions. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

But this can not be called a minus.  The material, which is replaced by metal, is made of very high quality, it is pleasant to the touch and is able to protect the phone from third-party influences.  Another advantage is that the coating ignores environmental conditions, always remaining in approximately the same temperature range.  But for some, this option is not suitable only because of the lack of an elitist look, because metal has the property to create such a feeling, and Nokia Lumiya 735 does not have it.  The smartphone is very light, does not interfere with the owner of its dimensions, it holds confidently in the hand, and the average person will not have problems with controlling the device with one hand.  A bit unpleasant is the fact that in order to replace the SIM card, you have to tear off the cover with all your might.  Otherwise, it just doesn‚Äôt work.  Compared to previous models, where this process went smoothly and without using excessive force, everything is much worse here.  With all the difficulty of disconnecting the cover, it gets back instantly and very easily.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For someone who has already met with smartphones, it will be surprising that there are no buttons on the front of the screen, because they were made software.  Quite an interesting solution, which has its fans and those who do not like this option.  The microphone was placed on the edge of the bottom panel, and the camera, speaker, and sensors remained on the top.  One caveat.  In the place where the speaker is, there is a recess in which dust accumulates: unpleasant, but not critical.  The developers of Nokia Lumia 735 decided to remove the camera control button - again a very controversial decision.  Although all the other controls are very convenient and well pressed, today, when every second person takes a couple of shots a day, the lack of a separate key for quick access to the sensor looks ambiguous. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

All the salt is in a special matrix, in which the number of green LEDs is two times more than other colors.  This allows you to make the image more acidic, but not everyone likes it, and because of this, you can notice the LED array, especially when looking at fonts.  Also, the touch screen can take as many as 10 touches at the same time, which, of course, is a big plus.  There is another important advantage.  The Nokia 735 recognizes gloves when touched, which turns out to be a salvation on cold days.

There are always buttons at hand to control the sound volume.  Both speakers are very loud, even make the whole phone vibrate.  True, the human voice is a little distorted, but this is not a critical flaw.  The main speaker, even at maximum volume, does not begin to distort the sound or produce extraneous noise.  It does not stand out in the smartphone case, so if you cover it, the sound instantly disappears, becoming very deaf and quiet.  This fact also cannot be called a critical flaw.  The sound that is fed into the headphones is very pleasing in its purity and volume, but in order to fully experience this quality, you will have to purchase a good headset.  There is the ability to connect an FM radio.  For it to work, you need to insert headphones that will act as an antenna.  Everything here also works without failures, it gives a truly high-quality signal.

Moreover, both elements are very good.  The front camera is practically not inferior in quality photos.  Both sensors can shoot video in FullHD-resolution.  The interface itself when working with the camera is already well recognized by previous models from Nokia.  Here you can not delve into the settings and put pre-made templates, but if they do not suit you, then wider options are easily opened.  With all these advantages, it is not clear why they decided not to make a shortcut key to the camera.

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Thanks to its filling, the Nokia 735 smartphone can easily cope with heavy games, which take a lot of resources, and the engineers also worked on the computation speed, which has improved significantly.  This is especially noticeable when working with demanding applications.  The installed battery has a capacity of 2220 mA / h.  Its charge should be enough for one to two days, depending on the time of direct use of the smartphone.  At its average price, it shows excellent characteristics, so that its purchase can make many people happy. </p><h2>  Opinion </h2>

Design belong to the undoubted advantages, indicate that it is concise and made with taste.  The form, color, as well as the interface are called pleasant and intuitive to use.
