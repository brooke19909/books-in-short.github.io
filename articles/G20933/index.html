Many of them believe that this is a message to us from our ancestors.  In principle, the way it is.  However, there are museums that are located directly in the open.  They not only look much more interesting, but are also more natural, as if pouring into the rest of nature.  If you have never been to such a museum, then be sure to go, as here you will get a lot of new impressions. </p><h2>  Open Air Museum named Hakone </h2><p>  This museum was opened in 1969 in Japan.  He became the first museum here, which is located directly in the open air - without a bulky roof, which is usually used to protect against weather conditions. </p><p>  The territory, constantly changing depending on the season, has become a permanent home for more than 120 works by contemporary sculptors and artists.  The museum also has 5 exhibition halls, including the Picasso Pavilion, as well as places where children can play, take a foot bath, fed by natural hot springs. </p><p>  There are many other objects where visitors can relax, enjoying the beauty of the local nature and the unusual works of art located in this area.  The Hakone Open Air Museum has a collection of approximately 300 works by Picasso, acquired from his oldest daughter, Maya Picasso.  All are on a rotating display in the Picasso Pavilion.  The museum is rich in many restaurants and shops in addition to exhibition galleries. </p>

    <h2>  Living Museum "Black Country" </h2><p>  This is a real city.  The open-air museum includes more than 40 buildings that recreate the atmosphere of life in the middle lane during the industrial era.  Among them, an old school, shops, houses, a cinema and a pub stand out.  Visitors can travel by electric trams, trolleybuses.  That is, the atmosphere of the city has not changed much since the period of the industrial era.  Thanks to the demonstrators in the costumes, the buildings completely returned to their previous lives.  A schoolboy, a doctor, a cook, a teacher, and even a military man can meet on the road.  An open-air museum cannot be left before 4 hours, because there are so many interesting and unusual things here! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Museum in Detmold </h2><p>  The small <span>German</span> open-air <span>museum city of</span> Detmold has many attractions, including a great place to visit - the Freilichtmuseum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Detmold is a very popular destination for tourists.  The old city center with a theater and a park is really worth a look. </p><p>  But Detmold's main attraction is the beautiful castle, Furstliches Residenzschloss.  The price of the visit is 4 euros. </p><p>  Now let's go directly to the museum.  It is called the Municipal Museum of Westphalia, dedicated to folklore / ethnolinguistics, and is located on the outskirts of the city, but walking there from the center is quite easy.  It takes no more than 15-20 minutes.  Entrance here costs 5 euros, and for children - 4 euros. </p><p>  The first thing visitors can see at the entrance is a <span>water mill,</span> near which there are horses.  Any tourist can hire a carriage and plunge into the atmosphere of the past. </p><p>  One of the buildings houses an exhibition called "Planet Westfalen 2010".  By the way, the Ruhr District was called the cultural <span>capital of Europe,</span> so many compositions and events are dedicated to him. </p><p>  The field, wooden houses, sheep pastures and windmills - most likely, it looked exactly that many years ago.  This unusual atmosphere has been preserved in the city of Detmold until now. </p>

    <h2>  Which museum to choose? </h2><p>  To get started, go to any open-air museum that is nearby.  Some people, even if they don‚Äôt like going to museums, may be satisfied with visiting the museum ‚Äúin the air‚Äù.  For others, such a place may not cause any emotions at all.  Therefore, before you go to another country, decide what category you belong to: do you like such museums or not!  In any case, museums "on the air" are much more interesting than ordinary ones. </p>
