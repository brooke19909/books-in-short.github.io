Peoples and ancient states on the territory of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Ancient people</span> in Russia appeared in time immemorial.  About 700 thousand years ago, for the first time settled in its southern territories - on the banks <span>of the Kuban River</span> and the North Caucasus.  The climate here was mild, nature - rich in plant and animal food, so the ancient people did not make much effort to obtain it, but appropriated the gifts. </p><h2>  ice Age </h2><p>  Ancient people in Russia could not live one at a time, since there were many dangers, so they began to unite in groups called the primitive human herd.  Together they got food, defended themselves from predators and kept fire.  But about 80 thousand years ago, living conditions sharply worsened.  The icy cold shackled the <span>northern territories of</span> our continent.  An endless tundra ran from the border of the glacier, and to the south, right to the Black Sea, was the cold steppe.  The inhabitants also changed: instead of heat-loving animals, woolly ones appeared, such as mammoths, rhinos, bison, horses, reindeers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient people on the territory of modern Russia table" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/796929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The man had a hard time, but he adapted.  His main occupation now consisted of driven hunting.  The need for heating forced the ancient man not only to maintain fire, but also to master the wisdom of its extraction.  Gradually, people settled north, despite the difficult living conditions.  The site of an ancient man was discovered in Ukraine, in the Middle and Lower Volga. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then the human herd was supplanted by the clan community uniting blood relatives.  Several such communities constituted a tribe.  Changing living conditions, and with them the appearance of man.  It took a modern look about 40 thousand years ago. </p><h2>  Agriculture, cattle breeding </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the ice age came to an end about 12-14 thousand years ago, many large animals became extinct, so hunting and gathering could no longer feed people.  New sources of subsistence were born.  Gathering smoothly goes into agriculture in the south of the country about 5-6 thousand years ago.  In parallel, the process of transition of hunting to cattle breeding is ongoing.  An ancient man tamed a dog, a horse, a pig, a goat.  The necessary products are now produced, not assigned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient people in Russia" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/796925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The appearance of artisans </h2><p>  Gradually, ancient people learned to spin, weave and sew clothes, burn clay and make dishes from ceramics.  Lands of the north went to explore, applying new achievements in the field of vehicles.  On sleds, skis and boats, everyone walked and walked until they reached the shores of the Baltic and the Arctic Ocean. </p><p>  <span>The material culture of</span> ancient people rises to a new level in connection with the acquisition of metal processing skills.  With metal tools, the earth has become more malleable.  In the production of food stocks, surpluses began to arise that served as objects of exchange between tribes.  The processing of iron and other materials required great skills and experience, so there were people involved in a certain craft.  Craftsmen brought great benefits, they produced tools and various products. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ethnoses for the beginning of a new era </h2><p>  Ancient people on the territory of modern Russia (table No. 1, No. 2), according to the studies of historians and linguists, lived in numerous ethnic groups.  In the European part, Finnish tribes soon became glorified and played a fundamental role in the development of the Russian population.  Today on the Middle Yenisei there are only a few hundred Kets, and on the Kolyma - the Yukagirs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient culture" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/796950.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ancient people in the territory of modern Russia (table No. 2) were one of the first to master the North Caucasus, and according to scientists, only religion has changed there during this time.  At first Christianity spread, but over time it was supplanted by Islam. </p><p>  Paganism is interspersed with the new religion in <span>modern times.</span>  The Northern Caucasus, the lower reaches of the Don and Volga, along the southern edge of Siberia and in Altai, is the territory of the ancient nomadic tribes of the Scythians-Sarmatians, the Caucasus and the Don are the refuge of the Alans, the Saks lived to the east.  In the Middle Ages mixed with Polovtsy.  During the invasion of Batu Khan, part of the Alans' descendants hid in the mountains, therefore they survived - these are the ancestors of modern Ossetians. </p><p>  Where did ancient people live on the territory of modern Russia?  Table No. 1 clearly demonstrates this. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 495px; height: 312px;"><tbody><tr><td>  Location </td><td>  Tribes </td></tr><tr><td>  Center and north of the European part </td><td>  Finnish: all, chud, muroma, merya. </td></tr><tr><td>  Northeast </td><td>  Finnish (ancestors of the present): Estonians, Finns, Karelians, Komi, Mordovians. </td></tr><tr><td>  South Urals and Siberia </td><td>  Ugric peoples, ancestors of the Khanty and Mans. </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Of course, these are far from all ancient people in the territory of modern Russia.  Table 2 continues the first. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 367px; height: 155px;"><tbody><tr><td>  Location </td><td>  Peoples </td></tr><tr><td>  East to Altai and Sayan </td><td>  Ancestors of Samoyed peoples: Nenets, Selkups </td></tr><tr><td>  Eastern Siberia </td><td>  Hunting tribes: Khets, Yukagirs </td></tr><tr><td>  Far East </td><td>  Future Nivkhs, Koryaks, Chukchi, Eskimos </td></tr><tr><td>  North Caucasus </td><td>  Kasogi (later Circassians), Aesy (ancestors of the Abkhazians) </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Bosporus State </h2><p>  After the improvement of the tools, many families were able to manage their households independently, which is why family ties are weakening.  The clan community is replaced by the neighboring (territorial).  People are united on the basis of living in a certain territory.  Tribes with close economic ties are united in tribal unions.  At their head are rulers.  These changes lead to the collapse of the primitive communal system and the emergence of a new organizational form - the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient man‚Äôs parking" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/796924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The first states arose in the south of Russia.  Greek sailors in the 7-6 centuries BC  e.  founded city states on the Black Sea coast (east and north).  Cities near the <span>Kerch Strait</span> in the 5th century BC united in the Bosporus kingdom, which became the richest state in the northern part of the Black Sea coast. </p><h2>  Scythian kingdom </h2><p>  The neighbors of the Greeks were Iranian-speaking tribes, collectively called <span>Scythians.</span>  <span>Scythian</span> tribes were divided into cattle-breeding, which wandered, and agricultural, which led a sedentary lifestyle.  The land of the Scythians was desirable for many conquerors, so the tribes united to repulse the blow.  At the head of the union stood the strongest leader and proclaimed himself king.  So a new state appeared - the Scythian kingdom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient people of the earth" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/796927.jpg" width="244"></div>

    <p>  In the 4th century BC, it stretched from the Danube to the steppes of Crimea.  From the 3rd century BC  e.  the states of the northern Black Sea region began to be invaded by nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns.  The attack of the Huns in the 4th century obliterated the first states on the territory of the northern Black Sea coast. </p>
