    <h2>  Elite city for yachtsmen </h2><p>  Porto Montenegro in Montenegro appeared as if by magic, when a Canadian businessman Peter Munch fell in love with these picturesque places with a warm <span>azure sea</span> and climate.  On the coast of the city of Tivat, he bought a plot of land and decided to turn the picturesque surroundings into a luxurious and fashionable area for owners of sea yachts.  This happened in 2006.  Several reputable entrepreneurs from different countries have become participants in a new exclusive project: S. Demian, Rothschilds, B. Arno and Anthony Munch.  To bring this plan to life, the famous British landscape designer Martin Lane Fox was invited, as well as the famous American architect Kevin Lynch.  When they started work, only an unremarkable marina was located here.  Four years later, a unique luxury complex grew in Porto Montenegro (Montenegro).  In Europe there are only a few such resorts.  In the Adriatic, something similar no longer exists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Montenegro, Tivat, Porto Montenegro </h2>

    <p>  The charming small town of Tivat is located on the shore of one of the largest bays of the Adriatic Sea.  People have chosen this place since the III century BC.  e.  Who just did not want to possess these lands!  They consistently belonged to Rome, Byzantium, Serbia, Venice, Ottomans, Austria and finally Montenegro.  Everyone left their mark in this town.  On the island of Flowers from the monastery built by the Serbs, the temple of the Holy Trinity remained.  The nearby island of St. Mark is now undergoing a grand construction of an exclusive resort.  On the third island called Otok there is a Jesuit monastery.  The urban complex of buildings, which is called Bucha, now houses a cultural center consisting of a museum exposition, an art gallery and a summer scene.  And not far away is the Botanical Garden, where sailors from around the world brought decorative exotic plants.  Its foundation dates from the end of the 19th century.  At the same time, Arsenal was built - a naval port.  Now it has transformed and become a marina for super-yachts called Porto Montenegro.  Today it is a ‚Äúcity in a city‚Äù with its restaurants, cafes, bars, entertainment centers, boutiques.  About this story further.  In the meantime, we‚Äôll talk about individual places where wealthy tourists from all over the world settle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Regent Porto Montenegro Hotel </h2><p>  In the city of Tivat is a magnificent hotel, which is located in the center of the truly royal complex of Porto Montenegro.  <span>Kotor Bay</span> (Montenegro), on the banks of which the entire resort is located, is so unique that it is under the protection of UNESCO.

    <p>  It is considered the most expensive in the world and is located on the small island of St. Stephen.  It is connected to the mainland by a small isthmus.  In the Middle Ages, it was just a simple village where fishermen lived.  It was rebuilt in the 50s and turned into a magnificent hotel, where many Hollywood stars like to stay.  It was here that the famous chess match between <span>Boris Spassky</span> and <span>Bobby Fischer took place.</span> </p><h2>  New buildings in Porto Montenegro (Montenegro) </h2><p>  In 2019, the new Baia wing will be commissioned, which is executed in the style of the <span>Italian Riviera.</span>  The apartments will be adjacent terraces with beautiful views of the mountains or the sea. </p><p>  The construction of an eighteen-hole golf course is also foreseen. </p><p>  Three international airports are close enough: Tivat (7 km), Dubrovnik (46 km) and Podgorica (90 km). </p><h2>  Black lake </h2>

    <p>  It is the coldest lake in the Adriatic.  In winter, it even freezes and becomes covered with ice.  It is divided into Big and Small, and Small is half its size, but twice as deep.  The first refers to the Black Sea basin, and the second to the Adriatic Sea. </p><h2>  The largest bay of Montenegro </h2><p>  About this amazing bay you need to tell a little.  Kotor Bay in Montenegro bizarre forms crashes into land for twenty-eight km.  This is a former river bed, which went under sea water after shifts of the earth's crust.  The whole bay, divided into four parts, is very deep, and at its bottom the remains of dead schooners, ships and submarines of different historical times have found their place.  There are several islands.  Magnolias and mimosas, roses and pomegranates, olive groves bloom along the banks.  Numerous tourists have chosen Lusitsa Peninsula with White Pebble Zanitsa Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marina Porto Montenegro" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2003740.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this bay, one of the most beautiful in the world, there is a marina for four hundred and fifty yachts.  The world-class yacht club has the best conditions for sailing.  If the marina of Porto Montenegro could initially accept 85 yachts, now it can accommodate vessels of various sizes - even large ones that are up to one and a half hundred meters in length. </p><p>  The marina has the Museum of the Collection of Marine Heritage.  Today it is the best port of Montenegro.  It is located just two days of calm sailing from the popular resorts of Greece, France, Italy. </p><p>  The views of the Bay of Kotor with an abundance of magnificent yachts are simply amazing, and the presence of numerous restaurants and boutiques offers a serene seaside life. </p>
