    <p>  It is believed that if a person loses half of all the blood contained in the body, then he will die.  But even small losses have consequences.  Most often, these changes are negative.  Without tangible harm to the body, about fifteen percent of this vital fluid can be lost.  Of course, given the lack of <span>serious</span> chronic diseases in <span>humans</span> , intoxication or other deviations that violate and slow down the subsequent recovery.  The age of the victim is also important here: young children do not tolerate bleeding very well.  As well as the elderly, in whom coagulation is often impaired with age.  In addition, it was found that in hot weather, blood loss by the human body is much worse than in the cool months. </p><p>  <strong>How many liters of blood in a person.</strong>  <strong>The total number and possible differences in different groups of people</strong> </p><p>  Answering this question, we can only talk about the approximate volume.  So how many liters of blood in an ordinary person?  On average, the mass of a given liquid is between six and eight percent of the total weight.  The amount of blood in the body of each person varies, including, it depends on gender.  Despite the fact that a woman has about 4-4.5 liters of this fluid, and a man has 5-6 liters, which is much more, her loss is weaker in the weaker sex.  Interestingly, the main reason that men are better able to tolerate various physical activities, also lies in the composition of the red liquid.  Unlike female blood of the opposite sex has a higher content of hemoglobin and red blood cells.  This allows you to quickly saturate the body with oxygen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Donation and blood loss symptoms</strong> </p><p>  When asked how many liters of blood a person can take for medical purposes, doctors call slightly different numbers.  But on average 450 grams are taken from donors.  this fluid.  At the same time, a person does not feel any particular discomfort.  But the loss of 20 to 40 percent is already considered large.  It is characterized by cardiac abnormalities, tachycardia and a strong decrease in pressure.  Outwardly, this manifests itself in obvious pallor, rapid breathing, cold extremities.  Victims usually complain of dizziness, even <span>fainting is</span> possible <span>.</span>  <span>Loss of</span> more than 70 blood circulating in the body causes convulsions, agony, and practically leaves no one a chance to survive. </p><p>  It is also important for what period of time the human body loses blood.  A quick loss of two or three liters is fatal, although it, only distributed over a longer time, will not lead to <span>death.</span>  Large and frequent blood loss can ultimately lead to anemia.  Of course, if it is not a question of donation: in the hospital they will take only the minimum amount (as already mentioned, harmless to health). </p><p>  With a loss of not more than 30 percent of <span>blood, transfusion is</span> not required.  It will be enough for the victim to provide timely assistance and give time for recovery.  Small amounts of red wine or <span>pomegranate juice</span> can help this process <span>.</span>  Also, a good effect for replenishing the blood balance in the body is given by drinking from tea mixed with milk, and adding garlic to food.  Foods such as raisins, many fruits, especially those rich in iron, red fish, dried apricots, and nuts should definitely be added here.  Frequent drinking is recommended.  Full recovery is usually achieved within two weeks. </p><p>  You need to know: in order to satisfy your curiosity and find out how many liters of blood in a person, you need to understand what kind of blood is meant by this question.  The one that the body is able to lose if seriously injured?  But after all, it exists not only in its free form.  Forcing substances and circulating through the circulatory system, red fluid is only about 70%.  Some of it is constantly located in the muscles, kidneys and liver.  And also in the human brain. </p><p>  <strong>Quantity or quality?</strong> </p><p>  Does it matter how many liters of blood in a person?  It is important, although there are more serious indicators, especially since its amount varies depending on the weight.  The above five liters is an average.  The amount of blood in a person with a large physique can reach up to ten.  Even when it comes to anemia, this is by no means a small amount of red fluid.  In general, how many liters of blood in a person does not characterize his state of health.  Of greater importance is its composition.  Namely, the number of red bodies (red blood cells).  After all, it is known that the blood circulating throughout our body is nothing but a transparent liquid with impurities dissolved in it.  Otherwise, this substance is called plasma.  Red blood cells give it a characteristic color. </p>
