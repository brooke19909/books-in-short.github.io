After it was bought by bankers Viktor and Roman Krestins, the financial institution moved to Fryazino and changed its name to “Moscow Regional Bank”.  In subsequent years, the composition of shareholders changed several times.  97.94% of the credit institution belong to the Republican Financial Corporation OJSC, the rest is distributed among individuals.  Alexander Malchevsky owns 70% of the OJSC, and his father Andrzej headed the bank until 2011. </p><h2>  History of development </h2><p>  In 2005, Mosoblbank was admitted to <span>the insurance deposit system.</span>  This allowed to increase the number of units to 400 in just two years.  The quality of management is also evidenced by the fact that in 2013 the bank "adopted" more than 1000 ATMs, seven hundred terminals and 4 thousand POS-terminals, in which customers with <span>Visa and MasterCard</span> cards were served <span>.</span>  In 2011, its own money transfer system, MOPS, was launched. </p>

    <h2>  Start of trouble </h2><p>  Mosoblbank’s problems started back in 2011.  Then the Central Bank banned for six months to accept deposits from individuals.  The management was not at a loss and began to offer their shares for a meager amount.  Already then, experts had a question about how a financial institution manages to pay such huge interest on deposits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In August 2012, Izvestia published reports.  Mosoblbank had the highest rate fixed at 19.3%.  Management immediately denied this data in official sources.  The Bank continued to raise funds from business entities at a furious interest.  This could not affect the level of its development. </p><h2>  Key financial indicators </h2><p>  In 2013, National RA gave the bank the highest credit rating - “A +”.  61.9% of its net assets included loans to small and medium-sized businesses.  There was still 4.8% of investments in the Central Bank.  Due to attracted funds from individuals, the bank financed 81% of liabilities.  The total amount of reserves is 9%.  The amount of capital is 18.8 billion rubles.  Mosoblbank acted as a donor in the interbank market.  With such indicators, he took 8th place in Russia and 7th in Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Mosoblbank: problems of 2014 </h2><p>  05/07/2014, Vedomosti published data indicating that through one of the largest and most successful banks in Moscow, 60 billion rubles were transferred to affiliate campaign accounts through a fraudulent scheme.  The leadership of Mosoblbank immediately denied this information and filed a lawsuit in the Moscow arbitration court against the owner of the newspaper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  05/19/2014 The media reported that the Central Bank decided to sanitize three institutions at once: Mosoblbank, Inresbank and Finance Business Bank.  All of them belong to the Malchevsky family.  The Central Bank will allocate 117 billion rubles to solve the problem.  Sanatorium - SMP.  An official statement appeared in a couple of days, and after him - information in the press about money laundering schemes. </p><h2>  How did this happen </h2><p>  During the investigation, the Central Bank revealed a dengue laundering scheme.  Mosoblbank, having restrictions from the regulator, continued to attract deposits.  But he did not place them on accounts, but displayed them on the balance sheet of related companies. </p>

    <p>  Technically, the scheme is as follows.  In the afternoon, a normal deposit agreement is concluded with the depositor.  In the evening of the same day, the bank unilaterally terminates it, and transfers the money to the balance.  The depositor may demand them back at any time.  But on the balance sheet they will not be visible.  According to the financial results of 2014, the bank attracted deposits totaling 19.5 billion rubles.  This figure has not changed over the past two years.  Due to the atypical situation, DIA payments may at times exceed the amounts reflected in the balance sheet.  During the reorganization, the former owners - the Malchevsky family - will transfer all their assets to the NSR.  Mosoblbank does not recognize problems and issues related to money laundering. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  It is possible that no one would have known about the fraud, if not for the case.  One of the Mosoblbank depositors turned out to be an employee of the Central Bank.  He noted that deposits issued a day earlier were fully withdrawn in offices of neighboring cities.  As the investigation later showed, every night specially launched software terminated the contract and entered into new ones for investments in shares of RKF OJSC, the bank’s main shareholder.  The further fate of the money is unknown.  Part of the funds was found in the accounts of LLC Rus.  This is an equestrian park.  The investment, I must say, is dubious.  <span>The payback period</span> is 15 years.  The Central Bank is now looking for solutions to the problem that the Deposit Insurance Agency is waiting for, and the police chose to eliminate themselves. </p>

    <p>  The credit institution almost broke the record in the allocated amount of reorganization.  In 2008, the Central Bank allocated VTB 295 billion Russian rubles to rehabilitate the <span>Bank of Moscow</span> .  And here are the problems that Mosoblbank and its sanatoriums are experiencing today: in the register of investors, some real names are replaced with fictitious ones.  DIA will have to conduct an additional investigation.  This will invariably lead to an increase in the balance hole. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews: Mosoblbank </h2><p>  The problems of a financial institution are actively discussed on the Internet.  In June, information appeared that the bank did not return deposits.  But not all.  Deposits opened later than February 1, 2014 (in the amount of more than 700 thousand rubles) fell under the ban.  Mosoblbank explains the problems with payments on deposits by carrying out the reorganization procedure.  According to the new regulation, if the amount of funds does not exceed 700 thousand rubles, then a client can withdraw only 100 thousand from the account per day.  Otherwise, you need to write a statement to the bank.  It is considered by a special commission.  At this time, the contract and primary documents are verified, which confirm the fact of receipt of money in the account.  Moreover, such applications are not accepted by branches in all cities. </p>

    <p>  This innovation caused a lot of resentment from customers.  The situation is also exacerbated by the incompetence of employees.  This is especially true of subsidiaries of the financial institution Mosoblbank (Samara).  Customer problems are most common in this city.  Outraged people literally overwhelmed with complaints the Samara branch of the brainchild of Malchevsky. </p><p>  So, for a long time, the bank accepted <span>payment of utilities</span> without a commission.  But, according to customer reviews, now the situation has changed.  Many complain that a panel with the size of the commission appears after making bills in the self-service terminal.  Moreover, in case of refusal to make a payment, the amount of funds deposited in the terminal will not be returned.  For any complaints on this issue, employees assure that this can not be.  If the client refuses to pay, the bank will return the money to him.  Here are just a few who want to verify this statement, risking the amount of 6,000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  Mosoblbank is trying to solve the problems that have arisen this year in different ways.  In particular, many customers complain that they cannot receive money even on a bill of exchange.  Investors who terminate a deposit agreement earlier than the deadlines do not receive money at all.  Bank Mosoblbank explains problems of this kind with the actions of a sanatorium.  Since the SORT cannot compile a register of depositors in any way, the financial institution cannot return the money. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  One of the largest Russian banks came under reorganization of the Central Bank.  As a result of the investigation, it was revealed that the financial institution withdrew 60 billion rubles from the balance sheet.  This amount, through the accounts of OJSC RFK, was transferred to the balance of doubtful enterprises.  Now DIA is trying to compile a correct register of depositors, and customers are trying to collect money from the bank. </p>
