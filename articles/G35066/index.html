  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alfa-Bank Cashback Card: Owner Reviews, Features and Conditions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, many people are actively using cashback cards.  It is profitable to receive a certain amount from a perfect purchase back to the account in the form of bonuses or real money. </p><p>  There are many offers to date, but one of the most popular is the Alfa Bank Cashback card.  The reviews of its owners help make sure that the product is really profitable.  However, since the topic is relevant, it is worth considering it in more detail. </p><h2>  Debit card </h2><p>  It‚Äôs necessary to clarify right away: Alfa-Bank offers two cards at once, called Cash Back.  One is debit and the other is credit.  First you need to talk about the first option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.currencyhistory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cashback from the card" class="if uuid-2829157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2829157.jpg"></div><p>  Here are some refunds with a debit card: </p><ul><li>  10% to the account from gas stations at the gas station. </li><li>  5% of orders in catering. </li><li>  1% of other purchases. </li><li>  Accrual of up to 6% on the savings account. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to the cashback calculator, you can immediately figure out how much you can save in total.  Suppose a person has monthly expenses like this: </p><ul><li>  Fuel for the car: 15 000 rub. </li><li>  Restaurants and cafes: 20 000 rub. </li><li>  Other expenses: 20 000 rub. </li></ul><p>  Total per month is 55,000 rubles.  With this amount, cashback will be approximately 2700 p.  It turns out 32,400 rubles a year! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, when registering a cash back debit card at Alfa Bank, you can choose the most favorable rate.  There are three of them: </p><ul><li>  "Optimum."  Refunds up to 24,000 rubles / year. </li><li>  "Comfort".  Refunds up to 36,000 rubles / year. </li><li>  "Maximum +".  Refunds up to 60,000 rubles / year. </li></ul><p>  Each tariff has its own characteristics.  Of course, ‚ÄúMaximum +‚Äù opens up the most opportunities. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  Now you can consider the reviews left on the Alfa-Bank Cashback card.  Here are the main advantages that people who use it note the attention: </p><ul><li>  The card is contactless, so it‚Äôs convenient to pay with your phone.  You can even leave it at home - the main thing is that the application is connected to the gadget. </li><li>  You can apply for a card in two accounts.  Very convenient: you just need to leave a request on the site and wait for a call from the manager who will tell you all about the conditions and features.  The next day, a courier with a card will arrive. </li><li>  All completed operations can be monitored through the convenient Alfa-Bank application.  It also provides the ability to open / close deposits, transfer funds between accounts, etc. </li><li>  You can really save on fuel.  This is especially true now when gas prices have risen to extremely high levels. </li><li>  There are no additional insurances and hidden fees. </li><li>  Cashback comes as a single payment in the second half of next month.  The return is immediately felt - no need to calculate the penny how much you managed to save in the end. </li><li>  Cashback comes not with bonuses, but with real "live" money.  They can be spent on anything or withdrawn from an ATM. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="lukojl-licard.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank cashback card reviews" class="if uuid-2829007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2829007.jpg"></div><p>  And of course, in all the reviews left on the Alfa-Bank Cashback card, people note the fact that this is perhaps one of the most profitable financial products to date.  The funds are actually being returned.  And the percentage is an order of magnitude higher than that of other banks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Important Features </h2><p>  Many Alfa-Bank debit card holders with a cashback in their reviews specify that this financial product is not suitable for everyone. </p><p>  The main condition: a person must spend money.  For shopping, <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> gasoline.  And at least 20-30 thousand rubles per month (the exact amount depends on the selected tariff).  Only in this case will he be credited with cashback next month.  If he spends not 19,000 rubles, but 19,999, there is no need to wait for a return. </p><p>  Someone may consider that it is unprofitable.  But on average, after all, monthly expenses are obtained in such a way.  And if a person regularly spends on a particular cashback category, then the card will bring him special benefits. </p><p>  Moreover, many customers exceed the upper limit bar for refunds.  Every month, a cashback of 2 to 5 thousand rubles can be charged on the card, depending on the chosen tariff.  But if a person spent, say, 100,000 rubles, then he will still be paid only the maximum amount, without additional interest. </p><h2>  Design Nuances </h2><p>  The issuance of such a card is free, but for annual service will have to pay 1990 p.  In the reviews of the Alfa-Bank Cashback card, many people advise you to do this: arrange it before any event, event or long trip. </p><p>  Why?  Because it will be able to immediately recoup.  Let‚Äôs say an anniversary is coming, which a person will celebrate in a restaurant.  What do you need?  Draw a card shortly before the event to pay for dinner.  Next month, such a cashback will be credited for this, which will instantly pay for its release. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Alfa-Bank salary card holders were most fortunate.  They do not need to pay for the service.  You just need to contact the employer in order to receive interest from paying checks in catering and gas stations.  According to reviews, Alfa-Bank Cashback cards for officially working people are fairly easy to get. </p><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  As already mentioned at the very beginning, this bank has two Cash Back cards.  Now we will focus on credit.  The list of its advantages and features is impressive: </p><ul><li>  10% for gas stations. </li><li>  5% for catering orders. </li><li>  1% for other purchases. </li><li>  The credit limit is 300,000 rubles. </li><li>  The rate is 25.99% per annum. </li><li>  60-day interest-free period. </li><li>  15 percent discounts from partners of the bank. </li><li>  The ability to make funds transfers free of charge in order to close loans from third-party banks. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="fortune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="debit card alfa bank cash back" class="if uuid-2829033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2829033.jpg"></div><p>  The conditions for receiving a refund are the same - you need to spend at least 20,000 rubles at retail outlets.  The maximum monthly return is 3000 rubles. </p><p>  Issuing such a card is free.  Main card maintenance will cost 3990 rubles per year.  There is also a limit on cash withdrawals - 120,000 rubles / month.  A commission of 4.9% is charged for this (a minimum of 400 rubles). </p><h2>  What do you need to get a credit card? </h2><p>  What else do consumers say in their reviews of Alfa-Bank Cashback cards?  10 percent return on fuel spent is quite real!  You can apply for a credit card without leaving your home.  The maximum waiting time for a response from the bank is 1-2 days.  Then you need to come to the office at the appointed time with the documents to conclude the contract and receive a card.  Here are the requirements for a client who wants to become its owner: </p><ul><li>  Application form. </li><li>  Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Additional document.  Some of the following will do: SNILS, a foreign passport, driver‚Äôs license, TIN or OMS policy. </li></ul><p>  To obtain a lower interest rate and a high credit limit, you must provide a copy of one of the following documents: </p><ul><li>  Front side of the VHI policy. </li><li>  Vehicle Registration Certificate. </li><li>  Travel passport with travel information for the last year. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.insider.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank cashback card 10 reviews" class="if uuid-2829017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2829017.jpg"></div><p>  To obtain the most favorable conditions, you will need a certificate in the form of 2-personal income tax for three months of work. </p><h2>  Credit Card Reviews </h2><p>  The people who own it note that this is a very interesting and convenient product.  With the help of such a credit card, you can make full use of the entire range of services offered.  Here are some of its advantages, noted by most Alfa-Bank customers: </p><ul><li>  The interest-free period is as much as 60 days - 2 months.  You can use borrowed funds during this time for free.  And the monthly <span>mandatory payment</span> is only 5%.  And the number of grace periods is not limited. </li><li>  To formalize it, it is enough to have a monthly income of only 5,000 rubles (for Muscovites - 9,000). </li><li>  If you repay the debt on time and still often use the card, the bank will increase the credit limit. </li><li>  Customers are offered free mobile banking. </li><li>  A welcome bonus is accrued, the size of which depends on the type of card. </li></ul><p>  In general, reviews on the Alfa-Bank card with a cashback of 10% at gas stations are also positive.  It‚Äôs nice to have a financial ‚Äúairbag‚Äù in your pocket, using which at the right time you can get a bonus in the form of a refund. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pymnts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank credit card cashback reviews" class="if uuid-2829019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2829019.jpg"></div><h2>  Earnings on the map - profitable and real! </h2><p>  A little attention should be paid to this topic.  In many reviews of Alfa-Bank Cashback credit cards, people write that it can be used to earn money.  How?  It is very simple, although you will still need to get used to the scheme discussed below. </p><p>  To get an extra penny, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Credit card with cashback. </li><li>  Debit card. </li><li>  Savings / income account.  Or a map, which is even more convenient. </li></ul><p>  What do we have to do?  As soon as a person receives a salary, it must be transferred to a revenue card.  Money will "work" there - bring interest.  What to live next month?  With cash from your credit card!  The interest-free period is 60 days, and it will be possible to repay it from the next salary without overpaying anything. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.revistachacra.com.ar" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overview of alpha bank cards with cashback" class="if uuid-2829035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2829035.jpg"></div><p>  The balance, if any, can be transferred to the savings account to the amount already there.  And again pay with a credit card.  The main thing is to pay off the debt as a whole.  No expenses, only benefits: cashback with credit cards and interest from the income account. </p><h2>  For travelers </h2><p>  It should be noted that Alfa-Bank has many offers that are beneficial for people who often travel. </p><p>  In total, 16 different cards are issued that help to save on travel.  The most profitable is Alfa-Bank Aeroflot.  If you pay with it, then you can accumulate a lot of bonuses.  For every 60 rubles spent, 2 miles are awarded. </p><p>  And those who like to ride trains will like the RZD Bonus card.  Paying it, you can get 1.75 points for every 30 rubles. </p><p>  And of course, in addition to miles and bonuses, each of the 16 cards has its own interesting features and advantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ngzt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank cashback debit card reviews" class="if uuid-2829012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2829012.jpg"></div><h2>  What other suggestions are there? </h2><p>  Finally, it‚Äôs worthwhile to review Alfa-Bank cards with a cashback.  In addition to the two proposals listed, there are many others.  These cards can be issued at the bank: </p><ul><li>  Pyaterochka.  Conditions: 2500 welcome bonuses, the same amount on your birthday, 2 points for every 10 rubles spent in Pyaterochka, and 1 for purchases in other stores. </li><li>  "Crossroads."
