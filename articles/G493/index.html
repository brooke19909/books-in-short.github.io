Sights of a colorful city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mukachevo, the sights of which simply amaze with its large number, is the real gem of the Transcarpathian region.  The city is located in the central part of this area, among the mountains covered with dense forests, in an area protected by nature and fabulous creatures.  This is a cozy and quiet European settlement.  His fame goes far beyond Ukraine, and therefore Mukachevo has become the object of visiting tourists from all over the world.  And this is not surprising, because neither more nor less than one hundred thousand inhabitants live in the village, and there are as many architectural monuments as you will not find in a huge metropolis. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mukachevo map with landmarks" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/526312.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Business card </h2><p>  It is considered Palanok castle.  One of the local legends says that the name of the city is connected with this attraction.  Palanok has an extraordinary location and is a romantic and mysterious castle of the Middle Ages, which has miraculously survived to this day.  A map of Mukachevo with attractions will indicate exactly the place where you can find the magnificent Palanok. </p><p>  The first mention of the castle dates back to the XI century.  Palanok rises above the city, it was erected on a 70-meter cliff in the middle of a plain.  A riddle is the fact of the occurrence of such a high mountain on an absolutely flat territory.  From here come all the legends that shrouded the castle.  So, the elders of Mukachevo say that there once lived a cruel prince who planned to build an incredibly fortified castle.  He intended to create a building that defies no siege.  To do this, the ruler ordered all residents to pour rock.  For days on end the tormented people carried out the order of their overlord.  And their flour became the basis for the name of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Less sad facts </h2>

Once the mountain where it is located was a volcano, and on it there were Slavic fortifications made of wood.  Later, by order of the Ugric king Laszlo I, a stone castle was built in their place, which over the centuries underwent many rebuildings and buildings.  As a result of all these manipulations, Palanok turned into one of the stunning masterpieces of fortification architecture.  The fate of this facility was also complex.  Not once did he find himself at the epicenter of various sieges, but he always came out with honor from such battles.  And today it pleases tourists with its ancient impregnability and mighty greatness. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mukachevo sights" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/526180.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other amazing places </h2><p>  The city of Mukachevo, whose sights can be listed all day, is known for its Catholic church of St. Martin.  St. Martin is considered the patron saint of the city, therefore, in his honor at the beginning of the 20th century, a Catholic church was built on the site of an ancient Gothic church.  From the old building there is only a chapel in the Gothic style with tombstones and murals of the medieval era. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The decoration and one of the main attractions of Mukachevo today is the city hall.  The beginning of its construction dates back to 1903.  Then in the summer construction work began on this subject.  The architect of the town hall was J. Babule.  It was he who decided to install a huge clock on the building with bells and battle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mukachevo city attractions" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/526190.jpg" width="600"></div>
