It's about Zatoka.  There are excellent beaches, a delightful sea, an abundance of fruits and vegetables, and most importantly, friendly and hospitable locals.  A lot of tourist centers also try to make the guests only on the good side remember their vacation in Zatoka.  The Mountain Eagle is one of the most convenient and most economical bases in many respects.  The staff here is caring and attentive, there is housing for every taste, from wooden houses to Eurostandard rooms, the food is excellent, and the prices are ridiculous.  But first things first. </p><h2>  A few words about the resort </h2><p>  First, we‚Äôll talk about the place where the recreation center ‚ÄúMountain Eagle‚Äù is located.  Zatoka is a small village for 2 thousand inhabitants.  It is 60-65 km from Odessa (depending on which highway to go) and about 1.5 hours away, and from Belgorod-Dniester it is only 15 km that can be overcome in 20 minutes by car.  The village grew up on a narrow (maximum 900 m) and long (22 km) sandy spit called Budak (some call Bugaz, by the name of the railway station) and cut deep into the water surface.  On the one hand there is the Black Sea, on the other - the Dniester estuary, which adds its own zest to the rest.  It‚Äôs hard to get bored in Zatoka, because there are an incredible amount of bars, discos, cafes, night clubs for such a small village, there are cinemas, Internet clubs, billiards, post office.  On the seashore and estuary, a variety of activities are organized, from riding a "banana" to fishing on a boat.  For shopping in the village there are a lot of shops, two markets, and Odessa is nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The situation with public transport </h2><p>  The village is geographically divided into districts.  In Limanskiy the recreation center "Mountain Eagle" is located.  Zatoka has a wonderful transport development.  Along the spit there is a T16-04 highway connecting Odessa and Belgorod-Dniester, and a railway branch from Odessa to Izmail.  At Bugaz station (the center of the village) passenger trains number 902 and 288 stop. They follow from Kiev to Izmail.  There is also a train number 686, going from Odessa to Berezino.  At the station Limanskaya all electric trains make a stop.  But it‚Äôs more convenient to travel around the neighborhood by shuttle bus.  There are flights in the village: </p><ul><li>  No. 560 to Odessa or Belgorod-Dniester; </li><li>  No. 544 to Belgorod-Dniester through the village; </li><li>  No. 6 and No. 13 in different ways to Belgorod-Dniester;  minibuses from Odessa depart from the station and from Privoz. </li></ul><h2>  Description of the territory of the base </h2><p>  Pension "Mountain Eagle" (Zatoka) is located in the heart of the Liman district of the village.  Near the main avenue with shops, cafes and bars.  Five minutes to the market.  Also nearby is a train / bus station.  The territory of the base is quite spacious, with wide asphalt and concrete paths.  Along the perimeter, it is fenced with a low fence.  All buildings of the base are surrounded by greenery giving a dense shadow of trees.  Fresh grass is pleasantly pleasing to the eye on the lawns, and flower beds amaze with an abundance of flowers.  To relax from the summer heat in the shady alleys, wooden benches are installed.  Everywhere is clean and tidy.  Without exaggeration, it can be argued that one of the most well-groomed bases of the resort is the Mountain Eagle (Zatoka).  Photos taken by tourists are proof of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Description of "Junior Suite" </h2><p>  At the recreation center "Mountain Eagle" (Zatoka), this category is assigned to block type numbers.  That is, the hygiene room in them has one for two neighboring rooms.  Each of them has standard furniture sets (single and double beds, wardrobe, table, bedside tables, chairs).  Electrical appliances are provided with a TV (no cable or satellite TV), a small refrigerator and air conditioning.  Each room has a balcony.  The hygiene room has a toilet, washbasin and shower (without cabin). </p><h2>  Description of houses </h2><p>  Summer houses are the most economical accommodation option that the Mountain Eagle recreation center can offer its guests.  Reviews about this type of housing, to put it mildly, are not very.  But, probably, for the money that costs living in houses, it is hardly possible to relax better somewhere.  So, in the rooms there is nothing but furniture (beds, wardrobes) and a small refrigerator.  The windows in some houses do not close well.  Conveniences presented in the form of a summer shower, washbasin and toilet are located on the street.  True, hot water is also served in the shower.  These houses were built a long time ago, repairs were carried out in them for a long time, hence the complaints of tourists.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach such number is small.  Beautiful design as such is not provided.  The purpose of this type of housing is to give the tourist a place where you can sleep and relax after an active day at sea. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The recreation center "Mountain Eagle" (Zatoka) does not have a swimming pool and spa in its infrastructure.  There is also no animation here, neither for children nor for adults.  For entertainment, sports grounds are equipped on the territory, tables for playing table tennis and billiards are installed.  You can celebrate the celebration or just relax, listen to barbecue music in a small cafe located here on the territory.  Anyone who does not like the hustle and bustle has the opportunity to relax in one of the gazebos or on a bench with a book, tablet or computer.  Wireless Internet-based "catches", however, not everywhere.  Toddlers can spend time in the playground.  There are ladders, horizontal bars, a couple of swings.  For children and adults, a stone's throw from the base there is an amusement park. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Beach holidays - this is the main reason why people go to the mountain eagle boarding house (Zatoka).  Photos of tourists demonstrate how spacious and clean here.  The sea is located from the base 200-250 meters.  The beach in the Liman region of Zatoka is sandy with a slight admixture of shells.  It is spacious, wide and relatively clean.  Sunset at sea is very suitable for kids, as it is gentle.  Depth does not begin immediately.  Of the entertainment on the beach there is a cafe, a disco, organized to ride on an inflatable banana, and in Limanskoe you can rent a catamaran, jet ski. </p><p>  Anyone traveling to the Mountain Eagle (Zatoka) base and generally to the spit should take into account that the sea in this area can be cold even in July (water temperature is up to +22 degrees or slightly lower).  Of course, this is not for the whole month, but only for a couple of weeks due to underwater currents.  The climate of Zatoka is mild.  Precipitation throughout the year falls with approximately the same intensity.  The average air temperature in the middle of summer rarely rises above +30 Àö. </p>

The following are distinguished among its advantages: </p><ul><li>  wonderful territory, everything is beautiful, lots of greenery and corners for relaxation; </li><li>  wonderful rooms where everything works, good furniture, clean and comfortable (such reviews are only about ‚Äúsuites‚Äù in the new building and a couple about ‚Äúsuites‚Äù in three-story buildings); </li><li>  Responsive, efficient, friendly and helpful staff; </li><li>  wonderful food in the dining room, a wide variety of dishes, lots of fruits and vegetables daily; </li><li>  convenient location of the base (everything is nearby: both the sea and entertainment); </li><li>  there is where to play for children and sports for adults. </li></ul><p>  After reading these reviews, you begin to imagine the Mountain Eagle base as a paradise oasis among the sands of the Budak Spit.  Especially many kind words are addressed personally to the director.  His hospitality is so great that he can move from a ‚Äústandard‚Äù to a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù at no extra charge, feed a whole family of 6 people for free, and even give money for the trip home (this is mentioned in the recall of one couple who stole the money).  In general, "Mountain Eagle" is a real fairy tale. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Mountain Eagle" (Zatoka).  Reviews are unkind </h2><p>  But on the other hand, many people recall the rest in this institution as a waste of time.  Reading their reviews, you begin to think that there are two Mountain Eagle boarding houses in Zatoka, where two completely different directors work.  The second hospitality of their vacationers does not pamper and not only does not move them to the best room, but also booked and already paid does not give due to lack of places.  And to solve an unpleasant issue for days pickles people in line under his office.  In addition to these complaints, the comments on the database are as follows: </p><ul><li>  they do not clean the rooms at all, regardless of the number of days of stay, but for independent cleaning a broom, a mop, a bucket have to be required; </li><li>  beds, towels do not change, also regardless of the number of days spent at the base; </li><li>  rooms in the most uncomfortable state, cramped, dirty, with non-closing windows and old furniture (such reviews are only about houses); </li><li>  there are no showers in the toilet rooms, only a hole in the floor (about deluxe and junior suites in three-story buildings); </li><li>  no toiletries are issued even on the day of arrival and even in new ‚Äúsuites‚Äù; </li><li>  there is no parking as such, people park where they want; </li><li>  monotonous menu in the dining room; </li><li>  scanty portions of salads and fruits; </li><li>  poor Wi-Fi (works at individual points in the base that you need to look for); </li><li>  very poor playground for children; </li><li>  too loud music in the cafe (reviews of those who lived in the rooms next door to this establishment); </li><li>  there is no reception, all controversial issues need to contact the director. </li></ul><p>  The general in good and not so reviews is as follows: </p><ul><li>  proximity to the sea; </li><li>  beautiful green area; </li><li>  quick staff in the dining room (student interns); </li><li>  low prices for food and accommodation. </li></ul><p>  Conclusion: if you go to the ‚ÄúMountain Eagle‚Äù for the sake of the sea and do not expect from the service base at the level of foreign resorts, you can relax here well. </p>
