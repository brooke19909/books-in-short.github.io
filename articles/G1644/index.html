    <p>  The fact that Corfu is an amazing island and the Ionian Sea is wonderful is evidenced by almost everyone who comes here to relax.  There are, of course, very expensive hotels here, but there are a number of budget hotels.  However, not all three-star hotels tourists respond as well as Potamaki Beach 3 *. </p><p>  Many guests liked the food at the hotel (especially fish dishes).  Also, some tourists note excellent cozy and comfortable rooms.  Someone who was most impressed was the location of the hotel and the local beach.  However, the hotel has a number of minor minuses.  So, according to some tourists, there is not very good sound insulation, as well as cramped showers. </p><p>  Nevertheless, almost all tourists who have been here express a desire to return to Potamaki Beach 3 * again. </p>
