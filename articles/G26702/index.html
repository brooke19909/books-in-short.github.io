The simplest and most beautiful crafts!  Previously, their beauty was due to the original drawings, but now the craftswomen have learned to create whole masterpieces.  Let us consider in more detail how to make several types of boxes from postcards, and begin from simple to complex. </p><h2>  Rectangular simple box </h2><p>  For work, we need: </p><ul><li>  any cards of the same size; </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  threads (contrasting or color cards); </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Now pay attention to one more moment.  If the box will be just for beauty, then its walls can be made of two cards.  If you want to store jewelry, small things in it, then make the walls thicker and take stronger threads. </p><p>  Two long walls, the bottom and the lid of the box will be rectangular in shape and correspond to the size of the postcard.  The two short sides should correspond to the width of the rectangle.  These are standard postcard casket parts. </p><p>  Once you have prepared all the material - 8 solid and 4 cropped postcards, then connect them with the wrong side to each other so that the picture is on each side.  And you process each edge with a ‚Äúfence‚Äù - a loop seam (nnn).  Then for these floors all the details will be connected.  Remember that the rows should be even, and for this stitches do the same size.  To help you can draw a barely noticeable line with a pencil. </p><p>  As soon as all the details have been processed, now attach adjacent elements to each other and sweep away the ‚Äúcrossbeams‚Äù of the seam.  The product is ready! </p><h2>  <span>How to make a</span> jewelry <span>box</span> for jewelry </h2><p>  For this craft you need to take: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  postcards; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  crochet threads ("Iris", cotton); </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  the cloth; </li><li>  the needle. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="postcard boxes" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/362337.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  We sew four whole postcards with a <span>looped seam</span> around the edges.  Next, make one square and four triangles, the side of which is equal to the length of the rectangle.  Sheathe all the details and attach the triangles to the square, forming a cover. </p><p>  Now cut out of cardboard 5 squares to fit the box.  Tighten with a cloth.  Sew rectangular postcards to the sides of the box, which become convex.  Wide petals form at the corners of the box.  Make a pattern, overlay these details and sew to the product.  The last step is fixing the lid. </p><p>  Please note: the sides of the box can be made square, then a miniature box of cards is obtained.  The pattern corresponds to the width of the rectangle.  If the marginal petals bend slightly inward, then the appearance will be different.  When stitching parts, you can take beads for beauty. </p><h2>  Figured box for beginners </h2><p>  Let's try to complicate the task and make the product on legs, but with a simple scheme for beginners.  For work you need postcards, pencil, scissors, a needle and thread.  We do each side individually, two of them will be rectangular and two will be square.  In this case, the internal cards need to be trimmed a little so that the external ‚Äúwall‚Äù forms a bulge when stapling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts boxes from cards" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/362338.jpg?1396097636151" width="353"></div>

You get four convex walls that you sew together with a bottom consisting of two postcards.  Do the legs as follows: draw a rectangle with the side of the square of the desired height and then draw triangles from both ends.  Define the middle and draw a semicircle to cut off. </p><p>  Sew over the legs and sew with the box.  Next, cut the top at the same height at the triangles.  Sew all the triangles with the bottom of the lid.  Next, at the base of the top, cut a square and connect it to the entire part. </p><p>  To make the petals of the correct shape, cut out the template from paper by measuring the distance of the box wall.  Next, connect the petals to each other and to the sides of the casket.  Sew the cover on one side with the last step. </p><h2>  Decorative box from cards.  DIY schemes </h2><p>  Patterns are easier to make if there is an image of a finished box.  Just mentally divide it into details and draw them on a sheet.  We show on the example of a box in the form of a wine glass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="box of cards" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/361320.jpg?1395936323500" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The shape of the square box is considered in the previous example.  We proceed immediately to the drawing of the cover: </p><ul><li>  draw the right size square corresponding to the side of the box; </li><li>  in its shape, draw any up - a triangular, oval and other shape. </li></ul><p>  When forming the lid, the parts close and form a dome. </p><p>  Next, form the legs, the height of which will correspond to the length of the card, and the width is equal to the side of the box.  Now, just cut the card along the length, making concave edges, and cut the bottom of the legs in the middle with a half-shaft.  For stability of the casket draw a square on which on each side measure the semicircles.  Now you can connect the legs to the bottom and to the casket. </p><h2>  And finally ... </h2><p>  You can build any form of crafts: boxes from postcards in the form of a temple, a steam locomotive, a train, a bus, a sofa, an armchair, a tower, a bottle, a clock, a boat, a samovar.  To do this, you need to make the scheme correctly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a box of cards" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/361322.jpg?1395936380980" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Make an external image of the box and divide it into geometric details.  On a sheet in a cage it will be convenient to see the shape of the product.  In this case, complex crafts will have the main bearing parts and decorative.  Learn from simple album sheets with glue or scotch tape, and then play everything on postcards and threads. </p>
