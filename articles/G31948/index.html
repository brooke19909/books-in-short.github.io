He started playing poker as a teenager.  Known by the nickname durrrr, therefore he is constantly called Tom durrrr Dwan.  During his career, he won about three million dollars.  And given the online game, the amount reaches $ 10 million.  He constantly travels to different countries, playing poker in a casino, and spends time with his lover. </p><p>  Consider the biography of Tom Dwan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pokerdiscover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tom Dwan Biography" class="if uuid-2966136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107981/2966136.jpg"></div><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  The guy was born on July 30, 1986 in the town of Edison, New Jersey.  Tom lived in the most ordinary middle-class family, which constantly tried to accustom the boy to hard work.  The boy studied at a local high school.  Constantly participated in extracurricular activities.  My favorite high school hobby was football. </p><h2>  early life </h2><p>  Outside of school, the boy was fond of playing various card games.  He constantly spent time with his friends playing poker.  At the age of 17, parents gave their son $ 50 as a gift for his birthday.  Tom‚Äôs friends recommended that the guy invest all the money in a poker site to make money, because they considered Tom a talented poker player. </p><p>  At first, Tom did not want to illegally play poker online.  However, the pressure of loved ones played a role.  As the username, Tom chose the alias durrrr.  At first, the guy played in small amounts, but then decided to try playing cash games, thanks to which he began to make significant profits.  Just a few months later, the guy had on his account about 15,000 dollars.  At this point, Tom decided not to stop and continued to play.  By the end of school, the guy was able to pay for his college studies.  Tom enrolled at Boston University.  However, he studied at the university for only a year.  In his spare time, the guy played poker with his neighbors.  By the beginning of next year, Tom realized that his life was connected exclusively with the game, and not with study.  So he decided to start his professional career as a poker player, leaving the university. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pokercentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poker player" class="if uuid-2966134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107981/2966134.jpg"></div><h2>  Professional career </h2><p>  Until the age of 21, the guy played exclusively in online poker.  The first significant tournament was in London in 2005.  The prize pool of the tournament was 3 million pounds.  He managed to earn a little over $ 12,000. </p><p>  After the tournament in London, Tom began playing in other online tournaments.  For example, he signed up for Poker Stars, Full Tilt Poker.  Literally in one night, he could both lose and win several hundred thousand dollars.  On these sites, Tom had the opportunity to compete with famous pros such as Phil Ivey, Chris Ferguson or Mike Matusov. </p><p>  In the same year, the guy was lucky to participate in live tournaments in the United States.  At the World Poker Championship, Tom took fourth place, which brought about 350 thousand in prize money.  The following year, at a tournament in Atlantic City, he took second place and won 250 thousand dollars. </p><p>  Additionally, Tom has constantly participated in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. </p><p>  In 2009, Full Tilt Poker turned to Tom, who was one of the most successful poker sites.  They wanted him to join their team of professionals who paid to play on the site and wear Full Tilt Poker uniforms at all tournaments.  Dwan was glad to join the team, because before that he was a simple and inconspicuous player. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  FullTiltPoker Team Fraud </h2><p>  On April 15, 2011, the Department of Justice took over the Full Tilt Poker domain name for breaking the rules.  Players from across the United States fled to their accounts and tried to withdraw money.  Most players were unable to do this because Full Tilt Poker owners stole game funds to host parties and raise the salaries of their professional poker team.  A thorough investigation revealed that the players' funds were not enough for $ 350,000. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.highstakesdb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tom Dwan is a professional poker player" class="if uuid-2966138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107981/2966138.jpg"></div><p>  Dwan was devastated by the news and immediately stopped wearing his Full Tilt Poker uniform.  In an interview, the guy explained his feelings to unscrupulous owners of the resource, speaking about them in an open form. </p><h2>  Current affairs </h2><p>  Recently, Dwan began spending a lot of free time in Macau, Hong Kong and in various cities of China.  He enjoys the unique atmosphere of Chinese casinos and believes that tournaments have more opportunities to win large sums of money than tournaments in the United States.  In 2017, he took 2nd place in the Super High Roller No Limit Hold'em tournament, Super High Roller in Macau, winning $ 252,000. </p><p>  Currently, Tom Dwan does not plan to constantly move to China, but this is what he is considering in the near future.  He has already studied the process of obtaining dual citizenship in both China and the United States.  He also began to shop around buying a house in the Macau area. </p><p>  Tom is very grateful to his friends and family who have supported him throughout his career, and he loves to give them expensive gifts. Also, Tom Dwan donated funds to several well-known charitable organizations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tom durrrr dwan" class="if uuid-2966137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107981/2966137.jpg"></div><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  In early 2018, Dwan was spotted in Australia with a girl.  A little later, the media began to appear information about the beloved poker player.  Bianca Rosso is the chosen one of Tom Dwan. </p>
