    <p>  He has many of the most controversial opinions about himself, AK Bars (bank).  Deposits (reviews indicate frequent failures in the online system, because of which you have to go to the office and make financial transactions there) in this bank are profitable, but, as clients indicate, it takes a lot of time to process them.  More positive reviews indicate quick service and qualified staff, good credit conditions, the bank fulfilling all obligations to customers. </p><p>  Negative reviews indicate poor service, cramped office space, frequent technical failures, due to which you have to go to the bank several times.  These people say that often a bank refuses a loan for reasons that it does not voice.  Imposes insurance even where it is not needed, and without it refuses to draw up a deal.  Sometimes, at the last moment, the bank changes the loan rate without notifying the client, and people have to wait a few more days to get loan approval again.  Making a mortgage takes about a month, unlike other banks, where the implementation of such a transaction takes a couple of weeks. </p><p>  It cannot be said that there are much more negative opinions about the work of this bank than positive ones, but all of them affect its reputation and demand for banking products. </p>
