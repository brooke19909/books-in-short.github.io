A photo of this natural attraction will be enough to understand why UNESCO in 1994 included the bay in the list of world heritage of mankind.  And all the tour operators sending their customers to Southeast Asia, refrain: ‚ÄúIf you did not admire Halong, you did not see Vietnam!‚Äù  Well, follow the recommendations of travel agents.  In this article we will tell you when it is best to visit Halong, how to get there from the popular <span>resorts in Vietnam,</span> where to settle and what else to see in the vicinity.  The origin of the bay is connected with the beautiful legend of the dragon.  The monster lived in the mountains for a long time, until suddenly it became furious.  All crashing in its path, the dragon plunged into the sea.  Now only its teeth-islands stick out from the surface of the water.  And the name "Halong" is translated as "The place where the dragon sank into the sea." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam Halong" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285170.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the bay </h2><p>  The main natural <span>attraction of Vietnam</span> is located in the north-east of the country.  The city of the same name belongs to the province of Nuangnin.  And Halong Bay (Vietnam) is part of the <span>Gulf of Tonkin</span> (locals call it Bakbo) of the South China Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Pacific Basin.  What is this lagoon so famous for?  Its area is one and a half thousand square kilometers.  And over the whole bay in a chaotic order, more than one thousand six hundred islets and simply rocks are scattered.  Some have such a bizarre shape that when you look at them it seems like you are Alice, who has fallen into the country of fairy tales.  If you swim to the islands on a boat, you will see numerous grottoes and caves - with stalactites and stalagmites.  There are also deserted beaches, jungle and other beauty.  In a word, paradise.  And it is recommended to visit here for everyone who came to this country of Southeast Asia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halong vietnam get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285171.jpg" width="600"></div>

And the residents of the city of the same name profit from this, which, with the exception of the bay, is nothing interesting in terms of tourism.  But still do not forget that this region is North Vietnam.  Halong in winter is often wrapped in fog and watered with drizzling rain.  This off-season lasts from February to early April.  And although the sea does not storm, visibility is rather poor.  Yes, and windy, damp and slightly cold weather does not have to admire the beauty.  And the rest of the year, the bay appears to the gaze of amazed travelers from around the world in all its irresistible charm.  If you want to combine the contemplation of natural beauties with swimming, of course, it is good to choose the hot summer months.  But then there is a high probability of rain.  The high season in these parts are the periods April-May and September-October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam Halong Bay how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285173.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vietnam, Halong Bay: how to get there </h2><p>  Only a hundred and seventy kilometers away from the capital of the country.  Therefore, you can easily go here for a day.  Intercity buses run from Hanoi to Halong City.  They depart from Mai Dinh.  There is an opportunity to leave by train, both regular and express trains.  Another interesting option is to buy a one-day excursion to Halong Bay.  You will be quickly delivered to your place in comfortable minivans and taken on a tourist boat to the large island of Katba.  The tour lasts more than six hours and includes a visit to the iconic sights of the bay.  Independent tourists themselves need to reserve a place in the boat.  A ticket will cost one hundred thirty thousand dong.  Entrance to the national park is included in this price.  A taxi from Hanoi will cost you fifty dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halong vietnam photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285172.jpg" width="600"></div>

Getting to him from Hanoi is not very difficult.  Indeed, modern modes of transport will help to overcome the distance of one hundred and seventy kilometers in a couple of hours.  But is it possible to visit the bay in one day, coming from other resorts in Vietnam?  If you are resting in the north of the country, in Haiphong or Sap, then getting to the city of Halong is also not difficult.  You may not even need to go to Hanoi for this.  But is it possible to visit the bay from the more southern resorts of the country?  From the <span>island of Fukuok</span> or the city of Ho Chi Minh City this is unlikely to succeed.  At least one day.  Is Halong Bay (Vietnam) accessible from Nha Trang for tourists?  The local bureaus undertake to organize excursions to the fabulous bay for 450 US dollars per person.  But often they return the money, because not enough people have gathered for the formation of the group.  For a hundred dollars, you can go to Halong on your own.  But for this, you first need to get to Hanoi.  This is easy to do on board a Vietnam Airlines, JetStar or VietJet aircraft.  And from there you can easily reach the coveted bay by train or bus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halong bay vietnam from nha trang" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285174.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Halong (Vietnam) Hotels </h2><p>  This town is called the Gateway to Paradise.  Doors are like doors.  For those who rush to paradise, the gates to it are uninteresting.  And all the guidebooks bypass the sights of the city of Halong with deadly silence.  So what can you see in this village, built on an artificial dam that connected the two capes?  Only Halong Bay!  The sandy beaches of the city are bulk, they are not of interest to divers.  The city is regarded by most travelers as a place to spend the night after admiring the evening bay.  Therefore, in Halong there is no shortage of hotels.  You can stay in budget hotels away from the sea or in chic "fives" on the first line.  Among the most worthy are Winpearl Ha Long Resort.  If you want to extend your vacation in a fabulous bay, you can book a hotel on one of the large islands of the bay - Katba or Tuan Chau are at your service.  An unforgettable night will be on board a chic liner (for example, ‚ÄúRoyal Cruise Signatures‚Äù) or a traditional junka (‚ÄúImperial Classic‚Äù), which is moored in a picturesque place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halong Hotels Vietnam" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285186.jpg" width="561"></div>

    <h2>  Types of excursions.  Flight over the bay </h2><p>  For travelers arriving in Vietnam, Halong is the ‚ÄúMast Si No. 1‚Äù.  Therefore, the travel agency offers a variety of excursions to this bay.  Those who are not sorry to part with 175 dollars can see Halong Bay from a bird's eye view.  In order for the helicopter tour to take place, it is enough to recruit six people.  You can book this trip at Northern Airport Flight Service Company.  Departures take place every Saturday at eight in the morning from Hanoi Gia Lam.  If you are a guest at Sofitel Metropol Hotel, you will be delivered to the <span>helipad</span> for free.  From a height you will see all the islands of Halong Bay and take breathtaking photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halong vietnam" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other excursions </h2><p>  You do not need a boat to get to the nearby islet of Tuan Chau.  After all, a bridge with a length of one kilometer connects it to the mainland.  On the island there is a dolphinarium and several hotels - both expensive and simple guesthouses.  A regular tour involves a two-hour cruise on the bay on a simple boat with a landing on one of the beaches of Katba.  Halong may interest Russian tourists arriving in Vietnam on the island of Titova.  The famous Soviet cosmonaut visited here in the 70s, and now one of the rocks bears his name.  The islands of the bay abound in caves and grottoes, where you can penetrate directly by boat.  Katba is famous for its pristine jungle and mangroves along the shores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halong aerial view" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1285175.jpg" width="600"></div>
