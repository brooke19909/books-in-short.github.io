Among them there are those who began their history in the 30-40s of the last century.  These are entire concerns, which in addition to production have many subsidiaries.  But there are such companies that appeared at the end of the last century, and now have become leaders in their field.  One of these was the Asus company, the manufacturing country of which is Taiwan. </p><h2>  Start </h2><p>  Of course, the company does not have such a huge history as its colleagues: HP, Aser, Sony and Lenovo.  Nevertheless, I was able to go a long way in order to present myself in the world market with the help of high-quality and reliable goods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus country manufacturer" class="if" height="138" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1575731.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For the first time, the company became known in 1989.  Then Asus (Taiwan) was founded by four enthusiasts who fled with another eminent Aser company.  Naturally, they already had experience working with electronics, and therefore in a small apartment it was decided to organize their own mini-concern. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Asus, whose manufacturing country is Taiwan, got its name from the animal.  It turned out that it relied on ‚ÄúPegasus‚Äù, which symbolized not only success and rebirth, but also translated from Greek as ‚Äúrapid current‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As you know: "As you call a boat, so it will float."  The same thing happened with pegASUS.  If the first few months they only advised other companies on the development of motherboards.  After a while, they realized that they could independently create a ‚Äúmother."  And the most surprising was that they successfully released it in the first year of its foundation.  This allowed them to open the door to the world market and officially become a company in 1990. </p><h2>  Leader </h2><p>  Four years later, Johnny Shea, who is currently the president of the company, took over as CEO.  It was he who pushed the company to world leadership in the manufacture of motherboards.  Over time, Johnny Shea managed to not only keep the company afloat, but also help her capture other segments of the global electronics market. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  In 1997, the <span>first</span> Asus <span>laptops</span> appeared.  A little later, it was decided to release communicators under their own name.  Which was also a significant step in the development of the company.  Although it is still worth noting that the ASUS mobile phone, although it was first released in 2003, still became known only in the last couple of years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus taiwan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1575732.jpg"></div>

As a result, the concern turned into three separate groups.  First, ASUSTeK Computer worked on motherboards, laptops, smartphones, monitors, and other accessories.  But Pegatron Technology, under its own name, began to give the world ready-made computers, as well as cases for them and devices. </p><p>  Unihan Technology is the third group that has worked on the contract manufacturing of PC components.  It has become a working platform for cooperation with distributors, resellers, integrators and manufacturers of integrated equipment. </p><h2>  motherboards </h2><p>  Asus, whose manufacturing country is Taiwan, originally specialized in the manufacture of motherboards.  Now it is the largest producer of this segment.  Its share in the world market is more than 40%.  Statistics show that at the moment, almost every third PC is equipped with an Asus motherboard. </p><p>  For four years now, the company has been the most expensive brand in Taiwan, in addition, and the best manufacturer of motherboards.  For all the time, a huge number of innovations have been implemented in this segment that have not been registered anywhere before. </p><p>  So there was a revolutionary 16-phase power scheme.  Thanks to it, it was possible to significantly reduce energy consumption.  The result was a "mother" who not only consumes less energy, but also releases a little heat.  Both the first and second indicators do not affect excellent performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus models" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1575733.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A special EPU function was created, which is the controller of the parameters of the main components of a PC: video card, RAM, chipset, HDD, cooler and processor.  But Express Gate is working on the fact that literally 5 seconds after turning on the PC, the user already has access to the network. </p><h2>  Laptops </h2><p>  Also, Asus, whose manufacturing country is Taiwan, began to work on laptops over time.  Moreover, many of them have become not just a quality product, some have become a leader in a certain segment.  We are talking about <span>gaming laptops,</span> which, albeit worth sky-high money, are still the most powerful and reliable machines. </p><p>  The company has released more than 20 series of these devices.  Among them, there is ZENBOOK UX, which are the thinnest and most attractive laptops.  This series is quite expensive and perfect for business people.  But ASUS X is responsible for multimedia, especially suitable for moviegoers and music lovers. </p><p>  But <span>ASUS N</span> has become a very versatile series.  There are budget models with an attractive design, there are devices for businessmen, as well as quite powerful laptops.  ASUS G is the line that marked the beginning of the gaming boom.  Thanks to the models of this series, every fan of computer games will be able to plunge into the virtual world with pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1575730.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Gadgets </h2><p>  Well and above all, over the past few years, the company has been able to present very powerful and high-quality smartphones.  Asus (manufacturer - the country of Taiwan) has developed a series of very successful and good devices called ZenFone. </p><p>  There are several branches in this line: camera phones, large displays, powerful processors and simply beautiful models. </p><p>  The ASUS phone is not just an excellent gadget, it, first of all, continues the tradition of quality from the company.  Each model is assembled from strong materials, there are more budget models, which, albeit assembled from plastic, are still quite durable.  There are also very cool metal cases, which, among other things, are the real technical giants of the market. </p><p>  The company also boasts that last summer it released the first smartphone on the most powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. This excellent modification was awarded by the excellent modified ZenFone 3 Deluxe model.  In addition, the gadget is almost the <span>most powerful smartphone</span> in the world market.  And all thanks to 6 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal memory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphones asus manufacturer country" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1575729.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of course, ASUS cannot be called the undisputed leader in everything.  She produces the best models of motherboards, but their smartphones are too expensive, so they are less popular than similar Chinese models.  The company's laptops are also beyond praise, but there are companies that specialize in the manufacture of these devices.  Naturally, Asus cannot "compete with them."  But it is worth remembering that many of the experienced concerns on the market have been over 40-50 years old, but the Taiwanese company has been operating for almost 28 years and during this time achieved very cool results. </p>
