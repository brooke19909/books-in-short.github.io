Drawings created on the canvas can have a magical connotation.  For example, house embroidery patterns help in solving housing issues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": Minayat Umarova, "><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn house" class="if uuid-3109234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3109234.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular Stories </h2><p>  Not only the result, but also the value depends on what is embroidered on the canvas.  Foreign companies produce kits equipped with the necessary materials for the process.  For embroidery of houses cotton threads and canvas of small count are used.  For the primitives, needlewomen select a homespun cloth or linen so that the embroidery is beautiful and detailed. </p><p>  Popular <span>charm</span> embroidery patterns include <span>Victorian charm,</span> seasonal haed locks, and Chimera patterns.  Domestic manufacturers also produce sets with the image of houses, but they are not as overall as the above. </p><p>  Schemes with houses can be divided into several categories.  These are landscape images where nature plays the main role, but the house is also embroidered on a beautiful background, architectural options where the embroidery of the building plays the main role.  Combinations include embroideries using different techniques and a combination of several elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nwhistorycourse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="complex scheme" class="if uuid-3109249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3109249.jpg"></div><h2>  Magical overtones </h2><p>  Embroiderers invest in their work not only strength and time, but also desire.  Visualization of the conceived helps to quickly achieve the desired.  So the embroidery patterns of houses affect the solution of housing issues. </p><p>  Need to embroider on the growing moon and a new needle.  To make a wish come true, it is imperative in the process to imagine a new home and what it will be inside.  You can‚Äôt sit down at work in a bad mood, because the threads absorb energy and can then give it to the environment. </p><p>  The houses must be embroidered with light in the windows, which means joy and a full-fledged family.  Embroiderers are not advised to depict dry branches, broken trees or dried rivers near the house.  It is advisable to choose the embroidery scheme of the house in the summer, when there are many flowers and bright colors around. </p><p>  When choosing a color scheme, you need to pay attention to warm and soft shades and abandon too dark and deep.  The exception is a Victorian charm or a witch's house, which is embroidered on a dark basis.  This house is considered magical, because in most cases it helps to solve the housing problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nwhistorycourse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="primitive scheme" class="if uuid-3109236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3109236.jpg"></div><h2>  Execution technique </h2><p>  You can embroider not only with a cross, but also alternating different stitches and options.  This is done to create volumetric, smooth or detailed transitions from one shade to another.  Semi-crosses and crosses in a different composition of threads are considered popular in the embroidery process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the embroidery of flowers or small peas, French knots are used, thanks to which attention is paid to small details.  Backing a stitch or sewing back with a needle helps to draw contours on the embroidery and adds clarity and brightness to small plots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cross-stitching.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="primitive festive" class="if uuid-3109254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3109254.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes seam techniques can also be used, which not only adds originality to the work, but also creates a realistic plot.  Stitching elements are also often used in embroidery; they add watercolors and lightness to the work.  The <span>cross-stitch patterns of the houses</span> combine different techniques and stitches to achieve the realism of the finished work. </p><h2>  Original sampler </h2><p>  This type of embroidery combines several details and a key element that combines all the parts on the canvas.  Samplers are popular due to their versatility, because the embroidered plot can carry both decorative and applied functions. </p><p>  You can independently create a unique image with inscriptions, metrics are becoming popular, which prescribe the number of people living in the house and embroider its architectural features.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch an image came from ancient times, when samplers were passed down from generation to generation, as valuable relics. </p><p>  Today, embroidery formats have changed a little, but the meaning of the transfer remains the same.  Thanks to the beautiful schemes, you can create a masterpiece. </p><h2>  Strength in the primitive </h2><p>  It is not necessary to embroider large paintings in order to bring about the desired changes in your life.  A small enough plot, neatly designed and with the necessary details.  The embroidery patterns of small houses, the so-called primitives, require considerable experience in creating different types of stitches. </p><p>  Such paintings are made in a semicircle on the canvas of a small county, back stitch and other stitches can also be used.  As for colors, a few contrasting shades are enough for a primitive to convey meaning.  Embroidery of this type can be issued as a decorative work, as well as an applied practical thing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": stefania bardi, "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter option" class="if uuid-3109245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3109245.jpg"></div><h2>  Seasonal embroidery </h2><p>  In a separate category, you can collect stories that are sewn in the winter.  In such works, special warmth and comfort are hidden.  Embroidery patterns for winter houses require decoration not only in a picture, but also in a beautiful boot for gifts or a cozy decorative pillow. </p><p>  Although a cold gamut of shades is used, additional elements in the form of shiny threads, beads, charms are added to the embroideries, which gives the finished work beauty and coziness.  Pictures of such a plan also have a magical meaning, because this is a sign of the unity of the whole family, peace and tranquility. </p><p>  Small needlepoints or individual embroidered elements of the needlewoman are made out of New Year's toys and decorated with a Christmas tree or hung in prominent places.  <span>Embroidery patterns of Christmas</span> houses will help to create a festive mood and decorate the room, creating the desired coziness and comfort in it. </p>
