Compositions in this technique can be of various sizes, colors and textures.  Cones can be used perfectly for any product, whether it be a children's scarf or a stylish cardigan for a woman.  This pattern allows you to make the product more voluminous and gives it the effect of three-dimensionality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1628065.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <p>  The bumps made with knitting needles look very picturesque and attractive.  Even inexperienced, just beginning knitters will be able to handle them.  It is simply important to follow a certain knitting order, which we will try to talk about in detail today.  You don‚Äôt even have to look at the diagram.  If you perform the first rapport of the pattern, the rest of the knitting will not cause any difficulties and difficulties. </p><h2>  We knit a "bump" pattern with knitting needles. </h2><p>  Want to make the product more unusual and extraordinary?  Skilled needlewomen always recommend combination knitting.  The bumps made with knitting needles can be combined with braids, openwork knitting, creating models in the country style or creating spectacular three-dimensional patterns of different color shades. </p><p>  This pattern is a group of loops knitted in a specific technique.  They form a bump, a hill, a bulge and give the product a particularly beautiful appearance.  Let's look at how to knit cones with knitting needles and what popular methods are most often used by experienced knitters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Option 1. From one loop we make three </h2><p>  If you knit a product with a <span>front smooth surface,</span> then this method of forming cones is suitable for you.  In this case, the bump can be made from both the inside and the front loops.  So what is the main secret? </p><p>  First, you need to knit three from one loop.  Then you need to turn the work over and in the same way tie three more rows.  In the latter, just three loops are knitted as one.  As a result, on the front side of the product you will see a bulge.  This is the bump. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cones" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1628064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How can I knit as many as three out of one chain?  There may be several options.  Each needlewoman uses what is convenient for her.  You can do this with the replacement of the loops, for the front wall of the loop or for the back.  Choose the one that is simple and clear to you. </p><h2>  Option 2. From one - five </h2><p>  If you need the cones to be slightly more voluminous and convex, it is recommended to simply increase the number of loops.  For example, very often instead of three, five or seven loops from one are knitted.  Further, the knitting technique is the same as in the first case.  We knit rows, then we knit all five (seven) loops together. </p><h2>  Option 3. Below two rows </h2><p>  There is another method that is often used if knitting cones with knitting needles.  In order to make such a pattern, you need to go down two rows below and pass a spoke there.  We catch the loop, making a yarn, we knit.  Exactly the same manipulations are done with the second loop.  Now it remains to knit all the loops together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted cones with knitting needles and crochet" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1628063.jpg" width="406"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Knitted cones (knitting and crocheting) always look more spectacular than a regular canvas.  But it should be remembered that with this technique you will need an order of magnitude more yarn than, say, with a garter or sock knit.  In addition, needlewomen are advised to take for such knitting yarn containing at least fifty percent of the wool.  So the bumps will be more voluminous and convex. </p><p>  If you want to knit even more unusual cones with knitting needles, then we recommend experimenting with the color of the yarn.  The main canvas can be made in one color, but the knots to knit in another.  You can even take for such a pattern diverse threads, that is, thin and thick.  Or, for example, knit the fabric in one thread, and the bumps in two. </p><p>  This pattern is why we are loved by needlewomen, which allows us to combine and invent something new, and improve the long-forgotten old.  Fantasy is not limited to a detailed scheme that does not go astray. </p>
