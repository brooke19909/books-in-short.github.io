As practice shows, it is this component that provides the conditions for maximum immersion in the atmosphere of a movie, and even more so a musical work.  Manufacturers produce such systems in various configurations, but wall-mounted acoustic systems occupy a special place in the lines as the most convenient from the point of view of operation. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  As in the choice of any audio equipment, the capabilities of a wall-mounted speaker system should be evaluated on the basis of parameters such as power, sensitivity and frequency range.  For domestic use, you can focus on models whose power potential is in the range of 90-100 watts.  At the same time, the power available to wall-mounted <span>speakers</span> should not be associated with volume.  Rather, this indicator determines the reliability of the musical installation. </p>

    <p>  The quality and clarity of playback depends on the sensitivity.  In this case, we can already talk about the power of direct sound.  The optimal indicator for home use is considered to be 85 dB.  Here it is worth paying attention to the spectrum of reproduced frequencies.  The choice for this parameter should be based on queries.  So, for a music lover, wall-mounted <span>acoustic systems</span> that process the spectrum in the range from 20 to 35,000 Hz are suitable.  If the system is required as an auxiliary addition to a home theater, then you can limit yourself to a corridor of 100‚Äì20,000 Hz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  In addition to operational characteristics, acoustics are divided by type of housing.  Today, devices with a closed or phase inverter design are most in demand.  In the first case, we are talking about the simplest version of the case, which fully meets the needs of the average user.  However, for a better and more detailed reproduction of the lower resonance, a system with a bass reflex enclosure will be required.  Both ceiling and wall-mounted <span>speakers</span> vary in material type.  This point is especially important for systems with a hinged mount, since the additional load increases the requirements for means of fixation.  Actually, to facilitate the installation task will help the plastic case, which is light in weight, but does not pamper the sound quality.  Wooden cases give the opposite effects.  They more accurately and more deeply lose the entire spectrum of frequencies, but due to the large weight they cause certain difficulties during the installation process. </p>

    <h2>  Passive and active acoustics - what are the differences? </h2><p>  For the operation of any modern musical complex, amplifying equipment is required.  Another thing is that there are different approaches to ensuring its function.  The most winning solution in terms of sound quality are wall-mounted speakers with active amplification.  In this case, each band in the form of a speaker will have a separate amplifier, to the input of which a filter unit is also connected.  As for passive systems, they benefit from a simplified connection scheme.  They do not need to connect a special linear signal.  However, the clarity in this configuration will be significantly degraded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, the ability to adjust the volume on each band is another advantage that active speakers have.  A review of the complexes presented below will allow you to make the best <span>choice of acoustics.</span> </p><h2>  Dali Model Reviews </h2><p>  Kits of this brand are distinguished by fast and sensitive dynamics, as well as detailed sound effects.  According to listeners, Dali systems reveal a lot of accents, but at the same time retain the overall coherence of the bands, which is especially important in home theater systems.  Such kits are especially recommended for those who prefer to assemble musical complexes on their own - the developers strictly think through the connection and settings nodes, which avoids unpleasant moments during operation. </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs range also includes wall-mounted hybrid <span>speakers</span> , which are complemented by ceiling and floor installations.  According to users, this combination is optimal for a powerful home theater, and for the implementation of modern schemes for wireless playback of musical compositions. </p><h2>  Cambridge Audio Model Reviews </h2><p>  This company is primarily known for electronic components, but this is just the case when non-core products are successful.  In particular, the WS30 model is ideally suited for those places where it is impossible to integrate shelf and floor speakers.  Owners emphasize the advantages of thin walls of the structure, thanks to which it is possible to mount on any wall.  As for the nature of use, many recommend disclosing Cambridge Audio wall-mounted speakers as rear speakers.  In addition, this inexpensive solution can be a worthy option for voicing inappropriate rooms - for example, a garage or kitchen. </p>

    <h2>  Monitor Audio Shadow Model Reviews </h2><p>  Manufacturer Monitor Audio Shadow offers <span>high-quality acoustics,</span> designed for integration into a wall niche.  This is a small-sized design, users of which note a dotted sound drawn, although without the traditional volume characteristic of wall systems.  Actually, the main advantage of this development is the preservation of space in the room.  Special wall brackets for speakers of this type are designed to fix a 4-centimeter metal profile, which corresponds to the full size of the compact speakers.  The result is a combination of balanced sound and the most optimized installation. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the best option? </h2><p>  Depending on the requirements for the system, its characteristics are also determined.  Moreover, it is not necessary to put at the forefront precisely the basic operating parameters.  Often, the method of installation and placement in a room determines the merits of sound.  At the same time, there are nuances on which saving is not recommended at all.  This also applies to the materials used in the manufacture of the case, and fasteners, as well as auxiliary fittings and cables, due to which wall-mounted speakers operate.  Wall acoustics gives many advantages to owners of modest apartments, but for their disclosure it is important to correctly install and connect the system to sources.  Therefore, initially it is important to provide for accessories, due to which the overall installation of the acoustic complex will be implemented. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Acoustic manufacturers are improving systems in different directions using new tweeters and diffusers, as well as cables and fixing clips.  In particular, wall mounts for new generation speakers are represented by magnetic elements and terminals, which have a minimal impact on the quality of the sound picture.  But this also complicates the task of the user who needs to rationally and at the same time correctly complete the installation of components.  After all, wall-mounted kits in terms of installation can be called the most complex. </p>
