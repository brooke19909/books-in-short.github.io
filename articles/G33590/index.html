Although the assortment of the company is small, it still offers excellent inserts and gags.  Some of them are not compatible with phones of other brands, but they are all universal for HTC Desire.  The company's headphones on this device work just fine, and each of the available models. </p><h2>  Briefly about the company </h2><p>  The described brand has long been considered the leader in the domestic market.  Previously, the company produced only one smartphone, but now it also produces headphones, which are discussed in the article.  In 2012, the brand owned more than 50% of Beats.  The latter, due to its unprecedented success, has become synonymous with beautiful sound.  Even then, HTC did not even put forward hints that someday its phones and smartphones will be released with a related headset.  Many buyers and experts believed that in this way the company ‚Äúshowed‚Äù that the DAC and device software are able to reveal the good potential of more expensive and high-quality headphones than complete ones. </p><p>  Although the company has already reduced collaboration with Beats to naught, experience has been drawn from previous relationships.  The sound in HTC smartphones has become much better, it has more colors.  It should be noted that it is better than in iPhones and Sony.  And Beats * HTC headphones are in demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1526521.jpg" width="500"></div>

Inserts are very popular, there are practically no complaints about them.  By themselves, they are quite specific.  However, this does not bother HTC management at all.  Headphones of this type do not have sufficient sound insulation, and this suggests that such devices at the output give a sound worse than plugs.  However, many vacuum devices are not suitable for any reason, so this option will be quite tolerable. </p><h2>  Headphones HTC RC E160 </h2><p>  This option is suitable for those who want to get a normal headset for little money.  This device is simple, budget and almost one of the best devices in this price category. </p><p>  HTC headset - headphones that have good sound.  It is quite soft, for the money that they cost, the buyer receives a very worthwhile reproduction.  "Light" genres are well received by headphones.  We are talking about jazz, classical and electronic music.  Nice basses are easily reproduced without the slightest distortion, which can not be said about rock tracks.  The sound is made as good as possible from the earbuds.  Ear pads are made of foam.  Discomfort with prolonged wearing does not occur.  The microphone has a static location, which does not interfere when talking on the phone. </p><p>  Average cost: 500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire headphones" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1526524.jpg" width="600"></div>

Headphones sometimes press, and pain appears, they quickly break.  An inoperative earphone on this headset is a very common problem.  First, the wire responsible for the operation of the microphone breaks, then it breaks off at the plug. </p><h2>  HTC Vacuum Plugs </h2><p>  The company was able to create completely high-quality <span>vacuum headphones</span> through the use of an improved type of design <span>.</span>  Especially when you compare them with inserts.  Soundproofing and sound are at a good level. </p><p>  Due to the design, the waves are delivered directly deep into the auricle, which means that the bass and sound volume are deep and clear.  If a person likes good reproduction, then HTC plugs - headphones are quite suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc headphone jack" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1526533.jpg" width="600"></div>

Absolutely any styles are reproduced well.  A long time wearing headphones does not affect the condition of the auricle.  They do not cause discomfort and pain. </p><p>  The average price is 400 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones with microphone htc" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1526543.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  RC E190 Reviews </h2><p>  The headphone data wire is thick, so buyers attribute this to the pluses.  He is not confused.  There is a set of ear pads.  The sound is powerful and high quality. </p><p>  Of the minuses, the device breaks down after six months or a year.  Often, wire breaks happen at the plug, which causes the "death" of one of the headphones.  The switch works poorly and slows down a bit. </p><h2>  HTC RC E240 device </h2><p>  The described model most often comes with the HTC One smartphone.  The headphone jack is standard, which means 3.5 mm.  It is universal for all phones of this company.  The sound in them is good, does not cause negative emotions.  The quality of the headphones is one level higher than the previous ones, but they are more expensive. </p><p>  The RC E240 has a beautiful design in which minimalism prevails.  Wearing them is quite comfortable, and the sound will impress not only lovers, but also professional musicians.  Anyone who appreciates deep bass tracks will be incredibly shocked.  It is quite difficult to achieve such a smooth and clean reproduction in this price category.  Sound shades will allow you to hear all the details of each song, no matter how complex and rich they are. </p><p>  The average price is 650 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc earphone not working" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1526545.jpg" width="417"></div>

    <h2>  HTC Wireless Headphones </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no wireless headphones from HTC.  In this case, if there is a desire for a Taiwanese manufacturer to buy such a device for your phone, you can pay attention to universal devices.  So far, HTC does not plan to create wireless headphones. </p><h2>  Problems with broken headphones </h2><p>  If the HTC <span>earphone does not work</span> , then there are only three solutions to this problem.  Consider them. </p><ul><li>  It should be taken to a service center.  Often, one earphone does not work if the wiring is broken.  Depending on where it happened, the chances of "rehabilitation" increase or decrease accordingly.  In the service center, if the breakdown is to be fixed, the headphone can be repaired.  However, this method only works in 5 cases out of 10. </li><li>  Try to understand what is with the headphones at home.  Now it is easy to find information on an independent solution to this problem.  Again, if the wire was broken, there is still a chance to fix it by resorting to using electrical tape and other items. </li><li>  Purchase a new device.  An inoperative earphone is a common problem with budget device models.  Some devices break literally in a week, while others are able to work for more than a year.  It all depends on the attitude to the headphones, build quality and materials.  Often, users simply buy a new headset. </li></ul>
