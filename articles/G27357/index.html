The words of vacationers confirm this.  The maid regularly cleaned the room.  Shampoo and liquid soap were replenished as needed.  The ATM, which is located in the lobby of the hotel near the reception, worked properly.  It was always possible to withdraw cash. </p><p>  Internet speed was sufficient for downloading files and sending emails.  The low cost of living compensated for the inconvenience associated with faulty appliances and shabby furniture.  Due to its location away from noisy highways, the nights in it were quiet.  Nothing disturbed the sensitive sleep of young children and their parents.  Dining at Club Bamboo Boutique Resort SPA is available at the restaurant. </p><p>  Not without cons.  The guests complained about insects that ran right in the rooms.  Many did not like the steep steps.  It was difficult to climb them.  There were complaints about the diner menu.  The dishes seemed too sharp and salty.  I had to go to the center in search of budget European canteens or bistros. </p><p>  If you got the old number, then in compensation the hotel administration offered substantial discounts on cocktails in the bar.  It is said that flocks of wild dogs lived near the residential buildings, wandering through open terraces in the evening and in the morning in search of leftover food.  Animals were not aggressive or embittered, but not everyone liked this neighborhood. </p><p>  The hotel staff does not speak Russian at all.  It is necessary to communicate in English, which not all waiters and maids understand.  The way out is active gesticulation.  Our compatriots praised the park, which is divided into the hotel.  This is not an ordinary square, but the real jungle.  In it were hand-held squirrels that jumped around the sunbeds. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main advantage of the region is rightfully considered local spas and medical centers.  The list of the most popular establishments was headed by Siladon Patong.  The cheaper ones follow: Burasari, Vayo Massage, Sweet Lemongrass, Breeze, Oriental and Art Massage.  They can be reached on foot or by taxi.  Russians usually rent motorcycles and scooters.  Convenient and fast! </p><p>  In Patong, excellent conditions are created for profitable shopping.  Therefore, Russians buy last-minute tours to Thailand even in the rainy season.  The gloomy sky is compensated by low prices and a huge selection of goods.  Numerous shopping galleries run boutiques and shops of local and international brands.  Jewelry shops are very popular among girls.  They present not only expensive jewelry, but also democratic jewelry. </p><p>  The water area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPatong is a storehouse of impressions for experienced divers.  Numerous schools and educational centers invite you to learn the basics of diving.  Information is available at the front desk and at the Club Bamboo Boutique Resort SPA.  Excursion agents invite you to walk in the bay.  They organize fishing in the waters of the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean. </p><p>  In the evenings, the neon lights of nightclubs are lit in the city center.  They have noisy parties.  In the dry season, discos move directly to the beach. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2>
