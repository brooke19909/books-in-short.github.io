    <h2>  Service Evaluation </h2><p>  Blue Bay Beach Hotel is visited by thousands of tourists every year.  Based on their opinion, it is possible to form a definite opinion on the quality of work of this institution.  So, the evaluation of services is as follows: </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td align="center">  Criterion </td><td align="center">  Score (out of 5 possible) </td><td align="center">  A comment </td></tr><tr><td>  Infrastructure </td><td align="center">  4.3 </td><td>  The hotel has a completely landscaped area, which is equipped with parking, infrastructure for recreation, as well as a reliable security system.  As for catering establishments, the guests found their work schedule somewhat uncomfortable, as they close early enough. </td></tr><tr><td>  Service </td><td align="center">  3.9 </td><td>  The most negative point that spoils the overall rating for the service is the quality of the wireless Internet signal.  His work is extremely unstable.  As for the work of the reception staff and maintenance staff, it is rated highly enough.  It is also worth noting high-quality, but unobtrusive animation. </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of rooms </td><td align="center">  4 </td><td>  The number of rooms is quite outdated, and therefore needs repair, as well as the replacement of furniture and technical equipment.  There are some problems with sound insulation.  As for the quality of cleaning, it is done fairly conscientiously. </td></tr><tr><td>  Vacation with children </td><td align="center">  4 </td><td>  Children's rest is organized at the hotel at a high level.  This applies to both infrastructure and animation.  The only complaint is nutrition. </td></tr><tr><td>  Location </td><td align="center">  3.9 </td><td>  The location of the hotel is beneficial for those who love a beach holiday, and also want to explore as many attractions as possible.  As for the deployment relative to urban infrastructure, it is very disadvantageous.  Also, there are practically no entertainment facilities nearby. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The best testimony to the quality of the Blue Bay Beach Hotel resort reviews.

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Such a resort as the Blue Bay Beach Hotel (Ialyssos) is not without its drawbacks.  4 stars of this institution should not dazzle tourists with their brilliance.  Tourists should be prepared for such negative moments: </p><ul><li>  in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are practically no infrastructure facilities and entertainment facilities; </li><li>  TVs in the rooms are quite old, due to which the image may be of poor quality; </li><li>  a strong smell of bleach is felt in the pool; </li><li>  on the terrace by the pool there are few enough sun loungers, and therefore they have to be occupied from the very morning (before breakfast); </li><li>  standard rooms are too cramped to accommodate 4 people (not to mention extra beds); </li><li>  old mattresses with protruding springs that cause serious discomfort during sleep; </li><li>  in the dining room there is a constant lack of glasses; </li><li>  the beach closest to the hotel is strewn with a lot of sharp pebbles; </li><li>  for sunbeds for relaxing by the sea you need to pay 3 euros per day; </li><li>  in the dining room you can often see dirty plates and glasses; </li><li>  all animation in the hotel in English (including children); </li><li>  if there are any problems in the room, employees are in no hurry to fix them, no matter how much you ask them about it; </li><li>  special requests regarding the format of the beds (large or twin), as well as regarding the view from the window, are almost never taken into account; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that a hairdryer is stated in the bathroom, this option is absent in some rooms (apparently the old one broke down, but they did not take care of the new one); </li><li>  Guests are not provided with bottled drinking water. </li></ul><p>  If you want to relax with high quality and relatively inexpensive, you should pay attention to this institution.  Despite the outdated interior and other shortcomings, it leaves a fairly pleasant impression. </p>
