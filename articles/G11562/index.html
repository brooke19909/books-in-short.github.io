Very beautiful, warm and hospitable city of Sochi!  This is the pearl of Russia.  There are many diverse attractions and amenities for tourists.  There is only one drawback that can slightly spoil the long-awaited vacation, we will learn about it later in the article. </p><h2>  "Deuce" by geography </h2><p>  Sochi is one of the longest cities in the world, which is located on the Black Sea.  He is very unique.  Here you can swim in the gentle sea (season April - November), then sunbathe, and after an hour or two ski and throw snowballs on the famous Mount Krasnaya Polyana.  And how many cypresses and palm trees in the city!  Blooming oleander with magnolia is just a miracle.  It‚Äôs good to spend time in the gorge by the mountain river and breathe in the wondrous air of the mountains.  And in 40-50 minutes go down to the sea. </p>

    <p>  Actually, it is to this blue surface that many people come here.  And what happens?  People hoped in Sochi to lie on a yellow and warm sand in order to return home with a beautiful skin color.  But in reality they were just exhausted, their feet were torn off by sharp stones.  It was especially difficult to get out of the water on pebbles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Yes, apparently they had a "deuce" in school geography.  Due to the nature of the mountainous terrain, the city does not have its own natural sand.  All beaches are pebbled.  So when asked where the sandy beach is in Sochi, they will answer that it is not there, there are only such small sections. </p>

    <h2>  Pebble on foot </h2><p>  To begin with, we will walk along <span>the seashore.</span>  Maybe we can still <span>find where the</span> sandy beach in Sochi is located.  Here is the "Seaside" (near the Central Embankment).  It is pebble-rocky.  Maybe on the "Riviera" find what we are looking for?  The coast here is spacious, spacious, but also covered with small pebbles, in some places - sand.  The question of where the sandy beach in Sochi remains open. </p><p>  The "Swallow" (Mamaika microdistrict) is all strewn with small pebbles.  "Azure" is always ready to meet tourists in the summer.  Comfortable sun loungers and sun loungers are located here, otherwise those who have arrived will have to lie on hard pebbles under the well-baked southern sun.  This is also not the place where Sochi has a sandy beach. </p><p>  "The Seagull" pleases with clear sea water and an amazing view of the mountain peaks, a convenient beach.  It is the largest in the city limits (located in the Adler district).  Its area is 30 thousand square meters.  Here is what you need for the best rest, even a post rescue and medical center.  And the beach is small pebble.  True, wooden floorings are carefully arranged everywhere so that people do not walk on hot stones and burning sand. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Have you come to rest with young children?  Go to the Lighthouse, where the pebbles are quite small and there are sand and pebble areas. </p><p>  All coastal areas in the city do not have continuous sand.  So a positive answer to the question of where in Sochi is a sandy beach can hardly be obtained.  What to do?  I have an idea! </p>

    <h2>  Outside the city </h2><p>  We need to drive off a bit and see where in <span>the Sochi area there are</span> sandy beaches.  Here, for example, the <span>resort "Loo",</span> which is 18 km away.  It boasts a clear sea and spacious beaches.  But they are also sand and gravel.  And if someone did not manage to occupy a place in the sand in the morning, then you will be lurking on pebbles.  The village of Vardane is 30 kilometers away.  Here is a great resort with excellent facilities and service.  But the shore is again made of stones. </p><p>  To find out where in the Sochi region there are sandy beaches and a clean sea, let's go to Golovinka - this is in the Lazarevsky district.  Here the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Black Sea is considered the most unpolluted. </p><h2>  Curious story </h2><p>  Where did these smooth, sharp, small and large stones come from on the beaches of Sochi?  And these mountain rivers and rivulets have been grind the Caucasus Mountains for centuries and carried various debris, boulders, tiles to the Black Sea.  The sea continued to grind and grind them.  <span>The mountains of the Caucasus are</span> 70 million years old.  They grew and formed during the eruption of lava.  After all, the local mountains are volcanoes that are already extinct.  Pumice is a frozen magma, filled with air, and therefore light.  There are tuffs and basalts that simply froze at the exit of the vent.  They are heavier than pumice, but, of course, lighter than granite.  By the way, it can also be found on the beaches. </p>

    <h2>  Souvenir </h2><p>  Granite pebbles are beautiful in a special way.  Take a few of these stones for memory.  Under your feet you can also find basalts.  There are simply decorative pebbles, and even semiprecious.  Add flint-chalcedony here.  About its healing properties healers now speak with might and main. </p><p>  And on the coast and the same beaches you can see stones with holes, sometimes with holes.  This means that the sea clam has already worked - stonecutter.  They say that finding such a pebble is fortunately.  Therefore, do not be very upset that you did not manage to lie on the beach the way you wanted. </p><h2>  On the golden sand </h2><p>  But everything flows, everything changes.  More recently, a completely new beach has opened in the Imereti Lowland <span>(Adler District)</span> .  Its area is like three football fields.  At the same time, nearly a thousand people can sunbathe.  Here you will receive the long-awaited answer to your question, where are the sandy beaches in Sochi.  Photos selected for the article will confirm this. </p><p>  The beach began to be built recently - in April 2015.  We carried out all types of necessary work and finished with landscape design and landscaping.  The fact is that this beach is artificial, bulk.  Since their sand is not mined in Sochi due to the peculiarities of the rocky relief, no less than 11 thousand tons of special gold were brought here.  He was chosen from 15 samples that were searched both in Russia and abroad.  In particular, in Africa, as the beach workers themselves said.  This unusual cargo was transported 160 railcars to the Black Sea by rail.  Each contained 70 tons. </p><p>  On the sandy surface, of course, it‚Äôs better to relax, although there is a minus: vacationers still have to enter the sea on pebbles. </p>

    <h2>  Two levels of pleasure </h2><p>  The new beach consists of two sites: coastal and main.  The first accommodates 200 people and is located right by the sea.  The second - 30 meters from the seashore.  On the lower terrace there is an entrance area, sports and dance floors, a town for kids.  On the top - its own cafe plus terraces (700 sun loungers).  Here is the territory of a special, enhanced service: additional service and services, there is a jacuzzi. </p><p>  We are no longer talking about showers and toilets - these are trifles, as well as a medical center with a rescue service. </p><p>  Here you can spend the whole day with your whole family or in the company of friends - they will not rush anyone.  Residents of the region pay 200 rubles / day for this luxury, visitors - 400. </p><p>  Already a lot of people have been here.  Rumors of this amazing building are constantly growing.  Now you can explain to everyone interested where in Sochi there are sandy beaches and a clear sea. </p>
