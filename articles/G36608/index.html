Most recently, Bazhov Park was created here.  Visitors open a low carved iron gate and pass through torn stone arches into the courtyard.  Stone sculptures froze here - the heroes of the tales of the famous Pyotr Bazhov, a writer who managed to revive the Ural stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="butyrskii.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bazhov park" class="if uuid-2969611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969611.jpg"></div><p>  The creators did not accidentally give the park the name P.P.  Bazhov.  No one in the literature before him sang the Ural gems.  For the writer, a small town was a welcome place where, behind every stone, he saw his heroes. </p><h2>  From the history of the park </h2><p>  Bazhov Park is located in a picturesque place on Krasnaya Gorka, from where you can admire Tagonai and Kosotur.  He, like Chrysostom, has a story.  20 years ago, at the initiative of a leading enterprise in the city, which also acted as an investor in the reforms, the reconstruction of this place began: </p><ul><li>  A square was destroyed in honor of John Chrysostom, the patron saint of the city. </li><li>  A few years later a bell tower was erected, the height of which exceeded 50 meters. </li><li>  In the tower was opened a chapel dedicated to St. John Chrysostom. </li><li>  At the top of the tower is a huge bell with a diameter of one meter, weighing more than a ton.  Any visitor, having risen to the very top of the tower, can try to ring the bells, and then a unique ringing is heard. <div class="photo" data-original="zlattur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sculpture in a mountain park" class="if uuid-2969616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969616.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  As a legend, local residents tell about the deeds of the breeder Mosolov, who revered the saint and gave his name to the new city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Later, the leadership of the Zlatoust plant continued work on Krasnaya Gorka.  A monument to Yuri Gagarin and a submarine appeared in the square - evidence of the skill of the workers of the Ural factories who developed and produced missiles for submarines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nashural.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sculpture in Bazhov park" class="if uuid-2969613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969613.jpg"></div><h2>  Along the alleys of the park </h2><p>  Visiting Zlatoust, it is worth looking into the Bazhov park, where a real fairy tale begins.  Vigilantly guards the entrance of the Serpent-Gorynych, the fire-breathing heads of which the Ural craftsmen forged from iron, and the body was a wooden capitol barrel.  A little distance from behind a stone boulder a stately beauty will emerge - Mistress of the Copper Mountain. </p><p>  Next to her is a Jumping Firebug, a small, palm-witted, mischievous girl in a blue sarafan, holding a handkerchief in her hands.  People will notice a mischief waving a handkerchief, which means that gold deposits are in this place.  And here is the Silver Hoof, from under whose legs gems fly apart, and next to it is the admired Dasha and the cat Murena. </p><p>  A stone flower looks like a real masterpiece, the very one over which the young Ural master suffered. </p><p>  A huge eagle hung out meter-long wings.  He holds with his powerful claws to the sharp edge of a granite rock, clutching in his claws a fish that she brought to her chick.  It is interesting that of all the attractions of the park, the newlyweds chose this one.  In the bird's nest, they throw coins for happiness and the fulfillment of desires. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The highlight of the park is the fountain, which is a huge open stone book.  Passing through the pages of the book, tourists enter the Kingdom of Reading.  Here a girl and a boy crouched on a bench and are holding an open book.  Another reader lay down in the middle of the lawn and, carried away by reading, did not notice anything around.  Stone sculptures have many visitors.  There are those who came here for a reason, but to sit in the reading room in the open air, because Bazhov's tales are interesting to read surrounded by nature. </p><p>  The open-air museum has no familiar attendants.  Any figure can be touched, stroked, because the stone is eternal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="butyrskii.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zlatoust Bazhov Park" class="if uuid-2969610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969610.jpg"></div><h2>  At the observation deck </h2><p>  Zlatoust is famous for its stone processing, so there are many stone sculptures in Bazhov Park.  After examining the sculptures made of stone, the guests open a massive oak door, on which bronze lizards are heated, and pass to the observation deck.  The sculptures on it are unique: </p><ul><li>  Striking a nine-meter waterfall.  The stone for him was taken from the quarries of the region.  In total, 500 tons of stone blocks were left. </li><li>  In the center of the site is an oak, a masterpiece of Perm blacksmiths.  Masters put their souls into it and a broad meaning, which is as follows.  In nature, everything is harmonious, man is its particle.  There is enough space under the sun for everyone, therefore peace must reign on earth.  Confirmation of these words are sculptures of foxes and hares, which are peacefully located under an oak tree, and a forest boar looks up with interest, not trying to undermine the roots of a mighty tree.  Visitors linger near a miracle tree for a long time: they need to find 20 characters hidden in iron leaves.  You will see everyone - life will become happy. <div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alley in the mountain park" class="if uuid-2969623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969623.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Exhibition gallery </h2><p>  The Bazhov Mountain Park in Zlatoust opened several pavilions for visitors: </p><ul><li>  In one ("Mineral room") of them all the minerals collected that are saved in the bowels of the Ural Mountains are the Mistress of the Copper Mountain.  Visitors are attracted by the Ural hills - collections of minerals that were invented by Peter I. Gemstones, Ural gems and malachite sparkle in museum windows, and small fragments of giant meteorites darken.  Near a tree decorated with 33 gem balls, tourists freeze in mute delight.  Samples for engraving were taken not only in the Urals, but also from deposits of foreign countries. </li><li>  In separate rooms of the Armory workshop there is a collection of weapons forged by the Ural gunsmiths. </li><li>  Of interest is the exposition telling about the development of crafts in Zlatoust. </li><li>  In the exhibition halls ("Chronograph Zlatoust") you can get acquainted with the history of the city. <div class="photo" data-original="sdelanounas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain park in the Chelyabinsk region" class="if uuid-2969625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969625.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Blacksmiths of the Ural Guild </h2><p>  Zlatoust is considered the birthplace of a unique engraving, the first steel guns, and forged products.  Sculptures in the Bazhov park confirm the talent of the masters of the region: </p><ul><li>  The author of the eagle sculpture is a Perm blacksmith, and the association of Perm blacksmiths was the embodiment of the idea. </li><li>  On a large panel there is an iron Serpent, which, according to Bazhov's tales, combined the properties of a man and a reptile.  It was he who became famous for his wisdom and was declared the owner of the Ural gold.  The iron panel "The Great Runner" was performed by Kasli craftsmen.  Their second work is a sculpture of Danila the master. </li><li>  Kisley's casters cast both the figurine of the Ognevushka girl and the Silver Hoof. </li></ul><h2>  According to tourists reviews </h2><p>  In Zlatoust Bazhov Park is popular among tourists, many of whom leave their reviews after the tour: </p><ul><li>  In the park there is an untold expanse, I want to fly up. </li><li>  A visit to the park for children becomes a journey into a fairy tale. </li><li>  In the park, adults remember what they read in childhood.  Upon their return, they take Bazhov's tales in the library to once again, together with their children, plunge into the secrets of the Urals. </li><li>  Visitors notice that in a short time it is not possible to examine all the exhibits of the park.  They say that everyone who worked on creating the Bazhov park was in love with their land and city. </li><li>  It pulls into the park in any weather, because there you get younger and relax your soul. </li><li>  Visitors are eager to take numerous photos of Bazhov Park.  Zlatoust is a combination of all seasons at once.  The Silver Hoof scatters gem stones in the winter, and the mighty oak rustles with foliage in the summer.  In the cold season, the park looks seriously, in the Urals, but as soon as the sun comes out, every stone sparkles and shimmers. </li><li>  If you go up to the bell tower when the tired sun sets over the horizon, then indescribable beauty is revealed.  I want to tirelessly admire the Chrysostom, which was surrounded by mountain peaks, I do not want to leave the observation deck at all. </li></ul><h2>  How to get to the park </h2><p>  The city attracts tourists with its attractions, including a mountain park.  In Zlatoust, Bazhov Park has the following address: the village of Krasnaya Gorka, 16b.  Tours are often arranged in the city, because it is located at a distance of 140 km from Chelyabinsk, 260 km from Ufa and 28 km from Miass.  Sometimes excursions take days off.  Visitors settle in hotels, hostels.  Locals believe that Bazhov Park is located within the city, so often they cover the distance of 4 km on Gagarin Avenue on foot.  Tourists are invited to use public transport (the Krasnaya Gorka stop), although it‚Äôs only 500 meters from the bus station to the park.  Get a little further from the train station. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.1558787" data-lng="59.685885299999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/8/6/6/11866.png"></div><h2>  Working hours </h2><p>  The park is open around the clock.  Exhibition halls, ascent to the bell tower will be paid.  The entrance is free.  In addition to the park, you can visit the museum of local lore, the Armory settlement and the arms factory shop. </p><p>  Bazhov Mountain Park in Zlatoust has become a favorite vacation spot for citizens.  Everyone who has ever come to the park wants to come back here again and again. </p>
