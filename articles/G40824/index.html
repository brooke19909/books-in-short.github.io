    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The most reliable source from which you can get information about the shortcomings of the Ascos Coral Beach 4 * hotel (Cyprus), reviews.  A review of negative comments draws attention to the following: </p><ul><li>  the wireless internet in the hotel is very expensive; </li><li>  the entrance to the sea is not very convenient due to the large number of sharp stones; </li><li>  the hotel needs repair; </li><li>  housekeeping leaves much to be desired, even if you leave a tip; </li><li>  due to the fact that the pool is under the scorching sun, the water in it is almost hot, and therefore swimming in it is not very pleasant; </li><li>  really lacking sports animation; </li><li>  use of the safe is possible only at an additional cost; </li><li>  for using the remote control from the air conditioner and TV you have to make a deposit of 5 euros; </li><li>  water in the pool stinks terribly bleach; </li><li>  information that the hotel is located on the first line is not entirely true, because the beach will have to go about 10 minutes; </li><li>  breakfasts are modest enough. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you want to make an overall impression of the Ascos Coral Beach 4 * hotel (Cyprus), visitor reviews will help you with this.  A pretty positive impression is made by a beautiful landscaped area.  It is immediately clear that the project was well done by designers, gardeners and other specialists.  Also quite interesting is the architecture of the building and the bungalow.  Due to the fact that the hotel is located on an elevated area, you will have a good overview of both the sea coast and the city (especially beautiful will be the view from the windows of rooms located on the upper floors).  Thus, the outer shell of the hotel makes a pretty good impression. </p><p>  Basically, in order to swim in the sea, travelers come to the Ascos Coral Beach 4 * hotel <span>(Cyprus).</span>  <span>Reviews of tourists</span> indicate that the beach of this hotel is quite rocky.  As a result, to swim, you have to walk a few meters on the barbed stones.  And given that with a sharp increase in depth you can lose balance, there is a big risk of injuring your legs.  Therefore, it is worth stocking up with slippers.  By the way, in this area, even the most expensive hotels can not boast of sandy beaches.  But there is a lot of marine life here.  Taking along the pipe and mask, you can make an exciting underwater trip.  As for the pools, the guests do not really like them because of the high temperature of the water and the sharp smell of bleach. </p><p> Special attention deserves food.  The food here is very tasty and varied.  In the restaurant of this hotel you can get to know more about traditional Greek cuisine.  It is also worth noting the presence of a good menu for children.  If you want to feel free and not depend on the schedule of the dining room, then you can not order meals on a full board basis, but limit yourself to breakfast or create any convenient conditions for yourself.  Given the peculiarities of local agriculture, you can be sure that your table will always have fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as natural homemade cheeses. </p><p>  As for the profile of the hotel, it is hardly suitable for active youth or families with children.  This option is just perfect for those who like a calm and measured rest.  There are not so many entertainments here, but loud music will not be playing late under your windows, no one will disturb your sleep.  In addition, given the contingent of vacationers, here you can count on intelligent neighbors with whom you can have a good time. </p>
