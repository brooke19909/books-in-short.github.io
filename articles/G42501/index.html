  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is diarrhea and how to treat it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even in our progressive times, not everyone understands what diarrhea is.  In fact, this is <span>an intestinal disorder,</span> which is an increase in bowel movement more than two times in one day.  In this case, a characteristic liquid consistency of feces.  Diarrhea is not considered a disease, it merely indicates a malfunction in the digestive system.  In the same way that coughing is a sign of a malfunction in the respiratory system. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that diarrhea is chronic and acute.  <span>Chronic diarrhea</span> can last more than 14 days, while acute attacks of the disorder occur suddenly and end within 7-14 days. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail what diarrhea is, as well as the probable causes of its occurrence. </p><p>  Various intestinal infections, such as viral diseases, salmonellosis, dysentery, etc.  cause diarrhea.  This also includes: poor nutrition, dysbiosis, allergies to any type of food, lack of vitamins F, K, B2 (also known as riboflavin) in the body, niacin, various chronic diseases of the digestive organs (colitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, enteritis, hepatitis and others.).  Experts say that acute poisoning, fear, unrest, neurosis, a malfunction in metabolism, a sharp change of residence also contribute to the appearance of discomfort in the intestines.  If such changes have occurred in the body, then you will soon find out what diarrhea is. </p><p>  There are several options for developing an <span>upset stomach.</span>  In the first case, the cause is an increase in intestinal motility (wave-like contractions of its walls).  As a result, the food goes along the intended path too quickly.  It happens that in the large intestine the process of water absorption is disrupted, or inflammatory fluid gets inside it.  This, in turn, leads to liquefaction of the intestinal contents. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Signs of Diarrhea </p><p>  So what is diarrhea and how dangerous is it?  Confusing this disease with something else is very difficult.  There are so severe cases that a person spends almost all the time in the restroom.  In addition to diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and flatulence can also occur.  A person loses his appetite, his weight decreases.  However, it depends on what caused such ailments. </p><p>  Few people are seriously afraid of diarrhea: that it is very dangerous, in general, many do not think.  However, there are times when you need to see a doctor.  For example, if the duration of diarrhea exceeded four days, mucus or blood streaks appeared in the feces, severe pain is felt in the abdomen, the temperature has risen sharply, or food poisoning is very likely to be assumed. </p><p>  Possible danger </p><p>  Diarrhea can lead to dehydration.  Most often, elderly people and small children suffer from this.  A particularly neglected case can even lead to death. </p><p>  Diagnostics </p><p>  The most important thing is to determine the cause of diarrhea.  A gastroenterologist or even a therapist will help with this.  After the examination, he will try to find out in detail how the disease started.  After this, you will need to <span>analyze the feces.</span>  If it turns out that diarrhea has arisen due to an infection, you will need to see an infectious disease doctor. </p><p>  If the disease is chronic, then, in all likelihood, it will be necessary to pass an analysis of urine, blood and undergo an ultrasound of organs located in the abdominal cavity. </p><p>  Treatment </p><p>  On TV, we are often assured that a tablet can solve all problems.  However, in reality this is not so!  It must be borne in mind that an intestinal upset or chronic diarrhea, like any disease, is a consequence, and the cause must be treated.  So, if the disease arose due to a lack of vitamins, then vitamin injections will help.  If the reason lies in dysbiosis, it is recommended to take Bificol, Lactobacterin or Bifidumbacterin.  Diarrhea in case of colitis is treated with drugs that relieve inflammation.  If the cause is a bacterial infection, then antibiotics will help. </p>
