Everyone can comprehend this art, for this you need to learn how to knit loops, deal with types of yarn, learn the types of knitting, read patterns. </p><h2>  Types of Yarn </h2><p>  Manufacturers do not get tired of impressing us with new products for knitting threads from both natural and artificial raw materials.  Consider the most common <span>types of knitting yarn</span> : </p><ul><li>  Cotton yarn.  This is a natural fiber of plant origin.  Products of this kind are very pleasant to the body.  The yarn is produced by smooth torsion and can be of various thicknesses.  Cotton products are unpretentious, washable at a temperature of 30-40 ¬∫ and do not require special care. </li><li>  <span>Woolen yarn.</span>  It is a natural product obtained from the wool of sheep.  With such a fiber, you need to be very careful to use.  Things are washed at low temperatures manually.  However, wool yarn is very much appreciated for its thermal qualities. </li><li>  Yarn with a pile.  This type includes cashmere and Angora fiber.  You can knit sweaters, cardigans, pullovers from it.  This yarn requires special care.  Cashmere items do not like frequent washes.  If necessary, wash only with mild detergent at room temperature. </li><li>  Shaped yarn.  This type is obtained by twisting fibers of various origins and all kinds of colors and textures.  The ratio of natural fibers is always indicated on the packaging of yarn, it can be used for various products. </li><li>  Eco Yarn.  In its manufacture only environmentally friendly materials and dyes are used.  All necessary care measures are usually indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of yarn for knitting" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/596585.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Loop set </h2><p>  From it begins the knitting of any product.  First you need to determine the length of the free end of the thread, with which the loops will be performed.  This size will depend on what types of knitting yarns are used.  If the yarn is thin, 1 cm will suffice for one loop.  When using <span>thick yarn,</span> lay 1.5-2 cm. Multiply the number of loops to be dialed by this indicator, and you will get the required length of the free end.  Do not forget to add 20 cm for the convenience of knitting the last loops.  Dialing can be done by several techniques.  Consider the most basic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A simple set of loops </h2><ol><li>  Put the thread on the deployed palm and stretch it under the index finger.  Then we wind by the thumb and lay to the fingers to maintain. </li><li>  We put together two knitting needles, from the bottom up we hold under the thread between the thumb and forefinger.  We hook the thread passing under the index finger, stretch it into the loop under the thumb. </li><li>  The formed first loop must be tightened, for this we knit the threads from both fingers. </li><li>  We return to the place of the thread - the free end on the thumb, and the thread going from the ball to the index finger.  We continue to loop in the same sequence to the required number. </li></ol><h2>  Types of loops </h2>

    <p>  The first set of rows is made.  To create any patterns, you need to know the types of loops when knitting.  There are only two of them: </p><p>  <em>Facial.</em>  The first point to consider: the thread is placed behind your work.  The needle that lies in the right hand, from left to right, insert into the nearest loop, which is located on the left needle.  A working thread is stretched through it, which forms a loop on the right knitting needle.  The one through which the thread from the left needle was stretched should be discarded. </p><p>  <em>Wrong.</em>  The difference is that the working thread in this option must be placed before work.  The movement of the right knitting needle is, on the contrary, from right to left.  We insert the knitting needle in the right hand into the loop, which is located on the left knitting needle, pull the working thread through it.  We drop the loop from the left knitting needle and get a loop of a new row. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The types of loops for knitting, presented above, are basic.  The canvas, made with front elements, on the reverse side will look like the wrong side.  And vice versa. </p><h2>  Edge loops </h2><p>  They include all types of knitting, because any part has edges.  The first and last loop of the knitting row are called edge.  They are considered auxiliary and are not part of the pattern.  The execution of edge loops is mandatory, you can perform them with the following techniques: </p><p>  <em>"Chain".</em>  The meaning of this technique is that for every two rows of canvas there is only 1 <span>edge loop.</span>  For this, the first loop of the row is simply removed without knitting, so that the thread is in front of the work, and the last is knitted with the front one.  So it is necessary to do in each row.  To obtain a uniform edge, the last loop must be knitted tighter than all the loops of the fabric.  Such edges are perfect for assembling parts.  If the edge will be used under the bar or neck, in these cases, the best option is to make the first and last loops in the front row, and the back loops on the back side, so you get a more even and even edge. </p><p>  <em>The knot.</em>  The technique is similar to the previous one.  The first loop is removed, only the thread in this case should remain at work, and the last loop is knitted with the front one.  You can also make a nodular hem edge, starting and ending with a series of facial loops, the thread should remain at work.  It should be noted that this technique gives a less elastic edge than when making an edge with a chain.  Therefore, it is recommended to use it, for example, for strips of jackets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Whatever types of knitting, each row should repeat the selected technology, that is, the number of edge loops must match, otherwise you will get the edges one shorter than the other. </p><h2>  Loop closure </h2><p>  This technique depends on the canvas on which it will be performed: </p><ul><li>  Facial surface.  The edge and second loops are knitted in the front performance.  After which the first loop is pushed through the second.  Then the next one is knitted + the one through which the previous one is pushed.  The whole process is repeated until all loops are closed, after which the thread is cut, passed through the last loop and tightened. </li><li>  Wrong surface.  The process is repeated, as with the front surface, only all the loops are closed in the wrong technique. </li><li>  Elastic band and other types of <span>knitting patterns.</span>  Closing must be done according to the pattern, that is, it will be necessary to carry out a combination of closing the front and back loops provided by the scheme.  The first two loops are knitted, according to the figure, then the second is passed through the first.  After this, the next loop of the pattern is knitted, the previous one is stretched through it.  After closing the entire row, we tighten and cut the thread. </li></ul><h2>  The execution of crochets </h2><p>  This element is mainly used in openwork patterns.  The yarn is an additional loop so that the number of loops in the row does not increase, after the yarn, the next two loops are knitted together, and one of the two is obtained.  After yarn on a continuous canvas, a hole is obtained.  All types of knitting include two types of yarn: </p><p>  <em>Plain.</em>  In order to make a crochet, the working thread is captured by the right knitting needle, pulled to the loops located on it, and adhered with a finger.  Then all subsequent loops are knitted according to the pattern.  In the wrong row, it will be necessary to knit a crochet made, it is mainly performed by the wrong loop.  If this condition is different, the correct implementation will be indicated in the instructions. </p><p>  <em>Double.</em>  The technology is similar to the previous one, but not one, but two are made from a thrown thread.  To do this, the right knitting needle is clasped with a working thread twice.  And to save the number of loops in a row before and after the double crochet, two loops are knitted together. </p><h2>  Types of Gum </h2><p>  The simplest element of the product is an elastic band, which is obtained by alternating the back and front loops.  To perform high-quality elastic, you need to use knitting needles at least one and a maximum of three sizes less than for the main fabric.  A large number of products begins with this element, for the manufacture of which a variety of knitting can be used.  Types of rubber bands, schemes by which they can be made - all this can be found in various interest forums in a huge amount.  We will consider the most elementary of them: </p><p>  <em>A simple rubber band.</em>  The simplest option is obtained through a combination of front and back loops: 1x1 (in such a sequence along the entire length of the row).  On the reverse side, knit according to the resulting pattern.  As a result, on the canvas, your front loops will line up in columns, and the wrong loops will form hollows. </p>

    <p>  <em>Double gum.</em>  These types of elastic knitting needles are a more structurally pronounced option.  Alternation in a row occurs from 2 facial loops and 2 wrong loops.  Accordingly, if you have finished a series of facial loops, on the reverse side you will start with the wrong ones.  For symmetry, choose the number of loops for this type of elastic, which will be divided into four, and do not forget about the two edge loops that need to be added to the total number. </p><p>  <em>Torn gum.</em>  The front part of the fabric is knitted in the same way as a double elastic band, the front and back loops alternate in a 2x2 ratio.  As for the back side, all wrong loops are performed on it. </p><h2>  Basics for patterns </h2><p>  Knitting made by a combination of front and back loops can serve as a basis, which includes different types of knitting: </p><p>  <em>Facial surface</em> .  It is performed in this order.  The first row fits in the front, the second - the wrong one.  This combination is repeated over the entire height. </p>

For this species, crossover loops are used, with the help of which elements such as harnesses and braids are performed. </li><li>  Jacquard patterns.  The technique of execution consists in knitting one row with threads of various colors, which according to the scheme fit into color patterns.  This technology came to us from Norway.  The basis for it is the front surface. </li><li>  Patent patterns.  The difference between these patterns is that the relief canvas is the same on both sides. </li><li>  Openwork knitting.
