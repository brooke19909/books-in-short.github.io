Many people want to be sure that the fall of their favorite gadget will not lead to irreversible damage, and the ingress of water - to the need for repairs.  Which phone is the strongest in the world?  We suggest you find out from our rating, compiled on the basis of feedback from ordinary users and experts. </p><h2>  Security criteria </h2><p>  The main criterion for the security of a mobile gadget is its compliance with certain requirements.  Among them is the Ingress Protection Rating (IP) penetration resistance system for liquids and solids, or the American military standard MIL-STD 810G. </p><p>  The obvious need to protect the phone from dust and moisture forces many manufacturers to produce gadgets that comply with IP68.  This type of protection does not affect the design of the smartphone. </p><p>  But the increased impact resistance of the case affects the size, weight and ergonomics of the phone.  It is logical that users decide to sacrifice these characteristics only if necessary, and the protected phones themselves occupy a rather narrow niche in the market.  We offer to get acquainted with the strongest phones in the world, which have good functionality. </p><h2>  Ginzzu r62 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://imgur.com/a/wSJDpdn"><img itemprop="image" alt="the strongest phone in the world" class="if uuid-3189437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3189437.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the push-button most powerful phones in the world becomes less and less over time.  Despite the fact that the product is niche, there is a demand for it, and not bad.  In particular, the demand for unpretentious and hardy models with a walkie-talkie - such as the Ginzzu R62.  It is equipped with a full-fledged radio station with a range of 400-470 MHz, an external antenna and a communication range of up to 2 kilometers in open space.  Unfortunately, there is no frequency scanner, so you need to agree on a radio exchange with your interlocutors in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The manufacturer's lineup includes the twin brother of the model in question, called the Ginzzu R2, in which the antenna socket is replaced by an LED flashlight.  By the way, the gadget only works on 2G networks, which is not particularly attractive. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Full-fledged radio station. </li><li>  Capacious battery. </li><li>  Clip to fasten the phone to the belt. </li><li>  A slot for a memory card and two SIM cards. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Lack of support for 3G / 4G networks. </li><li>  Lack of frequency scanner. </li><li>  Poor display quality. </li><li>  The need to choose between a flashlight and an antenna. </li></ul><h2>  SENSEIT P300 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="world's strongest touchscreen phone" class="if uuid-3189439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3189439.jpg"></div><p>  The specific functionality of one of the strongest phones in the world will interest those users who need reliable and guaranteed communication even in the absence of cellular coverage.  The gadget is equipped with an eight-channel walkie-talkie, which allows you to communicate in the range of up to a kilometer in open space or several hundred meters with dense buildings.  The phone‚Äôs antenna is removable, channels can be tuned, a tangent is located on the side. </p><p>  The gadget has an address book for 500 contacts, each of which can store up to four numbers and an email address.  The advantages of SENSEIT also include the IPS matrix of the high-definition display, several profiles for SIM cards, the work of FM-radio without the need to activate a headset and a good camera.  The battery lasts for several days in mixed mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Main advantages: </p><ul><li>  Walkie-talkie with the ability to configure channels. </li><li>  High screen resolution. </li><li>  Detachable antenna. </li><li>  Nice phone book. </li><li>  Powerful flashlight. </li><li>  Work FM radio without a headset. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Poor firmware quality. </li><li>  Poor impact protection. </li><li>  Scratched protective glass. </li></ul><h2>  teXet TM-512R </h2><div class="photo" data-original="habr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the strongest phone in the world" class="if uuid-3189441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3189441.jpg"></div><p>  The teXet brand, owned by the St. Petersburg Electronic Systems Alkotel company, is actively promoting in the domestic market clones of one of the most popular models of the Chinese company Chinavasion Electronics - Mann Zug S. The first version - TM-511R - practically did not differ from the prototype, but the other two - 512R and 513R - received a lower resolution display.  The manufacturer managed not only to maintain affordable prices, which is important in the conditions of the economic crisis, but also to attract attention by the increased autonomy of the models.  As a result, we have the strongest phones in the world, corresponding to the declared protection class.  In addition, the gadget copes well with static loads thanks to pads made of aviation aluminum at the edges of the case. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  High degree of protection IP76. </li><li>  High capacity removable battery. </li><li>  Special pads on the body. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  One contact - one number. </li><li>  The display is not completely blocked, which can lead to an accidental response to an incoming SMS. </li></ul><h2>  Ark Power F2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tinypic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the strongest phone in the world photo" class="if uuid-3189446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3189446.jpg"></div><p>  The rating "Which phone is the strongest in the world" continues the protected model Ark Power F2.  The undoubted advantage of the gadget is its large battery capacity: the manufacturer claims 4000 mAh, which should be enough for three weeks of standby time. </p><p>  The phone has only one speaker;  it is located behind, the protruding part of the battery prevents it from normal to press the device to the ear, because of which everyone around can hear the conversation.  On the other hand, a loud speaker and a SOS button allow older users to use the phone. </p><p>  The phone book is designed for 300 contacts with the ability to store one number.  The radio functions without activating the headset, which, however, has nowhere to connect.  A nice additional option is a powerful flashlight with a separate control key. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Capacious battery. </li><li>  Quick call nine numbers from the book. </li><li>  The SOS key located inside the joystick. </li><li>  High speaker volume. </li><li>  Powerful flashlight with a switch located on the side. </li><li>  Radio with internal antenna. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  One speaker, and one on the back. </li><li>  Average display quality. </li><li>  A simple phone book. </li></ul><h2>  AGM X2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the strongest phone in the world photo" class="if uuid-3189448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3189448.jpg"></div><p>  One of the strongest touchscreen phones in the world with a glass back panel that complies with the MIL-STD-810G standard.  The AMG brand is almost unknown, but it offers a very good X2 model, stylized as alligator skin. </p><p>  The protected smartphone has excellent technical characteristics, among which is a set of sensors and sensors for almost any situation, and the main advantage is the built-in gas analyzer.  Of course, it is difficult to call it universal, but it can determine the degree of air pollution by volatile organic matter. </p><p>  The smartphone supports all 4G bands, equipped with a good camera - a real dream of an inveterate traveler.  The gadget is equipped with a special cover-float that does not allow the smartphone to drown. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  11 various sensors. </li><li>  Decent camera. </li><li>  High performance. </li><li>  Large battery capacity. </li><li>  Protection Level - IP68 and MIL-STD-810G. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Lack of technical support. </li><li>  Unreasonably high price. </li><li>  Combined tray for memory cards and SIM cards. </li></ul><h2>  Blackview BV9000 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmochina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the strongest phone in the world rating" class="if uuid-3189449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3189449.jpg"></div><p>  A good mid-range smartphone with an original design that looks attractive even in the photo.  The strongest phone in the world, and pay attention to the simple version of the BV9000.  The manufacturer offers an improved version of the model with a Full HD + display resolution, but it is almost impossible to meet it in Russian stores. </p><p>  The smartphone meets the IP68 protection level, which guarantees the shock resistance of the case thanks to metal inserts and corrugated "rubber" pads.  Among the nice bonuses is a customizable smart key that launches applications and performs some functions when the display is locked.  The only possible complaints are the lack of Bluetooth profiles for high-quality audio playback and the reluctance of the NFC module to read transport cards. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Good technical specifications. </li><li>  Capacious battery. </li><li>  Narrow side frames and a large display. </li><li>  Great navigation. </li><li>  Programmable key. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Too gluttonous processor. </li><li>  Combined slot for SIM card and memory card. </li><li>  Lack of support for transport cards. </li><li>  It starts to bask under load. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Which phones are the strongest in the world?

It is worth restricting yourself to the simplest gadgets if the main purpose of its use is calls.  The ability to keep in touch with the built-in walkie-talkies can be useful for hunters, fishermen and athletes.  Protective smartphones with excellent performance are ideal for those who do not want to give up the usual entertainment on the go and worry about the safety of the phone. </p>
