  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Place des Vosges in the French capital Paris</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Place des Vosges in Paris is the oldest in the city.  It is considered one of the most beautiful places due to its architecture.  About when and how it appeared, about the historical events associated with this place, and interesting facts will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  Before the Place des Vosges in France, swamps and swamps were located on this site.  As a mockery, Louis IX presented these places to the Knights Templar.  However, the Templars were not upset by this fact, but simply drained the swamps, then built up and ennobled the territory. </p><p>  It was this area that influenced the name of the Mare quarter, which means ‚Äúswamps‚Äù.  The king was enraged that the Templars managed to make a landscaped area out of unsuitable terrain.  Subsequently, the lands were returned under royal rule, and the Templars were executed. </p><p>  Until 1559, King Henry II lived in these places, but during one of the tournaments he was killed.  The desperate queen left the Turnel Palace, calling it a cursed place, and transferred it to the equestrian bazaar. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The Place des Vosges owes its appearance to the King of France, Henry IV, who, by his decree in 1605, gave the land of the former Hotel Tournel to the development of the square and its further improvement.  This was done on the occasion of celebrations dedicated to the engagement of Anna of Austria and Louis XIII. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecultureconcept.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tournaments in the square" class="if uuid-2562295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2562295.jpg"></div><p>  Along the edge of the square pavilions were erected for walking and entertaining ordinary people.  The center of the square itself was called Royal, it was covered with sand and leveled for the performance of the cavalcades (a group of riders).  Later, tournaments and sometimes dueling began at this place.  This continued until in 1670 a public garden was made from the Place des Vosges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  Here picturesque lawns were created, benches were installed, and the area around the perimeter was surrounded by a curly fence made of cast iron.  In the center of the resulting park, a statue of <span>Louis XIII</span> was installed <span>,</span> which was remelted during the French Revolution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecultureconcept.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park with fountains" class="if uuid-2562298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2562298.jpg"></div><p>  In 1800, after the revolution, the square changed its name from Royal to Place des Vosges.  It was renamed in honor of the inhabitants of Vosges, one of the French departments.  The fact is that they constantly supported the revolutionary army with their financial contributions.  In the XX century, the square was included in the list of historical and architectural monuments of France. </p><h2>  Area currently </h2><p>  Paris, the capital of France, has many attractions, but the square has always been a special historical place.  One of its features is the original rectangular construction, which was obtained from buildings that were built at different times. </p><p>  Despite this, they practically do not differ from each other either in form or in style of decoration.  They are built of white stone and red brick, and the facades of the buildings have the same arched supports.  The only buildings on the square that differ from all the others in their grandeur and luxury are the castles of the queen and king. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.aviewoncities.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square buildings" class="if uuid-2562303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2562303.jpg"></div><p>  The French called this place the most enclosed area in the capital, since only one street passes through it.  In Paris, the capital of France, this square is one of the few places that has almost completely retained its original appearance to date and has hardly been restored.  The only restoration was carried out several years ago, and it was to clean the building of mold and dampness that has formed over several centuries. </p><h2>  Description of the Vosges Square </h2><p>  The buildings that create the area at different times belonged to very famous people.  For example, one of the luxurious houses was owned by Cardinal Richelieu, who erected a monument to Louis XIII in the square.  Another building belonged to the famous French writer Victor Hugo, who wrote most of his books here.  Not far from Hugo lived the poet <span>Theophile Gauthier,</span> as well as the playwright and novelist <span>Alphonse Daudet.</span>  The industrialist and inventor Isaac Singer lived and worked on improving the sewing machine here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="evro-travel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the square from a height" class="if uuid-2562302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2562302.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the Place des Vosges is one of the cultural centers of Paris, as well as a monument of French architecture.  Its center is decorated with four three-tier fountains, striking in their aesthetics.  Inside the perimeter, the square is surrounded by figuratively planted trees, and in its center is a statue of Louis XIII. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  On this square, any tourist will find what is interesting to him.  Here on the ground floors of buildings various boutiques and cozy cafes with restaurants have opened.  For connoisseurs of history, there are antique shops and museums in the square, and for art lovers there are several art salons. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of architecture will definitely be interested in the Saint-Paul Church, built in the 17th century.  The house-museum of Victor Hugo, whose interior has been preserved in its original form, is especially popular. </p><p>  This place is loved not only by numerous tourists, but also by local residents.  The area has a pleasant and peaceful atmosphere.  It is amazing that the square, which was originally intended for tournaments, today has become a tourist attraction, where people admire its beauties and relax from the daily rush. </p>
