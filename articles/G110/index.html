First, let‚Äôs get acquainted with what beadwork is, what beads are, what types of it exist, how to collect work according to simple schemes so that they do not crumble and are durable. </p><p>  Beadwork lessons for beginners are best started with small flat children's crafts.  When you master the assembly of beads into parts, you can try to do bulk work. </p><h2>  What is a bead? </h2><p>  Small glass beads are called beads with a central hole into which a wire, thread or thin transparent fishing line is inserted.  Of these elements, you can create various figures, patterns, make a mosaic on fabric or embroidery, decorate clothes or knitwear, make jewelry - beads, earrings and bracelets, and decorate the surface of bags and purses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead stars" class="if uuid-2639745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639745.jpg"></div><p>  Beadwork is the whole art of composing from flat elements both flat and three-dimensional figures.  For beginners, beadwork will be good to use schemes and step-by-step photographs.  It‚Äôs easier to understand how to start assembly, how to connect parts to each other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of beads </h2><p>  When choosing beads in a store, you need to focus on several important indicators.  Details must be of high quality, almost the same size (with slight deviations).  It is also necessary to check the color during washing, especially if the beadwork will be embroidered on fabric.  For the experiment, you just need to soak a few beads in water with washing powder and then put it on a white napkin.  If the paint fades, it is better not to do embroidery from such beads, otherwise the thing will go bad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="light snake crafts" class="if uuid-2639839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639839.jpg"></div><p>  Beads are distinguished by shape and color.  There are rounded beads, faceted, they are also called chopped, cylindrical and bugles, which looks like thin tubes.  By coloring, they can be translucent, fully colored, with shine and tints.  There are mixed forms, for example, when the bead itself is transparent, and the inner hole is painted with color or silver. </p><p>  The so-called satin beads looks beautiful in the light of lamps. </p><h2>  Materials for work </h2><p>  For a beginner, beadwork needs to know what materials are required for work other than beads.  Beads are strung on a wire that has a thickness of 0.3 mm to 1.5 mm.  For bulk large crafts with large beads, a denser material is used, for flat crafts from small beads, you can take a thin wire. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Strong sewing nylon threads are taken for sewing; for large beads, the thinnest satin ribbon is sometimes chosen; for jewelry, a fishing line is often used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="10awesome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowflake pattern" class="if uuid-2639833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639833.jpg"></div><p>  Cut off excess material with scissors, preferably small and sharp.  If the work is carried out with threads, then prepare a thin needle that will freely crawl into the inner hole of the bead. </p><p>  You will also need a work flow chart, a sample of which is visible above. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  For the very beginners, beading is an important tip for the proper organization of the work surface for the manufacture of crafts.  Since the details are all small, then take care of the excellent illumination of the table, the table should correspond to the height of the person, then you will not need to bend down and bend your back. </p><p>  To make it easy to find items of the desired color or size, prepare small containers so that they can pour the beads of the same color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2639740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639740.jpg"></div><p>  It is best to do the craft on a table covered with a cloth or linen white napkin.  Then, if accidentally dropped, the bead will not roll away, and on a plain contrasting surface it can easily be found. </p><p>  It is not recommended to work on beadwork for a long time (and this is a very interesting matter and can drag on for a couple of hours), otherwise your eyesight can be damaged.  Take great breaks to relax the eyes and back with great work. It is advisable to stretch yourself and do gymnastics for the eyes. </p><h2>  Buttonhole technique </h2><p>  Beading for beginners always begins with the creation of loops.  This is the easiest option for beginners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loop dragonfly" class="if uuid-2639785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639785.jpg"></div><p>  The essence of loop weaving is as follows: </p><ul><li>  The required number of beads is strung onto the wire, bent with a loop and, holding the parts together, twist the wire under the loop.  So you can make a flower petal or leaf. </li><li>  After stringing the parts on the wire, its two free ends are threaded into one bead and fingers tightly press the loop.  This mount is often used in crafts. </li></ul><p>  Let us consider in more detail beadwork methods for beginners step by step with a photo. </p><h2>  How to make a butterfly </h2><p>  1. Start work with the body of an insect.  The wire is folded in half, leaving long ends on both sides.  So that the beads do not fall, the edge of the tail bends in several turns. </p><p>  2. Then string small beads of the tail, 9 pieces will be enough.  Then they put on one large part and push the ends of the wire in different directions.  Work begins on the wings.  Lower loops will need fewer elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a butterfly from beads" class="if uuid-2639792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639792.jpg"></div><p>  3. When the desired value is reached, the loops are rolled left and right, and once the wire is twisted around the center. </p><p>  4. Next, make large loops of the upper wings, putting more beads on the wire.  The loops are tightened with your fingers and again wrapped the wire around the central part.  Then the two ends are again folded together and put on 2 parts on top. </p><p>  5. For the insect head, choose a large bead.  Leave the required length for the antennae and cut off the excess edges of the wire with scissors.  Twist the ends with curls, the tiny details at their ends look original. </p><h2>  Little flower </h2><p>  Flowers for beginners beadwork is best collected from narrow parts with an offset hole.  They are very similar to the petals.  For the middle, a large bead is used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elegantjewelrybeadsandaccessories.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower bead" class="if uuid-2639797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639797.jpg"></div><p>  10 beads are strung on the wire and fasten the ends of the loop as follows: </p><ul><li>  The left end is threaded into the last hole and pokes on the opposite side. </li><li>  The right edge of the wire is inserted into the same hole on the other side. </li><li>  Pulling the edges of the wire, tighten the loop tightly. </li><li>  Further, one large central bead is immediately put on both ends. </li><li>  On the opposite side, the wire is likewise inserted into one hole on both sides. </li></ul><p>  Continuing work in this way, you can make a long bracelet on your hand, it is advisable to wear a pair of contrasting elements between the colors. </p><h2>  How to make bracelets </h2><p>  <span>Beginners</span> need to learn how to use patterns.  These are drawings in which the lines show how to insert a wire, fishing line or thread into the holes of the elements.  Consider carefully how, according to the scheme below, you can make a beautiful bracelet with a floral pattern.  The middle of the colors in the diagram is black, and the petals are white.  You can use any colors you wish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freekidscrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2639758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639758.jpg"></div><p>  The first three beads are put on the middle of the wire.  Then they bend the wire with a loop, and string 4 more pieces.  The first is the color of the petals, the second and third are dark for the middle, and the last is the same as the first.  The other end is inserted into all 4 holes on the back side.  The wire is again bent by a loop, and the last row in the manufacture of one flower will again consist of three beads of the main color.  The wire is threaded through all openings on both sides.  This is done until the bracelet is the right size.  At the end, the edges are fixed, and excess wire, fishing line or thread is cut. </p><h2>  Bracelet from different types of beads </h2><p>  For such a craft, you need to buy a bag of bugles, round and flattened parts.  Buy a lock for the bracelet in advance, as the work begins with attaching one part of it to the wire.  Its two long ends will continue to take part in the work on the bracelet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keepsakecrafts.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bugle bracelet" class="if uuid-2639830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2639830.jpg"></div><p>  First, two pieces of glass beads are put on each edge, then one small part is inserted on two edges at once, combining them together.  Then again, work occurs with each wire separately.  Three glass beads are put on each side, then rounded elements alternate, as in the photo.  In this case, the wire is threaded inside all the holes on both sides. </p><p>  Work continues similarly to the desired length.  Then they attach another part of the lock and twist the end of the wire, cutting off the excess with scissors. </p><p>  As can be understood from the photos available in the article, beadwork for beginner needlewomen can be mastered without much difficulty.  Try the scheme to make a snowflake or stars to decorate the Christmas tree.  Like a butterfly, the manufacturing method of which is described above, you can make a dragonfly, a photograph of which is also in the article.  Try, develop creatively, learn new forms of art.  This is fun and useful.  Good luck </p>
