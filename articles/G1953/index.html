However, in fact, the great scientist was interested in various fields of knowledge.  Mendeleev's discoveries are related to chemistry, physics, metrology, economics, geology, pedagogy, aeronautics, etc. </p><h2>  Periodic law </h2><p>  The periodic law is one of the fundamental laws of nature.  It lies in the fact that the properties of chemical elements depend on their atomic weight.  Mendeleev discovered the periodic law in 1869.  The scientific revolution that he accomplished was not immediately recognized by chemists. </p><p>  A Russian researcher proposed a logical system with which it was possible to predict unknown then chemical elements and even their properties.  After their early discovery (we are talking about Gaul, Germany and Scandium), world-famous scientists began to recognize the fundamental nature of the periodic law. </p><p>  Mendeleev's discoveries took place in an era when science was replenished with ever-new scattered facts about the world around us.  Because of this, the periodic law and the periodic table of elements built on its basis faced serious challenges.  For example, in 1890.  noble gases and the phenomenon of radioactivity were discovered.  Defending his theory, Mendeleev continued to improve the table, correlating it with ever new scientific facts.  In <span>1900, a</span> chemist placed argon, helium and their analogues in a separate zero group.  Over time, the fundamental nature of the periodic law became more and more clear and undeniable, and today it is rightfully considered one of the greatest discoveries in the history of the natural sciences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Silicates research </h2><p>  The periodic law is an extremely important page in the history of science, but Mendeleev‚Äôs discoveries in the field of chemistry did not end there.  In 1854, he explored Finnish orthith and pyroxene.  Also, one of the cycles of Mendeleev's works is devoted to the chemistry of silicates.  In 1856, the scientist published his dissertation ‚ÄúSpecific Volumes‚Äù (it assessed the relationship between the volume of a substance and its characteristics).  In the chapter on silica compounds, Dmitry Ivanovich elaborated on the nature of silicates.  In addition, he was the first to give the correct interpretation of the phenomenon of a glassy state. </p><h2>  Gases </h2><p>  Mendeleev‚Äôs early discoveries were related to another chemical and at the same time physical topic - the study of gases.  The scientist took up it, delving into the search for the causes of the law of periodicity.  In the 19th century, the theory of the ‚Äúworld ether‚Äù was the leading one in this field of science - an all-pervading medium through which heat, light and gravity are transmitted. </p><p>  Studying this hypothesis, the Russian researcher came to several important conclusions.  Thus, Mendeleev‚Äôs discoveries in physics were made, the main of which is the appearance of <span>the ideal gas equation</span> with a universal gas constant.  In addition, Dmitry Ivanovich proposed his own thermodynamic temperature scale. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In total, Mendeleev published 54 works devoted to gases and liquids.  The most famous in this cycle were "Experience in the chemical concept of the world ether" (1904) and "An attempt at a chemical understanding of the world ether" (1905).  In his works, the scientist used virial expositions and thereby laid the foundations of modern equations for <span>real gases.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Solutions </h2><p>  Solutions were of interest to Dmitry Mendeleev throughout his scientific career.  Regarding this topic, the researcher did not leave a complete theory, but limited himself to a few fundamental points.  The most important points regarding solutions, he considered their relation to compounds, chemism and <span>chemical equilibrium</span> in solutions. </p><p>  All the discoveries of Mendeleev were checked by him with the help of experiments.  Some of them related to the boiling point of solutions.  Thanks to a detailed analysis of the topic, Mendeleev in 1860 came to the conclusion that, when boiling in steam, the liquid loses its heat of vaporization and the tension surface up to zero.  Also, the teachings of Dmitry Ivanovich on solutions influenced the formation of the theory <span>of electrolyte solutions.</span> </p><p>  Mendeleev was critical of the theory of electrolytic dissociation that appeared in his time.  Without denying the concept itself, the scientist pointed out the need for its refinement, which was directly related to his work on chemical solutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Contribution to Aeronautics </h2><p>  Dmitry Mendeleev, whose discoveries and achievements cover the most diverse spheres of human knowledge, was interested not only in theoretical subjects, but also in applied inventions.  The end of the XIX century was marked by increased interest in the emerging aeronautics.  Of course, the Russian scholar could not help but pay attention to this symbol of the future.  In 1875, he created a project of his own stratospheric balloon.  Theoretically, the apparatus could rise even into the upper atmospheric layers.  In practice, the first such flight occurred only fifty years later. </p><p>  Another invention of Mendeleev was an aerostat powered by engines.  Ballooning was of interest to the scientist, not least in connection with his other works related to meteorology and gases.  In 1887, Mendeleev made an experimental flight on a balloon.  The balloon managed to cover a distance of 100 kilometers at an altitude of almost 4 kilometers.  For the flight, the chemist received the gold medal of the Academy of Aerostatic Meteorology of France.  In his monograph on issues of environmental resistance, Mendeleev devoted to aeronautics one of the sections in which he described in detail his views on this topic.  The scientist was interested in the development of aviation pioneer <span>Alexander Mozhaysky.</span> </p><h2>  Development of the North and shipbuilding </h2><p>  Mendeleev‚Äôs applied discoveries, the list of which can be continued as such in the field of shipbuilding, were made in collaboration with geographic research expeditions.  So, Dmitry Ivanovich was the first to propose the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa test basin - an experimental setup necessary for hydromechanical studies of ship models.  Admiral Stepan Makarov helped the scientist realize this idea.  On the one hand, the pool was needed for trade and military-technical purposes, but at the same time it was useful for science.  The experimental setup was launched in 1894. </p><p>  Among other things, Mendeleev constructed an early prototype of an icebreaker.  The scientist was included in the commission that selected the project for the state appropriation of the world's first such ship.  They became the icebreaker "Ermak", launched in 1898.  Mendeleev was engaged in research of sea water (including its density).  All the same Admiral Makarov, who had traveled around the world on the Vityaz, provided him with material for study.  Mendeleev‚Äôs discoveries in geography related to the topic of the conquest of the North were presented to scientists in more than 36 published works. </p>

    <h2>  Metrology </h2><p>  In addition to the other sciences, Mendeleev was interested in metrology - the science of means and methods of measurement.  The scientist worked on the creation of new weighing methods.  As a chemist, he was a proponent of chemical methods of measurement.  Mendeleev's discoveries, the list of which was replenished year after year, were not only scientific, but also literal - in 1893 Dmitry Ivanovich opened the Main Chamber of Weights and Measures of Russia.  He also invented his own design of a cage and rocker. </p><h2>  Pyrocollodion gunpowder </h2><p>  In 1890, Dmitry Mendeleev went on a long trip abroad, the purpose of which was to get acquainted with foreign laboratories for the development of explosives.  The scientist took up this topic with the filing of the state.  The Ministry of the Sea invited him to contribute to the development of Russian powder business.  The initiator of the Mendeleev‚Äôs business trip was Vice Admiral Nikolai Chikhachev. </p><p>  Mendeleev believed that in domestic cross-breeding, it is most necessary to develop the economic and industrial aspects.  He also insisted on using exclusively Russian raw materials in production.  The main result of the work of Dmitry Mendeleev in this area was the development by him in 1892 of a new pyro-collodion gunpowder, distinguished by its smokeless nature.  Military experts praised the quality of this explosive.  Pyrocollodine gunpowder was distinguished by its composition, which included nitrocellulose subject to solubility.  Preparing for the production of new gunpowder, Mendeleev wanted to endow it with stabilized gas formation.  For this, in the manufacture of explosives were used additional reagents, including all kinds of additives. </p>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  At first glance, Mendeleev‚Äôs discoveries in biology or metrology are not at all connected with his image of the illustrious chemist.  However, the scientist's studies on economics were even more distant from this science.  In them, Dmitry Ivanovich examined in detail the directions of development of the economy of his country.  As early as 1867, he joined the first domestic business association - the Society for the Promotion of Russian Industry and Trade. </p><p>  Mendeleev saw the future of the economy in the development of independent artels and communities.  This progress implied concrete reforms.  For example, the scientist proposed making the community not just agricultural, but engaged in factory activity in the winter, when fields are empty.  Dmitry Ivanovich opposed resale and any form of speculation.  In 1891, he participated in the development of a new Customs tariff. </p>

    <h2>  Protectionism and Demography </h2><p>  Mendeleev, whose discoveries in the field of chemistry overshadowed his successes in the humanities, conducted all his economic research with the quite practical purpose of helping Russia.  In this regard, the scientist was a consistent protectionist (which, for example, was reflected in his work in the industry of cross-breeding and his letters to Tsar Nicholas II). </p><p>  Mendeleev studied economics inextricably with demography.  Shortly before his death, he noted in one of his works that in 2050 the population of Russia will be 800 million people.  The scientist‚Äôs forecast became a utopia after two world and civil war, repressions and other disasters that hit the country in the XX century. </p>

    <h2>  Refutation of Spiritism </h2><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, Russia, like the rest of the world, was embraced by the fashion of mysticism.  Esoterics were fond of representatives of the upper world, Bohemia and ordinary city dwellers.  Meanwhile, the discoveries of Mendeleev in chemistry, the list of which consists of many points, obscure his long struggle with the then popular spiritualism. </p><p>  The scientist exposed the methods of mediums along with colleagues from the Russian Physical Society.  Through a series of experiments with gauge and pyramidal tables, as well as other tools of hypnotists, Mendeleev came to the conclusion that spiritualism and similar practices are just superstitions, which profiteers and scammers profit from. </p>
