    <ul><li>  too weak water pressure in the bathroom (this problem is especially acute for the upper floors); </li><li>  the hotel really lacks a pool, because it is located far enough from the sea. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Park Inn Hotel (address: 56/3 Gorky St., Sochi, Krasnodar Territory, Russia) is a rather attractive accommodation option.  It offers beautiful and comfortable rooms, as well as qualified staff who will satisfy any of your whims.  The assortment and quality of dishes in the restaurant deserves special attention.  Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages here.  The hotel is a considerable distance from the sea.  However, there is no swimming pool.  It is also worth noting the proximity of the train station, which is why in rooms with windows overlooking the square, it is quite noisy (especially in the mornings). </p>
