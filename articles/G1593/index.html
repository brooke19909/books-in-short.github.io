There is everything that travelers demand for exotic, and at the same time, you will not be deprived of any of the achievements of civilization.  If the resort, located in the neighborhood - Kutu, is called respectable, then Seminyak has earned a reputation for glamorous.  And not without reason. </p>

    <h2>  Why go here </h2><p>  We can ask a question about how and why travelers with money choose when arriving in Bali, Seminyak.  Of course, first of all, for the sake of its beach - clean, wide, with fine sand, as if arising from brochures.  Accommodation here is also prestigious and of high quality.  The region is convenient and compact.  It has all the necessary infrastructure, and in addition, everything you need is right around the corner.  Most restaurants in Seminyak are awarded different awards for cuisine and class service.  For art lovers, the resort has art galleries.  And after <span>sunset,</span> a rich and vibrant nightlife begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to this resort village, you need to fly to the airport Ngurah Rai (Bali).  Seminyak is located from this hub (its second name is more popular, it is Denpasar) no more than half an hour away.  Rarely does anyone get here on their own.  The vast majority of hotels send customers a shuttle service, which is included in the price.  But if no one meets you, then you can take a taxi. </p><p>  Some companies provide machines at the front desk, but say it is too expensive.  And if you go outside and call a Blue Bird taxi, then pay the average price for Bali.  If you use public transport, it is not too convenient.  The bus does not stop in Seminyak, but only in neighboring Kut.  And from there, about a quarter of an hour you need to go to the place. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels (Seminyak, Bali): where to stay? </h2><p>  There is simply no cheap accommodation at this resort.  Villa rental starts at one hundred dollars a day.  At the same time, each square meter is built up.  Most hotels are new and recently opened - after all, ten years ago there was a fishing village and rice plantations.  Of the luxury hotels in Seminyak, Oberoi is recommended for its comfort and location both near the beach and with shopping centers.  He is very romantic, and he is preferred by couples in love. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The conceptual complex ‚ÄúTS Suites &amp; Villas‚Äù is famous for its design rooms, and its pool is open around the clock.  The Quartet are not too far behind five-star hotels, and besides it‚Äôs cheaper, and the service is almost the same.  For example, in Light Exclusive, each room is a villa with its own pool and several bedrooms.  And you can get to Harris even for 1600 rubles a day.  There are as many as five pools, one of which is located on the roof. </p>

    <h2>  Where to sunbathe and swim </h2><p>  It is believed that the local beaches are the best in Bali.  Seminyak is famous for its coast.  They are not crowded, snow-white, very wide, there is always a lot of sun.  It is believed that there are two beaches in this area, but it is unlikely that anyone will be able to say exactly where one begins and the other ends.  The first of them - Double Six - is called in the English style, and the second - Petinenget - in Indonesian.  They are all well equipped, but there are differences. </p><p>  Double Six will appeal more to families with children.  There are many water activities, a lot of cafes and a beautiful promenade.  Therefore, in the evenings, festivities are arranged.  And Petingenet got its name from the temple of the same name, located very close by.  There are always big waves, so surfers like him very much.  In addition, there are practically no people here.  But in no case do not go into the water if you see a red flag on the beach!  This means that strong currents have come that can carry you away. </p>

    <h2>  What to do here </h2><p>  The Seminyak (Bali) area is intended not only for seals, but also for sightseeing.  The name of the sanctuary near the beach translates as ‚Äúmagic box‚Äù.  And indeed, in the richness of decor, decoration, sculptures, statues and ornaments, it resembles a wonderful carved box.  There are a lot of different art galleries.  There are sculptures, paintings and other works of art dedicated to Bali and its nature, and the bars offer excellent coffee.  There are exhibits related to folk crafts - textiles, gold and silver jewelry.  For fans of extreme sports, there is also entertainment - a jumping tower where you can jump from a height of forty-five meters from morning to night.  And for spa salons of the resort of Seminyak <span>(Bali), reviews are</span> reserved only for admiring interjections.  Massage is generally beyond praise. </p><p>  Families with children are advised to visit El Park Bali or Lollipops Playland.  These are huge entertainment complexes for young travelers.  Huge multi-level playgrounds, children's pools, <span>obstacle</span> courses <span>,</span> trampolines and, of course, cafes and restaurants where parents can retire at this time.  Something is constantly happening at this resort - parties, concerts, shows, demonstrations, presentations.  Seminyak is often called the Balinese Beverly Hills.  And there is a lot of truth to this. </p>
