It was opened in 1843.  But, despite the fact that so many years have passed, this park has not lost anything of its originality and popularity among both adults and children.  Although now there are many other entertainment complexes, this garden is firmly in third place in Europe in terms of attendance.  What are these parks?  Tivoli is inferior only to the Parisian Disneyland, Europe in Germany and Efteling in Holland.  In the heart of Copenhagen, you will find this fun city - a true oasis of relaxation.  Let's take a walk along the alleys of these wonderful gardens and see why they are so attracted to the people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tivoli park copenhagen" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1780297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Garden layout </h2><p>  The Tivoli Amusement Park (Copenhagen) is located in the heart of the Danish capital.  Its address is Westerbrogade 3. Nearby is Andersen Boulevard.  You can get to it by train.  The railway station closest to the park is Copenhagen N.  The garden is across from her.  You can also get there by city bus.  There are several routes to the park: 1A, 2A, 5A, 9A, 11A, as well as 40, 250 and 866. Many tourists who simply sightsee the city do not pass the park either.  After all, the Copenhagen Town Hall is located nearby.  And due to the fact that it is in the center, many come there even in the late evening.  Indeed, at this time, the garden is especially wonderful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Tivoli Gardens Amusement Park in Copenhagen (Denmark) was founded by officer Georg Karstensen.  An interesting legend is told about this.  Allegedly, this officer from the family of diplomats did not have enough funds to implement his grandiose plan.  Then he persuaded the Danish king Christian the Eighth to allocate land specifically for the park and free it from taxes for the first years.  He told him that this could save the country from revolution, because when people have fun, they are not involved in politics.  The monarch agreed on the condition that there was “nothing obscene” in the gardens.  True, a few years later the Danes still forced the king to adopt the Constitution, but the park had already been built.  Its name comes from the garden of the same name in Paris.  At first it was just a park for festivals, where orchestras played, ladies and gentlemen walked decently along the tracks, and artists performed on the venues.  And at the beginning of the twentieth century began to build attractions for children.  Now almost every year they add some new entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tivoli amusement park copenhagen" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1780296.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Tivoli Park (Copenhagen) spreads over an area of ​​more than eighty square kilometers.  Four million people come here every year.  This is a great place to relax, have fun and take children for a walk.  Perhaps, there aren’t any particularly sophisticated modern attractions here, as in other similar parks like “Disneyland”.  But it looks more like a fairy kingdom.  Therefore, not only tourists, but also residents of Copenhagen and the surrounding area are frequent guests in this garden.  It is interesting that Andersen himself managed to visit here, but the park did not approve.  But Walt Disney thought about building his empire of entertainment just after visiting the “Tivoli”.  The popularity of the park at one time was terribly used by the Nazis who occupied Denmark.  They blew up its southern part as a sign of revenge on the resistance units.  But after the war, all this was successfully restored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park tivoli gardens in copenhagen denmark" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1780303.jpg" width="600"></div>
