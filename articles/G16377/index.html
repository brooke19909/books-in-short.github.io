Let's talk about it in more detail. </p><h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Hotel Corinthia (St. Petersburg) consists of two buildings, both of which have their own interesting history.  The hotel complex itself was opened about twenty-five years ago.  For this new luxury hotel, the masters reconstructed two old houses.  Both of them were built in the first half of the nineteenth century and keep within their walls many secrets of other people's destinies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first building is the brainchild of the famous architect Arthur Lange and overlooks Nevsky Prospect.  Hotel guests write that a similar view opens today from several rooms of the hotel and restaurant, where breakfast is served. </p><p>  The second building was designed by Mikhail Lange for an acting family, whose members have played in theaters of the Northern capital for more than a century and a half.  The owners of the hotel set up a small museum dedicated to this acting dynasty.  Today it is part of a luxury hotel complex and its hallmark. </p><p>  It is interesting that from the first quarter of the last century on the site of the Corinthia Hotel (St. Petersburg) there were several hotel complexes.  Therefore, we can say that, staying here, you can feel the "heartbeat" of the ancient city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelspb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In a hotel" class="if uuid-2560264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2560264.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel complex has almost four hundred rooms.
