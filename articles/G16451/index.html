For this, those who have the desire and ability, try as often as possible to attend various anti-aging treatments, massage sessions, fitness centers and other similar institutions and events.  If we consider Europe, then the Baltic region is one of the regions that is the undisputed leader in the number of tourists visiting it in order to improve their health.  This article will examine the best spa hotels in Estonia and provide detailed information about them. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The founding father of a <span>holiday</span> in Estonia is considered to be a man named Georg Witte.  It was he who in 1813 in <span>the Kadriorg park,</span> located in Tallinn, built a bathing establishment, which, in turn, very quickly gained popularity as a summer vacation destination with the royal family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spa hotels estonia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1453175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Capital highlight </h2><p>  Looking at spa hotels in Estonia, first of all, of course, we will stop our eyes on the capital's institutions.  One of the best in Tallinn is Pirita TOP SPA, which is located on the coast of the sea.  The amenities of this excellent hotel can offer guests the following: </p><ul><li>  Twenty-five meter pool. </li><li>  Two baths. </li><li>  Three Finnish saunas. </li><li>  Infrared bath. </li><li>  Salt chamber. </li><li>  Gym. </li></ul><p>  As for the health and beauty complex, those who wish can visit the SPA-JET hydrodiffusion capsule, Vichy massage shower, use paraffin masks, undergo inhalation, cryotherapy, lie in pearl baths, undergo mud therapy and all types of massage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many tourists from Russia note a good menu in the hotel restaurant.  However, at the same time, a rather large percentage of visitors were also dissatisfied with the spa, because, in their opinion, it remained in terms of its development even in the era of the Soviet Union: poor service, gloomy building design, lack of various amenities that are used modern tourists.  In addition, many guests of the hotel note its large population, which also not everyone liked. </p>

    <h2>  In the neighborhood with Russia </h2><p>  Relatively close to the border with the Russian Federation is "Norus" (spa hotel, Estonia).  According to tourists, this institution has good baths and an excellent menu in the restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel offers tourists: </p><ul><li>  Visit the fitness center Three Apples Spa, equipped with the latest requirements and having competent trainers in the state. </li><li>  Visit the water bath center, equipped with eight saunas, a sports pool, a children's pool, an attraction pool, a jacuzzi, an outdoor terrace, a bar, a salt sauna, an aromatic bath, and Finnish saunas. </li></ul><p>  For lovers of privacy, there is the opportunity to relax in a private recreation area, access to which have people over eighteen years of age. </p><p>  For people who want to undergo anti-aging treatments, the Beauty Center opens its doors, offering a wide variety of massages (traditional, Swedish, with a candle, volcanic stones, Ayurvedic).  In the same center, there is the only multifunctional cabin with Aemotio Spa shower in the whole territory of the Baltic States.  In addition, a 3D rejuvenation procedure is provided, for which the eTwo apparatus of the world famous Israeli company Syneron is used. </p><p>  According to many hotel visitors, they had a double impression of the rest here: on the one hand, the hotel has excellent food and procedures, and on the other, the room for accommodating a child is very small, the service in the restaurant is not always at its best, but in fitness the center does not always work all the simulators. </p>

    <h2>  Meresuu </h2><p>  Meresuu (spa hotel, Estonia) is another one of those centers that will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  <span>Wellness procedures of the center are</span> focused not only on women, but also on men and even children as well.  Here visitors can enjoy facial and body care, enjoy a massage, undergo medical procedures (visit the salt room and <span>infrared bath).</span>  A sunny room and a solarium are also available. </p><p>  For children, a special massage, massage baths with coconut milk, manicure and pedicure are provided. </p><p>  Outside the hotel there is an aquacenter with a bath complex, where you can stay for unlimited time, enjoying relaxation and wellness.  For outdoor enthusiasts, the Meresuu Sports Club opens its doors. </p><p>  In the Meloodia restaurant, you can enjoy a varied menu throughout the day, which can satisfy the taste needs of any gourmet.  Here you can order a romantic dinner or a children's party. </p><p>  If we talk about the reviews of hotel guests, then among them you can find quite harsh statements related to claims regarding the inconsistency of these procedures on the official website of the hotel with their real rendering.  Some tourists claim that individual baths or pools were inoperative.  Also, the poor work of the Internet in the center was noted.  Although in most cases, Meresuu, like all other spa hotels in Estonia, left a good impression on many guests. </p><h2>  Metropolitan center </h2><p>  Listing the spa hotels in Estonia, we note that in the very center of Tallinn, in the immediate vicinity of the parliament building, the Meriton Grand Conference &amp; Spa Hotel is located.  The second floor of the hotel is a spa center, which has developed an extensive program of various wellness services: bath, solarium, massages, baths.  For children it will be a joy to visit the water park, swimming pools, pearl bubble baths. </p><p>  An exclusive feature of the hotel is a two-person massage using red wine and a bathtub filled with white rose petals and cherry blossoms. </p><p>  Studying the reviews of hotel guests, it can be noted that most of them liked the spa, although there are some tourists who did not like the hotel due to not always truthful information provided by the staff.  They do not warn of repairs, malfunctions, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Georg Ots SPA </h2><p>  This hotel, located on the <span>island of Saaremaa,</span> welcomes its guests with various wellness programs that are aimed at restoring the cardiovascular system, metabolism, eliminating diseases of the joints, muscles, gynecological and other ailments.  Here you can use oxygen, mineral baths, massages (regular and using herbal extracts), a jacuzzi.  It goes without saying that physiotherapy cannot be avoided here either: acupuncture, inhalation, wave therapy, ultrasound - all this can be used by hotel guests. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say that spa hotels in Estonia are a significant source of revenue for the state budget, and therefore special attention is paid to their development. </p>
