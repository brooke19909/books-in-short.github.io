The decorative possibilities of this needlework make it possible to make a wide variety of wardrobe details from yarn: clothes and accessories to it. </p><p>  Knitwear is comfortable, practical and elegant.  <span>Knitted clothes are</span> out of fashion - they always attract freedom and unobtrusiveness of voluminous solutions and soft forms.  In addition, thanks to the ability to knit, we can become owners of original and unique things.  Perhaps that is why today many women seek to learn how to knit.  Let's try to learn the basics of this magical art, offering to make out some types of knitting.  Photos of these samples are presented in the article. </p><h2>  Knitting Basics </h2><p>  The basis for the manufacture of knitted fabric is the initial row.  Even the simplest types of knitting needles start with it.  Of the existing methods for looping, consider the most common one.  We put the thread on the index and thumb of the left hand.  Its tail and the end from the ball are located in the middle of the palm and are held by the rest of the fingers.  So that the row is not overly tightened, the set is made on two knitting needles: we put them into the loop at the thumb under the thread draped over the index, grab it and stretch it.  Release your fingers and tighten the loop.  The remaining loops are typed in the same order.  After the set is completed, carefully remove one knitting needle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting: basic elements </h2>

    <p>  The dialed loops consist of the front (on the front side) and back (behind the knitting needles) walls.  Surprisingly, all types of knitting with knitting needles are based on two main loops - the front and the wrong.  Combining their combinations and methods of knitting, get a lot of the most diverse patterns.  Any pattern consists of a repeating part (rapport) and <span>edge loops that</span> are not included in its description.  Edge - this is the first and last loops corresponding in height to two rows, since the first, as a rule, is not knitted, and the latter is made from the inside for convenience. </p><p>  The front loop is knitted as follows: we put the right knitting needle into the loop, grab the thread under the left needle and stretch it onto ourselves.  The new loop remains on the right knitting needle, we discard the remaining knitted from the left knitting needle.  No knitting can do without a front loop.  The reverse side is not inferior to it in significance.  It fits like this: we put the right knitting needle into the loop above the left, grab the thread from the top to the right and pull it away from us.  The front and <span>back loops</span> can be knitted for the back wall located behind the knitting needles, getting new patterns from crossed loops that are very dense.  Nakid is the simplest loop.  It is obtained with one movement of the thread, thrown on the right knitting needle.  We have listed the main loops and methods of knitting them, now we will consider simple types of knitting a knitted fabric. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of knitting: elastic and not very </h2>

    <p>  The simplest elastic viscous is a garter, which is performed only with facial loops and forms a two-sided canvas - the same from the face and the wrong side.  It is the most common and convenient for beginner needlewomen.  Despite the simplicity of the pattern, this simple knitting with needles is quite effective in the performance of blouses, booties, socks and is used quite often. </p><p>  Less elastic and half as thin as the garter is hosiery (or facial) knitting.  This is a one-sided canvas obtained by alternating rows of front and back loops.  Not very elastic, it lends itself well to steaming and perfectly combines with various types of weaves.  Hosiery simple knitting when done in a circle is done only with facial loops.  When knitting loops on the back walls, you can get an elastic hosiery fabric that is more dense than the usual <span>facial surface.</span>  Often, <span>hosiery</span> becomes the basis of a knitwear. </p><h2>  Rubber bands </h2><p>  Alternating front and back loops creates different types of rubber bands or eraser.  When knitting an elastic band 1 x 1, one loop is alternated, in the manufacture of 2 x 2 two by one, etc. The pattern specified from the first row is repeated in each row and continues to the required height according to the figure.  The most prominent and dense are the elastic bands connected by crossed loops.  For example, 1 x 1 gum: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  1st row - 1 front inverted, 1 remove, flip, again put on the left knitting needle and knit the wrong one, etc. </li><li>  The second row and all the rest - from the inside, we knit the crossed inside, the front - crossed front. </li></ul><p>  So you can create other types of gum.  Such types of knitting with needles are less tensile, do not lend themselves to deformation, which increases the quality and durability of the completed eraser.  Hollow elastic can be used as a strap.  It runs like this: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/634392.jpg" width="530"></div>

They look great not only as an eraser, but are also good as the main motive of the product, since this is a rather spectacular large knitting. </p>

    <h2>  Scythe and Aran </h2><p>  Performing simple braids and simple arana is also within the strength of a novice needlewoman.  Usually they are performed with facial loops on the wrong side.  Thus, a large embossment of the knitted fabric is achieved.  To knit braids, the loops are disassembled according to the selected pattern.  Their simple variety is carried out by interweaving two halves.  For example, a braid of 6 loops is knitted as follows: 3 loops are removed on an additional knitting needle and wound up for work, then the next three loops are knitted, then three loops from an additional knitting needle.  The height of each link is determined by the craftswoman.  Having knitted a given number of rows, we twist the braid again.  Similarly, rhombs, wickers, aranas, all kinds of stems and snakes, i.e. all facial fragments on the wrong field, are knitted.  These are quite complex drawings, the implementation of which will require strict adherence to the graphic schemes that can be found in various needlework magazines.  The made braid or intricate curls of author's aran - large knitting, embossed and at the same time elegant, is used in <span>knitting sweaters,</span> cardigans, jumpers or vests. </p><h2>  Openwork patterns </h2><p>  Special attention from needlewomen always enjoyed openwork knitting.  Graceful and incredibly beautiful patterns are based on mathematically accurate calculation.  Of course, it is difficult for a novice master to cope with knitting a weightless openwork shawl.  But to decorate the bottom or sleeves of the product with a simple pattern - it is quite possible to have flowers from 6 nakida in a circle. </p><p>  Openwork knitting is a complex technique, which consists in the fact that each decrease in crochet is necessarily contrasted with one decrease.  As a rule, it is carried out by knitting two loops into one to maintain the same amount in the canvas.  For beginners, for practice, you can knit a small scarf or tippet with a simple openwork pattern.  For example, we make a crochet, we knit two loops of one, 3 front, etc. The wrong row is performed with the wrong loops. </p>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Types of knitting with needles, the schemes of which are presented in the article, are different in texture and methods of execution, but all will require patience and endurance.  The apparent simplicity and even ease of this craft are deceptive.  To learn how to knit beautifully, you should make a lot of effort.  True, they will be rewarded a hundredfold, because the possession of a unique wardrobe, created with one's own hand, very raises self-esteem and causes some envy of friends. </p>
