Why?  In fact, there are plenty of prerequisites for this.  First of all, one cannot fail to note the fact that this place has an excellent transport interchange, and secondly, the sights located at the top, for example, the Redan Museum, the Wonder Island amusement park and the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, cannot but attract attention. <strong></strong></p>

    <h2>  <strong>"Old village".</strong>  <strong>Metro.</strong>  <strong>general description</strong> </h2><p>  Almost everyone who is interested in the Northern capital knows that the Staraya Derevnya metro station belongs to the St. Petersburg metro, namely to the Frunze-Primorsky line.  On one side of the station is Komendantsky Prospekt, but on the other, Krestovsky Ostrov. </p><p>  By the way, it should be noted that the address of the metro station "Staraya Derevnya" was not always that way.  Literally until March 7, 2009, it belonged to a completely different line, Right-Bank. </p><p>  The "Old Village" is a deep-laying station and is located at a depth of 61 meters.  Architecturally, this metro has one arch.  This is the last station in the <span>St. Petersburg metro,</span> belonging to the single-vault type.  Designed the "Old Village" by V. N. Shcherbin and I.P.  Macayuda. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Few people know that the station also has a reversible dead end, in which trains are at night, in addition, it has a VET. </p><h2>  <strong>"Old village".</strong>  <strong>Metro.</strong>  <strong>Construction history</strong> </h2><p>  The facility was commissioned relatively recently, on January 14, 1999.  The name was chosen quite simply: the stations gave a name in honor of the historical district of the same name.  Initially, according to the project, it was planned to be called "Sestroretskaya". </p>

    <p>  At the moment, the outer balcony of the lobby is faced with granite.  If you delve into the recent history, it will become known that he used to go to the trolleybus ring, but in 1999 he was fenced off from the stop by stalls.  The rows of stalls were removed in 2007, but soon the balcony was closed and a shopping center began to be built into the pavilion, in which bookstores and flower shops were placed in 2008. </p><h2>  <strong>"Old village".</strong>  <strong>Metro.</strong>  <strong>Station features</strong> </h2>
