    <h2>  What do you need? </h2><p>  What could be a postcard for a war veteran?  There are quite a few options.  However, it is worth remembering that there is a certain symbolism that will help distinguish this holiday from everyone else.  First of all, these are flowers, namely red carnations.  It is customary to give them to our liberators, therefore this flower may be present on the card.  Also appropriate would be the St. George's black and orange ribbon, which is considered a traditional symbol of courage.  Necessarily, as a sign of Victory, a red <span>five-pointed star</span> should be on the card <span>.</span>  You can still draw a salute that invariably accompanies the Victory Day over <span>Nazi Germany.</span>  You can also specify the date of Victory Day - May 9, 1945.  As for the card itself, it can be a regular rectangular, drop-down or just double-sided.  A great idea is a greeting card to a veteran, carved in the <span>shape of a triangle.</span>  This is also a special sign of wartime, because then the letters from the front-line soldiers came simply folded into a triangle, without stamps and an envelope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Method 1. Standard </h2><p>  A handmade postcard for a veteran can be of the usual standard form, i.e.  just double-sided.  On the one hand there will be just a drawing, on the other - a written congratulation.  So, you can draw a bouquet of carnations, a red five-pointed star and write: "Happy Victory Day!"  or ‚ÄúThank you for the Victory!‚Äù.  The background will also predominantly be red, but it may also be orange.  You can also draw a St. George ribbon, on which orange and black stripes will alternate. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="postcard to a war veteran" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/399794.jpg" width="515"></div></h2><h2>  Method 2. Quilling </h2><p>  You can make greeting cards out of paper with your own hands in the form of a drop-down book, i.e.  consisting of two pages.  You can try to decorate the cover <span>using the quilling technique</span> (artful torsion), this is a fairly new, but interesting idea.  So, a postcard can be made completely using this technique, which will somewhat complicate the work, or partially.  You can just wind a bunch of flowers, and draw everything else or make it in the <span>form of an application.</span>  Be sure to remember that in addition to flowers on the card there should also be symbolism, which is important and dear to the veteran. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself postcard to a veteran" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/399797.jpg" width="324"></div></h2><h2>  Method 3. Applications </h2><p>  What else could be a postcard to a veteran?  You can create it with your own hands in the application technique.  You will need corrugated paper, plain colored paper, scissors and glue.  From corrugated paper you will need to make a bouquet of carnations.  It is enough just to take a narrow strip of paper (about 10 cm long and 3-4 wide), beautifully fold it as if into a bud, and slightly bend the edges.  Next, with scissors, you need to cut the top of the paper throughout the flower to make it fluffy.  For a bouquet you need to do 3-5 flowers.  Next, from ordinary paper you need to make a leg and flower petals.  Also cut the inscription "Happy Victory Day!"  and glue a small red five-pointed star in the corner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Method 4.

    <p>  You can do it yourself in a somewhat non-standard way to make a postcard to a veteran.  To do this, you will need an unnecessary computer disk, red corrugated paper, plain colored paper and superglue.  The disk in this version will act as the basis on which everything else will be mounted.  On the title side will be placed the number 9, made in the form of a swirling St. George ribbon.  You can cut it out of colored paper, or you can simply draw plain white paper with colored pencils and wrap it in the form of a nine.  From corrugated paper you need to make one large clove according to the same principle as described in the third method (however, the width and length of a piece of paper for a flower can be much larger, and the flower will turn out to be of impressive size).  It is mounted on the right, a little lower from the nine.  From colored paper, you can make two leaflets that are attached on the sides of the clove.  All this needs to be put on a disk with the help of superglue, which will perfectly grasp such fundamentally different in nature.  It remains only on an orange paper circle (to fit the disk) to write a congratulation and glue it carefully.  That's all, an original and very nice postcard to the veteran, created with his own hands, is ready. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper cards" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/399793.jpg" width="429"></div></h2><h2>  Text </h2><p>  What else is important to take care of?  What else do you need to make an excellent postcard for a veteran?  Drawing is, of course, important, but words that will be written and addressed to a specific person have a more serious meaning and power.  If the person who creates the gift does not know exactly to whom the card will be presented, i.e.  He doesn‚Äôt know the name of the front-line soldier, in this case you can apply more universally, for example, ‚ÄúOur dear veteran!‚Äù.  Next, you must definitely thank the person for helping to restore justice and peace in the territory of our country.  You can do this in different ways, using different words and their number.  Further, it is very important to write a few words of wishes to this person.  Veterans are people of mature age, they definitely need to wish health, happiness, peace can be desired, these people know the value of this word.  When all the main things are said, you can write a small poem or a song on a military theme in a postcard, it will be very nice for a veteran.  Well, in the end you need to subscribe.  You can write your name and surname, but you can express gratitude from the whole team, class and even the city. </p>
