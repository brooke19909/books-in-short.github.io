  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An operational day is part of the working day of a banking institution. Bank working hours</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>During the day, banks and other organizations (members of the payment system) accept documents for payment and transfer of funds.</span>  During this period, operations can be completed without delay.  All actions taken should be reflected in the accounting for off-balance and balance accounts through the preparation of a daily report.  The operational day is the period during which there is a transition from one financial condition recorded in accounting to another.  This is part of the working day of a financial institution, which is allocated for the provision of services to customers and is associated with the reception, execution, control of accounting documents of the bank and customers, their reflection in accounting, completion of information processing and the formation of a daily balance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="syaria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="billing day" class="if uuid-3128086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128086.jpg"></div><h2>  Operating time </h2><p>  Operational time is the period during which bank employees make banking operations and other transactions.  Also under this concept is the time of workflow and information processing.  The duration of the operating time in most cases is determined based on the operating mode of the bank. </p><h2>  What is a trading day in simple words </h2><p>  How can I convey the essence of this concept in simple words?  Most often, a business day means a business day of the bank plus the time required to complete the basic procedures.  In most organizations, this period is pretty standard - from 9 to 18 pm.  But for some actions (for example, currency exchange), it is limited to 9-15 hours of the day.  The start and end time of a banking day is set by the bank management.  All information is necessarily communicated to customers.  If a person comes to the company after the end of the trading day, then the transaction or transfer he needs will be carried out only on the next day (if he is a worker). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.izvestiaur.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Day" class="if uuid-3128098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128098.jpg"></div><h2>  The beginning of the day </h2><p>  The start and end time of a business day in a bank is established by order or order of the head of a financial institution.  In the first working hours, the chief or his deputy gives the employees keys that allow them to perform various operations.  Then the bank employees prepare their jobs: receive cash, put their signatures in the control book, connect and start up the necessary technical equipment. </p><h2>  Daily Balance Dates </h2><p>  The daily balance is up to 12 hours of the next business day.  The consolidated balance sheet must be made up to 12 hours on the same day after processing the balance of operations performed.  All documentation received during operating hours is subject to execution and reflection on accounts on the same day.  The same operations that came to be executed after its completion are carried out the next day. </p><h2>  The end of the day </h2><p>  The end of the trading day in the bank is characterized by the following operations: </p><ol><li>  Issuance of all necessary reports (daily, monthly, ten-day, quarterly reports). </li><li>  Conducting relevant documentation in payment. </li><li>  Fixing the state of the infobase, creating a copy of it, transferring it to the server. <div class="photo" data-original="www.newyorkfed.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="operating day sberbank" class="if uuid-3128083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128083.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Postoperative time - what is it? </h2><p>  Postoperative time is considered the period from the end of the operational banking day and customer service until the end of the working hours of the bank branch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All banking organizations have their own cash settlement time intended for servicing.  For example, a payment day at Sberbank lasts exactly as long as the functioning of electronic systems continues.  For any customers today, certain service schedules can be set.  And for those who use payment systems, transactions are carried out round the clock. </p><p>  According to the regulations, Sberbank processes payments executed in accordance with established standards.  In particular, payment transactions are carried out on business days, excluding holidays or weekends.  Not everyone knows how long an operating day is at Sberbank, so they often find themselves in a difficult position.  To avoid this, you need to know in advance the working hours in a particular department. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kathmandupost.ekantipur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="operational banking day" class="if uuid-3128096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128096.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms for processing payment receipts at Sberbank </h2><p>  The internal rules of a banking organization set certain deadlines for processing payment orders: </p><ul><li>  In paper form - from 9:00 to 15:00. </li><li>  In electronic format - from 09:00 to 17:00.  On pre-holiday days and on Fridays, processing is carried out from 09:00 to 16:00. </li></ul><p>  All instructions regarding the processing of payments are carried out within 2 days after receipt of the documentation at the bank. </p><p>  It should be noted that the payment banking day at Sberbank is the time period during which the institution can operate.  The moment of opening the electronic payment system marks the beginning of the day.  As soon as the systems are completed, the bank‚Äôs payment business day also ceases.  During this period of time, various transactions may occur that fall within the competence of this financial institution. </p><h2>  Features of processing urgent payments </h2><p>  Such transactions may be considered by a banking institution for a certain period.  Payments with the status of ‚Äúurgent payment‚Äù are considered instantly by the financial institution Sberbank.  They can be carried out even in cases when the trading day has come to an end, in accordance with the established list of currencies and with a limit on the amount on the bank client's account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecorner.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banking day" class="if uuid-3128087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128087.jpg"></div><h2>  Corporate Exception </h2><p>  It should also be borne in mind that Sberbank introduced some innovations for corporate clients and offered them special payment processing times.  Thanks to this system, people can significantly expand their work time.  Those customers who exchange certain financial documents through the Sberbank Business Online system have the opportunity to conduct such operations from 07:00 to 23:00.  In addition, corporate clients have the right to do this on weekends and on holidays, which is very convenient. </p><p>  Many corporations also offer individual working hours for each client.  But the longer the operating day, the more expensive the cost of services. </p><p>  Thus, the introduction of new information technologies makes it possible to put the business on stream, thereby expanding the economic borders. </p>
