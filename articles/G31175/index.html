What to do in such cases?  How to sew a hole in such a way that no one is puzzled that you continue to walk in such clothes?  You will find many non-standard solutions with photos, as well as tips for darning manually and on a sewing machine in this article. </p><h2>  How to sew a hole manually </h2><p>  If it is necessary to sew a gap on clothing, then in the vast majority of cases this can be done with a needle and thread.  Just pick up the threads in the tone of the fabric and from the back side connect the two sides of the product, stretching the fabric as little as possible to prevent creases.  Now sew the torn place along one line with a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam. </p><p>  If a piece of fabric is not enough at the place of the hole, then it is better to patch this place and not think about how to sew the hole.  It looks interesting when the patch is sewn as if specially inaccurately, with large stitches, and the fabric was taken in a contrasting color.  Such a detail will look good on shirts and denim jackets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.familyeverafterblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a hole in jeans" class="if uuid-2381242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2381242.jpg"></div><p>  If you are thinking about how to sew a hole on a knitted product, then you can pick up yarn to match the item of clothing, insert the thread into a thick needle designed to sew parts of the knitted product together, and gently pick up loops to patch the gap.  You can try to imitate knitting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.home-ec101.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a sock" class="if uuid-2381244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2381244.jpg"></div><h2>  How to darn a hole with a sewing machine </h2><p>  If a hole has appeared in the place to which it is possible to get close with the help of a sewing machine, then you can darn it.  To do this, put the machine in the "zigzag" mode and take the threads to match the product.  Now sew a hole from its beginning to the end without deforming the thing, otherwise wrinkles may go in this place.  Continue to darn, stitching from edge to edge and back until a new fabric of thread forms in the hole.  It should be pretty tight.  This method is best suited for darning plain dark trousers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing machine" class="if uuid-2381257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2381257.jpg"></div><h2>  Hole Appliques </h2><p>  An excellent solution when you set out to understand how to sew a hole, is gluing applications on it.  This method will not only hide a hole on clothes, but also can perfectly refresh a thing.  Especially relevant this method will look on children's clothing.  For example, on a torn knee, you can stick ready-made thermal stickers, which are sold in a wide variety in stores with sewing goods.  You can also make such applications yourself: inserts from contrasting fabric look interesting on the elbows and knees.  Faux leather inserts can also be sewn onto the elbows of a sweater or jacket. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wikitalks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patches for knitted sweater" class="if uuid-2381265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2381265.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew a hole in the seam </h2><p>  The simplest case when the question is how to sew a gap is the appearance of a gap at the seam.  In order to sew it, you need to connect the two sides from the wrong side and repeat the line, strictly continuing the line that goes along this seam.  To connect the sides together it was easier and they were more even, you can iron the torn place.  It is necessary to start sewing up a little earlier than the hole begins, and to finish a little further.  This is done so that the thread does not open and the slot is not formed again.  If you sew by hand, then use the sewing <span>‚Äúwith the needle forward‚Äù,</span> and using the sewing machine, select the mode that is most similar to the rest of the stitch.  When the thing has spread on the front side of the product, you must repeat the line, choosing the size of the stitches as much as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabric.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a hole in the seam" class="if uuid-2381240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2381240.jpg"></div><h2>  Darn holes in knitwear </h2><p>  Knitwear is a very moody material.  It can easily dissolve in place of the hole, like a pantyhose capron, if not made very high quality.  Because of this feature, you need to be as careful with it as possible and try to sew up the hole as soon as possible.  If the so-called arrows went along the fabric, then they also need to be fixed with a thread.  If you still have questions about how to sew a hole on a knitwear, then you need to know that on this soft fabric very often, in addition to the arrows, wrinkles and wrinkles from the seam remain, so it is best to glue the hole on the back of the product with an adhesive web, which is sold in sewing stores for gluing two parts when sewing.  And on top of all this stick an application. </p><p>  Knitwear often wears on the elbows or knees, around the holes that appeared in these places, very thin, disheveled fabric.  It is better to strengthen the stitching place by applying a patch on the inside and stitching a torn place several times with a piece of fabric on the machine. </p><h2>  How to hide a seam </h2><p>  If you have already figured out how to sew a hole, then perhaps you have a question how to hide a seam.  You can use the advice given above and stick the thermal sticker in place of the hole.  If the seam is small, then it can be masked with beads.  A brooch worn on this place will also be a good solution, if the location of the seam allows this.  You can do embroidery with your own hands to hide the ugly place of the seam.  In order to make it more convenient, you need to insert the product into the embroidery frame and tightly stretch the fabric.  Cross stitch will look very interesting on a blouse.  Especially if the thing itself is made in ethnic style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pantsvillepress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hole embroidery" class="if uuid-2381249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2381249.jpg"></div><p>  If your sewing machine has an embroidery mode, then it's time to use it!  Such actions will add a twist to the thing, and, perhaps, wearing it will become even more pleasant than before the tear appears. </p><p>  Thus, you learned not only how to carefully sew a hole, but also how to hide a place from the seam, and also got acquainted with various darn methods.  Now a favorite thing can be saved from the fate of being sent to the cottage or become thrown out. </p>
