The food is also on the level - for some tourists the menu seems a little monotonous, but the food is always fresh, and enough fruit is served.  By the way, the bar prepares wonderful cocktails, and the bartenders and waiters here are very polite, pleasant and smiling.  Many hotel staff understand Russian well, which makes communication easier. </p><p>  The advantages include proximity to the beach, as well as a sufficient amount of entertainment on the territory of the hotel itself.  People here really have a good time, not worrying about various household trifles.  Tourists recommend hotel Richmond Ephesus Resort 5 *.  Kusadasi (Turkey) is an ideal place for a perfect vacation, memories of which will remain with you for life. </p>
