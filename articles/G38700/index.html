The difference of the application is that it is completely made with your own hands. </p><p>  This contributes to the comprehensive development of the child, knowledge of the world.  In the process of making an application, proteins can give a child information about this animal, its environment and nutritional characteristics.  You can turn a fun and entertaining creation of an application with your own hands into a simple, but interesting lesson. </p><h2>  What is applique? </h2><p>  A similar product is a picture made up of various pieces, the materials for which can be selected the most diverse.  Applications are made not only by children, but also by adults, since this type of work is often used in decorative and applied art.  They can be flat, made of paper or cardboard.  And they can be convex, from natural materials, beads or other materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application squirrel with nut" class="if uuid-3000599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3000599.jpg"></div><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  You can choose anything to do the job.  We will consider several options for making protein applications.  For the simplest you will need the following materials: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Colored paper. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Blue or green cardboard. </li><li>  Stencils. </li></ul><p>  The next option we will consider a squirrel from the leaves.  The application will be more complex and require more materials.  For her they will need: </p><ul><li>  Leaves, approximately the same in color (oak, birch, mountain ash). </li><li>  Thick cardboard. </li><li>  Super glue. </li><li>  Several rowan berries. </li></ul><p>  And the last, most difficult option is the application of the squirrel with the nut.  It will be voluminous.  It will require such materials: </p><ul><li>  Colored paper. </li><li>  Acorn. </li><li>  Thick cardboard. </li><li>  Super glue. </li><li>  Ribbon of any color. </li><li>  Leaves, if desired. </li></ul><p>  Now you can start creating our applique. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  We start manufacturing with the simplest option.  You need to prepare all the necessary materials and follow the instructions. </p><ol><li>  Take colored paper of the colors you like.  You can use pre-made stencils or cut out shapes of any size.  For the body of the squirrel, you need to cut a triangle.  For the head - a circle.  For the ears - small triangles.  For the tail - an oval.  Eyes and nose should be made small, from black paper.  If desired, you can cut clouds, sun, mushrooms or trees. </li><li>  Further, all the details need to be gradually glued to a sheet of thick cardboard.  It is advisable not to stick paper parts with liquid glue, it is best to take glue stick. </li><li>  Allow the product to dry. </li></ol><p>  Done! </p><div class="photo" data-original="happythought.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper squirrel stencil" class="if uuid-3000603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3000603.jpg"></div><p>  Applying squirrels from the leaves will be a little more difficult, as the leaves may crack or stick poorly.  To avoid such problems, you need to use super-glue.  Before do-it-yourself leaves do not need to be dried, otherwise they will crack very much.  The step-by-step instruction will be as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Lay out the collected leaves in front of you.  For the body of the squirrel, we will use a birch leaf, it should be larger than the rest.  For the tail, it is better to take an oak leaf, it will give the effect of fluffiness.  All paws will look organically if they use mountain ash leaves.  Squirrel eyes can be made from rowan berries. </li><li>  Next, you need to start gluing the leaves to thick cardboard.  They need to be glued only in the center, so that other parts of the body of the squirrel can be placed below. </li><li>  Next, you need to give the product enough time to dry. </li></ol><p>  The product can be considered finished! </p><div class="photo" data-original="mommysbabylove.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leaf applique" class="if uuid-3000620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3000620.jpg"></div><p>  The most difficult option will be the production of protein applications with volumetric parts.  For such a product, you will need to perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Cut out the body parts of the squirrel from paper. </li><li>  Glue them on thick cardboard. </li><li>  In the paws of the animal you need to glue the acorn.  To do this, use the "Moment" glue. </li><li>  From the ribbon you need to make a bow for the squirrel's neck.  With the help of rhinestones, beads and natural materials, you can decorate the resulting protein.  Volume application will turn out to be very beautiful and interesting. </li></ol><p>  Work on the product is completed! </p><h2>  Interesting ideas </h2><p>  As unusual options, you can consider the following ideas: </p><ul><li>  Squirrel application enclosed inside a large sheet.  On the street in the autumn, you can find a beautiful and large maple leaf.  Inside it you need to glue a circle of cardboard.  The squirrel itself will be in this circle.  A paper application will look much more interesting if you design it this way. </li><li>  Squirrel with a voluminous tail.  For such a product, you will need to use brown or orange paper, which should be cut into long strips of 2 centimeters.  These strips are glued with the ends to each other.  It turns out a beautiful volume. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Squirrel with acorns" class="if uuid-3000615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/3000615.jpg"></div><p>  You can use your imagination and create your own unique and original applications. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  To make the product beautiful, you need: </p><ul><li>  neatly cut parts; </li><li>  Do not use liquid glue (it will only warp tissue paper); </li><li>  stick volumetric parts onto super-glue. </li></ul><p>  Before gluing all the details, you need to try them on a cardboard sheet in advance.  If something looks messy or unnatural, then it's better to fix it in advance. </p>
