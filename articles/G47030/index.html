Bali is an island that is part of this state.  Here the tourist infrastructure is most developed.  And the island itself amazes with its beautiful pristine nature, lush greenery of the jungle, Gunung-Batur, Agung and Kintamini volcanoes, ancient temples and endless snow-white beaches.  Many tourists claim that Bali is just a relaxing, relaxing vacation in the Bounty advertising style.  But if you have ‚Äúparadise pleasure‚Äù - excursions and new experiences, do not rush to put an end to this island.  There is something to see.  Bali is good because it offers different categories of tourists what they want.  Here you can feel yourself on the edge of the earth, far from civilization, where time flows slowly, but you can find yourself in the epicenter of bright events.  It depends on the resort.  And our article is designed to help you make the right choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali indonesia" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When to go </h2><p>  Now a few words about when it is best to go on vacation.  Indonesia (Bali in particular) is experiencing a tourist boom in the summer months as well as in September.  The peak season occurs between Catholic Christmas (December 25) and Three Kings Day (January 6).  Prices soar by a third during these periods.  Therefore, experienced tourists are advised to go to Bali in the winter, but not on the holidays mentioned above.  Reviews say that the weather on this island paradise is good at any time of the year.  Even if the tour operator scares you with the words "rainy season" (November - March), do not believe it.  A couple of drops in the evening or night rain lasting ten minutes is not a reason to refuse to travel at a time of low prices.  You need to go for at least two weeks.  A long flight and acclimatization require a longer rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali Indonesia Hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701025.jpg" width="600"></div>

The flight in this case will take twelve hours.  As for other cities of Russia, airplanes from Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg (Nordwind Airlines) and Vladivostok fly in this direction.  But tickets for such non-stop aircraft are too expensive.  Charters fly in this direction only during the New Year and Christmas holidays.  Therefore, reviews advise using the services of other companies - Singaporean, Turkish, Thai Airlines or Air Asia.  But then you will need to land at other <span>airports.</span>  <span>Bali</span> (Indonesia) has only one air gate.  This is Ngurah Rai Airport, thirteen kilometers from the island's capital, Denpasar.  The hub ranks second in the country in terms of congestion, and so now the construction of the second air gate is underway at the northern tip of Bali. </p><h2>  How to get from the airport to the resort </h2><p>  How to get around Bali (Indonesia)?  The reviews claim that due to the small size of the island, even a taxi ride from the airport to your resort will not empty your pockets.  Direct carrier parking is located in front of the terminal.  At the counter you need to name your destination and pay for the trip.  There are many hotels in the resorts, the price of which includes a transfer from the airport.  Also, from the building of the international terminal, a city bus runs to the capital of the island of Denpasar.  You can buy a ticket for it in the airport building.  By the way, in the capital itself it is most convenient to travel in excursion horse-drawn carriages ‚ÄúDokar‚Äù.  Also in Denpasar Bemo shuttle buses ply.  The final stops on them are indicated in Latin letters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Airports bali indonesia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701075.jpg"></div>

This differs from other tourist countries in Indonesia (Bali).  Tour packages offered by tour operators can be focused on total relaxation in Ubud or Sanur.  Or, conversely, on an excursion-rich program in the north of the island.  You can go on a honeymoon to the elite resort of Nusa Dua or enjoy spa treatments in the thermal springs of Banjar.  Young people choose Kuta, experienced and novice divers - Chandidasu, surfers - Uluwatu.  In addition, according to reviews, there are still tours dedicated to any events, for example, to the Galungan festival.  Tourists advise combining their holidays in such a way as to recharge first with excursions and impressions, and then ‚Äúdigest‚Äù all this, lying in a deck chair and enjoying relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Indonesia bali prices" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701062.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels Indonesia, Bali </h2><p>  On the island there are all the famous world chain hotels.  The starry level in them is usually ‚Äúfour‚Äù or ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  It will be more difficult to find a treshka.  Budget hostels are available in the capital Denpasar and resorts, which position themselves as youth vacation spots (for example, Kuta).  There is no shortage of so-called boutique hotels.  They are small, with dozens of rooms, but the level of service in them corresponds to the ‚Äú5 * Lux‚Äù class.  Private villas are also in great demand.  Reviews mention that in the summer, when Indonesia and Bali become a favorite vacation destination, prices just soar, and finding affordable housing becomes problematic.  Therefore, you need to book a hotel room in advance.  Tourists give good recommendations to the Alila 5 * hotel in Ubud (11,500 p.), Ayana Resort and Spa 5 * in Jimbaran (15,000 p.).  A worthy Quartet is D&amp;G Villas by Premier Hospitality Asia in Nusa Dua (11,000 p.).  Of the "treshki" praise Bali Reef Resort in Benoa (6000 p.).  The price range of private villas is very wide.  It can be both palaces for several thousand euros per day, and bungalows on the shore for 10 EUR per night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Indonesia Bali" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The specifics of the resorts: a relaxing beach holiday </h2><p>  Indonesia, Bali are famous for this.  The cleanest sand, quiet warm lagoons - more than enough of all this on the island.  If you are traveling to Bali over the sea and the beach, choose any resort.  In this regard, they differ only in prices.  Nusa Dua and Seminyak have many luxury hotels (Grand Hiyatt, Melia).  There are also hotels working on the all-inclusive concept.  Jimbaran - the same beach pleasures at a lower price.  Legian is an ideal compromise of price and quality.  In Sanur, Ubud and Chandidas a wide selection of hotels of different classes.  A special feature here is the rest, which can be described as a "paradise in a hut."  Newlyweds all over the world dream of spending their honeymoon here.  The huts, however, seem to be huts on stilts above the water only at first glance.  They have everything that your heart desires.  And attendants are accustomed to be invisible if necessary.  The bungalows are set so that guests do not see or hear their neighbors and feel like Adam and Eve in the midst of <span>paradise Eden.</span>  These hotels are famous for Uluwatu, Amed and the resorts of western Bali. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali indonesia reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701056.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  The most party place on the island is the resort of Kuta.  There the fun lasts a day and night.  Pretty noisy and Ubud.  There are frequent winds, and therefore surf lovers rush to this resort.  But in Nusa Dua it is good to come with children.  Low tide, which lasts from 10.00 to 16.00, makes the sea so shallow that you can not worry about the baby.  Divers will be bored there.  To admire the colorful inhabitants of the coral reefs, reviews recommend going to Sanur, Jimbaran or small islands.  Indonesia (Bali in particular) has many nameless rocks, the foot of which are a mysterious underwater world with caves and grottoes.  Excursions are organized to them.  But around Bali there are at least three islands (they are called nusa here), on which you can live.  These are Penida, Lembongan and Ceningan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Indonesia bali package tours" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/701059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Indonesia, Bali: what to see, try, bring </h2><p>  You need to visit the Kanggu area to get acquainted with the exotic traditional village life of the locals.  In the capital of the island you must visit the temple of Pura Maospahit 14th century.  The oldest sacred building in Bali is Blandjong.  This temple is located south of Sanur.  From ‚Äúmast tray‚Äù it is simply necessary to try soto ayam - chicken soup, various varieties of rice with additives and noodles.  Reviews praise nasi goreng, bakso, and my goreng dishes.  Tourists are advised to dine in inexpensive restaurants on the street, which are called varungs here.  From souvenirs, they usually bring home jewelry made of black pearls, inlaid with mother-of-pearl caskets, figurines of ebony or sandalwood, fabric. </p>
