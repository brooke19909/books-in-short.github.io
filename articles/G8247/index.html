However, they are not affordable for everyone.  It's no secret that West European resorts are much more expensive than Turkish or Bulgarian.  Yes, and 3 * hotels here are fundamentally different from those that can be found in Turkey and Egypt.  The list of services in Spanish hotels 3 * is not at all large.  These are typical economy hotels with the type of food “BB” or “Half Board”.  However, the staff in them is well trained and performs their work clearly and responsibly.  So, for those who want to relax in Spain, but at the same time want to save on accommodation, the best option is to use the Roulette Costa Dorada 3 * system.  What does it mean?  We suggest you read in the next section. </p>

    <h2>  What is the Roll system? </h2><p>  Surely many of you have heard about this type of booking as a “Fortune”.  The principle of "Roll" is the same as in the case of "Fortune".  Let’s try to explain its principle to you: tourists choose the country where they want to go, the resort where they want to relax, the <span>type of food</span> and the starryness of the hotel.  The travel agency with which they work draws up documents, book flights, etc. However, tourists will find out which hotel they have to rest in, at best, two days before departure to the country or only after arrival.  That is why this type of reservation is called “roulette”, and in the case when accommodation is in a three-star hotel, then Roulette 3 *.  After arriving at the destination, tourists are met by the representative of the travel agency or operator and escorted to the desired hotel.  As you know, tourists may be lucky, but maybe not.  In this case, they have the right to ask to change the hotel, but for a fee. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Roulette Costa Dorada 3 * hotels: location </h2><p>  As already noted, tourists use the Roulette system because they want to save money.  The price of tours to three-star Costa Doroado hotels is 18,000-20000 rubles. </p><p>  The cost is also affected by the season selected for the trip.  Among budget hotels, there are those that belong to the global hotel brands, and if you come across one of them, then there will certainly be no problems. </p><p>  In Costa Dorada, good “treshki” are Comarruga, Portaventura Golf, Pacha La Pineda and others.  Next to them is the magnificent Aquapolis water park.  In addition, tourists can have fun visiting the <span>Dancing Fountain</span> show <span>,</span> Port Aventura, etc. By the way, from Reus airport to the resort is only 10 minutes drive.  And if you go to Spain using the Roulette Costa Brava Hotels 3 * reservation system, you will need to fly to the Girona Airport, located 25 kilometers from the Costa Brava resort. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  In <span>hotels, three stars of</span> Spain, almost all rooms belong to the category of “standard”: “twins” or “single”.  They are either double beds or two single beds.  An extra bed can be added upon request.  There are also family rooms, these are all the same standard, only they consist of two “standard twin”, between which there is a door.  The rooms have all the amenities, but some of them, such as safes, Internet, minibar and others, are provided for a fee.  It is in these rooms that those who buy tours according to the Roulette Costa Dorada 3 * system have to live. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Apartamentos Bolero </h2><p>  Most 3 * hotels in the Costa Dorado resort were built in the late 80s of the last century.  At one time they were considered the best on the entire Spanish coast.  However, over time, they are outdated, and no reconstruction can fit them to the level of 5 *.  Nevertheless, they are very comfortable and convenient for relaxing unpretentious tourists.  A typical representative of this class of hotels is Apartamentos Bolero.  As you may have guessed, this is an apparatus hotel, the rooms of which are distinguished by the fact that they have kitchen corners that create the impression of an apartment (apartment). </p><p>  “Bolero”, like other similar hotels, is located not on the first line, but in a small distance, 300 meters from the beach.  On the territory there are both children's and adult pools, playgrounds, restaurants and bars, a fitness center, etc. Unlike the 5 * Ol Inkusiv hotels, the use of some services is chargeable.  Of course, we are not talking about a pool or fitness equipment.  So, by choosing the Roulette Costa Dorada 3 * system, you, of course, save on buying a tour.  However, you will pay extra for a lot.  As for the beaches, in Spain almost all of them are municipal, which means that they have free entrance, that is, free of charge.  But you can use beach equipment and amenities, up to the toilet and shower, if you pay for them.  But here everything is in perfect order.  Not to mention the amazing beauty of the beach. </p>

    <h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  There are times when tourists do not like the Fortuna hotel provided to them.  Then they either have to come to terms and be content with the beauty of nature, which is more than enough in these parts, or pay for the transfer to another hotel and, if necessary, pay the difference in price.  Many tourists find the Roll system fun.  If you are a completely democratic person, moderately demanding and not too whimsical, then the <span>type of booking</span> "Roulette Hotel 3" will certainly suit you.  But those tourists for whom comfort is very important may be unhappy.  However, one must not forget that a three-star European hotel cannot be serviced in the same way as a de-class hotel. </p>
