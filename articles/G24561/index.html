  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knit socks - is it easy?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hand-made warm <span>wool socks will</span> certainly be a very pleasant and touching gift to any loved one, and will not leave anyone indifferent.  For a long time, knitting socks and slippers, scarves and hats has been considered a demonstration of love and care, and socks in this regard are especially good, because they are always made the most comfortable, the warmest and the most fluffy ones, able to protect from winter cold and inclement weather.  Be sure to have such a child, because children have imperfect thermoregulation, and therefore for warming the kids requires outside help.  The best cold protection is knitted wool socks. </p><p>  <span>Knitting socks with knitting needles</span> has always been a popular pastime, and interest in him has not faded until now.  Women love to create beautiful and comfortable things with their own hands, and the desire for originality allows you to constantly be born with more and more new knitting patterns and patterns.  There are many technologies of this complex business.  Many people prefer knitting socks with two knitting needles, and most of the craftswomen prefer options based on the use of sectional elastic, the calcaneal bottom, consisting of three parts, and the ribbon toe. </p><p>  For those who have embarked on the knitting path for the first or one of the first time, you can give some tips.  After all, knitting socks with knitting needles is not the easiest process.  Firstly, if you have only recently taken up knitting needles and yarn, and therefore have no idea about how to perform a heel of a sock, you should first pay attention to models without a heel.  They are performed by a straight pipe, which is an order of magnitude easier than tying the <span>heel of the toe.</span>  Secondly, in this case, it is best to select threads from one hundred percent wool or, in extreme cases, containing wool.  It is possible to use the thread remaining after your other knits, even the smallest.  The main thing is that they be of the same quality and thickness.  Thirdly, in the event that knitting patterns with multi-colored threads is not yet successful or too difficult, you can create socks with knitting needles simply with multi-colored stripes of various widths.  They will come out no less cute than socks with complex patterns.  There are also various methods of imitation, for example, imitation of jacquard (knitting patterns with multi-colored threads), when a single-color fabric is made, on which later stitches of the required color are applied over the corresponding loops in the pattern, creating an imitation of colored loops. </p><p>  Creating your own knitting patterns is not only possible, but also necessary.  Individuality and originality have never been out of fashion.  However, if you still do not know how to think through your own crafts, use the ready-made schemes and model options.  Among them are sometimes truly remarkable, for example, models of socks with an openwork pattern.  A classic option is the model with multi-colored patterns, which many consider the most comfortable of thick winter socks.  Do not forget to carefully select the yarn.  Many call the best yarn the one whose composition is approximately the following: seventy-five percent of natural sheep‚Äôs wool, eighteen percent of polyamide, seven percent of polyacrylic.  However, preference for any yarn should be given based on the model you have chosen.  Also pick the right knitting needles.  There are special hosiery options that are considered the best if you undertook to knit socks with knitting needles.  Their size is also selected depending on the scheme and model. </p><p>  Knitting is not a big deal.  Of course, at first it may seem that this is a laborious, monotonous process.  However, one has only to remember that any business starts with a creak, and then enters a rut.  Knitting socks is one of the best gifts that a needlewoman can make to her household.  So feel free to take yarn and knitting needles and take up the creation of true beauty. </p>
