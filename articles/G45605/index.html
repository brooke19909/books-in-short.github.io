    <p>  The air in <span>the recreation center is</span> filled with salt fumes, which is why being in those places helps to relieve stress.  It should be noted that the effectiveness of treatment at Yarovoy is very high.  Artemia Salina crustaceans take part in the formation of therapeutic mud. </p><p>  The salt lakes of Altai are unique in nature.  The mud, which is located at the bottom of the Yarovoye Lake, is widely used in gynecology.  It contributes to the normalization of the menstrual cycle, cures <span>chronic endometritis</span> and infertility.  If you have skin problems, you should go to the lake.  Therapeutic mud contributes to the renewal of the epidermis.  In addition, it has a very good effect on the cardiovascular system. </p><h2>  Salt <span>lakes of</span> Altai <span>mountains</span> : where to stay with tents? </h2><p>  One of the highest lakes is Dzhulkul ("summer lake").  It is located above sea level at an altitude of 2200 meters.  Rare animals live in these marvelous places: laughing gulls, whooper swans and cormorant colony.  There are no tourist routes there, so getting to Dlulkul is quite problematic.  It is best to go there by car with tents. </p>

    <h2>  Kulunda lake </h2><p>  The salt lakes of the Altai Territory are famous for their healing properties.  Kulundinskoye is no exception.  There you will not see the shores in hot weather due to strong fumes.  Neither rivers nor streams flow from the lake.  The water is so salty that the mineralization level is 160 g / l. </p><h2>  Bitter lake </h2><p>  Its length is 45 kilometers and its width is 5. In the system of isthmus lakes, it is the final water body with a steppe continental climate and pine ribbon forest.  Nearby is the Gorky-Pereshcheinoe Lake, which is famous for alkaline waters.
