Usually these are green areas.  The city of Lipetsk was no exception.  Here the leader in attendance is Victory Park.  Lipetsk has other great places to relax, but we will stop there.  Victory Park spreads over 35 hectares.  It is located between the Kamenny Log natural boundary, Polygraphicheskaya ulitsa, 60 years of the USSR avenue and residential quarters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park Lipetsk" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/245284.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  Before telling what Victory Park (Lipetsk) is, I want to dwell a bit on the history of this attraction.  It was laid in 1975 on the eve of the 30th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.  Its construction was carried out for 12 years, and only in 1987 it was opened.  Initially, the name of the park was dedicated to the anniversary of the holiday, and only in 1999 it began to be called, as it is now, Victory Park.  Over 40 species of shrubs and trees are planted on its territory, which form shady alleys, picturesque natural corners and beautiful groves. </p><p>  Victory Park (Lipetsk) has many interesting places, one of them is <span>Victory Square,</span> tall beautiful spruce trees are planted around its center, and if you look from above, you can see the clear outline of a <span>five-pointed star.</span>  Nearby is Labor Square.  A stele was installed on it in honor of the residents of the Sovetsky district, with whom this park was laid.  In 2005 it was thoroughly reconstructed, changes were made in the process of work.  Instead of one entrance to the park, two are now open - from the 19th and 24th microdistricts.  In addition, a monument was erected - the creation of the national artist of Russia A. Wegner, and in the forest plantation thickets were cleared and paved paths laid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park lipetsk rides" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/245286.jpg" width="600"></div>

It began to function on the eve of the celebration of the anniversary of the 50th anniversary of the Victory.  Here is presented military equipment from the time of the war: the legendary Forty-five, artillery pieces.  Among the equipment you can see a real patrol boat, which left its mark on history: during the war he took part in the Wisla-Oder operation and reached Berlin itself.  And on July 20, 2013, the Avenue of the newlyweds was opened in the park, where all newly created families will be able to plant a tree together. </p><p>  But the most important thing that attracts city residents to Victory Park (Lipetsk) <strong>is</strong> attractions for children and adults.  In the first time after the opening, only a few funs were installed here, including "Russian Swing", "Jung", "Bell", "Whirlwind".  Their number increased after reconstruction.  At that time, complex devices for outdoor activities "UFO", "Fast and the Furious" and others were installed.  And in the summer of 2013, new installations appeared in the park.  Now the residents of the city will be able to ride a carousel or visit a capsule-movie theater.  The playground has earned, an interactive shooting gallery is open.  Now, if you wish, you can test your driving skills on electric cars, enjoy the <span>rope town.</span>  Water rides were added, as well as a climbing wall.  And there are ten units of such novelties in the park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park in Lipetsk events" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/245287.jpg" width="600"></div>

On holidays, fireworks show are organized for guests and residents of the city.  In addition to all of the above, there is a <span>cafe, a summer</span> disco and billiards.  In winter, residents use the territory of the park for skiing.  For convenience, a rental service is available.  And in winter, to the pleasure of people of all ages, an ice rink is poured. </p>
