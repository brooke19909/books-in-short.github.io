    <h2>  Short characteristic of Tatarstan </h2><p>  It is located at the confluence of <span>the Kama</span> and Volga <span>rivers</span> .  <span>The Tatar Autonomous Socialist Republic</span> was created in 1929, in 1990 it was transformed into the Republic of Tatarstan as part of the Russian Federation.  The capital Kazan is an ancient year, which was founded in 1005. </p><p>  About 3.8 million people live in this region.  Moreover, 75% of them are residents of cities.  There are two official languages ‚Äã‚Äãin Tatarstan - Tatar and Russian.  In total, 115 different nationalities live here.  The president is considered the head of the republic.  Tatarstan has its own anthem, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Constitution and the State Council. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The geographical position of the republic </h2><p>  The region is located on the East European Plain, in the forest-steppe and forest zones.  The climate of the region is temperate continental with rather pronounced seasons.  The sights of Tatarstan are best visited from April to October, when the snow no longer lies and pleasant warm weather has settled.  Snow usually falls in mid-November and lasts until the end of March, and sometimes until the beginning of April. </p><p>  In addition to such large rivers as the Kama and Volga, approximately 500 small rivers flow in the region.  There is also a reservoir: Kuibyshev, Zaim, Nizhnekamsk and Karabash.  About 15% of the territory of Tatarstan is occupied by deciduous forests.  Over 1,500 valuable natural objects are protected, the largest of them are the Volga-Kama nature reserve zone and the Nizhny Kama National Park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Kazan" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/396140.jpg?1400091997293" width="302"></div>

    <h2>  Sights of Kazan </h2><p>  Kazan is rightfully considered the pearl of the republic.  Here are a myriad of historical monuments.  Nevertheless, the <span>Kazan Kremlin,</span> which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, is considered to be the visiting card of the city. </p><p>  The view of the Kul-Sharif Mosque and the Kremlin from the side of the Kazanka River is perhaps the most famous image of Kazan.  The capital of Tatarstan is a unique color of cultures of the West and the East, Christianity and Islam.  Mosques here harmoniously coexist with Orthodox cathedrals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An unforgettable impression is made by a walk along the historical quarter of the city - along the streets of Bauman, Tukay and Gorky, the Bulak Canal, the Old Tatar settlement.  One of the most important modern symbols of the city can safely be called the Millennium Bridge, which was built in part of the 10,000th anniversary of Kazan.  The Kazan Circus, which in shape resembles a <span>flying saucer,</span> may surprise <span>.</span>  The Riviera water park also gained great popularity.  Quite often, tour operators offer bus tours to the capital of Kazan with a mandatory check-in to this institution. </p><p>  The sights of Kazan do not end there.  The city has a lot of interesting places to visit.  This is Chatyr-Tau Mountain (the highest mountain of a single mountain range in the region), the Ascension Monastery, Kara-Kul Lake, etc. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  To learn more about this region, it is worth visiting the museums of Tatarstan: the Museum of Military Glory, the Circus Museum, the National Art Gallery, <span>the Fire Protection Museum, the Museum of the</span> 1000th Anniversary of Kazan, the Museum of Islamic Culture, the Botanical Museum, the Vasilyev Art Gallery and other no less fascinating institutions . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museums of tatarstan" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/396150.jpg?1400092040241" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Orthodox shrines </h2><p>  The most important Orthodox shrine of Kazan and Russia as a whole can be called the Church of Our Lady of Kazan.  Here are the most revered icons in Orthodoxy.  The Peter and Paul Temple, which proudly rises above Kazan, is considered no less picturesque. </p><p>  The Epiphany Cathedral is one of the most important symbols of the capital of the republic.  The city also houses the ancient temple of the Yaroslavl Miracle Workers, which is located on the Arsky cemetery.  In addition to all these shrines, you can visit the monasteries of Tatarstan: Zilatnov Assumption female, Raifsky and Ioanno-Baptist male and others. </p><p>  Not far from Kazan, in the village of Voznesenskoye, there is a unique temple of the Mother of God of the Tikhvin Icon.  Previously, there was a fairly well-known image of "All Who Sorrow Joy."  In the village of Borisoglebsk there is the church of the Great Martyrs Boris and Gleb.  It was erected in 1600.  In 1888, her building was again restored after a fire. </p><h2>  Mosques of the republic </h2><p>  The main religious building of Tatarstan is the Kul Sharif mosque.  This magnificent building is a real treasure of the white stone Kremlin and the capital of the republic.  In the old part of the city there are other amazing mosques of Tatarstan.  Among them is the Bulgar mosque.  It was founded in honor of the 1100th anniversary of the conversion of the Volga region to Islam.  One of the <span>sleeping areas of</span> Kazan adorns the <span>Blue Mosque.</span>  The whole quarter is also consecrated by the wooden ‚ÄúKazan Nury‚Äù.  In the Novotatar settlement there is a mosque with a very strange name - No. 11.  It was built by the patron of al-Uranbashi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosques of tatarstan" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/396146.jpg?1400092085000" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Sviyazhsk </h2><p>  The city of Sviyazhsk is a picturesque place of Tatarstan and a monument of local importance.  This fortified city was founded by Ivan the Terrible himself in 1551 at the confluence of <span>the Sviyaga</span> and Volga <span>rivers</span> .  During the years of Soviet rule, hundreds of thousands of prisoners were exiled here.  After the creation of the Kuibyshev reservoir, Sviyazhsk turned into an island.  You can get to it by a dam by car or river transport. </p><p>  Since 2011, a grandiose program has been launched to turn this place into a museum reserve.  Now in Sviyazhsk work is underway on the reconstruction of various monuments, some of which were founded in the 16th century. </p><p>  This island island is considered one of the most popular holiday destinations for both tourists and residents of the republic.  Various contests, festivals, festivals are often held in Sviyazhsk. </p><h2>  Bulgar </h2><p>  We continue to closely study the sights of Tatarstan.  On the banks of the Volga lies the picturesque city of Bolgar.  It was built in the place where the ancient Bulgar was previously located.  At that time, the city was a major economic center and the largest settlement of the Golden Horde.  Bulgar was destroyed in the 15th century. </p><p>  The most remarkable construction of the town is the settlement of Bulgar.  This complex consists of numerous monuments of the 13-15th centuries: the Small Minaret, the Cathedral Mosque, the Khan's tomb, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monasteries of tatarstan" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/396858.jpg?1400151736751" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Elabuga </h2><p>  Elabuga is one of the oldest cities in the republic, whose age has long exceeded one thousand.  True, the exact date of its occurrence has not been clarified, it is only known that it was founded at the turn of the 9-11th centuries.  The main historical monument of Elabuga is the Devil's Hillfort.  All the main attractions of the village were combined into a museum reserve.  It included memorial museums of various figures that are related to Yelabuga (Durova, Ankylosing spondylitis, Tsvetaeva).  There is also an art gallery of Shishkin. </p><p>  In general, Elabuga is a very beautiful city, but the rapid economic development has somewhat spoiled the characteristic architectural ensemble, which should be saturated with the spirit of antiquity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk city" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/396151.jpg?1400092190609" width="300"></div>
