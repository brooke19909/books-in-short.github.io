    <h2>  From the history </h2><p>  The story goes that Inal Bay was named after one of the preachers of the Christian religion, who lived on the Black Sea coast.  No information about the righteous has been preserved.  Only the name of the bay and the legend of its existence. </p><p>  According to another version, this place was named after the prince.  The event is dedicated to the reconciliation of the tribes.  According to legend, 2 tribes lived on the banks of the Inal.  The daughter of the ruler of one of them and the son of the leader of the other were in love and met secretly.  Once such a meeting ended tragically.  The young man was captured and decided to be executed.  But a loving girl managed to dissuade her father from this crime.  The daughters of the prince managed to reconcile both tribes.  Since then, the bay began to be called Inal. </p><p>  Another legend says that, after a truce was concluded between the two warring tribes, the settlement of Bzhid appeared, located near the bay.  An elder during the celebration of the end of civil strife was broken glass.  He ordered that a village be built on this site. </p><p>  Which of the legends is closest to the truth is difficult to determine today.  But it‚Äôs important that they all tell about the world to which the warring tribes finally came, and that the name was given to the bay precisely because of the conclusion of such a world.  This is also important.  Maybe this is what allowed her to flourish and become a favorite vacation spot for many tourists.  And beautiful legends only ennoble the Inal Bay and give it mystery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What attracts the bay </h2><p>  Most of all, tourists are attracted to Inal Bay by the beauty of nature and healing blue clay.
