At the same time, this metropolis cannot be called a cheap place to spend a vacation.  For accommodation in good hotels located either in the center or by the sea, you will have to pay a considerable amount.  Therefore, tourists who want to save money often stop at budget complexes.  However, not all of them provide an equally high level of service.  In this article, we will talk about the best 3 star hotels in Dubai in the UAE.  Consider their number of rooms and infrastructure, as well as the advantages and disadvantages that tourists noted. </p><h2>  List of Good 3 Star Hotels in Dubai </h2><p>  Many tourists do not risk going on a trip to the UAE, expecting that the trip will cost them a round sum.  It seems to them that three-star hotels will not meet their expectations.  Indeed, some of them can not boast of a favorable location or high quality service.  However, if you approach the choice of place of residence wisely, then you can choose a great option for a low price.  In this case, you can find a hotel in the city center, and not far from the sea. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.2048493" data-lng="55.270782800000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/4/6/4946.png"></div><p>  We list the three-star hotels most popular with tourists, offering accommodation at affordable prices: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Rove Dubai Marina complex; </li><li>  Hotel Arabian Park Hotel; </li><li>  Hotel Chelsea Plaza; </li><li>  Rove Downtown complex; </li><li>  beach hotel Regent Beach Resort; </li><li>  Hotel Palm Beach Hotel. </li></ul><p>  Below, we will not only describe in more detail the infrastructure of each of these options for accommodation, but also consider the reviews of tourists about living in budget hotels in Dubai. </p><h2>  Rove Dubai Marina Complex </h2><p>  One of the most respectable areas in the city is considered Dubai Marina.  It is quite difficult to find 3 star hotels here, as here is one of the most expensive marinas.  The area is located next to the artificial bay, and most of the buildings in the marina are huge skyscrapers.  But budget hotels are also available.  For example, Rove Dubai Marina is a good option to stay in this area.  This hotel is located in the central part of Dubai Marina, so it is surrounded by a mass of infrastructure facilities, including restaurants and shopping centers.  And from the windows of the complex offers amazing views of the skyscrapers.  The beach can be reached in just 10 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rove Dubai Marina Complex" class="if uuid-2580691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580691.jpg"></div><p>  Rove Dubai Marina is a modern hotel.  All of its rooms are equipped with the latest technology: they have air conditioning, plasma TVs, rain showers in the bathroom.  On the territory of the hotel tourists can visit the gym, outdoor pool, restaurant.  There is a playroom for children.  The hotel has staff who speak Russian. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the reviews, tourists say that they liked this complex.  They note the high quality of local service, calling it one of the best and most affordable options for accommodation in Dubai Marina.  They like the location of the hotel, the cleanliness of the rooms, and the varied buffet in the restaurant.  But they practically did not notice any shortcomings.  Only a few guests complained about the noise coming from the construction site near the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Arabian Park Hotel </h2><p>  One of the best options for budget accommodation will be <span>the Bur Dubai area.</span>  It is considered the historical center, since it was here that the life of the city was concentrated before the beginning of its rapid development.  It is famous primarily for its low real estate prices.  Therefore, if you are looking for an inexpensive 3 star hotel in Dubai, then it is worth paying attention to this area. </p><p>  In Bur Dubai <span>, the Arabian Park Hotel is</span> very popular with tourists <span>.</span>  It is located next to a busy highway.  The central part of the city is 1.5 km away, and the international airport is 10. It resembles an inexpensive European hotel with its appearance.  In total, it offers 318 rooms with a view of the city buildings.  The hotel has an outdoor pool, a conference and meeting room, a gym, a jacuzzi, 3 restaurants and 2 bars.  A free shuttle to the beach is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Arabian Park Hotel" class="if uuid-2580699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580699.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, tourists liked staying in a hotel, although they note that it has many shortcomings.  However, they are leveled by low cost.  They liked the delicious food in the restaurant, but the buffet here is monotonous.  Of the advantages of the hotel, they also call clean rooms and helpful staff, and of the shortcomings - poor sound insulation and round-the-clock construction near the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Chelsea Plaza </h2><p>  In the same area is another good and affordable 3 star hotel in Dubai - Chelsea Plaza.  It does not offer a large selection of infrastructure facilities and entertainment options, but is perfect for tourists looking for a cheap place to stay near the city center.  For example, the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, is 4.5 km from here.  The hotel has an outdoor pool, sauna, gym.  The price includes breakfast, which is served at the buffet in the main restaurant.  Private parking is free.  The hotel accepts tourists with young children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotels.ctrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Chelsea Plaza" class="if uuid-2580706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580706.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews, guests of this hotel praise its spacious rooms and convenient location.  At the same time, they complain of noise from the street at night and monotonous food. </p><h2>  Hotel Dream Palace Hotel </h2><p>  The Deira area is also often referred to the historical center of Dubai.  3 star hotels are also quite common here.  An inexpensive option for accommodation in this area is the Dream Palace Hotel.  It is located near the international airport, which can be reached in just 15 minutes.  Metro Station is 300 meters away.  It features a rooftop outdoor pool with panoramic views of the surroundings.  The complex also has private parking, an international restaurant, a gym and a business center.  Russian-speaking staff also works here.  The hotel rooms are modernly renovated.  They are equipped with individual air conditioning and TVs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.safariinuae.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Dream Palace Hotel" class="if uuid-2580722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580722.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the hotel has many advantages and disadvantages.  The guests consider its advantages as a favorable location, comfortable beds in the rooms, a clean pool and polite staff.  The cons they call the old plumbing in the bathroom, low Wi-Fi speed and the smell of tobacco in living rooms. </p><h2>  Rove Downtown Complex </h2><p>  Do not think that all 3 star hotels in Dubai are located at a distance from the city center.  For example, the Rove Downtown complex boasts a great location.  Within walking distance from it is the famous Burj Khalifa and the huge <span>Dubai</span> Mall.  The rooms in the hotel are distinguished by their spaciousness, modern design and the availability of a large number of amenities.  An outdoor pool with a sun terrace is located on site.  Guests can eat at the restaurant, which specializes in European and Asian cuisine.  Many infrastructure facilities are offered to guests: private parking, a conference room, luggage storage, a mini market and vending machines with food and drinks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fischer.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rove Downtown Complex" class="if uuid-2580728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580728.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews, tourists most often praise the hotel and recommend it for their stay.  Among the advantages they highlight an excellent location in the city center, excellent views from the hotel windows, friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms.  At the same time, guests complain about the noise at the pool and the lack of Russian-language channels. </p><h2>  Beach hotel Regent Beach Resort </h2><p>  Not all budget hotels are located within the city.  Near the beach, 3-star hotels in Dubai are not so easy to find, but possible.  For example, many tourists liked the Regent Beach Resort complex.  It is located in the Jumeirah area, and the coast can be reached in just 1 minute.  The hotel specializes in beach vacations, it has an outdoor pool and a sunbathing area.  On its territory there is a spa and massage room, a fitness center, two restaurants.  Wheelchairs are welcome here.  There are amenities for guests with small children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Regent Beach Resort" class="if uuid-2580730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580730.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists note that in Dubai you can rarely find a good hotel by the sea, but they liked this complex.  In addition to location, they also praise the room equipment, clean beach and friendly staff.  But guests believe that the hotel needs redecoration as it looks outdated. </p><h2>  Hotel Palm Beach Hotel </h2><p>  A popular option for tourists is the Palm Beach Hotel complex, which is also located near the beach.  But 3 star hotels in Dubai rarely have their own stretch of coast.  Therefore, guests visit the city beach.  A museum and a market are located next to the hotel.  The hotel rooms are decorated with wooden furniture.  The living rooms have a TV, air conditioning, safe, minibar and other amenities.  The complex has private parking and a business center.  There is a restaurant and a bar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.priceline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Palm Beach Hotel" class="if uuid-2580732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2580732.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists believe that the cost of living here corresponds to the quality of the service offered.  They liked the clean rooms and the good cleaning, the skilled staff and the good location.  At the same time, they criticize dim lighting in living rooms and old plumbing in bathrooms. </p><h2>  3 Star Dubai Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  Budget hotels rarely have a good reputation with tourists, as low cost is usually justified by a large number of shortcomings.  However, travelers most often praise 3 star hotels in Dubai.  Yes, they do not surprise their guests with luxurious room decoration or a large selection of amenities and entertainment.  Some hotels have not been renovated for a long time.  But for a low price, tourists are offered clean rooms and good food.  The staff at budget hotels in Dubai always behaves politely and tries to quickly solve the problems of guests.  In this case, it is not necessary to settle on the outskirts of the city.  A good and inexpensive complex can be found in the very center of Dubai. </p>
