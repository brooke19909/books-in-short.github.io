Some battles are lost in the memory of centuries, others remain on the hearing, however, over time, everything is erased, forgotten.  The war, which claimed the lives of at least 20 million people, and crippled incomparably more, the battles in the name of which were fought not only in Europe but also in Africa and the Middle East, are slowly becoming a thing of the past.  And the new generation not only does not know the main battles of the <span>First World War,</span> but is not even able to recall the chronological framework of this page in history, covered in blood and covered with gunpowder of burnt houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great battles of the first world war" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/575325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Members </h2><p>  The warring parties were united in two blocks - the Entente and the Fourth (Triple Alliance).  The first included the Russian and British empires, France (as well as several dozen allied countries, including the United States, Japan).  <span>Triple Alliance</span> concluded Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary.  However, in the future, Italy took the side of the Entente, and the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> and Bulgaria controlled by it became allies.  This association received the name of the Fourth Union.  The causes of the conflict, which entailed major battles of the First World War, are called various, but the most likely is still a complex of several factors, including economic, territorial.  <span>The boiling point</span> in the world was reached when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo, the hope of the entire vast Austro-Hungarian empire.  Thus, from July 28, the countdown of war began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main battle of the first world war" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/575326.jpg" width="495"></div>

The fighting arena, which unfolded in the north of France, took about 180 km, and 5 armies of Germany and 6 of England and France took part.

Losses on both sides were very noticeable (respectively, 11 ships and more than 3 thousand people from the German side and 14 ships and almost 7 thousand fighting from the British).  But the rivals shared the victory - although Germany did not manage to reach the goal and break the blockade, but the enemy‚Äôs losses were much more significant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Verdun battle </h2><p>  This is one of the bloodiest pages, including the major battles of the First World War, which lasted for most of 1916 (from February to December) in northeastern France.

    <h2>  Brusilovsky breakthrough </h2><p>  This battle of the First World War with the participation of Russia on the South-Western Front became one of the largest military operations organized directly by the Russian command.  The offensive entrusted to General Brusilov, launched in June 1916 on the Austrian section.  Bloody battles continued with varying success throughout the summer and early fall, but Austria-Hungary failed to withdraw from the war, but the enormous losses of the Russian Empire became one of the catalysts that led to the <span>February Revolution.</span> </p><h2>  Operation Nivelles </h2><p>  Comprehensive offensive operations designed to turn the tide of the battles on the Western Front were jointly organized by England and France and lasted from April to May 1917, and the forces exhibited by them greatly exceeded the capabilities of Germany.  However, a brilliant breakthrough was not possible, but the number of victims is impressive - the Entente lost about 340 thousand people, while the defending Germans - 163 thousand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tank battles of the first world war" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/575321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main tank battles of the First World War </h2><p>  At the time of World War I, the widespread use of tanks had not yet arrived, but they managed to be noted.  On September 15, 1916, the English Mk.I entered the battlefield for the first time, and at least 18 out of 49 vehicles managed to take part (17 turned out to be malfunctioning even before the start of the battle, and 14 were irreparably bogged down the road or failed due to breakdowns) nevertheless, their very appearance brought confusion into the ranks of the enemy and broke through the lines of the Germans to a depth of 5 km. </p><p>  The very first battles between the vehicles took place closer to the end of the war, when three Mk.IV (England) and three A7V (Germany) unexpectedly collided at Ville-Breton in April 1918, as a result of which one tank was seriously damaged on each side, however, the overall outcome is difficult to interpret in favor of one of the parties.  On the same day, ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù English Mk.A, who suffered from the surviving in the first meeting A7V.  Although the ratio was 1: 7, the advantage remained on the side of the cannon "German", additionally supported by artillery. </p><p>  An interesting clash occurred on October 8, 1918, when 4 British Mk.IVs collided and the same number of <span>German tanks</span> (captured) collided, both sides suffered losses.  However, the main battle of the First World War was left without the support of new dangerous armored vehicles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battle of the first world war with the participation of Russia" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/575322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The First World War caused the collapse of four huge empires at once - the British, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and Russian, both the victors in the Entente and the defeated in Germany, Austria-Hungary suffered, and the Germans were formally deprived of the opportunity for a long time build a paramilitary state. </p><p>  More than 12 million civilians and 10 million soldiers became victims of hostilities; a very difficult time for survival and recovery has come around the world.  On the other hand, it was during the years 1914-1919 that a significant development of armaments took place, light machine guns and grenade launchers began to be used for the first time, war and tanks were noted on the roads, and airplanes in the sky began to support the troops.  However, the great battles of the First World War were only the harbingers of the hostilities that unfolded two decades later. </p>
