    <p>  The clothing of the American Indians was to the taste of the Europeans, and they began to introduce it into their everyday life.  In the sixties of the twentieth century, it was adopted by famous fashion designers, and now they have greatly improved it.  So, now there are different options for the neck, in modern models of ponchos for women there are pockets, hoods, various fasteners, slots for the hands. </p><h2>  How to sew a poncho </h2><p>  The poncho, whose patterns are made very quickly, is easy to sew by yourself.  For this, you do not need to bother with sewing for a long time.  If you have a sewing machine and a desire to work a little on creating clothes for yourself, then you can create such an original outfit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat poncho pattern" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/697083.jpg" width="244"></div>

In the middle of the center we cut a semicircle, it will be the neck.

    <p>  A poncho is knitted in the form of a rectangle, the measurements for which you do in advance.  Now we collect 70 loops on our knitting needles, and knit with different patterns. </p><h2>  Poncho Knitting Patterns </h2><p>  In order to create such a convenient and practical thing with knitting needles, you will need to master certain types of patterns. </p><p>  You create the Rosehip pattern on knitting needles, and it will decorate any product very much.  And the poncho is also suitable.  In order to tie it, you will need to master this sequence of knitting stitches: in the front row we knit first three loops together with the wrong, then we knit three from one loop - one wrong, one front, and again one wrong.  So it turns out a poncho coat, the pattern of which for a knitwear is very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="poncho for women" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/697095.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  In the wrong rows we knit according to this scheme: three <span>wrong loops,</span> one front, repeat. </p><p>  When knitting a poncho, the ‚ÄúWicker‚Äù pattern will be combined with the dogrose pattern.  Such a pattern is made simply: in the first row you take off the hem, then we knit one front, make a crochet, then the front loop and the crochet stretch through the loop that was removed.  In the second and other even rows, the loops and crochets are knitted on the wrong side. </p><p>  When you knit the poncho with these patterns, now you need to make an assembly.  The canvas that you have knitted, you need to connect along the edges to a height of forty-five centimeters, and tie the resulting neckline with crochet columns without a crochet.  At the bottom of the poncho, you can add fringe brushes 25 centimeters long. </p><h2>  Crochet poncho </h2><p>  Those who like crocheting can also create a beautiful and practical thing for the street.  If you want this thing to warm you in cold weather, then you need to take yarn, which consists of angora and acrylic, or yarn mixed with mohair.  A poncho pattern with a hood will come in handy in this case, as you can coordinate your knitting according to it. </p><p>  <span>Crochet a poncho</span> from the neck, in this case, you need to hook 83 air loops and close it into a ring.  Then on top are crocheted columns that are connected to each other by air loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby poncho" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/697096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Poncho, patterns of which should take into account cuts for the hands, crocheting is easy.  So, already in the first row you should know where you will have cuts for the hands. </p><p>  From the fifth row, crochet in rotary rows, up to a length of about 12 centimeters.  From this length, it is necessary to gradually increase along the line of the middle of the front and along the sleeves.  As you can see, the poncho whose patterns we are interested in is not difficult. </p><p>  When you are tied to the length of the sleeve, then you need to start making reductions for the sleeves.  Fill the sleeves with cuffs that can be tied with two or two elastic bands.  Tie the edges of the poncho with two rows of double crochet posts.  Draw a lace around the edge of the neck. </p><h2>  Openwork poncho </h2><p>  A crocheted openwork poncho will come in handy for spring and summer, when you no longer need to be so thoroughly insulated.  To knit such a thing, you will need <span>Yarn Art</span> Summer <span>yarn</span> , 600 grams, which consists of 60 percent cotton, forty percent polyamide. </p><p>  This <span>poncho coat, the pattern of</span> which is done in advance on paper, is knitted using a simple scheme.  You crochet 67 air loops, plus three lifting loops, and knit in this sequence: one air loop - four double crochets knitted into one base loop, so repeat to the end of the row.  Thirty-six centimeters from the start of work, you type on each side a chain of 36 air loops, and include them in the rest of the knitting.  After 56 centimeters from the set edge, the work must be completed by marking the middle of the front with colored thread. </p><p>  Then we knit shelves.  For the left shelf, we collect 34 loops plus five lifting loops, and we knit this pattern to a height of thirty-six centimeters, and there on the right dial 36 air loops for the sleeve, as on the back.  Then, similarly, we knit the right shelf. </p><p>  We connect the shelves and the back along the edges with the help of a kettel seam with a needle with a wide end.  Sew on the edges of the product fringe.  Sew a small button on the edge of the left shelf, and sew a buttonhole for it on the right shelf. </p>
