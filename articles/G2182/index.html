He managed to defeat the Arabs at the <span>battle of Poitiers</span> in 732.

    <h2>  Political fragmentation of francs </h2><p>  <span>Karl Martell</span> did not manage to find the beginning of the reign of the Carolingian dynasty.  He died in 741.  His son Pepin Korotky inherited the title of mayor of the Franks from him.  However, there was still an institution of royal power, the carriers of which were the Merovingians. </p><p>  Thus, Pipin was a second-hand feudal lord who ruled in the provinces of Neustria, Provence and Burgundy.  Part of his father’s allotment passed to his brother Karloman.  Brothers often fought in alliance against numerous enemies.  The beginning of the reign of the Carolingian dynasty was marked by battles with <span>Germanic tribes</span> from the east - the Bavarians and Alemans. </p><p>  In 742, the Duke of Aquitaine Gunald declared war on the Carolingham.  He, like many other feudal lords, believed that the brothers usurped power in the state.  Hunald managed to plunder several minor towns, after which he was driven out of these lands.  However, then Pepin still contributed to the accession of the new king Childeric III of the Merovingian dynasty.  That factual authority did not have and possessed small resources to fight against powerful feudal lords. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Carolingian rise to power </h2><p>  Several years passed in squabbles between the dukes and counts.  Finally, Pepin sent the embassy <span>to the Pope,</span> who asked if anyone who does not have real power has the right to be king.  Zachary replied that the most powerful and influential should rule.  This served as the green light for Pepin. </p><p>  So that the beginning of the reign of the Carolingian dynasty was formally legal, he organized a meeting of Franks in Soissons.  This happened in 751.  On it, numerous loyal feudal lords and aristocrats voted for Pipin.  Childeric was sent to the monastery (this was a frequent measure in the Middle Ages).  This was the beginning of the reign of the Carolingian dynasty.  The year 752 from the birth of Christ became significant for this family. </p>

    <h2>  Campaigns against the Saxons and the Lombards </h2><p>  The new king had to prove his legitimacy and viability.  The first against the new government were the restless Saxons.  The beginning of the reign of the Carolingian dynasty was marked by a war with this tribe.  The king and his army reached <span>the Weser River,</span> where the Saxons were defeated.  After that, they began to pay the Franks an even greater tribute than before.  In addition, they still remained pagans, so it was at this time that Christian missionaries began their preaching work in still wild Germany. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pepin's faithful ally was the Pope, from the submission of which the new king received power.  Therefore, the Franks defended the Father of the Church every time he was threatened by the neighboring Lombards, who ruled most of modern Italy.  In 752, their leader Aistulf invaded the vicinity of Rome.  The new Pope Stephen III sent a letter to the Franks asking for revenue.  This was the very beginning of the reign of the Carolingian dynasty.  The date of the coronation barely left behind, but Pepin went to Rome, despite the danger of rebellion in the rear. </p><p>  The campaign was successful.  The leader of the Lombards was defeated.  He pledged to give the pope the important city of Ravenna.  In addition, he paid the Franks a large indemnity and temporarily stopped the aggressive policy against Rome. </p>

    <h2>  Domestic policy </h2><p>  In domestic politics, Pepin also actively supported the Church.  He believed that it was this organization that could become one of the main pillars of the state.  The king introduced a new tax - tithe.  This money was paid by all residents of the Frankish Empire.  Funds went to the Church. </p><p>  Pepin also supported the army.  His father began the practice of distributing land for service.  The new king continued this policy, which allowed him to strengthen power.  Although it was this measure that caused the further <span>feudal fragmentation of</span> Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Pepin passed away in 768.  It was he who laid the foundation of the Carolingian dynasty.  The formation of the Frankish state of a new model was successfully completed.  After several decades, his son Karl will become emperor in the likeness of the Roman rulers of the glorious European past. </p>
