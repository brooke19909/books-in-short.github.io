  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to clean iPhone from viruses?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When creating and updating the iOS operating system, Apple developers pay great attention not only to its technical capabilities, but also to protection against malware.  For all the time since the release of the first iPhone model, only 20 viruses were detected.  This means that the "infection" of the iOS device is practically excluded, but in extremely rare cases it is possible.  In the article, we will consider how to remove a virus from an iPhone, if such a nuisance did occur. </p><h2>  Is it possible to infect the device? </h2><p>  Users of apple gadgets know that the company makes a large amount of effort to ensure the safety of its customers.  But many are wondering if the iPhone can ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the virus.  In fact, this is almost impossible.  Moreover, if you try to find an antivirus program in the App Store, only a few applications for downloading will appear, and even they are more designed to combat incoming mail spam, and not to protect against viruses. </p><p>  So, if during the use of the smartphone a strange activity or deviations from normal functioning is detected in the form of constantly pop-in ads, application loading errors and other problems, most likely the device ‚Äúcaught‚Äù the virus.  Often, the user does not even suspect the presence of a malicious program, since it is skillfully masked in the system and it is extremely difficult to detect.  From all of the above, one can make an unambiguous conclusion: there are practically no anti-virus programs to check an iOS device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="qfos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone virus" class="if uuid-3138340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3138340.jpg"></div><h2>  What does the appearance and spread of the virus mean? </h2><p>  Neglect of security measures most often leads to the fact that the iPhone is infected with a virus.  This is the primary reason that a malware appears.  At one time, several cases of malicious attacks on the Apple operating system were recorded, including even reliable applications.  They suffered from virus code or infection of the developer programs that were used to create the utility.  In this case, the user is not to blame. </p><p>  Another reason for infection with the virus may be the cancellation of safe downloads and downloading music, movies and other files not from official sources, but from extraneous resources.  In this case, the user intentionally spreads the virus, because he is aware of non-compliance with security measures.  Thus, the virus enters the phone or PC.  Of course, the presence of a protective system in iOS should prevent malicious attacks and block access to applications and the operating system, but in the absence of the latest updates or the latest virus infection can not be avoided.  If one type of danger is the placement of constantly pop-up ads, the other can read confidential data, including passwords from bank cards, online wallets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="qfos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 virus" class="if uuid-3138342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3138342.jpg"></div><h2>  Symptoms of device infection </h2><p>  In the case when the device begins to function strangely when using multiple applications, it may be infected with a malware program.  If malfunctions are detected in only one program, most likely this is a problem for one specific application. </p><p>  In most cases, applications attacked by the virus begin to redirect the user to previously unknown sites and open the App Store without asking the owner.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting once again that "infection" with the iPhone 5 virus and other models is extremely rare, and the reason usually lies in equipment malfunction. </p><p>  Sometimes users are faced with the problem of uncontrolled sending messages.  This is not necessarily a manifestation of the virus.  Perhaps this is how the activation of iMessage and FaceTime applications behaves. </p><h2>  What are malware programs like? </h2><p>  There are several types of viruses on an iPhone: </p><ol><li>  Harmless - malicious code that displays a variety of messages on a different time interval.  Another sensational virus is WireLurker, which manifested itself only by installing a comic on a mobile device. </li><li>  ‚ÄúThief‚Äù - virus programs that steal personal data - from phone numbers and photos to passwords for access to financial information.  As a rule, all of them are developed for a specific category of commercial structures.  The most widely publicized story was with the IGN Bank. </li><li>  SMS virus spreading through messages.  When you read this alert, the device freezes or slows down. <div class="photo" data-original="legkovmeste.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="can an iPhone catch a virus" class="if uuid-3138377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3138377.jpg"></div></li><li>  Banners - penetrate the Safari-code and appear constantly pop-up advertising materials, including obscene content. </li></ol><h2>  Clear history and cache </h2><p>  If you do not know where to start and how to clean your iPhone from viruses, then first pay attention to the history of sites and a temporary buffer for storing information.  It happens that unclosed tabs or temporary data can cause slow operation or other problems with the phone. </p><p>  Each application has its own cache, which is recommended to be removed from time to time.  It is most convenient to do this not for each individual program, but at once on the entire device.  It is best to use the Battery Doctor app or any other application of your choice.  After downloading, go to the Junk tab, and then click the Clean up cache button.  The program will search for the cache in the system and delete it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technofizi.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove a virus from an iPhone" class="if uuid-3138348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3138348.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you need to clear the Safari cache.  Since applications do not affect the browser when deleting information from the buffer, it is better to do this manually.  To do this, open the "Settings" tab, select Safari, and then "Clear site history and data." </p><div class="photo" data-original="best-mobile.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone is infected by a virus" class="if uuid-3138355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3138355.jpg"></div><h2>  How to remove a virus from an iPhone </h2><p>  To clean the smartphone from malware, it is recommended to use the following utilities: </p><ul><li>  Lookout Mobile Security. </li><li>  McAffe. </li><li>  Virus Barrier. </li><li>  Norton. </li><li>  Avira </li></ul><p>  As a rule, after installing the program, it offers to check for viruses.  If this does not happen, you can always find and select this function in the menu; just activate it.  For example, the Avira utility in the antivirus tab has a Scan button, in other programs everything is also available. </p><h2>  How to protect your device from viruses? </h2><p>  What to do so that the virus does not appear on the iPhone?  First of all, it is advisable to exclude the installation of updating the version of the operating system if the developer is unverified.  It is worth weighing the need for Jailbreak, because after that access to the file system appears not only for the user, but also for attackers.  The latter, in turn, can easily introduce the virus into the device.  All downloads should be made only from official and verified sources. </p><p>  It is necessary to update the operating system as an improved version of iOS is released.  Apple developers take into account all the gaps and weaknesses in the anti-virus protection and eliminate them when upgrading to the new version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bazava.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean iPhone from viruses" class="if uuid-3138363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3138363.jpg"></div><h2>  What if nothing helps? </h2><p>  In the case when no methods help to remove the virus on the iPhone, you can try to ‚Äútear down‚Äù the application, perhaps the ill-fated code is hidden in them.  Moreover, if necessary, software can always be reinstalled.  Another advantage of this method is that after reinstalling the application takes up less device memory.  The same is recommended for unnecessary photos.  If sooner or later they come in handy or just nice to see, you can save files to the cloud. </p><p>  A cardinal measure in the fight against the virus is a complete reset of the device to the factory settings.  However, before resorting to this method, you must save all your data: photos, contacts, personal videos and other files in iCloud, on a computer or on a USB drive. </p><p>  After resetting the application, applications are reinstalled via the App Store or iTunes.  Before downloading, make sure that the program is not infected with a virus.  When installing digital and media files, the settings are personalized for maximum ease of use.  This method requires time, but most likely you will no longer have to resort to it. </p>
