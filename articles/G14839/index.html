Domestic and foreign manufacturers strive to surpass each other, realizing this desire.  And to choose an outfit for a little princess today is not difficult.  But much more interesting when mothers create dresses for girls with their own hands!  Moreover, for this it is not necessary to have the skills of a professional seamstress.  There is enough knowledge once acquired at school in labor lessons, and the desire to give the baby an original thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresses for girls" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12623/111205.jpg" width="361"></div>

    <p>  Dresses for girls are created using a variety of technologies, depending on what the mother-needlewoman prefers.  They are knitted and crocheted, sewn from whole fabric and shreds, combine fabric and yarn.  When a thing is done with love (and how else can you create for your own daughter?), It always turns out to be very beautiful.  Well, if these are your first steps in needlework and not everything turns out as you would like, it's okay!  Children grow up quickly, and after some six months, clothes for girls will need new ones. </p><p>  <strong>Where to get a pattern?</strong> </p><p>  Of course, you can choose your favorite item in the fashion magazine for needlework.  There will be not only a pattern, but also a detailed description of the process.  However, today, as before, not all needlewomen are satisfied with the proposals of fashion designers.  Indeed, most often dresses for girls with their own hands are created for every day, and not for a single show on the catwalk.  In addition, it is impossible to find the right model immediately.  And the price of quality magazines is high enough to buy them in large quantities.  Actually, this makes sense only if there is an intention to make the creation of children's clothing a <span>source of income.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12623/111204.jpg" width="381"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another option is much more accessible: remove the pattern from an existing dress.  To do this, just select your daughter‚Äôs favorite dress, which she already wears, carefully measure and ‚Äúdraw‚Äù every detail on <span>graph paper</span> .  Taking into account the growth of the child, the necessary increases are made - and your own pattern is ready!  No need to fear that you will repeat an existing thing.  Creating dresses for girls with their own hands is why it is wonderful that each of them is unique.  Sewn from another fabric, with other details, it will certainly be unique. </p><p>  Option three, for especially creative and bold needlewomen: create a pattern yourself.  This is more suitable for those who already have at least minimal experience in modeling clothes.  In this case, your own model is conceived and drawn on paper.  In accordance with the plan, measurements are taken from the child, and a pattern is drawn.  It is best to first sweep the ‚Äútest‚Äù dress out of any unnecessary fabric (for example, an old sheet), and only then cut out the details from the selected fabric.  On the "probe" immediately become visible pattern errors, they will be easy to fix without sacrificing updates. </p>

Here, everything can be extremely simple: the sleeves turn into sleeves, the hem into the hem, the shelves and the back into their own likeness of a smaller size.  Ideal for training!

It is obvious that dense <span>woolen fabric is</span> not suitable for a <span>summer dress</span> <span>,</span> and silk or chiffon is not very suitable for winter.  It is best to choose natural fabrics in bright colors.  For the warmer months, cotton and linen are a great choice.  For cold weather - wool, fleece, jeans.  You can choose fabrics with colorful prints.  And you can use plain, decorating the finished thing with lace, applique, embroidery.  The main thing here is not to overdo it so that beauty does not turn into bad taste. </p><p>  If you are not going to sew, but to <span>knit a dress</span> for your girl, then here, preference is given to natural fibers.  Synthetic yarn, even the most spectacular and wearable, is best left for outerwear that is worn for short periods of time.  After all, it is assumed that the dress is worn for the whole day, and the body needs to breathe. </p><p>  <strong>So, what is next?</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresses for girls do it yourself" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12623/111206.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  And then there‚Äôs room for creativity.  Sew, knit, combine fabric and knitted details.  Attract its future owner to create a new thing.  On the one hand, it is useful for educational purposes.  On the other hand, this will guarantee that she will like the new dress.  After all, what is created with your own hands is always valued much higher than any purchase. </p>
