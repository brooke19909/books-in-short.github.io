Usually we get all the corrections, as they say, "under the tree" and look through them in a hurry.  And here is such a concern - more than a year to study the norms of the new accounting constitution. </p><p>  Moreover, accountants found themselves in a strange situation: they need to prepare reports for the past, 2012, when Law 402-FZ has not yet been implemented, now, in 2013, when it is already in full application.  How does this affect the formation and composition of <span>financial statements?</span>  And what should small businesses do? </p>

If Order No. 66n is not updated, or accounting software developers do not change the name of the form, it is advisable to do it yourself.  If this is not possible, you will have to submit a report with the same name.  It is hard to imagine someone raising a hand to punish for it.

Directly, Order No. 66n does not exempt them from this.  At the same time, Accounting Regulation No. 34n continues to apply, where there is just an indulgence.  It turns out directly Hamlet: "To surrender or not to surrender - that is the question."

    <p>  But instead of figuring out which of these normative acts is more important, it is better to reconcile them.  Yes, in the 66th Order there is no permission not to hand over applications, but there are words that they reflect only the most important information about the financial condition of the company.  Conclusion: if you have a regular turnover, there is probably nothing to enter into applications.  And to check the correctness of your professional assessment, according to which you decided to abandon the applications, strictly speaking, there is nobody.  It can be noted that small enterprises have the right not to include applications in the financial statements. </p><p>  One more noticeable relief for small businesses is pleasing.  Simplification of the forms that make up the financial statements made life easier for entrepreneurs and accountants.  In principle, it was declared a long time ago, and small enterprises themselves could develop ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù forms.  But some organizations did not see much sense in this, they were satisfied with generally accepted templates.  Those who were not averse to ‚Äúlightening‚Äù their forms simply did not grow up to such freedom; <span>their independent work</span> frightened them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Here, and <span>authorized capital,</span> and additional, and <span>retained earnings.</span>  In the "small" balance sheet there are no decipherments: they filled in the line "Capital and reserves", and the matter is with the end.

    <p>  The usual report on financial results was also significantly cut by the Ministry of Finance.  Interest went on under the knife - they should be reflected only in the line ‚ÄúOther income‚Äù.  But the officials paid interest to pay as a separate line.  It is understandable why: even a small company needs to see how much it costs the raised money. </p><p>  This ‚Äúsequestration‚Äù to small enterprises that needed it could be done on their own before, but since there were patterns, it was a sin not to use them. </p><p>  However, it is not repeated all the time in vain: the company can use the simplified forms included in the financial statements if it needs them.  But this need is not at all obvious, because from the point of view of accountants of small enterprises who have been filling out regular reporting all their lives, the transition to the ‚Äúlite‚Äù version is unnecessary trouble.  Approve the forms as an application to the accounting policy, add the lines of the "classic" statements to get the results for the aggregate lines of simplified forms. </p>
