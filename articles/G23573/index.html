So that there are no circles from wet dishes on the varnished table and in order not to burn the wooden table when you put a hot pot or teapot on it.  And also such coasters can successfully fit into any interior, thereby making your kitchen more comfortable.  How to make such a craft?  You need to collect wine corks and then cook them.  How to do it?  Put them in a saucepan, fill them with cold water and wait until the water boils.  Now you need to cool the workpiece.  Some may wonder why you need to cook lids?  Then, so that the cork absorbs moisture and slightly increases in size.  After the workpieces have cooled, they need to be cut into plump circles.  It remains to glue the blanks in a chaotic manner with each other.  When gluing, stick to the shape of the circle and do not try to make all the supports the same in shape. </p><h2>  Photo Frame </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY traffic jams" class="if uuid-2347826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347826.jpg"></div><p>  Want to make an interesting gift?  Make a photo frame.  Such a utilitarian and beautiful thing is sure to decorate the interior of your friends.  Moreover, making such a gift is very simple.  The first thing you should do is frame.  To do this, you need to take a thick cardboard and cut out two rectangles from it.  Now take a 10 x 15 photo and circle it in the middle of one of the blanks.  Make the hole a little smaller than you drew.  Reduce the size so that the photo is well fixed in the frame.  Now you need to glue the two blanks and decorate the facade.  Take the lids and cut them along.  Some blanks can be cut across into several parts.  Now, using the glue gun, we fix the plugs on the front of the product.  It remains to make a stand - and the photo frame will be ready. </p><h2>  Jewelry holder </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from bottle caps" class="if uuid-2347827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347827.jpg"></div><p>  A very simple and functional product can be made from wine corks.  If you do not know where to store your jewelry, take a look at this craft.  To make a jewelry stand you will need a large photo frame and wine corks.  We cook the blanks, and then cut them lengthwise to get two long halves.  Using a glue gun, we fix the plugs in the frame.  You can lay them out one to one or place blanks in a chaotic manner.  Now you need to stick some buttons into some traffic jams.  On such hooks it will be possible to hang bracelets, chains and beads.  To accommodate large earrings, pull two threads at the top of the frame.  You can hang the product on the wall of the room, near your little table with cosmetic accessories, or put the stand on the table. </p><h2>  Christmas tree toy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sabrinasouvenirs.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from traffic jams" class="if uuid-2347830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347830.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make a craft from champagne cork, you don‚Äôt need a lot of talent, but imagination is required.  You can make a cute pug in just half an hour.  How to do it?  Take a cork and a brown felt-tip pen.  Draw eyes, paws, folds and a muzzle.  Now with the help of acrylic paint you should detail the toy.  Draw the pupils, claws on the paws, nose and shadows on the folds of the dog.  In white, you can depict a snowflake on the toy chest.  Ears can be cut from small pieces of skin.  We attach them to the cork with a glue gun.  We insert a small self-tapping screw with a loop at the top into the top of the cork.  It remains to put a string into the toy.  Using this technology, you can create not only a dog, but also a cat and even Santa Claus.  Show your imagination and don't be afraid to create. </p><h2>  Flower pot </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from plastic corks" class="if uuid-2347831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347831.jpg"></div><p>  Do you think it's impossible to create a craft from corks from plastic bottles?  It is foolish to doubt human imagination, because it is limitless.  Therefore, there are many ways to use caps from plastic bottles.  For example, they can decorate an unpresentable pot.  With the help of colored caps and a glue gun you can make things of stunning beauty.  You can make the pot plain, create a pattern or lay out the covers in a chaotic manner.  And you can use not only plastic but also iron covers and even wine corks to create such a product. </p><h2>  Plate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from corks from plastic bottles" class="if uuid-2347832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347832.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes it‚Äôs a pity to put glassware on the table, because it can break.  If you have a noisy party and don‚Äôt want to use disposable tableware, you can create interesting crafts from plastic corks.  Consider an example of making a plate.  To create it, you need to make a template.  We cut a circle out of cardboard and put it in tight rows of lids.  To make the plate more interesting, you can lay out the covers in sectors, dividing them by color.  When you have fixed the bottom, you can glue the covers.  Now you need to increase the height of the workpiece.  Row after row, in a checkerboard pattern, you need to erect a plate of wall.  According to this scheme, you can make both a small saucer and a large plate for snacks. </p><h2>  Panel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from traffic jams" class="if uuid-2347833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347833.jpg"></div><p>  Go decorate the nursery, but don‚Äôt know what?  You can use bright colored caps from plastic bottles.  Such material is perfect for making panels.  How to make a decorative decoration on the wall?  First you need to create a wireframe.  It is advisable to make it out of wood.  You can make any shape.  It can be a triangle, square, rhombus, circle, star, etc. Now you should put the finished shape in any container.  In a small bowl, mix gypsum or cement.  Now you need to pour the prepared substance into the mold.  Shake the walls of the frame a bit to let out excess air.  When the solution begins to thicken, you can immerse the lids in it.  At this stage, you need to show imagination.  You can create a picture from the covers, lay out the figure of a cartoon hero or any animal.  Create a silhouette or just a beautiful abstraction.  Do not worry if you do not have enough covers of the desired color.  You can always paint plastic with acrylic.  After the panel hardens, you can colorize it.  If this is not required, attach a loop to the back of your product and you can hang the finished work on the wall. </p><h2>  Clock </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from traffic jams" class="if uuid-2347834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2347834.jpg"></div><p>  Plastic covers can decorate any product.  For example, decorate an old watch.  If you have a watch that has long lost its dial, but they still have a case, you can upgrade the product.  Take plastic covers of different colors.  It is desirable that the colors blend well with each other.  If necessary, you can even repaint the covers.  Now place the blanks on the dial.  You can do this in two ways.  In the first embodiment, the lid should be laid out with the convex side up, and in the second case, the convex side down.  Choose the option you like best and attach the covers to the plastic with a hot gun. </p><p>  You can make watches in another way.  For example, remove the clockwork and attach it to the wall.  Now, using the ruler, you need to make serifs and mark the space on the wall in the same way as it is done on the dial.  And now each figure needs to be laid out from the covers.  Such a watch will look very stylish if made in black. </p>
