Some perceive it as negative.  But this is not at all true.  Moreover, marginalization can be positive.  After all, it is a powerful incentive for human development.  Many famous personalities were marginalized.  If a person wants something very much, then sooner or later he will certainly achieve this.  Therefore, sometimes you need to be able to want something.  But marginals are often unnoticed.  The reasons for this are many.  But before you disassemble them, you need to understand the very meaning of this concept. </p><h2>  What is marginalization? </h2>

    <p>  Marginalization is a process when a person is at the junction of several <span>social groups</span> and does not feel that they belong to any of them.  This can happen due to various events: </p><ul><li>  War or revolution. </li><li>  Due to problems in society. </li><li>  Due to the presence of mental illness. </li><li>  Due to asocial or antisocial behavior. </li></ul><p>  These are the main reasons why people become marginalized.  But how exactly does this process happen?  What are the patterns of human marginalization?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  How does marginalization occur? </h2><p>  Each person experiences marginalization in different ways.  This is a very complex process that has not yet been solved by sociologists and social psychologists.  However, marginalization can begin from scratch or become a form of <span>social adaptation.</span>  Accordingly, the sign of the given process depends on this (whether it is good or bad). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Marginalization from maladaptation. </li><li>  Marginalization as a process of maladaptation. </li></ul>

    <p>  As you can see, it can be completely different.  Probably every person ever feels marginalized.  And the difference emphasizes that both criminal groups and ordinary alcoholics can belong to marginalized groups.  However, more positive examples can be given.  For example, really good revolutionaries who were supplanted by society, but at the same time created their own groups that are fighting for a place in the social structure. </p><h2>  The disadvantages of marginalization </h2><p>  Obviously, marginalization has a huge number of disadvantages.  First of all, they are associated with the psychological discomfort of a person who is between different social groups.  This is fixable.  Moreover, you can get used to it.  But this point must be taken into account.  There are also such disadvantages of marginalization: </p><ul><li>  Deterioration of self-esteem. </li><li>  The decline in social status. </li><li>  Difficulties of survival. </li><li>  Lack of stability. </li></ul><p>  These are the disadvantages of marginalization.  This is a difficult process for humans.  In fact, a person needs to undergo socialization anew if he suddenly finds himself at the junction of social groups in which he is not fully accepted as a full member.  And in another, he was generally kicked out for inconsistency with social norms.  And so it turns out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The benefits of marginalization </h2><p>  Marginalization has many advantages.  Many people find themselves in a rather low <span>social position.</span>  But since everything remains stable, they do not seek to change anything.  When a person is marginalized, he feels a rather strong threat to his well-being.  And so he goes to marginalized groups.  If they can win their place under the sun, then a man is on a horse. </p><p>  Marginalization can also become an incentive for the development of a person independently, without entering into these groups.  We will talk about them further.  In this case, this process provokes a sharp increase in a person.  If he decides to tie with a past life, then he may have quite a strong success.  There are many examples that confirm this. </p><h2>  Marginalized groups </h2><p>  What are marginal groups?  These are associations of marginals.  They characterize such a phenomenon as marginalization of society.  The more such groupings turn out to be, the more pronounced this phenomenon is in its social structure.  Too much marginalization indicates a restructuring of society.  The main reasons for the marginalization of society are precisely the phenomena associated with a change in the social system.  For example, war, revolution, unemployment, and so on. </p><h2>  Marginalization in Russia </h2><p>  In Russia, marginalization is quite widespread.  Since the country is large enough, it cannot be considered as a full-fledged large social group.  In any case, there are divisions between regions that have completely different psychological characteristics.  Anyway, Russia is a synthetic state.  There are few ethnic Russians in it.  But there are many peoples of other nationalities.  All <span>this exacerbates the</span> processes of marginalization in our society. </p>

    <p>  Another reason for marginalization, which is even stronger in intensity, is alcoholism.  This social evil is condemned by society - yes.  But, on the other hand, drinking alcohol has long been in our culture. </p><p>  Do you know the secret of the French or Germans who drink but do not become alcoholics?  This is what they do not approve of the first <span>stage of alcoholism.</span>  For us, Friday drinking is considered absolutely normal.  But narcologists say that drinking more than once every two weeks inevitably leads to alcoholism and, as a result, marginalization.  In general, the frequency of use plays a much more important role than quantity.  Although the latter also affects.  In general, they do not know how to drink in moderation with us.  And by normal drinking we mean the first stage of alcoholism, which is very sad. </p>
