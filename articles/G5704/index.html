The resort area, located in the Caribbean Sea, boasts amazing natural attractions.  The unique underground world is its main pride and wealth.  In the country of eternal summer, there are more than five thousand karst caves, perfectly preserved in their original form. </p><h2>  Natural corner for extreme lovers </h2><p>  If you are not tempted by a relaxing beach holiday, you should go on an excursion to an interesting corner, located near the famous resort of Punta Cana, in Los Haitises National Park.  Cueva Fun Fun is considered the most mysterious cave in the world.  Locals nicknamed it "diabolical" because it takes agility and fortitude to explore the miraculous sights.  Fun karst cave is a klondike for extreme lovers and those who love to tickle nerves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave funky fun dominican republic reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2140246.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The oldest miraculous monument in the world </h2><p>  According to scientists, this is one of the oldest caves in the world, whose age exceeds twenty million years.  Underground layers were washed away by the stormy waters of the rivers, which was the reason for the appearance of a giant karst cavity with numerous tunnels connected to each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Formed as a result of the flow of a river that has broken its way, the amazing Fun-Fun cave has a limestone structure. </p><h2>  Landmark of interest to scientists </h2><p>  This one of the longest caves in the world has a length of about 38 kilometers, but only eight of them have been well studied by scientists, confident that it will still bring many surprises.  Such an unusual name for the underground space was due to its main inhabitants - bats, which make wings with sounds that resemble, in the opinion of the Indians, the phrase "fun-fun." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave fun fun reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2140235.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The cave, which is of interest to scientists, keeps cave paintings that amaze the imagination of contemporaries.  At the entrance, you can find petroglyphs reminiscent of the ancient culture of the Indians, and in the depths of the dungeon - pictograms related to modern culture.  In addition, there are scary stone idols everywhere that have survived to this day. </p><h2>  What you need to know about an excursion into the underworld? </h2><p>  To get to the cave Fun-Fun, you have to go a long way.  Hard trials are waiting for the excursionists: horseback riding, climbing steep slopes, fording a turbulent river. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Visitors descending to a 60-meter depth in special climbing equipment find themselves in an amazing world created by nature itself.

    <p>  Inside you will have to go through the spacious tunnels and overcome narrow manholes, and when the solid ground under your feet turns into slippery, you will need to hold on tightly to the stretched rope.  However, as tourists admit, the most beautiful views of a unique masterpiece are worth it to overcome so many difficulties.  Locals claim that in the Dominican Republic the most exciting is a fascinating excursion to the Fun Fun Cave. </p><h2>  The path that not everyone will overcome </h2><p>  It is worth warning in advance that small children and elderly people will not withstand all the hardships of the path, and therefore it is better for them to stay at home.  In addition, single travelers will not be able to independently explore the territory: to get inside, you need a guide and special equipment, otherwise the rest can end very sadly. </p><p>  Guests of the country get an excursion at travel agencies.  Representatives of these companies guarantee that nothing bad will happen while traveling through the underground labyrinths, which will last a whole day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The cost of the tour (its duration is more than 12 hours) does not exceed 135 dollars.  The price includes the following services: special equipment, transport, breakfast and lunch, a Russian-speaking guide, drinking water and rubber boots. </p><p>  You must bring with you a change of clothes, a swimsuit, a towel and a waterproof camera. </p><h2>  How is the tour: detailed description </h2><p>  Early in the morning, at seven o‚Äôclock, a bus departs from the hotel in Punta Cana for the Rancho Capote ranch, which takes about three hours to reach.  A light breakfast of tropical fruits awaits everyone upon arrival.  Here, all tourists are instructed before descending into a miraculous monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave fun klondike" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2140217.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Through the impenetrable jungle, on horseback, guests leave for the cave.  This is a rather extreme trip through the rainforests, and not everyone will stand it.  Many speak with displeasure about the stories of guides who are silent about some facts and embellish reality.  So, they hide from travelers that they need not only to cross the underground river, but to dive headfirst without feeling the bottom with their feet. </p><p>  In addition, you will have to walk about 40 minutes more where the horses cannot overcome the path: climb up the slippery stone paths until the guests reach the right place.  This is actually a very difficult climb that not everyone can master.  Therefore, despite the fact that tours are sold for children, they are not able to overcome this path. </p><h2>  Extreme descent to the cave </h2><p>  When tourists wet from sweat get to a failure in the mountain, the guides announce a short halt.  This is followed by a descent to a depth on a double cable, and the guides from above and below control the entire process.  To take a step into the void is quite difficult, you have to overcome your fear.  As practice shows, this is a safe event, and not a single person was injured during the extreme descent, which is one of the most vivid impressions of the tour. </p><p>  Tourists walk slowly through the underground labyrinths, making stops and lighting their way with lanterns.  Spacious halls are replaced by narrow manholes, which are not so easy to get into.  Sometimes you even have to crawl to get into another tunnel. </p><h2>  The stormy waters of the underground river </h2><p>  Tourists overcome the next obstacle in the form of <span>an underground river</span> almost by swimming: cool water gradually reaches the chest.  It is here that an interesting attraction awaits everyone, and each guest dives into the water, under a huge stone, to get into the next room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave fun fun" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2140215.jpg"></div>

    <p>  True, there is no danger in such a dive, everything is well organized, and swimming skills are not required from anyone.  After that, you need to hold on to a thick rope with your hands in order to overcome 50 meters where the bottom is not felt with your feet, and a strong current literally rips off heavy boots.  This is another adrenaline rush and a lot of impressions that remain for life. </p><h2>  The long-awaited exit </h2><p>  Gradually, the river becomes shallow, and tourists get out of the Fun-Fun cave <span>(Dominican Republic), the photo of</span> which you can‚Äôt do with a regular camera.  At the exit (and a steep wooden staircase leads to it) everyone meets a stone idol - a dragon, hand-carved by the Indians from a huge boulder several thousand years ago.  Caressed by the sun's rays, he mysteriously looks at the arrivals, as if recalling that not all the secrets of the underground labyrinths are well understood.  On earth, tourists are given a jar of ice beer or Coca-Cola to choose from.  Everyone is waiting for a shower, after which you can change clothes and have lunch.  Rested admiring guests, sorting out their phobias and fears, return to the hotel. </p><p>  It does not matter that many failed to make high-quality photographs: for 1770 rubles.  ($ 30) you can buy a disc shot by an operator who captured every step of the tourists. </p><h2>  Fung Fun Cave (Dominican Republic): positive reviews </h2><p>  Guests who overcome fear and descended into the underworld, enthusiastically admit that they felt like real real primitive people.  It is an amazing feeling to be aware of yourself as a pioneer and discoverer.  Many note the unique microclimate and amazing silence, which is broken only by the sounds of bat wings and the mysterious bursts of groundwater.  In the dim light, luxurious stalagmites and stalactites form the most incredible pictures in the imagination, and the heart literally freezes with delight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cave fun fun dominican" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2140219.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Here, hiking trails are not decorated with strong railings and there is no beautiful illumination, as in other, more famous caves.  However, this is a real underground world, exactly the same as it was millions of years ago. </p><h2>  Fung Fun Cave: negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the negative aspects, as already mentioned, vacationers note that before the tour they are incorrectly informed of many points.  Few people talk about the need to take a waterproof camera with you, because you have to dive headlong into the turbulent waters of the underground river in the Fun Fun cave.  Photos in such extreme conditions, few will be able to take, and most simply will not be able to capture amazing beauty. </p><p>  When riding a horse, hold your hands on the saddle so as not to fall into the dirt.  When descending into the underground kingdom, there is no time even to think about taking unique moments as a keepsake, and inside the underground kingdom it is very dark and wet.  However, if there is no special camera that can withstand shock and moisture, then you can do with a waterproof case. </p><p>  Tourists note one more unpleasant moment: no one reports the need to change into bright tarpaulin overalls and boots.  Also, before descending into the cave of Fun Fun, a helmet with a flashlight is also issued.  All personal belongings have to be left in lockers.  Such equipment is mandatory for everyone, but the clothes most often get a much larger size than necessary. </p><p>  There are cases when tourists already on the spot refused an excursion, and they were sent to the hotel with a guide. </p>
