Household amenities are created by utilities, for which they charge an appropriate fee, and people do everything else with regard to improving comfort themselves.  When a small child appears in the family, every trip to the bathroom or toilet is accompanied by requests to turn on the light, so one of the parents must help.  The outputs are all different, while many decide to connect a motion sensor to the light bulb. </p>

    <h2>  What is this device? </h2><p>  You heard about him, maybe even more than once, but most likely you do not really understand his purpose and features.  Connecting a motion sensor for lighting allows you to automatically turn on the light if a person appears in his field of vision.  You can describe the principle of its action in general terms.  When the appearance of activity is observed in the controlled area, the motion sensor relay closes the electric circuit, due to which the light is turned on.  Turning off the device is carried out some time after the disappearance of a person from the field of view of the sensor, it is set individually. </p><h2>  IS-215 </h2><p>  Before we consider the connection diagram of the motion sensor, it must be said about which models can be used for such purposes.  For example, the IS-215 security sensor may be a good option.  Its standard power supply is 12 volts with a normally closed group of contacts.  You can connect a light control circuit to it, which will then be installed in the room of interest.  In this case, the connection scheme of the motion sensor with a rather simple principle of operation is chosen: when there is some activity in the field of view, the circuit is closed, which leads to the inclusion of lighting devices connected to the sensor.  If there is no movement, the circuit opens automatically, turning off the lamp. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The disadvantage of such a solution </h2><p>  The sensor works well.  If you use it in a restroom, then at the entrance there is an automatic inclusion of lighting, and a minute after it leaves the light goes out smoothly.  In this case, there is only one drawback, but it is very significant: if you stay motionless in the toilet for a minute, the light goes out, so you need to at least move your hand to extend the time.  A faint click of the relay indicates that the sensor has detected movement. </p><h2>  DD-008 </h2><p>  If you are afraid of the complicated motion sensor connection diagram, you can buy a ready-made device - DD-008.  Its feature is the presence of a pair of hinges that rotate the sensor.  Such a device is placed so as to maximize cover the room of the bathroom. </p><p>  This sensor option has adjusting settings: the time interval of shutdown, sensitivity and level of illumination.  The first parameter is used to set the time during which the light will remain on from the moment of detecting movement.  Its limits are from ten seconds to seven minutes.  The level of illumination depends on the time of day.  If during daylight hours the sensor detects movement, but at the same time there is enough natural light in the room, it does not work.  This is the logic.  After all, in the daytime in a well-lit room, you do not need to turn on the light.  Sensitivity is another adjustment setting.  The higher this parameter, the faster the sensor fires. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Operation problems </h2>

    <p>  After a week, for many, such <span>a connection scheme for a motion sensor for lighting,</span> as described above, may fail.  The device may burn out, just like the <span>incandescent lamp</span> used in the lampshade.  Typically, the thyristor burns in the control circuit.  The fact is that it is inappropriate to use discharge lamps to connect the sensor.  Due to burnout of the filament of the lighting lamp, a current surge occurs, which is similar to a short circuit.  If there are no further fuses in the load circuit, this will result in the loss of the thyristor. </p><p>  You can unify the light control scheme for any lamps.  A relay circuit is convenient, but there is no point in developing it yourself, you can buy a turnkey solution, namely the DD-009 sensor.  The motion sensor connection diagram implies the mandatory use of protective devices in the form of fuses, otherwise the manufacturer does not guarantee reliable operation.  Some install directly into the device housing both the fuse and the <span>neon lamp.</span>  DD-009 differs from DD-008 by the presence of only a couple of settings - the length of the delay for turning off the light and sensitivity.  For a restroom, such a set is enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the moment, there is such an extensive range of motion sensors on sale that it simply does not make sense to solder light control circuits.  And such an acquisition solves a rather important task - no one will need to constantly take care of turning on and off the lights in the bathroom and toilet. </p><h2>  What does the market offer? </h2>

    <p>  The market offers a huge variety of motion sensors.  There is a separate view for each specific task.  For example, some devices are best installed in the corridor or other room through which they often pass, but do not linger there.  Motion is detected by the sensor, and the delay time of the light on is kept to a minimum.  It is absolutely impossible to install such a device in the bathroom or toilet, otherwise for constant lighting in the room you will need to make some kind of movement.  That is why it is so important to look into the passport of the device in order to study its characteristics before use in each individual case.  As the main parameter that you need to focus on, you can call the duration of the delay turning off the lights after the cessation of movement in the room. </p><h2>  Where to install? </h2><p>  The connection of the motion sensor to the bulb should be made depending on the parameters of the room and the location of the doors.  There is one important rule: the device responds well to any movement, but not to a direct approach or distance from it.  That is why it is best to install it on the ceiling or on the side wall.  He must necessarily capture the opening door with his field of vision, then he will fire before the person enters the room. </p>

    <h2>  Closed room </h2><p>  You can consider the case when it is necessary to install the sensor in the corridor with several doors and without windows.  In this case, the absence of window openings is even convenient, since there is no need to configure different levels of illumination.  It is quite appropriate sensor that triggers with every movement in the corridor, regardless of the time of day.  If there is one door on each side, the task is a little complicated, since simultaneous control of all of them is required so that a person entering the corridor does not fall into the darkness. </p><p>  For example, the connection diagram of the Legrand motion sensor involves its installation in the corner of the room, since it has a 120-degree view.  In the middle of the wall, it should not be mounted, as this will lead to the loss of one door from the field of view.  In this case, when you open three doors, the light will turn on immediately, and for the fourth, some delay will be noted. </p><h2>  Staircase </h2><p>  The stairwell is illuminated due to the fact that the sensor is mounted on the wall or ceiling above the staircase so that the entire stairwell is in its coverage area.  Lighting devices should be mounted in the same way.  For lighting in this case, the period can be set small - 1-3 minutes, this will be enough. </p><p>  Now popular are IEK devices.  The connection diagram of the IEK motion sensor involves the installation of certain parameters for it.  The sensitivity should be in the absence of light maximum, and at some level of lighting - medium or minimum.  A multi-story building requires a special <span>lighting plan.</span>  If the building has three floors, then two sensors are required, if four - three sensors.  When fixing movement on some part of the ladder, the whole path for a person will be illuminated with an appropriate device.  You will be able to go down and climb the fully-lit stairs. </p><h2>  Utility rooms </h2>

    <p>  In utility rooms or in storage rooms, the motion sensor connection scheme involves installing it above the front door or a little to the side, it all depends on what layout the particular room differs in.  It is necessary to configure the device so that the interval for turning off the light is maximum, and the response threshold should be selected depending on a constant level of illumination.  When a person appears in the room, the sensor is activated, and the light will burn for 10-15 minutes.  If a person needs more time, then you can wave your hand so that the light continues to burn further.  If there are racks in the room or its division into several rooms, the connection scheme of two motion sensors or a larger number of them is used.  With the correct installation of the detectors, the convenience for a person in the room will be maximized. </p><h2>  Street lighting for car parking </h2><p>  Connecting a motion sensor to a spotlight is appropriate for lighting large spaces on the street.  The searchlight is selected depending on the required power, that is, the brightness of the lighting that is needed, and it should be fixed at a sufficient height near the parking lot.  The sensitivity of the sensor should be medium or minimal, which excludes the inclusion of light in the daytime.  And the operating time should be maximum, that is, 10-15 minutes, depending on the specific model.  If movement is detected in the parking area, the spotlight will turn on for 10-15 minutes.  The use of such a sensor brings additional benefits in the form of scaring away unwanted guests who entered the parking lot, because a bright light that suddenly turns on will frighten off intruders. </p>

    <h2>  Installation Features </h2><p>  The motion sensor should be connected to the bulb so that the <span>Fresnel lens</span> - the main element of this device - was free from various objects that could block the view.  For a motion sensor, the viewing angle is the main characteristic.  Fresnel lenses are embossed films or sheets that are placed around the circumference.  Under their control is a fan division of the observation area.  These lenses receive, focus and change infrared rays, including a sensor located in the back of the device.  If necessary, it is possible to limit the radius of observation of the lens due to the fact that individual segments of the ‚Äúfan‚Äù will be covered with insulation tape or self-adhesive. </p><p>  This is how the infrared motion sensor works.  The connection diagram in this case is selected depending on the tasks.  You can consider some of the most convenient options. </p><h2>  Device connection </h2><p>  The connection diagram of the security motion sensor, as well as the lighting one, is usually depicted directly on the device body.  Three wires come out of the device itself, which are connected to the junction box.  The colors of the wires are blue, brown, and red.  They may be different, but the connection diagram of the motion sensor is traditionally given for the wires of the above colors. </p><p>  It is possible that you will need a left control switch, which will work in parallel with the sensor.  This is often needed in rooms where it is sometimes required to keep the light on for a fairly long time.  In this case, the switch will be in the ‚Äúon‚Äù position, then the light will be on continuously.  Otherwise, it will light up only when the device is triggered. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Connecting two motion sensors is also a rather difficult task, since they must be connected in a circuit with one lighting device.  When all installation work is completed, you must check the operation of the device.  If the light in the room turns on immediately after you enter there, then you made the settings correctly. </p><p>  Now you know how to connect a motion sensor for lighting.  All the best! </p>
