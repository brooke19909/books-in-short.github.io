In this regard, the resorts of China are also gaining popularity and are gradually becoming known throughout the world, since a huge number of historical monuments of architecture and ancient architecture attract many thousands of tourists to this region. </p><p>  Among the most visited cities of this country, the cities of Xi'an and Chengdu are in first place, since a large number of monuments of spiritual culture are concentrated in them.  Xi'an was once the ancient <span>capital of China,</span> so there are still several large palaces where the Emperors of the Celestial Empire once sat.  The so-called "Silk Road" also began from here, when hundreds of merchants rushed to the northwest for trade with other states. </p><p>  In addition, the resorts of China are famous for their beautiful and picturesque places, among which you can not ignore the only tropical island of the country - Hainan.  Here you can visit the magnificent Lu Huen Tou Park, which means Deer Mountain.  Park "End of the World", "Island of the Apes", as well as "Butterfly Gorge" will be an excellent place for excursions and get new, vivid, memorable for a lifetime of impressions.  There are two large urban centers on this island - Haikou (the capital) and Sanya.  The latter is a seaside resort where you can relax and sunbathe.  Here is the famous Xinglong bell, which serves to purify consciousness and immerse into a meditative state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Resorts in China are also distinguished by the presence of geothermal springs, since there are a lot of them in this region.  When you make an excursion, you will be required to offer to try real Hainan delicious tea, as well as taste real coffee. </p><p>  Keep in mind that China‚Äôs seaside resorts are best visited from mid-August to the end of September, because it is at this time that the warm current makes the <span>Yellow Sea the</span> most attractive destination for tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  It should be noted that in China you will find a large number of health resorts, since a favorable climate, as well as developed infrastructure, allows you to perfectly improve your health in these places.  Fans of marine entertainment will also find here a great variety of diverse pleasures, among which surfing, windsurfing, and jet skiing are especially popular. </p><p>  If you like the steep slopes of the mountains with snow-white caps and beautiful picturesque landscapes, then the ski resorts in China will suit you perfectly.  In the Himalayas, dozens of resort areas are already equipped, among which are Yabuli, Jinguetan and Baidakh.  There are even sports tracks with a length of over 20 kilometers.  China's ski resorts take first place in the length of pistes throughout Asia.  Convenient sports equipment can be rented, and comfortable lifts will please tourists with their convenience and safety.  Picturesque nature and fabulously beautiful mountains will cause a truly sense of delight and joy among all who visit these interesting places. </p><p>  In conclusion, it should be said that Chinese resorts continue to attract tens of thousands of tourists annually from around the world.  An important feature of the tourism business in this republic is that you can come here at any time of the year, since a very large number of attractions and antiquities are concentrated here.  That is why if you have the opportunity to travel, be sure to visit this region, which will leave you with positive impressions and emotions for many years. </p>
