Maids are cleaned once every few days and often only after the guests contact the reception. </p><p>  There are various opinions regarding nutrition.  Tourists note that a variety of meat dishes are not enough for all guests.  Side dishes are represented by a wide assortimenot.  Stewed vegetables are also available.
