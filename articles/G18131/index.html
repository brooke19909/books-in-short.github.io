    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  People vacationing in Coral Beach 5 * in Paphos leave very good reviews, because this complex is gorgeous and the service is appropriate.  Here are the key features tourists note: </p><ul><li>  <em>Territory</em>  Huge, well-groomed, all in flowers and greenery.  It is located on a slope, which led to the outlandish architecture and stylistic design of the complex - small ornate stairs, waterfalls, jugs, hanging plants everywhere. </li><li>  <em>The beach</em> .  Mostly sandy, although pebbles are found.  The beach is private, closed from outsiders, so there is always enough space for vacationers on it.  The entrance to the sea is convenient and gentle, the depth does not start immediately - convenient for vacationers with children. </li><li>  <em>Food</em> .  The assortment is decent, the dishes are cooked with high quality and delicious.  They serve both delicious delicacies and healthy ‚Äúsimple‚Äù foods like oatmeal, cereal, soups, boiled meat, steamed vegetables.  For children there is a separate menu and a personal buffet.  By the way, the restaurants have a very loyal policy!  All-inclusive guests are allowed to take food with them, which is generally unacceptable in other hotels. </li><li>  <em>Good location.</em>  Do not want to take "all inclusive"?  It‚Äôs not necessary!  A stone's throw from the hotel is a large supermarket with a huge selection of goods at affordable prices, as well as several wonderful taverns and bars. </li><li>  <em>Apartments</em>  Fully comply with the claimed description and photos.  If possible, it is better to take a room with a sea view.  Travelers claim: the sight of the sun setting in the sea is worth the overpayment. </li><li>  <em>Service</em> .  In each comment about Coral Beach 5 * (Cyprus, Paphos) left on this topic there are a few words.  The staff at this hotel cannot but impress.  The hotel staff speaks five languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Greek, German, French, English and Russian.  They are not only professional, but also friendly - they treat every guest here as an expensive and long-awaited guest.  They even give you the opportunity to independently determine the cleaning schedule in your apartment.  Maids will come when guests are comfortable. </li><li>  <em>Thoughtful leisure.</em>  In this hotel everyone will find something to do.  People having a rest with children say that they simply took the kids to a mini-club, where teachers took care of them all day (there are Russian-speaking specialists there too).  The young guests there arrange a varied cognitive and entertaining program - every time they go there with pleasure. </li></ul><p>  In general, the reviews once again allow us to make sure that the hotel is really as good as it seems at the first glance at it.  So Coral Beach Hotel &amp; Resort Cyprus is a great option for people who want to spend their holidays with chic and luxury. </p>
