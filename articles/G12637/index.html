They surround them with their life, creating comfort in the home.  These include tea houses.  With your own hands to make such a miracle is not difficult.  After all, this requires a minimum set of materials and a bit of free time. </p><h2>  What is it and what is it for? </h2><p>  Each kitchen always has tea bags.  Many manufacturers make it in individual packaging so that it does not absorb moisture and odors.  Mistresses prefer to store them in factory boxes.  But you can do otherwise and transfer packages to the tea house.  With your own hands, the created trifle will help not only to organize the space in the kitchen, removing boring packaging, but will also delight many guests who come to mourn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tea house in the form of a stove" class="if uuid-2345435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2345435.jpg"></div><p>  At their core, tea houses are the same boxes, but decorated in the same style with the entire kitchen.  They have a vertical orientation.  Below them is a convenient window through which it is so easy to get bags.  In the upper part there is a lid that allows you to conveniently replenish supplies for the preparation of this drink.  So how do you make a house for <span>tea bags</span> with your own hands?  Everything is quite elementary, the main thing is to choose the appropriate method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From an old tea box </h2><p>  Some manufacturers on tea packets make special windows through which it will be convenient to get bags if you put the box in an upright position.  This can serve as an ideal preparation for our tea house.  You can perfectly decorate this ordinary package with your own hands. </p><p>  For work, we need: </p><ul><li>  harvesting; </li><li>  thick white paint; </li><li>  some cardboard; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  old newspaper; </li><li>  beautiful paper napkins; </li><li>  water based varnish. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tea house decoupage" class="if uuid-2343117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2343117.jpg"></div><p>  First, paste a box over with pieces of an old newspaper.  Thus, the basis for further decoration will be obtained.  In the upper part, you need to make an opening lid that will simplify the process of loading new tea bags into it. </p><p>  Then, when the glue dries, we cover the entire product with a dense white paint.  This will be a kind of primer for the workpiece.  We cut and glue the roof from cardboard, primer it and paint it brown.  When the element is ready, glue it to the workpiece so that you can then open the house from above. </p><p>  Now it remains to turn on the flight of fancy and decorate the product.  Many craftswomen do this using the decoupage technique.  A tea house decorated with this technique using your own hands looks simply magnificent, and you need to do very little work for this.  We'll talk more about decoupage a bit later, when we analyze all the options for manufacturing blanks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cardboard Accessory </h2><p>  You can create a tea house from scratch.  To do this, you need thick cardboard, paper, glue, scissors.  First, create a pattern on a piece of paper.  It should be in the form of a vertical square column with an inner perimeter slightly larger than the perimeter of the tea bag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard tea house" class="if uuid-2345436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2345436.jpg"></div><p>  An example of such a pattern is shown in the photo above.  But since this is a creative process, you can improve it at your discretion. </p><h2>  House assembly sequence </h2><p>  To begin with, all the elements of the pattern must be applied to cardboard and cut them out.  Then we take paper and cut narrow strips from it, which will serve as a connecting link for the walls.  We coat them with glue, and glue them on the inside of the workpiece.  This will help us hide the seams. </p><p>  Next, we collect the triangle.  It will be the roof of our tea house.  At the last stage, it remains to stick the bottom.  After that, it is recommended to paste over the entire blank with thin white paper to create an excellent basis for further decoration. </p><h2>  The most reliable tea house </h2><p>  If you do not trust cardboard and have at least minimal wood skills, you can try making a tea house yourself out of plywood.  The drawing of the workpiece is presented in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself cardboard tea house" class="if uuid-2342982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2342982.jpg"></div><p>  You need to transfer it to a plywood sheet and use a jigsaw to cut out all the details.  You can fasten them together with carpentry glue, or any other that is suitable for working with wood. </p><p>  When the glue dries, you can proceed to further processing the workpiece.  It must be primed with a special wood product, and then coated with white water-based paint.  After that, you can safely proceed to decorate your new kitchen accessory. </p><h2>  How to decorate a tea house? </h2><p>  The answer to this question may be the simplest: as you wish.  This is exactly the moment where there is no limit to creative imagination.  Any materials at hand can be used: </p><ul><li>  decorative napkins; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  lace; </li><li>  colored paper; </li><li>  paints; </li><li>  plasticine and salt dough; </li><li>  polymer clay; </li><li>  plywood blanks; </li><li>  cereals; </li><li>  eggshell; </li><li>  artificial flowers. </li></ul><p>  This list goes on and on.  We will consider the most popular tea house decoration techniques. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY tea bag house" class="if uuid-2343010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2343010.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage or fake painting </h2><p>  This technique is very popular among craftswomen.  With its help, you can create real masterpieces in any style.  The main thing is to find a suitable decorative napkin.  They saw everything in the store, and many use beautiful napkins with colorful drawings at home.  It is their needlewomen who transfer to their products. </p><p>  This is done as follows: the napkin needs to be disassembled into layers.  For work, the uppermost one on which the drawing is applied is useful.  The necessary piece of motive is cut out and is tried on to the place where it will need to be glued. </p><p>  Then we coat this section of the workpiece with glue and apply the decorative element to it as quickly as possible.  This must be done before the thin paper becomes wet with glue, otherwise it can be ruined. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="E3AY8ak-X58" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3AY8ak-X58" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/9/1/1691.jpg"></div><p>  When the entire workpiece is decorated, it must be covered in several layers with water-based varnish and allowed to dry thoroughly. </p><h2>  Applique </h2><p>  Now you know how to make a tea house with your own hands, but you also need to decorate it.  You can recall the lessons of labor in kindergarten and school.  We often made different applications on them.  Why not apply these skills in adulthood? </p><p>  On the workpiece, you can create a wide variety of compositions in one style solution with the design of the entire kitchen.  Colored paper and glue are useful for this. </p><p>  You can supplement the product with ready-made artificial flowers, beads, cereals.  The use of lace in the design of a tea house looks quite original.  It‚Äôs not difficult to glue it with your own hands, but to surprise others with such a craft is easy. </p><h2>  The combination of different techniques </h2><p>  Needleworkers rarely use technology alone to decorate their products.  They try to combine the incompatible in order to achieve the maximum decorative effect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tea house with your own hands" class="if uuid-2343012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2343012.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, you can also use decoupage to create a general background for the product, and then make decorative accents using other elements.  For example, a prepared egg shell creates an excellent impression of masonry, and small cardboard bricks glued around the frame will create an impression of volume.  Thin lace can be glued from the inside to simulate the curtains on the windows. </p><p>  Now you not only know how to make a tea <span>house</span> yourself <span>from cardboard</span> or plywood, but you can also decorate it in accordance with your tastes and the overall design of the kitchen. </p><p>  This cute little thing will become a highlight that will bring with it to the house a little warmth and comfort, especially created with your own hands.  Having tried to create such a thing once, you will know what to present to your family and friends, because such an craft will always come in handy in any kitchen. </p>
