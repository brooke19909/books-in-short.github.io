Yogurt Maker Recipes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Household appliances of various kinds make life much easier.  Over the past few years, a large number of new products have appeared, which we did not even know about before, but now we can‚Äôt imagine how to do without them. </p><p>  So, bread machines and crock-pots began to appear relatively recently, but they were widely used precisely because of their low cost and practicality, which allows them to spend significantly less time on simple everyday tasks.  Redmond RYM M5401 yogurt maker belongs to the same category of kitchen appliances.  Reviews about it will help to make up the big picture, is it worth buying such a kitchen assistant yourself.  For completeness of the analysis, we will first analyze what the manufacturer promises regarding it and why this device is needed at all. </p><h2>  What is a yogurt maker for? </h2><p>  As in the case of a multicooker, a yogurt maker can be used not only for preparing yogurt directly.  It is designed to turn fresh milk and the ingredients added to it into a variety of dairy products.  It all depends on what kind of additives and starter cultures will be used in the assembly of the workpiece mixture. </p><p>  As a result, it is possible to significantly reduce the cost of obtaining finished dairy products if you often use them in cooking or as an independent dish.  Yogurt maker Redmond RYM M5401, the price of which ranges from 2.5 thousand rubles, quickly pays off and does not hit the family budget.  Many have already appreciated this advantage. </p><p>  Sometimes the function of cooking yoghurts is also in other kitchen appliances, for example, in multicookers, but it is best to use devices for their intended purpose, since in this case you can achieve the best result and taste of the finished product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What you will find in the package </h2><p>  Redmond has long established itself as a manufacturer of equipment of a predominantly premium price segment, so the packaging is made in the appropriate rich style.  This is a black matte background, on which the device itself is depicted in full color, and its characteristics and main advantages are listed.  On the upper part is a plastic handle, which allows you to easily bring the purchase home if the kitchen appliances store does not provide the package of the required size. </p><p>  Inside, everything is packed with high quality, since the glass items are included in the delivery.  These are directly 8 glasses in which various milk will subsequently be prepared. </p><p>  The yogurt maker itself is made in metal with plastic elements, and this inspires confidence in strength and gives hope that washing the case will not be so difficult.  The top cover for the Redmond RYM M5401 yogurt maker is made of transparent plastic with a convenient handle.  Each individual glass also has its own small lid with a lock. </p><p>  Despite the sound packaging, it is advised to pay attention to the integrity of all elements during the purchase, because if you find chips or a broken glass already at home, you will be refused a warranty replacement of the damaged element. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the device itself, there are documents in the box, as well as a rather voluminous color glossy brochure in which you can find various recipes for the yogurt maker, recommendations for the preparation of dairy products, as well as an explanation of how its program works. </p>

    <h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  Externally, the yogurt maker Redmond RYM M5401, reviews of which will serve for a detailed quality analysis at the end of the article, looks quite simple without additional accessories.  This is a kind of container in which the bottom and edges will be heated to maintain a certain temperature in the glasses located inside it.  It can accommodate 8 complete glasses at once, however, if you wish, you can use your dishes, convenient for you volume and size.  The main thing is that it is placed inside the factory bowl of the yogurt maker. </p><p>  The internal size of the kitchen assistant is about 30 * 14 centimeters.  At the same time, the external dimensions, according to the specifications declared by the manufacturer, are 215 * 335 * 160 millimeters, which as a whole allows you to see a rather compact device in it, which will not interfere even in a small kitchen.  Her weight at the same time reaches 3.2 kilograms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, the stainless steel from which the body is made should somewhere be connected into a single element.  This joint is carefully hidden on the back side, and therefore does not catch the eye.  Moreover, it is made quite qualitatively, so you don‚Äôt have to worry that small debris and moisture can enter through it. </p><p>  The bottom of the yogurt maker is made entirely of plastic.  On the legs there are rubber pads designed to prevent her from sliding on the surface, so you can be sure that you will not knock her off the table with a careless movement, and the child will not be able to drag her by the hanging cord. </p><p>  All this suggests that this is, if not the best yogurt maker, then at least a good candidate for this title. </p>

    <h2>  Management and indication </h2><p>  Anyone, even a child, can cope with setting up and turning on the yogurt maker.  After all, for this, only a couple of simple buttons and a seven-segment LED indicator that displays only two digits are used.  Moreover, a couple in the literal sense - there are only two buttons, and this is a timer setting and heating on / off.  Everything, on this, the difficulties with switching on end. </p><p>  In order to start cooking, just select the appropriate recipes for the yogurt maker, according to them mix the ingredients in the bowl, set it inside the bowl and set the timer for the required time, then start the power button.  You do not need to do anything else, you just have to wait for the sound signal indicating the end of cooking. </p><p>  It is worth noting that sound is also provided during setup, so you will always hear if a key is pressed or not.  Although the buttons are quite soft, if not touch-sensitive, you don‚Äôt have to make much effort. </p>

    <h2>  Features of lids for glasses </h2><p>  Before cooking, after you have already prepared the mixture and filled it in glasses for a yogurt maker, special covers are put on them to keep the product fresh.  They are quite dense, which increases the storage time of the finished yogurt or other dairy product in the refrigerator. </p><p>  For convenience, they have another useful function built in, in addition to clogging containers.  By turning the upper plastic disk, you can set the date the yogurt was made in the window, as on the manufacturer‚Äôs original packaging.  This will allow you to always control its freshness, without opening the lid once again, and to be sure that the product is not spoiled. </p><p>  The date is set only in the form of a date, the month setting is not provided, since milk products are perishable products.  If you wish, you can buy individual <span>jars for the</span> Redmond RYM M5401 yogurt maker or use your own glassware suitable for the size. </p><h2>  Some Tips for Cooking Yogurt </h2><p>  It is worth remembering that dairy products, improperly prepared or stored in the wrong conditions, are a serious danger, because it is easy to poison them.  Therefore, you should follow a few simple rules that will help you always eat high-quality milk. </p><p>  Also, these tips will help to understand questions about how to choose a yogurt maker, what is important to know when choosing and what parameters will be specific enough in your case. </p><ol><li>  Use components only from trusted manufacturers.  This includes milk itself, as well as all kinds of starter cultures and flavors used to assemble prefabricated mixtures. </li><li>  Focus on the recipe book, but do not be afraid to experiment, choosing a composition that will appeal to you and your family. </li><li>  Do not use dairy products after the expiration date declared by the component manufacturer.  It is usually written on sourdough packaging.  To make it correspond to the real situation, each time sterilize glasses and lids with boiling water, as well as wash them qualitatively so that layers of the old product prepared with the help of a yogurt maker are not left on the surface.  Each hostess has a rating of the best ingredients. </li><li>  If you plan to make several glasses, it will be easier to dilute the mixture in a large container, and then pour it into a smaller container.  So it will turn out more uniform and the proportion of proportions will be uniform. </li><li>  During cooking, it is not advisable to rearrange the yogurt maker, as milk can <span><span>decompose</span></span> into its constituent components. </li><li>  Finished products should immediately be cleaned in the refrigerator.  So you will not only extend their shelf life, but also improve their taste, which Redmond RYM M5401 yogurt maker cannot do on her own.  Cottage cheese, by the way, can also be added for greater density and better taste of the finished product. </li></ol><p>  Applying these tips, you can cook always delicious yogurt.  To ensure a minimum of errors, after purchase, as soon as you leave the kitchen appliance store, carefully study the operating instructions for the appliance.  This will facilitate not only its use, but will also extend its service life and protect against critical errors in its use. </p>

    <h2>  Electrical Specifications </h2><p>  As for energy consumption, it is not so difficult to calculate the costs here.  The element used to heat the bowl, as well as the automation consume a total of only 50 watts per hour.  The average cooking time for yogurt is 8-12 hours, which means that the total cost at one time will not exceed the cost of 0.5 kilowatts of electricity.  This is a pretty good indicator for a yogurt maker. </p><p>  She tops the ranking of the best kitchen appliances in terms of energy saving for a reason, ahead of such well-known brands as Cuisinart and Tefal.  Nevertheless, in order to save money, it is recommended to fill all 8 glasses so that the area does not stand idle. </p><h2>  Positive feedback on the yogurt maker </h2><p>  Everything described above is official information from the manufacturer, and, as you know, the developer will always claim that he has the best yogurt maker, but this does not always correspond to reality. </p><p>  In this case, it‚Äôs possible to figure out what you really believe and what don‚Äôt help, reviews of users who bought the device some time ago and who had the opportunity to test it qualitatively for compliance with the declared characteristics.  On their basis, some positive points can be noted, mentioned especially often: </p><ul><li>  <em>It copes well with its task.</em>  Satisfied users note that the Redmond RYM M5401 yogurt maker, which reviews can be found on the forums quite often, has a powerful heating element, and the heating temperature is more than enough to prepare high-quality dairy products in a relatively short time.  The main thing in this case is only to properly prepare all the ingredients for heat treatment, and the yogurt maker will already do her job. </li><li>  <em>Components of good quality.</em>  Glasses for yogurt makers and their lids, which are supplied with the yogurt maker, are made of durable materials.  Glass is resistant to shock, and chips and traces of operation do not appear on it.  The covers are quite durable, plastic does not change its properties and does not have an unpleasant odor. </li><li>  <em>The presence of a sound signal.</em>  Both during setup and at the end of the program, a sound alert helps and facilitates operation.  You can always hear when exactly you should rearrange glasses with dairy products in the refrigerator, and you also know for sure whether the button worked or not. </li><li>  <em>A large total volume of containers for cooking.</em>  As noted above, each glass can hold up to 180 milliliters of liquid.  Even if you do not fill them to the brim, at one time you can make more than a liter of yogurt, which is a pretty good result. </li><li>  <em>Attractive and practical appearance.</em>  The yogurt maker Redmond RYM M5401, the silver metal of which looks good and does not spoil its image, also received inscriptions, applied with high-quality paint and not erased during cleaning of the case, which allows it to fit into any interior, even in an ultra-modern style. </li><li>  <em>The presence of a digital display.</em>  The information displayed on it simplifies the timer setting and allows you to turn on without problems even for those who use the device for the first time and have not read the instruction manual.  In addition, it displays a countdown accurate to 1 hour, which allows you to control the process. </li><li>  <em>Good equipment with a detailed cookbook</em> regarding dairy products.  Even if you have never tried to cook homemade yogurts with the instructions in the complete brochure, such an operation will not be too complicated. </li></ul><p>  In general, as can be seen from the above opinions of customers, the kitchen assistant turned out to be pretty good and gained popularity among users.  However, there are several negative points that they also noticed.  When buying a device, you should consider whether you are ready to put up with them. </p>

    <h2>  Negative moments in reviews </h2><p>  Like any other electronics, the yogurt maker Redmond RYM M5401 received not only positive reviews.  Obviously, it has its drawbacks.  For some, they may seem critical, while they will not bother others at all.  Among them, we can note the especially popular ones that are faced by more than one user and they cannot be attributed to a single marriage. </p><ul><li>  <em>Some users did not like the beep.</em>  In some parts, it is rather weak, in others it has a not quite pleasant sound, which is more annoying than carries an informative function. </li><li>  <em>Not everyone was satisfied with the length of the complete electric cord.</em>  For many, it turned out to be a little short, and had to use extension cords, which did not look very aesthetically pleasing, and in some cases not entirely safe.  Replacing it, as in most multicookers, is impossible, since it is connected directly, and not through a special connector. </li><li>  <em>A maximum timer of 12 hours</em> for certain recipes was also insufficient.  Consider this fact if you plan to cook something ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù.  As an option to solve the problem, restart the program for the required time after reaching 12 hours. </li><li>  <em>Lack of temperature control.</em>  Apparently, depending on the environmental conditions, users periodically faced with the fact that the milk mixture was simply overheating, due to which the preparation did not work properly. </li></ul><p>  These are all the disadvantages that the majority had to face.  If you do not see a serious problem in them, then you can safely buy this device. </p>
