    <p>  Poetry lovers will find out where Lermontov’s grave is.  We will talk about the most interesting places in Lermontovo and Pyatigorsk. </p><h2>  The village of Lermontovo </h2><p>  The history of the village begins in 1701.  The founder is Prince Yakov Petrovich Dolgorukov.  The village is located in the Belinsky district of the <span>Penza region.</span> </p><p>  In the XVIII century the village was officially called Yakovlevskoe.  However, local residents used the common name - Tarkhany. </p><p>  The fact is that at that time the peasants were actively engaged in small-scale trade, they sold flax, fur, and rope in the surrounding villages.  In the Tambov and <span>Penza provinces, the</span> peddlers were called Tarkhans.  Gradually, the village in everyday life began to be called Tarkhan. </p><p>  In 1794, the future grandparents M. Yu. Lermontova, E. A. Arsenyev and M. V. Arsenyev became the owners of the village. </p><p>  Modern Lermontovo still retains the charm of antiquity.  Thanks to the poet’s all-Russian fame, the state began to guard these places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The grave of Lermontov in Pyatigorsk </h2><p>  M. Yu. Lermontov was killed in a duel in Pyatigorsk in 1841. He was buried in the old cemetery, at the foot of the mountain.  The grave of Lermontov is the most important monument of the city of Pyatigorsk and its symbol. </p>

    <p>  After the burial, the poet’s grandmother E. A. Arsenyev insisted that the ashes of the grandson be transported to the family tomb of the village of Tarkhany.  There the family estate of the Lermontov-Arsenyev family was built.  It turns out that Lermontov’s grave is located in two cities.  Of course, officially the remains of the poet lies in the estate. </p><p>  Here is the old grave of Lermontov: a photo in the city of Pyatigorsk. </p><p>  It should be noted that at that time it was very difficult to achieve the reburial of a person.  But Elizaveta Alekseevna turned to the emperor and received permission. </p><p>  In the spring of 1842, the poet was buried in his homeland.  Years passed, and the grave of Lermontov gained all-Russian and worldwide fame. </p>

    <p>  The poet dedicated his first poems to the Tarhan.  He, like a seer, felt that he would die early and be buried in his native estate. </p><p>  From the earliest years, the life of the future poet was tragic.  His mother, Maria Mikhailovna, died very young.  Lermontov was still a child.  The heavy loss left an imprint of sadness and hopelessness on all of his work.  In his memory there was a bright, almost unearthly image of his mother. </p><p>  Moreover, after her death, scandals began in the family.  The poet’s grandmother, E. A. Arsenyev, blamed the death of her daughter-in-law.  Lermontov's father, Yuri Petrovich, a quick-tempered man, could not stand it and left the estate. </p><p>  The future genius remained with his grandmother.  The fact is that the father was not able to support and raise the child.  <span>Elizaveta Alekseevna</span> adored her grandson and did everything to grow from him a worthy and educated person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It was the grandmother who played a large role in the development of Lermontov's genius.  She gave her grandson a brilliant education. </p><p>  In the children's room of the future poet was a huge library.  He was constantly engaged in painting and graphics.  The first paintings of the poet can be seen in the house-museum.  He studied French, learned to dance.  He was well-read and educated beyond his years. </p><p>  Arsenieva had a tough, energetic character.  The only mistress of a huge estate, she perfectly managed affairs.  Lermontov began to communicate with his father only in his youth. </p><h2>  Museum of the poet in Tarkhany </h2><p>  Tarkhany - the museum of M. Yu. Lermontov known throughout Russia.  Located in the village of Lermontovo.  It was founded in 1939. </p>

    <p>  Here you will plunge into the atmosphere of a real Russian estate, find out how the Russian landowners lived and had fun.  You will finally see where Lermontov’s grave is located and be sure to visit it. </p><h2>  Barsky house </h2><p>  If you visit this wonderful exhibition, you will not regret it.  See the Russian estate: the former Lermontov-Arsenyevs house, a park and outbuildings.  The estate consists of many different buildings. </p><p>  Historians and literary critics restored the room where Mikhail Yuryevich lived and worked.  You can see the desk at which he wrote literary masterpieces. </p><p>  During the life of the lady, Elizabeth Alekseevna Arsenyeva, many remarkable buildings were built.  Unfortunately, there were only copies created from descriptions and illustrations of that time.  A lot was lost and destroyed after the revolution. </p><h2>  Hut </h2><p>  A brick building, restored according to old drawings, was built near the estate.  Peasants lived and worked in it, about 200 people.  Barynya, EA Arsenyeva, made strict demands on her serfs. </p><p>  However, she was fair and honest.  They say that the worst punishment that the landowner used was to shave half the head of a peasant or to cut a braid if the girl was guilty.  She did not use too harsh punishments, and the peasants respected and listened to her. </p><h2>  Church of Mary of Egypt </h2><p>  It was erected at the direction of Lermontov’s grandmother, E. A. Arsenyeva, in honor of the mother who died early M. Yu. Lermontov.  Built and consecrated in 1820.  The whole family attended the church, including the poet himself.  In addition, it has become an important center for believers in Tarkhany. </p><h2>  Arsenyev-Lermontov graves and a chapel </h2><p>  The family tomb <span>of the Lermontov-Arsenyev family</span> occupies a major place among other expositions.  By a tragic coincidence or by the will of fate, almost all of them died at a young age. </p><p>  One of the most interesting is the grave of Lermontov’s mother, M.M. Lermontova, who died on February 24, 1817.  On the grave of Maria Mikhailovna stands a monument in the form of a broken anchor - a symbol of unfulfilled hopes. </p><p>  The family life of the young spouses did not work out from the very beginning.  Maria Mikhailovna was in poor health. </p><p>  After the birth of her son, she became even more ill.  The husband began to cheat on her.  After another scandal, the woman fell into bed and died away before her eyes. </p><p>  Nearby is the grave of Lermontov (photo can be seen below), where he was transferred from Pyatigorsk, where he was killed in a duel.  The poet lived only 26 years.  The monument, mounted on the grave, is carved from black marble. </p>

    <p>  Nearby is the grave of the poet’s grandfather, M.V. Arseniev, who died in 1810. </p><p>  In 1843, E. A. Arsenyeva built a chapel over the graves of her relatives.  She died on November 16, 1845, at the age of 73.  In her declining years, she was left alone and outlived all relatives. </p><p>  At the entrance to the chapel, where Lermontov’s grave is located, there is a mighty oak planted by the poet’s grandmother after his death. </p><h2>  Church of St. Michael the Archangel </h2><p>  Built in honor of the patron saint Mikhail Yuryevich.  Consecrated in 1840, a year before the poet's sudden death.  It was in this church that the coffin of M. Yu. Lermontov from the city of Pyatigorsk was delivered.  Now it has become an important part of the museum complex and the parish church for the faithful of the village of Lermontov. </p>

    <p>  The grave of M. Yu. Lermontov also became a symbol of the Orthodox culture of Russia.  The Lermontov-Arsenievs are a deeply religious family.  They did a lot for the development of Orthodoxy in the village. </p><h2>  From the history of the museum </h2><p>  The Tarkhany Museum has a long history, closely connected with the life of the Lermontov-Arsenyev family. </p><p>  For the first time, the memory of a Russian genius was honored in 1914.  On the 100th anniversary of the poet’s birth, a school named after Lermontov was built in the village.  Researchers, literary scholars, historians and simply admirers of creativity have found out where the grave of Lermontov is. </p><p>  In 1934, Lermontov’s estate and all buildings were declared a cultural monument. </p>
