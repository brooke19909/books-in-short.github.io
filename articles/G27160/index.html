Each of them has its own name and an interesting story that the indigenous people of Northern Venice know.  Tourists enjoying local attractions come to the city, pierced by rivers and canals.  No matter how <span>Peter,</span> shrouded in fogs <span>,</span> changes <span>, bridges</span> will always be its main symbol and the object of pride of residents. </p><h2>  Passion for the culture of Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, a craze began in Russia in Ancient Egypt, and St. Petersburg was no exception.  Increased attention to the bygone civilization led to the fact that a bridge decorated in the style of the country of pyramids was built across the Fontanka.  In our article, we will consider interesting facts related to the construction of the building, about which many ancient legends are composed, and we will describe in detail where the Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egyptian bridge in saint petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1354343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unusual bridge </h2><p>  The project was unusual for the city handsome masters who created many attractions.  In 1825, the construction of a <span>picturesque bridge began,</span> which differed in appearance from the present.  All guests were greeted by gates painted with hieroglyphs, and the unusual <span>Egyptian ornament</span> surprised with its color.  The Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg was installed on supports faced with granite, and the entire structure was supported by three powerful chains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of particular interest were the four sphinxes, on whose heads a high golden crest is worn, and the appearance of the mythical animal was more reminiscent of Greek sculptures.  Egyptian creatures were portrayed with male facial features, rather than female, as in this embodiment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egyptian bridge in saint petersburg address" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1354347.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <p>  One of many legends tells that the face of the sphinx copies the face of the extremely attractive wife of Emperor Alexander I. </p><h2>  Funeral Songs </h2><p>  On August 25, the Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg, decorated with hieroglyphs, was inaugurated.  The people called this bridge ‚Äúsinging‚Äù because, when walking, we heard strange mournful sounds that made chains.  And many noted that the design in a fashionable style sang to itself a funeral song. </p><h2>  Collapse and its versions </h2><p>  In the winter of 1905, the chain structure collapsed under the squadron of the cavalry regiment, and only by fortunate accident not a single person was injured.  Only four gloomy sphinxes looked at what was happening. </p><p>  Then the inhabitants remembered the gloomy sounds and concluded that this is real rock that pursues the structure.  And experts considered the main culprits of the incident miscalculations in the design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egyptian bridge in saint petersburg photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1354365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the true reasons that the strong chains are broken are unknown.  Builders who repeatedly repaired the bridge noted the good condition of the structure as a whole.  The military was accused of swinging the structure due to a well-coordinated step in the foot, and in many textbooks the collapse of the structure is associated with the so-called resonance effect. </p><p>  Eyewitnesses to the tragedy claimed that the soldiers did not go over the bridge, but rode horses, so this version is considered very doubtful.  Contemporaries say the main cause of the accident is the fragility in the cold of the metal. </p><h2>  Mystical legends </h2><p>  The Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg since its inception has been surrounded by various legends and rumors.  The people did not skimp on fantasy, and the most fantastic explanations of the incident were put forward.  They remembered a girl deceived by the military, who in her hearts wished to fall under the ground to her offenders. </p><p>  They said that the granite blocks that faced the Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg were removed from the walls of the notorious moat in front of <span>Mikhailovsky Castle.</span>  Ostensibly, stones were originally brought from ancient temples where mystical rituals were held, and pagan gods brought down their fury on people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egyptian bridge in st petersburg reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1354357.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <p>  Another version of the catastrophe is associated with the curse of the Sphinxes, although they had nothing to do with Ancient Egypt, but the people still attributed supernatural power to them.  The sounds of chains that held the Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg, whose photo captivates with its beauty, were attributed by people to rumors to <span>mystical creatures,</span> endowing them with a prophetic gift. </p><h2>  Wooden building </h2><p>  For some time, traffic across the bridge ceased, but after the construction of a wooden crossing, which served faithfully for about 50 years, Petersburgers were restored again.  Due to inconvenience, the question arose of the construction of a new bridge.  In 1955, more than 20 projects were submitted, of which only one met all the requirements of the appearance. </p><h2>  New design with the same look </h2><p>  True, the design was simplified, but the design remained the same - in the Egyptian style.  And the former sphinxes are watching with an indifferent facial expression over passing people.  On a modern bridge, in order to avoid new troubles, the roadway slab is well fixed on nine frames. </p><p>  In 1989, another incident happened.  A truck hit a sphinx statue, a figure fell into a river and was seriously damaged.  During the restoration it turned out that the heads of the sculptures had gilding, which wore off over time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the egyptian bridge in saint petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1354343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 2004, the sphinxes returned to their original appearance, perhaps even in the hope that they would no longer make sad sounds, and would never cause the Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg to be a tragedy. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Visitors who have visited the site for the first time admire how organically the building looks on the Fontanka, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich it is so pleasant to walk both day and evening. </p><p>  Guests of the city on the Neva note that the original bridge, which cannot be passed past, attracts a fleur of mystery.  This is an amazing place for beautiful photo shoots, especially in the dark, when the faces of the sphinxes change as a result of the play of light. </p><p>  Many talk about a special atmosphere, immersed in the secrets of Ancient Egypt, and the developed imagination of tourists draws the most fascinating paintings. </p><h2>  Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg: how to get there? </h2><p>  Harmoniously blended into the city‚Äôs appearance, the bridge that spread across the Fontanka River in the Admiralteysky District of Northern Palmyra enjoys well-deserved fame among tourists. </p><p>  The nearest metro station is Baltiyskaya, and the Lermontovsky Prospekt public transport stop is located nearby.  It takes just a little to pass, and the Egyptian bridge in St. Petersburg will open to your eyes in all its splendor. </p><p>  The address of the structure is: Embankment <span>of the Fontanka River,</span> 34, 37. </p>

    <p>  Now, instead of portals, at the entrance to the bridge, stylized obelisk lights are installed, giving a special atmosphere to this place.  The original structure is an integral part of the mysterious image of the Northern capital, and the sphinxes serve as a wonderful decoration in a structure remote from the heart of the city. </p>
