It is located at Krasnodar Territory, the city of Anapa, 121 Lermontov Street. </p><p>  The office is open daily from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.  It is not far from the Black Sea coast, nearby is the square named after P. Sargsyan, the Seraphim Church. </p><p>  The general director of the company is Denis Valerievich Kharanzhuk. </p><h2>  Completed projects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="maluta-blog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Real estate in Anapa" class="if uuid-2977308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2977308.jpg"></div><p>  Deciding on the choice of a townhouse in Anapa from the developer, you can familiarize yourself with already completed projects of this company.  For example, this is a Primorsky townhouse in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Tsibanobalka with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã120 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For more than ten years of productive work, the company has acquired recommendations from dozens of customers.  It is important that in the construction of townhouses in Anapa, only high-quality building materials are used that meet all environmental and safety parameters. </p><p>  The company provides an opportunity to get a turnkey house that will be completely ready for living.  Also, the specialists of this company, erecting inexpensive townhouses in Anapa, provide service and warranty services.  The whole construction cycle will be handled by one team, which minimizes errors and force majeure circumstances.  The architectural design of the townhouse in Anapa, the preparation of design documentation, interior decoration and exterior design will be done by some specialists. </p><p>  The client has the opportunity to order an individual or typical house project from a block or any other materials.  Projects that are in the developer‚Äôs catalog have a fixed price, but can be changed at the request of the customer. </p><p>  If you want the townhouse in Anapa to be your dream home, you can come with your own project or sketch.  Professional designers and surveyors adapt it to local conditions: topography, seismic, snow load, soil.  As a result, the construction of a townhouse by the sea in Anapa will be a joint creation, which will take into account all your wishes, as well as fulfill the necessary building codes. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that making a project from scratch or changing an existing project in accordance with your wishes will not affect the final price. </p><h2>  Technology features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rex711.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Townhouses by the sea in Anapa" class="if uuid-2977312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2977312.jpg"></div><p>  The developer of townhouses in Anapa is able to keep the lowest prices compared to competitors, since it does not need additional advertising.  True, one must always remember that rising prices for building materials and inflation do not allow for a long time to fix the price.  Therefore, to find out the exact information, you will need to contact the company directly and clarify all the details. </p><p>  The company guarantees that they are able to achieve high quality new buildings in townhouses in Anapa at a relatively low price.  Here, customers are advised to opt for a monolithic frame house with block wall filling.  Used expanded clay block is considered one of the most environmentally friendly, economical materials used in the construction of cottages. </p><p>  If you are focused on the construction of frame or wooden houses, then the company recommends using these building materials in Anapa district.  The fact is that a humid and damp climate, which must be taken into account, spoils the wood several times faster than in central Russia, as well as in colder regions of the country.  In addition, the absence of subzero temperatures for a long time allows microorganisms and insects to influence the aging of a tree twice as fast on average; no treatments and chemical impregnations help them. </p><p>  Since ancient times, wooden houses have never been built in the Kuban.  The traditional technology for these places was adobe.  As a preservative, clay was used in it, which effectively protected from wear and rot. </p><p>  Of course, in our time, adobe has become an anachronism, which has many advantages compared to more modern technologies.  Therefore, the company strongly recommends the use of frame-monolithic construction, which is considered the most developed in the entire Krasnodar Territory.  This technology has a huge number of advantages. </p><p>  The developer in the construction of economy class townhouses in Anapa, depending on the volume and complexity, performs construction and finishing work in a period of four to six months.  The deadline for completion is necessarily fixed in the contract, the documents spell out responsibility for the failure to meet the deadlines for delivery of the facility. </p><p>  The company also provides interior design services.  After all, the acquisition of real estate is always an attempt to start life from scratch.  Especially if you moved to Anapa from another region.  In this case, it is all the more not worth starting a new life by observing the bare walls of the concrete box of your home.  Masters of South-Region will tell you how to perform facade and interior decoration of rooms using LEDs, plaster, multi-level ceilings, drywall, wallpaper, built-in furniture, individually adjustable lighting, other methods according to your desire. </p><p>  They will even help you make built-in furniture for any size kitchen.  In addition to interior design, your attention will be paid to the ergonomics of the workspace.  They will show you how to arrange everything in such a way that everything you need is always at hand. </p><p>  Specialists of the company note that individual design is not always expensive.  Even if you have an economy class townhouse, you can afford it. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fund-yug.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Townhouses Anapa" class="if uuid-2977309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2977309.jpg"></div><p>  The company offers two standard designs of apartments in townhouses in Anapa at a cost of 23 and 25 thousand rubles per square meter, respectively. </p><p>  In the first embodiment, after the preparation of design documentation and preparation of the site for construction work, the foundation of the tape type is poured.  Then, a monolithic frame of the bearing walls and interior partitions, attic floors are installed.  The roof is made of metal, window blocks made of metal with a single chamber package. </p><p>  Entrance metal doors with insulation are installed, the company arranges water supply, heating and sewage, ventilation system, power supply.

For example, a townhouse on Pioneer Avenue in Anapa will cost you six and a half million rubles at a cost of one square meter - more than 46 thousand.
