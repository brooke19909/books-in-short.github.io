    <h2>  As it was before </h2><p>  Earlier, <span>Ukrainian mobile operators</span> operated on the peninsula <span>.</span>  These include Life, Kyivstar and the Ukrainian ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù from MTS, as well as many others.  For several months after joining, they acted in all <span>settlements of Crimea.</span>  As a matter of fact, they are acting at the moment.  The only thing - roaming was introduced.  But the representatives of Russian cellular companies acted promptly, as a result, towers appeared in the Crimea by the beginning of summer, and SIM cards of Russian operators were on sale.  To date, by the way, several million Russian SIM cards have been purchased. </p>

    <h2>  How the calls were made </h2><p>  Calls to Crimea from Ukraine and vice versa are still being made.  So, first there are three basic characters: +38.  This is followed by the operator code.  They should be listed.  050, 099, 066 and 095 - this is MTS, which is the most popular and, accordingly, in demand.  Then - if we talk about the rating - there is Kyivstar - 097, 096 and 067. And four less popular operators are Beeline (068), Peoplenet (092), Life (063) and Intertelecom (094).  You need to dial a number exclusively with a plus sign at the beginning.  This innovation appeared several years ago, before, to call to the Crimea from Russia or another country, it was necessary to enter only the number ‚Äú8‚Äù in front of the number and code of the operator.  Earlier, and still, in order to make calls to Crimea on a landline or, as they call it, a landline phone, you also had to dial a code.  Only he was urban.  Nothing too complicated.  For example, if you need to call Alushta, then you need to dial the number ‚Äú8‚Äù, after which - 1038 and the area code.  In this case, it is 06560. In the case of other cities, the actions are repeated.  In the <span>capital of Crimea,</span> that is, in Simferopol, this code is 0652. The rest is also not too different.  Alupka has this number - 0654, exactly the same with Yalta.  Cities are nearby, and therefore the code is the same.  Evpatoria has 06569, Sudak has 06566. It can be seen that the first three digits are the same in all cases, so if you need to remember, you should keep the next one or two digits in your memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Changes in urban communications </h2><p>  The Ministry of Communications, as it became known, developed and sent to the public a draft order, according to which residents of the Crimea and the hero city of Sevastopol will soon receive Russian fixed-line telephone codes.  Accordingly, the question of how to call the Crimea began to be decided almost immediately after its occurrence.  This document implies certain changes to the numbering plan of the Russian Federation.  Thus, the long-distance code (digits - 365) is allocated in order to use it in telephone wire communication networks on the territory of the peninsula.  The code with numbers 869 will be applied in Sevastopol.  Dmitry Alkhazov, who is the deputy minister of mass communications and communications, said that subscribers will have numbers that will differ from the old ones by only one digit in the city code - if you do not take into account the country code.  For example, in Sevastopol there will be a code not ‚Äú692‚Äù, but ‚Äú869‚Äù.  In addition, instead of six digits, there will be seven. </p><h2>  Cellular Changes </h2><p>  If we talk about how to call to Crimea on a mobile phone, then here is a slightly different situation.  Experts say that there is no need to allocate any additional mobile codes, since they have sufficient numbering capacity.  But absolutely all companies that previously worked in Ukraine but now find themselves in Russia will need to renew their licenses, which will take some time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Documentation </h2><p>  It is worth noting, speaking about how to call the Crimea, that until the first of January next year, the so-called transitional period operates on the peninsula.  And this means that operators can still work under Ukrainian licenses that currently exist.  So far, only the operator Rostelecom has started its work in Crimea - directly through a subsidiary called Miranda Media.  Until the moment the frequencies appeared on the peninsula, specialists carefully prepared the frequency-territorial plan.  This information was reported by Vadim Ampelonsky, who is the press secretary of Roskomnadzor.  The preparation was completed in early June, after which the issuance of permits immediately began.  The specialist also made a reservation that the territorial administration of Roskomnadzor was being formed in Crimea.  In the capital of Russia, they are now preparing the necessary documents necessary in order to legalize a legal entity or create it.  In general, in the cities of Crimea, as well as in Sevastopol, it is already possible to purchase a SIM card, the only problem that may arise is long lines.  By the way, for one passport, which you must have with you, you can buy several cards. </p>
