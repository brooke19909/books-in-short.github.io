Everyone will find here sights that are closer to him in spirit.  There are many natural monuments as well as distinctive cultural sites.  Someone like Orthodox churches, someone wants to admire the expanses of the protected Galichy Mountain. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider the most beautiful places in the Lipetsk region, which every year attract an increasing number of tourists and pilgrims.  And also we will define automobile routes on which it is possible to reach these remarkable places. </p><h2>  Safari Park ‚ÄúKudykina Gora‚Äù, Lipetsk Region </h2><p>  Safari Park is the most popular attraction for families with children.  A huge territory that enchants with the scale of beauty and the grandeur of nature.  This is where the largest playground in the Russian Federation is located.  For children, this is by far the most attractive place where they can spend the whole day.  Countless swings, slides, labyrinths and other children's joys are located on a vast territory, covered with snow-white sand specially brought here. </p>

Following the road from this gate, you will find yourself in such magical places as the font of the source of Wisdom, the Church of St. Nicholas, the huge Trojan bull and horse, the observation deck of the beautiful bend of the Don.  This is where fishing enthusiasts can sit with a fishing rod.  The catch here will be almost one hundred percent, because there are a lot of fish on the Don.

This is a fairy-tale fair, where work is in full swing in the streets and immediately the masters demonstrate their masterpieces.  And if you want, then the masters will also teach you various crafts, for example, forging horseshoes, sculpting jugs of clay or weaving baskets of vines. </p><p>  The next interesting place in the Safari Park is the zoo.  But you can‚Äôt call him ordinary.  You will not see cells and pens here.  Animal habitats are close to natural conditions.  Almost 60 species of various animals walk in spacious enclosures, fenced by a low fence: these are camels, and kangaroos, and llamas, and horses, and many, many others.  If you wish, you can ride on a wonderful carriage that will take you right next to the walking animals.  And having bought special vegetable sets, you can feed animals from the palm of your hand. </p><p>  <span>Beautiful places of the</span> Lipetsk region are quite accessible for car travelers.  For example, the safari park is very easy to get: moving along the M4 DON highway at the 412th kilometer you should turn towards the village of Kamenka, and then follow the signs that will easily bring you to Kudykina Gora. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand ducal church" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1358950.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The Galicia Mountain Reserve </h2><p>  This natural attraction unites a huge territory located in different areas of the Lipetsk region.  The reserve cannot be called large on a global scale, but the uniqueness of this biological phenomenon is undeniable.  Flora and fauna are located in several natural areas, which is such a rarity for such a small area.  The rocky ledges of the relic Devonian limestone are covered with stunning colors that have adapted to live on stones.  There are feather grass and other steppe plants nearby.  And then there are sections of oak groves, lime trees, birch forests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Rock outcrops of limestone rocks, whose age exceeds 400 million years, are a favorite place for tourists, climbers and artists. </p><h2>  Morozova Mountain </h2><p>  Morozova Mountain is located on the left bank of the Don Valley, directly opposite the Galichy Mountain.

Here falcon-saker falcons, eagle owls, owls, eagles-burials are bred.  There is also the opportunity to visit a unique museum, where there are samples of unusual representatives of flora and fauna. </p><p>  Morozova Gora is the largest cluster in the reserve. </p><h2>  Voronov stone and Worgol rocks </h2><p>  The most beautiful places in the Lipetsk region are located in its most remote and inaccessible corners.  So Voronov stone, which is so attractive for tourists and climbers, is a secluded place far from civilization.  Large pieces of limestone hide the entrances to numerous crevices and caves.  A narrow karst cave formed by dissection is a unique place where climbers test their character and endurance for strength. </p><p>  The rocky outcrops are covered with <span>relic plants,</span> which are more characteristic of the Alpine mountains than in central Russia.  This is the Podolsk shiverkiya and the rodent of Robert. </p><p>  <span>Vorgolsky rocks</span> and Ravens stone are not far from each other.  These rocks are a favorite place for climbers.  Some stones even have their own unique names: Fox, Smoked, Big Kichi. </p><h2>  Plyushchan and Bykova neck </h2><p>  The Pluschany tract got its name from the Pluschanka river, along which it is located.  Its shore is very picturesque, since the river flows from a huge number of springs, winds around the tract and forms intricate patterns. </p><p>  "Khrizanteyimova Polyana" is a unique area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPlushenko, which is located on a steep river slope.  It is covered with bells, chrysanthemums, cores and other plants that are characteristic of Altai meadows. </p><p>  The bull's neck is a cluster of the reserve, characterized by a unique relief with heavily indented ravines and ravines. </p><h2>  Borkovsky castle </h2><p>  Manor Borki is located in the Terbunsky district of the Lipetsk region.  Once there was a whole palace complex, and Andrei Romanov owned it.  The style of the English neo-Gothic architecture in which the castle is built amazes with grandeur and beauty.  The construction of the palace ensemble dates from 1902-1903. </p><p>  To date, only a Gothic-style castle has been preserved, the material for the construction of which was rubble stone and gray stained sandstone. </p>
