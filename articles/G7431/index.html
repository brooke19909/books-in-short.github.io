For many of them, such art seems unbelievable.  None of them would refuse to decorate the interior of their room with such a product.  It turns out that there is an alternative to such work.  Perhaps few people know the new needlework technique - diamond embroidery.  Reviews of some women reveal the secrets of a new occupation. </p><h2>  What is diamond embroidery </h2><p>  Oddly enough, this sounds, the creation of hand canvases occurs without a needle and thread.  There is no need to have any special gift.  Any woman can master the skills of this type of creativity. </p><p>  The work uses so-called diamonds - plastic rhinestones or pebbles.  Due to their cut, they playfully shimmer and look quite rich.  This technique is associated with mosaic.  It is no coincidence that some women call it diamond laying.  Rhinestones are applied to the adhesive layer of the canvas base with a pattern with tweezers. </p><p>  Strass mosaic will help not only to miraculously create a monophonic surface of any object, but also to spend time interestingly, as evidenced by the reviews.  <span>Diamond embroidery</span> has already interested many women. </p>

    <h2>  Diamond Embroidery Kit </h2><p>  The set includes the following items: bags with multi-colored rhinestones, a box with grooves, tweezers, a metal ruler, an instruction table and a painting on the canvas covered with adhesive film. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each bag with rhinestones has its own number, which is tied to color.  The table shows the numbers in the corresponding figure order.  The challenge is to find the right colors and glue them carefully.  In the reviews of needlewomen on diamond embroidery, it is noted that the set is very convenient in its application. </p>

    <h2>  Calculation process </h2><p>  Before you begin the process of creation, you need to decompose the set and carefully familiarize yourself with its subjects. </p><ol><li>  Compare the location of certain colors in the picture itself with how they are numbered in the table.  The circuit itself is divided into squares, which facilitates the process. </li><li>  Select the colors that you have to work with. </li><li>  Arrange rhinestones in separate boxes.  Some needlewomen use ice molds or bead boxes for this. </li><li>  Pour the starting material for work into the tray that is attached to the kit.  Shake a little, and the rhinestones will be distributed more evenly and fit into the grooves.  Such a ribbed tray is convenient in that the grains are turned upside down in it. </li><li>  <span>The adhesive tape</span> from the drawing must be removed in parts, in accordance with the planned work.  It will be more convenient to carry out diamond embroidery.  According to the reviews of women, you can understand that this must be done.  Hands will not stick to the product and the glue layer will not dry out.  A bent piece can be cut off or pressed down well.  The quality of all work will depend on this. </li><li>  Then you can proceed to the diamond embroidery itself.  Since the picture is divided into cells, the diagram has its symbol, for example, letter A. Then you need to select the number of the corresponding color and fill the square.  After finishing the calculation of the first row, the rhinestones should be trimmed with a ruler and slightly pressed down for fixation.  Subsequent rows do as well. </li><li>  When the picture dries, it is inserted into the frame. </li></ol>

This process is very laborious and requires great patience and perseverance.  It is more suitable for those women who like to devote themselves to their hobbies for hours.  Such pastime gives deep satisfaction and calms the nervous system. </li><li>  The second method is more suitable for needlewomen who want to see the results of their work faster or simply seek to decorate the interior of their apartment. </li></ol><p>  The kit has a bag with extra glue and a stylus.  With the help of this special stick you can significantly speed up your creative activity.  Glue is applied to its tip, and rhinestones are captured. </p>

    <h2>  Some subtleties </h2><p>  For beginner needlewomen it is better to buy sets with a smaller palette of colors.  After certain skills are acquired, you can proceed to more complex pictures. </p><p>  The larger the color scheme, the more chic the product will look.  With the help of sophisticated techniques, skillful and assiduous craftsmen lay out wonderful portraits.  This is one of the most interesting facets of diamond embroidery.  Reviews of such works are exciting.  Due to the variety of shades, portraits look lively. </p>

    <h2>  Shapes and colors </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of people, diamond embroidery at first glance looks like the work that was done in the technique of cross-stitching.  This is because it is made of square pebbles. </p><p>  In mosaic kits, you can also find round rhinestones.  Diamond embroidery from round stones when hit by light just plays with a palette of their colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Diamond embroidery" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1823089.jpg" width="413"></div>

    <p>  Needlewomen with extensive experience prefer to work with a wide range of colors.  The pictures are more natural. </p><h2>  Flaws and difficulties </h2><p>  Sometimes not everything turns out as smoothly as we would like.  Difficulties also arise with such straightforward needlework as diamond embroidery.  Reviews of the craftswomen openly talk about pitfalls. </p><p>  Sometimes it seems that a rhinestone or pebble does not enter the place intended for it.  You just need to press the previous pebble more until a light click is heard.  Then insert the next strass. </p><p>  To avoid defective products, it is important to carefully inspect the material.  Even minor speckles on rhinestones can ruin diamond embroidery.  According to the reviews of women, it can be said that defective material is not excluded.  It is especially important to track this when it comes to drawings with people's faces. </p><p>  Sometimes on faceted grains unnecessary branches are found.  Such excess pieces can be carefully cut with scissors or plucked with miniature round-nose pliers. </p><p>  Some needlewomen are faced with the fact that over time the stones can fall off or move.  In order to have fewer such flaws, you need to cover the work well <span>with acrylic glue</span> after laying out the mosaic <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to the photo and reviews, diamond embroidery is of quite great interest for those who love handwork.  In online stores you can order kits for such needlework.  Although the choice is not so great, the presence of a variety of pictures is impressive.  On them you can see red roses, original bouquets and portraits of people. </p>
