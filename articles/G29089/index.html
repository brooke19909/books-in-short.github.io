Even in pre-perestroika times, tourists flocked here to climb the mountains, swim in the transparent sea, enjoy the clean air.  And the resort history of this region began much earlier. </p><h2>  Sights of Sukhum </h2><p>  Millennia ago, Abkhazia hosted colonies of ancient Greeks on its lands, then the Romans erected their fortress.  And they chose for their location the place that today is known to all as Sukhum, the capital of the republic.  He received the status of the city after 1840.  The name comes from the Turkish Sukhum-Kale.  That is what the fortress they built was called.  Su is water, and hum is sand.  Both the first and second are very many.  And excellent quality.  Those who have been here will confirm this with their reviews. </p>

    <p>  Sights of Sukhum should not be sought.  The city itself is unique and inimitable.  On the outskirts, where private houses are located, a familiar aroma is felt.  This laurel bushes are located on the side of the road.  The whole city is hidden in greenery, and so many palm trees are hard to meet elsewhere. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Fans of walking can not pass one of the picturesque places of the city - the promenade of Makhadzhir.  She is over a hundred years old.  And here, during his stay, the great Russian poet Sergei Yesenin liked to pace.  Now, groups of vacationers enjoy the view of the sea on cozy verandas, which are created in complete architectural harmony with the historical appearance of the embankment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  There are numerous mansions, hotels, restaurants and cafes.  The former Rossiya Hotel and the Shipping Company are the oldest buildings located here and recognized as the sights of Sukhum. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  You can not ignore the large Botanical Garden with a bicentennial history.  Ticket price is 140 rubles.  In the botanical garden, a rich collection of unique plants constantly accepts new pets.  Today, the fund has more than five thousand green spaces, shrubs and trees.  And after most of the garden was destroyed during the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, the first question arose about its restoration.  Tourists enjoy walking along the sandy paths hidden in the dense thickets of the most exotic representatives of the flora.  And the Caucasian linden, which celebrated its 250th anniversary, many make a wish. </p>

    <p>  Hospitality - this is what first comes to mind when Abkhazia is recalled.  Citizens of the country are very welcoming people.  You can stay on vacation in the private sector, where tourists receive not only a comfortable "shelter" for very little money, but also generous treats.  The flavors of Caucasian cuisine are in the air around the clock.  Speaking about the delicacies of national dishes, one cannot but mention the Nartaa restaurant.  He is one of the first places on the list of “Sights of Sukhum”.  This oldest institution in Abkhazia continued to receive and treat visitors even in the most difficult times in the early nineties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  About a hundred years adorned the city of Sukhumi Cathedral of the <span>Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</span>  Founded by the Greek community, it was reconstructed several times, as a result of the last of which a radiant gilded dome was installed. </p><p>  A map of Sukhum with sights will help you find Mount Trapeze, where the Monkey Nursery is located.  That is what many fans of these smartest creatures call him.  The museum of primates, hundreds of animals from South America, Asia and Africa will show guides.  By the way, the only monument to the monkey was erected on the territory of the nursery.  Ticket price - 140 rubles. </p><h2>  Theaters </h2><p>  Recalling the sights of Sukhum, one can not help but talk about the Drama Theater named after Shepherd.  A fountain with mysterious griffins was installed near the building in the forty-seventh year of the twentieth century.  Gilded creatures with the body of a lion and an eagle head spew sparkling streams of water that look so magical in the evening illumination. </p>

    <p>  The colonnade on the Sukhum Embankment, the Russian Drama Theater, the building of the Sukhumi City College are far from all the notable places in the Abkhaz capital.  Here you can go for a walk in the early morning and in the evening understand that half of the points marked in the tourist route remained unreached.  There are many surprises and secrets in Sukhum.  Sights, photos of which can be found in our article, are intriguing, causing the desire to definitely visit this wonderful land. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  In addition to excursions, here you can get the true pleasure of a “beach” vacationer.  The coastal strip for recreation stretched almost twenty kilometers along the sea.  The beaches here are very different.  To the east of the city center - Gumista, which attracts with its "wildness" and pebble-sand cover.  Another of the category without special amenities is “Doggy”.  The beach is in the center, near the promenade and cafe.  A two-kilometer Central is available for every vacationer.  There are a large number of entertainment centers, water and other attractions, rental items of inventory and catamarans, as well as coastal cafes, bars, restaurants with barbecue and homemade drinks.  And the “Lighthouse” is famous for the fact that in the sea it is quite possible to stumble upon a flock of the most heat-loving and affectionate inhabitants - dolphins.  A departmental beach in the territory of the Sukhum sanatorium, with locker rooms, deck chairs, is considered civilized.  For kids and adults - slides, riding a banana, other entertainment.  The water in this area is clean, as it is checked daily by special services. </p><p>  Hospitable and always different Sukhum.  Sights and entertainments of this city will help you to escape from the worries that sometimes we drag on vacation with our suitcases.  The purest mountain air, sweet fruits, transparent blue sea give the most wonderful mood.  And the time spent here will be imprinted not only on vacation photographs, but also in memory. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know a country like Abkhazia.  Sukhum, the sights of which we have described in detail, will appeal to every person, and the famous places will remain in memory for a long time. </p>
