All this will help to understand how faithful the organization is in front of us.  In fact, some controversial points may occur in many opinions.  Some people like certain conditions, some do not.  This phenomenon should not scare away.  So what about the company? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  First you‚Äôll have to understand what the organization is doing.  PrimoKollect receives reviews precisely as a collection company.  This is a company that collects debts from debtors.  Quite often found in modern realities, an organization whose activities attract many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primo set reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1511797.jpg"></div>

    <p>  That is, the company has no specific tasks.  PrimoKollekt is a collection organization, just remember this fact.  But what are the pros and cons of it?  For both employees and clients or debtors?  What will everyone have to pay attention to? </p><h2>  Offer from the company </h2><p>  What kind of reviews does PrimoKollect receive as an employer?  They are generally ambiguous.  However, as with most employers.  The thing is that many pay attention to the many promises of the future boss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What does PrimoKollect offer its employees?  Offers can be called standard.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  official employment; </li><li>  convenient work schedule; </li><li>  decent pay; </li><li>  social package; </li><li>  career; </li><li>  heterogeneous work; </li><li>  Friendly team. </li></ul><p>  Which of this is true, and which is a lie?  Should I believe all the offers from the organization?  Or is PrimoKollekt deceiving applicants? </p><h2>  Official work </h2><p>  The good news is that the company does offer formal employment.  But, as a rule, employees are not too keen on cooperation.  Some say that PrimoKollect is far from being a good employer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primokollekt debtor reviews" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1511798.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <p>  Some employees claim that this place is a good option for work or part-time work for elementary students.  But more serious people are better off not working here.  In any case, even official employment will not help to overshadow the frustrations received (this is often emphasized) from cooperation. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  PrimoKollect LLC receives not the best reviews because of the level of wages.  Initially, workers are promised a decent high salary.  But in practice, everything turns out a little differently. </p><p>  This is far from the highest salary.  This should be remembered by each applicant.  In general, there are few reviews about the organization left by employees.  But they still say that they pay extremely little in the company.  For work carried out by collectors should appoint a higher salary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  What's next?  It is worth paying attention to the work schedule.  PrimoKollect receives positive feedback from employees for this feature.  Despite not the highest salary, the agreed work schedule will still take place.  And the company management will try not to violate it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ooo primokollekt reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1511796.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, sometimes you have to perform work tasks after hours.  This is a normal practice for a collection agency.  Some workers are not entirely satisfied with this feature.  But it‚Äôs better than staying every day for overtime unpaid work, which is often offered by different bosses. </p><h2>  Nature of work </h2><p>  PrimoKollect LLC <span>(Moscow)</span> receives not the best <span>reviews</span> from its subordinates for the nature of the work performed.  As already mentioned, we are talking mainly about a collection company.  But everyone knows that such organizations do not always act legally when "knocking out" debts.  Of course, it is collectors-workers who violate the law. </p><p>  All this is extremely difficult.  Both physically and mentally.  Many emphasize that one has to practically knock out debts from debtors.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if people can pay this or that money.  Work as a collector, in principle, is suitable only for tough and physically / morally strong people.  Some do not stand up to work at PrimoKollect and quit.  Therefore, not everyone is given the opportunity to build a career here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Career </h2><p>  However, there is no particular career growth in the organization.  This is not a place where you can get to leadership positions.  This should be remembered by each applicant.  Especially if he is employed as a collector. </p>

    <p>  But on office vacancies there is some career growth.  You can grow to a senior department manager.  And nothing more. </p><p>  That is why many emphasize that the work at PrimoKollect is suitable mainly for students.  It does not give any career growth, but a person gets invaluable work experience.  Only physically and mentally, only a small number of students will cope with the established load during work.  In other words, working at PrimoKollect is a real test. </p><h2>  Collector actions </h2><p>  Now a little about what, in principle, this organization is.  What are PrimoKollect reviews of debtors and customers?  This is also an important nuance. </p><p>  The actions of the collection company are often assessed as illegal.  Debtors say that many collectors call and intimidate, threaten.  It is impossible to do so according to the laws established in Russia.  It is forbidden.  For this organization can be fined first, and then completely shut down.  Nevertheless, such behavior is inherent in all collection agencies.  This is a normal occurrence. </p>

    <p>  But customers leave positive feedback about the company PrimoKollect LLC (Moscow), saying that the organization operates only within the framework of the established legislation.  In any case, the management of the company says so. </p><p>  What to believe?  Rather, the population is more likely to believe in the first type of feedback.  Indeed, few people will trust the statement that the collection company operates only within the framework of the established legislation of the country, and also conducts conscientious activities.  Given the feedback left by employees, we can conclude that the company does not conduct its business in the best way.  However, like all other collection agencies.  There is nothing surprising in this. </p><h2>  Efficiency </h2><p>  What are PrimoKollect reviews?  Russia is a country where debtors often run into collection companies.  And the organization under study is one of them.  What do customers say about the effectiveness of the company? </p><p>  In general, it is the customers who are satisfied with the work of the organization.  It is indicated that PrimoKollect operates in such a way that many try their best to pay off the debt that has formed.  There are malicious defaulters, but often they even try to pay the bills.  It pleases many.  No need to change the collection company to get the necessary cash. </p><h2>  What debtors say </h2><p>  PrimoKollect receives not the best reviews of debtors (Russia, Moscow).  Rather, there is not a single positive opinion of this organization from those who owe someone money.  After all, some opinions emphasize that getting rid of the agency is difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primokollekt employee reviews" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1511793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In principle, there is nothing surprising.  Few debtors greet agency workers with open arms.  Both sides are a priori enemies.  So, positive reviews, in principle, cannot be discussed. </p><h2>  Documents and Conversations </h2><p>  What kind of reviews does PrimoKollect (Moscow) receive from those who have to pay money to one company or another?  Not the best.  Many emphasize that this company works according to the same scheme as all other collectors - they beat out debts by all means, but at the same time try to hide their identity and management.  Why is there such an opinion? </p><p>  All due to the fact that some debtors ask collectors to introduce themselves and present documents during a conversation / meeting.  Similar moments are ignored.  Or workers simply do not name their names.  And documents are provided only in units.  All this suggests the idea that the organization does not act in the most honest and legal ways. </p><h2>  Strange calls </h2><p>  What else does PrimoKollect receive?  Debtors quite often emphasize that they are illegally attributed to those who owe money.  Some indicate that all debts were always paid on time.  But at one point, they began to be disturbed by the PrimoKollect company with threats and demands to return certain funds. </p><p>  Along with this, the callers refuse to introduce themselves or to inform on whose behalf they act.  It is recommended that you simply ignore such calls.  Or record everything on a recorder and warn about going to court.  Disturb conscientious citizens quite often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primocollect reviews russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1511792.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear which PrimoKollect reviews are earning.  This is a typical representative of collection agencies, which works in approximately the same way as competitors.  Workers are doing their best to protect managers from communicating with debtors.  And they knock out debts in both legal and illegal ways. </p><p>  As an employer, PrimoKollect is not bad, but not suitable for everyone.  It‚Äôs hard to work here, hard work will have to be done (in every sense).  There is no big income.  All this is important to consider before contacting the organization for employment. </p>
