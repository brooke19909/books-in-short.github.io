The right choice would be to blacklist these people.  But not every owner of an "apple" gadget knows where to see blocked numbers on an iPhone, moreover, he does not know how to use this function.  In the article, we will look at how to block an annoying subscriber, see a list of blocked ones and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipodium.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to see the blacklist" class="if uuid-3057528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3057528.jpg"></div><h2>  How to block a person who is in the contact list </h2><p>  Blacklisting any phonebook number is easy.  You need to open the "Phone" menu, and then go to the "Contacts" section.  Find the person you want to block in the list and click on his name.  At the bottom of the subscriber‚Äôs card will be the item ‚ÄúBlock subscriber‚Äù.  It remains only to click on this button to confirm the action.  From this moment, a blocked contact will not be able to call you or send SMS messages: they simply will not reach you.  Even using the <span>Face Time</span> application <span>, a</span> blacklisted subscriber will not reach you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablyk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock phone number" class="if uuid-3057531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3057531.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that it is necessary to open the contact list via "Phone", since if you go to "Contacts", then there will be no option "Block the subscriber". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We send unknown numbers to the iPhone blacklist </h2><p>  Almost daily, we are called by employees of insurance companies, banks, advertising agencies.  They are annoying and tend to call from different phone numbers.  In order to add them to the list of blocked ones, it is not necessary to save them in the phone book.  You can even block unfamiliar numbers.  In the Phone menu, go to Recent.  Find the number from which you are regularly bothered from the list, click on the icon with the Latin letter i.  The button "Block subscriber" should appear.  Confirm the lock.  This method will not completely solve the problem, because people working in the service sector have several phones, and each time they can change the number. </p><h2>  We block numbers from SMS messages </h2><p>  Getting rid of spam in messages is also easy.  The lock option is located directly in the "Messages" menu.  To get started, go to "Messages", and then open a dialog with the number from which spam and other garbage were sent.  Select "Contact" at the top of the display.  The same icon with the Latin letter i will appear.  After that, in the menu that opens, find "Block subscriber".  After confirmation, the contact will be moved to the blocked list. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablyk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to see blocked contacts" class="if uuid-3057532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3057532.jpg"></div><h2>  How to view blocked numbers on an iPhone </h2><p>  If one of your friends is wondering why it‚Äôs impossible to get through to you, you may have mistakenly blocked his number.  Let's figure out how to see the list of blocked numbers in the iPhone.  In the settings of your smartphone, go to the "Phone" section.  In the "Calls" menu, click on the "Blocked" subsection.  You will see all the contacts previously sent to the ban.  You can add to the list of unwanted numbers by clicking on "Add new".  If you plan to move this or that number back to the White List, click on the "Edit" item, and then on the red circle next to the desired subscriber.  Then just click on "Unblock".  Unlock and see the blocked numbers on the iPhone, as you see, is very simple.  After that, you will again be in touch with your family and friends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many people have a question about how to see blocked numbers on the iPhone-5.  Which model a smartphone is of little importance, it is important that the installed operating system is not lower than iOS 7. Otherwise, it remains only to use paid programs.  Fortunately, all new iPhones have a built-in contact blocking feature, so you don‚Äôt have to puzzle over where to download auxiliary software. </p><p>  Now you know how to view blocked numbers on an iPhone, regardless of the smartphone version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--80aaacq2clcmx7kf.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blocked numbers" class="if uuid-3057535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3057535.jpg"></div><h2>  Do Not Disturb </h2><p>  If you are very busy at work and do not want outsiders to call you, you can set a mode that will not miss any calls or messages.  You will only be able to call and write, those whom you put on the White List. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--80aaacq2clcmx7kf.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view blacklist" class="if uuid-3057537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3057537.jpg"></div><p>  Do Not Disturb is set in the iPhone settings.  You can adjust the time during which the mode will be active.  When you select ‚ÄúFrom anyone‚Äù in the ‚ÄúCall tolerance‚Äù column, absolutely all numbers will be blocked.  If you click on "From the Favorites", people from your "White List" will be able to contact you. </p><p>  How to add the right person to the "White List"?  Find in "Contacts" the number of the person with whom you want to always be in touch.  Open his card, then click on "Add to Favorites".  Then in the "Call tolerance" in the "Do Not Disturb" menu, check the box next to "From Favorites".  After the manipulations have been done, only those with whom you need to communicate will be in touch with you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iland.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do not disturb mode" class="if uuid-3057540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3057540.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  You can create a black and white list in an iPhone without using paid applications.  Although the creators of third-party programs and offer owners of "apple" gadgets advanced features, for daily use of the built-in options of the smartphone is more than enough. </p><p>  You can see blocked numbers on an iPhone, as you know, in the "Settings" method above and you won‚Äôt have to download anything for this.  In addition, even paid software is not able to protect from telephone spammers and scammers, because they can make calls through the anti-identifier.  In this case, the Black List will not help. </p>
