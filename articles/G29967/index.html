In the biography of Maya Gogulan, it says that a terrible oncological disease led to the system of healing in Niche.  Having overcome it, a woman began to share her experience in books that are popular in our time. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  Maya has always been a very painful girl.  Her relatives constantly took her to doctors.  There were no results until the family moved to Crimea.  There was a temporary healing.  The sea, the sun, fresh fruit in unlimited quantities and an almost savage lifestyle: no shoes, no clothes.  So the girl first felt healthy. </p><p>  Subsequently, Maya found this logical explanation precisely in the system of healing Niches.  As they say, at that time she returned to that way of life for which nature created her: to eat what is filled with the energy of life and does not require any processing, to walk without clothes, taking all the energy of the sun, wind, earth.  Unfortunately, the war soon began, the family moved again, now to the Urals, and everything began anew. </p><p>  Lack of food has weakened the body.  The girl caught malaria, which there was no way to fight, since there were no drugs.  The attacks so drained the child that the doctors abandoned her.  She accidentally found out about this from an overheard conversation, where mother, crying, kept repeating: ‚ÄúSoon she will die!‚Äù  Then she was only ten years old.  It‚Äôs very difficult to believe in your death at this age, and Maya, not knowing anything about the Japanese methods, herself, on a hunch, found a pose in which she was able to prevent an attack of malaria: she lay on her back, folded her arms across her chest, as if in prayer, knees brought together, and legs spread, as far as possible.  There was one thought in my head - to prevent a repeat of the attack!  So it went all day, but the attack did not happen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Maya herself does not consider getting rid of malaria a miracle.  She argues that we all initially know how to deal with the ailments that have suffered on our body - this is how nature created us.  But over time, we forget about it, loading our brain with useless, and sometimes even harmful knowledge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="biozvezd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maya Gogulan" class="if uuid-2635407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2635407.jpg"></div><h2>  How Maya struggled with the worst disease </h2><p>  Over time, doctors discovered a tumor in Maya - myoma.  As stated in the biography of Maya Gogulan, she underwent two operations to remove tumors.  The first was successful at 34 years old, and the second, at 47 years old, ended in disaster, almost death.  Maya herself considers cancer the most terrible disease, calling it the "crown" among ailments.  Upon learning that she had a tumor, the woman became desperate.  But then she remembered how she defeated malaria.  The first operation was performed by the surgeon Alexander Alexandrovich Vishnevsky.  After that, Maya was able to bear and give birth to a healthy baby. </p><p>  According to the biography of Maya Gogulan, the years after the first operation were happy and fruitful.  Motherhood and doing her favorite thing (journalism) filled her life with pleasant worries, for which she could not consider the sneaking trouble. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.medsest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maya Fedorovna Gogulan. Photo from the article" class="if uuid-2635410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2635410.jpg"></div><h2>  Introducing the Niche Method </h2><p>  Twelve years later, a relapse occurred.  Vishnevsky had already died by then.  Maya agreed to the operation, but the disease did not recede.  As a complication, thrombophlebitis, swelling, bruising, unbearable pain fell upon a woman.  The woman ceased to live the usual life, although she refused disability.  Colleagues reacted to her problem with understanding and brought work to home.  This lifestyle allowed Maya to learn many healing methods, even try them on herself, but there were no results, life flowed out of her sick body. </p><p>  There was nothing for the woman to lose, since any touch on her left terrible bruises, and every movement caused wild pain.  Then she fell into the hands of a text written on a regular typewriter, where twenty-eight pages outlined the basics of Katsuzo Nishi's wellness system.  Maya began to rigorously carry out everything that Niches advised, the result was amazing.  The doctors could not believe their eyes, that the patient, whom they had already waved their hands and only looked sympathetically, answering her questions, now stood in front of them, quite lively and, even more surprisingly, absolutely healthy! </p><p>  None of the doctors supported her enthusiasm.  No matter how Maya tried, no one wanted to distribute this technique.  Then she herself decided to give lectures, write books about her experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bookmail.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maya Gogulan Book Cover" class="if uuid-2635536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2635536.jpg"></div><h2>  Methods of Maya Gogulan </h2><p>  So begins the biography of Maya Gogulan as a writer who has overcome cancer.  In her books, she talks about methods of dealing not with the disease itself, but with its causes.  The reasons, according to the writer, lie in the inability of the body to get rid of toxic substances that constantly attack our body with the help of food, water, air.  The smallest vessels - the capillaries - have the function of removing all the evil from our body.  But it is their cleaning that we pay the least attention to! </p><p>  The technique presented in the biography of Maya Gogulan contains six basic rules: </p><ul><li>  sleep on a hard surface </li><li>  instead of a pillow, have a solid roller, </li><li>  exercise "Goldfish", </li><li>  exercise "For capillaries", </li><li>  exercise "Closure of the heels and palms", </li><li>  exercise "For the back and abdomen." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="frame from a training video with Maya Gogulan" class="if uuid-2635539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2635539.jpg"></div><p>  In more detail, you can understand her methodology by watching several videos with Maya.  Or to study in detail not only the biography of Maya Gogulan and her last books, but also to delve into the methods of Niche, from where the author drew her inspiration. </p><h2>  To help the basic rules </h2><p>  In addition to exercises that are not new to people who are fond of wellness gymnastics, the methodology proposes a set of wellness measures, where the main place is taken by the principle of proper nutrition, based on the preference of vegetarianism, refusal to process foods, separate nutrition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bookz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maya gogulan" class="if uuid-2636811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2636811.jpg"></div><p>  Among other things, the author of books on the healing technique insists that the human body goes through three phases every day: eating, extracting from it all valuable substances, getting rid of unnecessary.  All of them have approximately the same time.  Sleep, when there is assimilation of all that is useful, then getting rid of all that is unnecessary, that is, from morning to lunch, and then loading food.  That is, based on these statements, you can start eating only after dinner, and depending on the food, stop taking it 0.5-3 hours before bedtime.  The time difference is due to the fact that fruits and vegetables, carefully chewed, are digested in 30-50 minutes.  The meat is processed 3 hours. </p><h2>  Is Maya alive? </h2><p>  The question that arises when studying the biography of Maya Gogulan, alive or not, remains open.  The last interview she gave on the phone (only the text of this interview is given) dates back to 2015.  Then, according to the journalist, Maya was 82 years old, she felt fine, lived with her family in the United States.  In 2014, she personally was in Moscow at the presentation of her books and a series of seminars.  Then, in an interview, it slipped by accident that she was a happy grandmother, mother, sister, and, just fine, a daughter.  Her mother is still alive, she is engaged in health gymnastics with her, as is her daughter and her husband.  My sister took on the function of a culinary specialist and treats everyone with amazing salads.  Around the time, according to the biography of Maya Gogulan, the last photo was taken and published on the Internet. </p><p>  It is difficult to say whether this wonderful woman is alive or not.  One thing is known for certain - its methodology has been and remains popular among people who are ready to change their health, and therefore life itself for the better. </p>
