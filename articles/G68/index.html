  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Climate of Cyprus: weather and temperature characteristics for months</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Mediterranean has always attracted people.  This is a region with a favorable climate, rich in flora and fauna.  It covers the coast of two continents - Eurasia and Africa, the archipelagos and a large number of islands.  Among the latter, Cyprus stands in the eastern part of the region and has an area of ​​just over 9 thousand square kilometers.  It is he who is most attractive for tourist trips.  When planning a trip, you should first take care of the weather conditions for the trip. </p><h2>  General information on the geographical position and climatic features of the island </h2><p>  The island was formed as a result of volcanic activity in this region.  Therefore, its main part is mountains. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.04550293057627" data-lng="33.254077749999965" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/1/3/1513.png"></div><p>  Almost the entire northern coast is represented by an extended mountain range, the highest point in the west is Mount Akromanda, which rises 1023 m above sea level. In the southwest, there is a mountain range with Mount Olymbos two thousand meters high.  Ranges and massifs are indented by longitudinal river valleys and divided by a fertile plain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyprus-guru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus collage" class="if uuid-2329493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2329493.jpg"></div><p>  Formally, the climate of Cyprus is defined as tropical Mediterranean.  But in reality this is not so.  It is closer to that which is characteristic of New Zealand, but not to the fact that it reigns, for example, on the islands of Malta or Rhodes, the Apennine or Balkan Peninsula. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="KRcl_zF8AAw" data-url="https://youtu.be/KRcl_zF8AAw" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/1/2/1512.jpg"></div><p>  The climate of Cyprus has a clear division into seasons.  The summer period lasts from May to October.  It is characterized by high temperatures and low rainfall.  Dense fogs often fall on the south coast at night and in the morning.  Winter, as a rule, is mild and short, it has a slightly more pronounced character in the climate of Northern Cyprus.  Autumn and spring are swift. </p><h2>  Monthly temperature </h2><p>  The traveler planning a trip to Cyprus, first of all, monitors all the nuances of the weather, in order to plan their route and vacation.  Therefore, we will study all the subtleties of the climate of Cyprus: </p><ul><li>  air temperature in the whole island and in individual resort towns; </li><li>  water temperature on popular beaches; </li><li>  type of precipitation and its intensity. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyprus-guru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus, Protaras" class="if uuid-2329501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2329501.jpg"></div><p>  Let's start with the first paragraph.  The temperature regime for months is reflected in the following table. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Name of the month</em> </td><td>  <em>Daytime air temperature, ° C</em> </td><td>  <em>Night air temperature, ° </em> </td></tr><tr><td>  January </td><td>  +12 ... + 16 </td><td>  +6 ... + 8 </td></tr><tr><td>  February </td><td>  +18 ... + 19 </td><td>  +8 ... + 12 </td></tr><tr><td>  March </td><td>  +18 ... + 22 </td><td>  +10 ... + 14 </td></tr><tr><td>  April </td><td>  +22 ... + 25 </td><td>  +14 ... + 16 </td></tr><tr><td>  May </td><td>  +24 ... + 27 </td><td>  +18 ... + 21 </td></tr><tr><td>  June </td><td>  +28 ... + 31 </td><td>  +21 ... + 24 </td></tr><tr><td>  July </td><td>  +31 ... + 35 </td><td>  +24 ... + 27 </td></tr><tr><td>  August </td><td>  +31 ... + 35 </td><td>  +25 ... + 28 </td></tr><tr><td>  September </td><td>  +29 ... + 32 </td><td>  +24 ... + 27 </td></tr><tr><td>  October </td><td>  +25 ... + 27 </td><td>  +21 ... + 23 </td></tr><tr><td>  November </td><td>  +21 ... + 23 </td><td>  +13 ... + 15 </td></tr><tr><td>  December </td><td>  +16 ... + 18 </td><td>  +5 ... + 7 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Thus, it is conditionally possible to distinguish a high season from late May to early October, a low season from November to February and an intermediate one, which includes March, April and partially October.  The last period is quite comfortable, but not suitable for swimming.  The possibility of splashing in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea will be considered further. </p><h2>  Climate of Cyprus: monthly water temperature </h2><p>  The most comfortable for swimming is considered to be the period from June to September.  Water at this time warms up to + 24 ... + 27 degrees Celsius.  May and October are relatively suitable, as they can vary significantly from year to year.  On average, these months are characterized by a water temperature of + 20 ... + 23 ° C.  In the low season, this indicator of the climate of Cyprus usually ranges from +10 to +19 ° C. </p><h2>  Precipitation: the amount and localization of the bulk </h2><p>  Since the island is characterized by heterogeneous geography, plains and valleys alternate with mountains, the types and amount of precipitation are quite diverse.  So, snow falls on peaks approaching a thousand meters and above, and rains irrigate the lowlands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyprus-guru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus, Larnaca" class="if uuid-2329489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2329489.jpg"></div><p>  The snow layer on the southwestern slopes of the ridge can reach 0.5-1.5 m, on the north and east - up to 30 cm. According to statistical reports over the past three decades, its volumes are steadily declining.  This type of rainfall is extremely rare in the lowlands. </p><p>  From the end of October to May, rather heavy rains occur on the island 2-3 times, thunderstorms rarely occur.  Between December and April, hail may fall. </p><p>  In summer, there is practically no rainfall, which leads to a low average annual rate: 480 mm.  The period is accompanied by high air temperatures and low humidity. </p><h2>  Features of individual resorts </h2><p>  In order not to make a mistake in choosing a particular resort, you should study the situation in Cyprus with the climate of cities.  If the trip is planned for the intermediate season, then it is better to select travel offers for resorts on the northeast coast.  It is there that the temperature of air and water will hold out at maximum boundaries within a period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyprus-guru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach in Cyprus" class="if uuid-2329502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2329502.jpg"></div><p>  The climate of Cyprus in the most popular resorts can be represented as follows. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">  <em>Name of the resort city</em> </td><td colspan="4">  <em>Air temperature by the seasons, in ° </em> </td></tr><tr><td>  <em>December to February</em> </td><td>  <em>March to May</em> </td><td>  <em>from June to August</em> </td><td>  <em>from September to November</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Pathos </td><td>  +15 ... + 18 </td><td>  +18 ... + 24 </td><td>  +28 ... + 32 </td><td>  +22 ... + 30 </td></tr><tr><td>  Protaras </td><td>  +16 ... + 18 </td><td>  +18 ... + 25 </td><td>  +30 ... + 34 </td><td>  +22 ... + 32 </td></tr><tr><td>  Ayia Napa </td><td>  +16 ... + 18 </td><td>  +18 ... + 26 </td><td>  +30 ... + 33 </td><td>  +22 ... + 31 </td></tr><tr><td>  Larnaca </td><td>  +15 ... + 17 </td><td>  +19 ... + 26 </td><td>  +31 ... + 35 </td><td>  +23 ... + 32 </td></tr><tr><td>  Limassol </td><td>  +15 ... + 17 </td><td>  +18 ... + 25 </td><td>  +30 ... + 33 </td><td>  +22 ... + 31 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Thus, it is possible to choose the region that most meets expectations.  But often travelers come to Cyprus not only to swim, sunbathe, see the sights and enjoy the Mediterranean scenery.  Surprisingly, the island has a ski season.  He is very short-lived: only from the beginning of January until March. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiprinform.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skiing in Cyprus" class="if uuid-2329504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2329504.jpg"></div><p>  The center of such pleasure at this time is Mount Olymbos (Olympos) as part of the Troodos Range.  It is equipped with several tracks named after the gods of Olympus.  There is a division into professional ones and those intended for beginners and amateurs.  Weather in winter is unpredictable, it is likely emergency warming.  In this case, all the plans of the skiers go to dust. </p><p>  Cyprus is an amazing island.  Regardless of the time of year, it will always provide travelers with a ton of opportunities. </p>
