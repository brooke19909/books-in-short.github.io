    <p>  The National Oceanographic Museum of Vietnam is located in the city of Nha Trang, near the Nha Trang Hotel.  Vietnam is a tropical country, the ocean is warm, and therefore many unusual fish and aquatic animals live in it.  In the Nha Trang Aquarium, tourists have the opportunity to look at sharks, stingrays, moray eels, etc. You can watch fish and sea animals in the museum not through the glass, as in other similar places, but directly live.  Sea inhabitants swim in this oceanarium in huge pools. </p>
