What are the main conditions for its use?  Recently, offers to issue in addition to the usual plastic virtual card have become quite frequent.  No exception - Russian Standard Bank. </p><h2>  Product Feature </h2><p>  The main purpose of the virtual product is to ensure the safety of the client from the actions of scammers when making purchases on the Internet.  Entering the data of the main card, a person risks becoming a victim of dishonest sellers, skimming or phishing, as a result of which attackers gain access to the basic data of the card and the ability to make payments on third-party sites or transfer funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coinrevolution.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual card russian standard" class="if uuid-3178092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178092.jpg"></div><p>  Often, such a mistake costs the client the entire amount on the card account.  In such a case, recovering lost money is almost impossible.  Therefore, a virtual card is extremely relevant for those people who regularly make purchases and pay online.  Such a card has a limited limit and a separate number, and therefore the funds in the main account remain safe.  It is recommended to transfer funds to a virtual card if necessary, that is, immediately before making a purchase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  For its customers wishing to additionally issue a virtual card, Russian Standard offers very favorable conditions.  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Issuing such a card costs a little.  You will need to pay a commission for registration only once, it amounts to 2% of the amount of funds in the account, and it can not be less than 25 rubles and more than 300 rubles. </li><li>  Virtual card service is free.  There are no hidden fees or commissions; you will not have to pay additional annual use. </li><li>  The customer has the right to choose a payment system. </li><li>  The product is not interconnected with other client accounts, which allows minimizing probable risks. </li><li>  You can issue a virtual card without visiting a bank branch, via the Internet. </li><li>  The card can be used to make purchases in any online store. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that using a virtual card to pay for a purchase at a regular outlet will not work.  In addition, you cannot transfer funds from such a card to the accounts of individuals.  But it is not intended for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="betanews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virtual credit card russian standard" class="if uuid-3178089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178089.jpg"></div><h2>  Visa virtual </h2><p>  Russian Standard Virtual Card Visa Virtual is the first product in a series of virtual cards.  It is basic, its duration is 3-6 months.  In comparison with ordinary plastic, a similar product has the following advantages: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Release rate.  As a rule, before a client receives his card, it goes a rather long way from the moment of registration to issuing.  This procedure takes about 5-14 days (depending on the region of issue and the bank).  The bank receives a virtual card in the Russian Standard immediately. </li><li>  You can get a virtual card online without showing your passport. </li><li>  The card can be issued in three currencies - the card account can be in euros, rubles, dollars. </li><li>  The limit on the card is 100 thousand rubles.  At the time of receiving the card, money is already on it.  The client himself determines how much, debiting is carried out from the main card account. <div class="photo" data-original="www.xpatloop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian standard card" class="if uuid-3178104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178104.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Virtual cards with convenient numbers </h2><p>  To facilitate the entry of a 16-digit number, Russian Standard introduced cards with convenient numbers.  This virtual account has the same characteristics as the previous card, however, the client can independently generate its number, which greatly facilitates the memorization of details.  The validity period of such an account is from 1 year. </p><h2>  Gift virtual card </h2><p>  "Russian Standard" provides the ability to issue a virtual card in the name of another person.  Such cards are a complete alternative to certificates in various stores, they can be sent to relatives or friends as a gift. </p><p>  You can issue a “Gift Card” remotely, replenish it for any amount, and then send it to the new owner together with your wishes via e-mail.  You can deposit up to 15 thousand rubles into the account of such a product, and its validity period is 90 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcicomplianceguide.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian standard internet bank" class="if uuid-3178091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178091.jpg"></div><h2>  Cardholder Requirements </h2><p>  Is there a virtual credit card "Russian Standard"?  Virtual accounts involve the storage of own finances, and not borrowed funds.  In this regard, the requirements that banks make to holders of virtual cards are minimal.  The Russian Standard has no such requirements at all.  This is due to the fact that virtual cards are prepaid.  The only prerequisite is that the client has a valid mobile number. </p><h2>  Virtual card design </h2><p>  To get a virtual individual account in the Russian Standard Internet Bank, you need to visit the official portal of the banking organization, and then go to the section of the same name, select the product that you like, and send an application for registration. </p><p>  A form will open on the site, which will require the following information: </p><ol><li>  The current telephone (mobile) number that was issued by the Russian operator and is in the access zone. </li><li>  Payment system.  This parameter does not affect the operation of the account. </li><li>  Email.  It is needed to obtain complete data, details, password for recovery (if such a need arises). </li><li>  Account limit.  Use the slider to select the maximum available amount. </li><li>  Card currency. </li></ol><p>  The card will be available 10-15 minutes after its processing.  To confirm the application, you will need to enter the code that will come in the SMS message, as well as pay the commission for registration. </p><p>  How to issue a virtual card "Russian Standard", it is better to find out in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myob.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gift virtual card Russian standard" class="if uuid-3178094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178094.jpg"></div><h2>  Order replenishment </h2><p>  Before making a purchase in the online store, you must replenish the virtual card.  The bank offers several convenient ways to replenish: </p><ol><li>  By transferring from an account in another bank.  You can make a transfer through the Internet bank, terminal, ATM of the financial institution that issued the card.  Funds when transferring from accounts of other banks are credited within 1-5 days. </li><li>  From the card of the same bank.  In this case, funds are credited instantly. </li><li>  Transfer of funds by requisites.  If the client does not have an ordinary card, then you can replenish the virtual product by contacting the nearest bank branch. </li></ol><p>  In this case, the client will be required to present the account details and passport.  All banks except Russian Standard have a commission on this operation.  Funds in this case will be credited within 1-5 days. </p>
