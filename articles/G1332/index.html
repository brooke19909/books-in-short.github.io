The sunny land invites those who wish not only to relax, but also to make fascinating trips around the republic.  One of the most attractive places for tourists is Lake Ritsa.  The path to it lies through the gorge "Stone Sack" in Abkhazia.  This is the second name of the Yupshar Canyon - a place in which the mountains surprise with their beauty and grandeur. </p><h2>  Natural landmark on the road to Ritsa </h2><p>  For those who make excursions in the Republic of Abkhazia, the ‚ÄúStone Sack‚Äù may seem like a strange name, but when you drive closer to the place, you can understand its origin.  The gorge is a section of road sandwiched between the rocks.  Its length is 8 km, and the distance between the rocks on this segment of the path varies from 20 to 30 meters.  The height of the mountains reaches 500 meters.  The breathtaking beauty of the ‚ÄúStone Sack‚Äù is breathtaking, but at the same time a person feels like a grain of sand among the grandeur of stone.  Somewhere rocks hang over the road.  The narrowest section at the exit of the gorge is called Yupshar Gate.  The span between the rocks is only 20 meters, so it feels like you are about to find yourself in a real bag of stone. </p>

    <p>  The slopes of the mountains are covered with perennial boxwood, reddish moss and lichens, in some places there are lianas.  Light penetrates the gorge for only 2-3 hours a day, the rest of the day there is twilight and cool.  On the bottom of the gorge of the Republic of Abkhazia "Stone Bag" flows the river Yupshara with amazingly clear water.  It flows from Lake Ritsa, on the way it absorbs the waters of the Gegi River, and then flows into Bzyb.  Not far from the Yupshar Gorge, Gega flows through the karst gorge and forms the <span>Gegsky waterfall,</span> in which the height of the incident stream is about 70 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Observation deck with the sad name "Farewell, Motherland" </h2><p>  On Lake Ritsa was one of the dachas of I. Stalin.  From the documents preserved in the archives of the FSB of Russia, it is known that in the period from 1933 to 1939 the head of state made several trips to the lake for recreation.  During the Patriotic War in 1942, the sheer walls of the gorge of the Republic of Abkhazia "Stone Sack" were mined with holes.  Mining work was carried out by an engineering platoon of the internal troops of the Sukhumi division.  This was done in order to block the road to Lake Ritsa and the village of Bzybta, which is located next to it, in case the German troops manage to break out of the Sanchar Pass. </p>

    <p>  After the retreat of the Nazi army in 1943, the gorge was cleared.  This fact is not very well known, but, according to one version, a bus with Soviet soldiers serving a section of the road in the Yupshar Gorge broke down from a narrow road with a high cliff on one side and a bottomless abyss on the other.  Now there is an observation deck equipped with the sad name ‚ÄúFarewell, Motherland‚Äù.  It offers a beautiful panorama of the surrounding mountains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Stone of kisses </h2><p>  At the entrance to the gorge (Abkhazia, "Stone Sack") lies a huge stone, which is called the Stone of Kisses.  Climbing it is very difficult, but, according to local legend, a couple who climb on it and kiss it will be happy all their lives.  Many tourists are photographed against a stone.  Next to it there is a parking lot with outlets and a large number of stuffed animals, there are also palm trees in pots.  The enterprising local population offers to take a memory photo in the national costume of a highlander with a dagger, an old pistol or a saber. </p><h2>  Legend of the Falls Girl's Tears </h2><p>  In addition to the Gegsky cascade, there are 4 more waterfalls on the road leading to the Yupshar Gorge.  The most popular among tourists are the Maiden Tears and Men's Tears waterfalls. </p><p>  <span>Waterfall Maiden's tears</span> stretched several meters.  It is difficult to call it a waterfall, because it is a karst cleft located high above the road, with which water flows in small streams.  At the entrance to it, a rock attracts attention, along which special ropes are stretched.  On these ropes and on tree branches, tourists cling to colored bows and make cherished desires. </p>

    <p>  The Maiden Tears Waterfall is located in front of the entrance to the Stone Sack Gorge (Abkhazia).  Legend has it that a beautiful girl Amra lived in the mountains for a long time.  She grazed goats, sang songs, and the young man Adgur fell in love with her.  The evil witch envied the lovers and wanted to kill the girl.  She decided to throw her off a high cliff, the girl cried and began to call for help from Adgur, but he did not hear her screams.  But the God of water heard them.  He decided to save the girl and turned the witch into stone.  Together with the witch, the girl also became a stone.  Since then, from the place where Amra cried, the tears of the beauty flow down with drops. </p><h2>  Waterfall Men's Tears </h2><p>  Behind the Stone Sack gorge, Abkhazia (photo in the article), Man's Tears Waterfall is visible.  A stream of water flows down from the mountains, splashes from the waterfall fall directly onto the road. </p>

    <p>  The legend connects two waterfalls together.  The distance between the cascades of water is 20 km.  According to legend, the young man Adgur hunted high in the mountains and did not hear the cries of his beloved, but with his heart he realized that trouble had come.  He realized that he could not help the girl, and men's tears fell to the ground.  When he found out about her fate, at the place where his tear fell, a waterfall formed, called Men's Tears.  At its foot are souvenir tents, and tourists tie colorful ribbons to the trees. </p>
