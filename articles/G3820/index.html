    <p>  Tourists from all over the world come to see the blossoming sakura flowers.  On such <span>days,</span> department heads send their junior employees to the park in order to take a place on the lawn.  They sit all day until colleagues arrive.  Tokyo residents gather in the park with families and friends to capture such beauty. </p><h2>  Menagerie </h2><p>  The zoo located in this place is the oldest and most visited in Japan.  He is one of the best menageries in the world.  Admission for children under 12 years is free, and adults go inside for 600 yen.  Tickets are purchased in the subway and at vending machines near the entrance.  In the zoo you can see up to 500 species of animals, including endangered species.  The main attractions are two pandas brought from China.  The most interesting thing is that they officially belong to China, and the Japanese annually pay about 900 thousand dollars to the host country.  In addition to large pandas, the zoo should be visited for the Ussuri tiger, polar bear, elephants, zebra, leopards, gorillas, rare fish, snakes, turtles and many other animals and birds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museums in Ueno Park </h2><p>  The National Museum of Western Art is located near the entrance to the park.  It stores drawings and paintings of French impressionists.  His library contains three thousand monographs and recordings of artists.  Next to the Museum of Western Art is a steam locomotive belonging to the Museum of Nature and Science.  On the other side of the building stands a tall sculpture of a whale.  Across the street from the above location is the Tokyo National Museum.  He keeps the largest collection of Japanese art: swords, paintings, sculptures, calligraphic drawings, Buddhist treasures. </p>

    <p>  The Royal Museum is popular in that it often hosts various creative exhibitions.  In front of the building is a huge statue of the hero of Japan - Seigo Takumori.  The Sitamati Museum is located on the shinobazu lake, in the center of the park.  Admission is 300 yen.  A small two-story house stores objects, tools, equipment, drawings, posters - everything that relates to the atmosphere of the 1920s of the Tais period.  Yushima Tenmanju Temple is a shrine to students and students of Japan.  Before entering, you can pay attention to the signs with inscriptions.  These are requests for a successful exam or university admission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sakura blossom </h2><p>  More than a thousand cherry trees grow in the park, which are located along the alleys leading to the Tokyo Museum, and next to Shinobazu Lake.  Sakura blossom begins in January in the northern part of the country, gradually moving south.  In late May, flowering ends on the <span>island of Hokkaido.</span>  Sakura has long been considered a symbol of fragility and tenderness, because its flowering period is very short. </p>

    <p>  Tourists from all over the world come to see the blossoming sakura, because it is an incredibly beautiful process.  Unlike other Tokyo parks, sakura blossoms in Ueno begin two weeks earlier - in early April.  Unfortunately, this amazing action does not last long - only three days. </p><h2>  What else to see in the park? </h2><p>  The library of children's literature is one of the largest in the country.  It is a magnificent architectural structure combining three styles of different eras.  Kaneiji Temple, which began the construction of Ueno Park in Tokyo, is located at the exit of the National Museum.  We also recommend visiting the Yoko flea market where you can purchase original items, expensive jewelry, green tea, roasted chestnuts, and seafood. </p><h2>  Ways to get to Ueno Park </h2><p>  First you must fly to Japan.  An air ticket from Moscow to Tokyo will cost about 30 thousand rubles, and this is only one way.  If you are a resident of eastern Russia, then you should pay attention to flights from Vladivostok, which will cost ten thousand rubles round trip.  For fear of aircraft, you can use the ferry from Vladivostok.  Arriving at the Tokyo airport called Narida, it receives international flights.  The flight from Moscow lasts about 9 hours, the time of stay varies: in the summer it is 10 hours before noon, in the winter - 50 minutes later. </p>

    <p>  Narida is a huge convenient airport in which there is absolutely everything: pharmacies, post offices, souvenirs, shops of Japanese cuisine, books and electronics.  But perhaps the main feature that distinguishes this airport from others is the fact that Narida closes at night.  There are no night flights to the airport, there are also no night flights.  In addition, there is no possibility to spend the night at the airport, and if you have a connecting flight, in order to get to the hotel in the city, you need to get a visa.  The cost of souvenirs in foreign currency is indicated without taxes, so at the indicated price of $ 50, be prepared to pay 55. </p><h2>  Ways to transfer from the airport to the city </h2><p>  To the necessary points in Tokyo, you can take the bus, which runs daily from seven in the morning to ten in the evening once an hour.  Bus tickets can be purchased at the airport ticket offices; travel time, taking into account traffic jams, is no more than two hours.  All routes from the airport go to the "doors" of the hotels, so the likelihood of getting lost is very low.  The cost of the trip is about 3,000 yen.  The train station is located directly under the airport, you need to go down the escalator and you will find yourself right in front of the ticket offices.  Right now you need to make the right choice: which train is better to get on? </p>
