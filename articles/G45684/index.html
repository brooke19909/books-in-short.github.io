Currently, some of them have been preserved and pamper tourists with delicious spring water. </p><p>  Along the coast there are hotels with magnificent beaches, excellent service.  And in an hour with a little you can easily walk to the city center, where tourists will be pleased with a great number of shops, restaurants, boutiques. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also in the city there is an amazing and rare place - a park where you can find the best and most exotic plants: trees, bushes, flowers of this latitude. </p><p>  And in the evening in the central part of Marmaris for all comers a singing fountain and other entertainments. </p><h2>  Hotel "Starfish" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thomascook.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.thomascook.com/destinations/turkey/dalaman/icmeler/sea-star-hotel/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zvezda Akademgorodok beach" class="if uuid-2230853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51967/2230853.jpg"></div><p>  It has been working since April 2014.  Its peculiarity is that only adults, from 16 years old and older, have a rest here. </p><p>  Sea Star is a relatively small building (97 rooms), a spa (with all kinds of procedures and a small pool), a courtyard with a huge pool, a bar and tables under a canopy, sofas with sea views, beautiful vegetation. </p><p>  Zvezda Beach (Akademgorodok) is located across a small passage from the hotel.

Also fruits, desserts, drinks. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thomascook.com" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey sand beach 4 stars" class="if uuid-2230856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51967/2230856.jpg"></div><p>  In Marmaris, the Starfish Hotel (4 stars, Turkey) has a sandy beach and a smooth sea bottom: no pebbles and boulders.  This allows you to swim without special shoes. </p><p>  <span>The shallow shore,</span> thanks to which you can smoothly and calmly enter the sea and also go on land.  The water in the Aegean is very clear and transparent, like a tear.  But colder in temperature (compared with the Mediterranean).  Although the water warms up perfectly (up to 25 degrees) and you can swim until October, inclusive. </p><p>  The sea is almost always calm due to the mountains and islands that surround Icmeler Bay.  A semi-closed oasis, a paradise, protected from strong gusts of wind and storms, was created here. </p><p>  On the beach "Star" is always a lot of free places.  And comfortable sun loungers with soft mattresses and awnings above them pleasantly protect from direct sunlight, which is especially important for tourists who are undesirable for a long time under the scorching sun. </p><p>  There is also a shower, changing rooms, toilets. </p><p>  Nearby is the promenade with many restaurants and cafes, as well as souvenir shops.  The city center can be reached on foot or by bicycle (via special bicycle paths). </p><p>  And from the concrete pier there is a magnificent view of the mountains, the sea.  Here you can meet sunrises and sunsets, which is especially romantic for couples in love. </p><p>  Entrance to the beach is free for vacationers at the Sea Star hotel, for the rest it is paid. </p><p>  Perhaps for some tourists this beach will seem a little boring, but if you come for a simple rest and some isolation from city noise and fuss, then the Zvezda beach of Akademgorodok will be very welcome. </p><p>  For lovers of more noisy and active holidays there is all the necessary entertainment in the center of Marmaris.  But the water in the sea in Icmeler is much cleaner. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thomascook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach starfish" class="if uuid-2230901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51967/2230901.jpg"></div><p>  About the Starfish Beach and the hotel of the same name, there are the following comments from tourists resting here: </p><ol><li>  All expectations about the service, conditions and beaches are met. </li><li>  Cozy and beautiful rooms. </li><li>  There is internet. </li><li>  A good contingent of vacationers, mainly the British, Germans, Turks, Russians. </li><li>  A beautiful spa with pool, sauna and steam bath (free of charge), as well as massages and other treatments (for a fee). </li><li>  The rooms have direct and side sea views. </li><li>  Great service, helpful staff. </li><li>  The food in the restaurant is quality and light, there is a bar. </li><li>  The beach with the blue flag is the purest water. </li><li>  Beautiful views of the mountains, islands and the sea. <div class="photo" data-original="www.thomascook.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.thomascook.com/destinations/turkey/dalaman/icmeler/sea-star-hotel/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Star" class="if uuid-2230916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51967/2230916.jpg"></div></li><li>  Clean air filled with aromas of pine and citrus that grow in the area. </li><li>  Marmaris has excellent humidity with a moderate sun and a gentle breeze, which contributes to a beautiful and even tan. </li><li>  There are night boat trips for vacationers. </li><li>  Service, food and accommodation are at a high European level. </li><li>  Beautiful beach "Star" - with soft sand, comfortable sun loungers and awnings. </li><li>  Warm water in the sea. </li><li>  Great location of the hotel. </li><li>  Clean, stylish, comfortable. </li><li>  Unrealistically delicious sweets served for dessert in the hotel restaurant. </li><li>  There is a Russian-speaking staff who comes to the aid of Russian tourists if necessary. </li></ol><h2>  Information </h2><p>  The hotel and the Starfish beach are located at: </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="36.80770712368118" data-lng="28.233276909389474" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/5/165.png"></div><p>  Cumhuriyet Mah.
