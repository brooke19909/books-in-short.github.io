Thousands of years have passed since then, and modern scientists not only share the opinion of our ancestors, but also do not stop proving that mathematics is the queen of science.  In music, in a plate, in the elements ... Numbers can express everything that is in our world.  But what do we ourselves know about this mysterious and at the same time the most accurate science? </p>

    <p>  Mathematics is the queen of sciences.  Who said that phrase?  We know exactly what the numbers are called and in what order they follow each other.  But how often do we think about where the numbers came from, why they look so and not otherwise?  Why exactly they became the main tool of mathematics. </p><h2>  Ancient numbers </h2><p>  ‚ÄúMathematics is the queen of sciences, and arithmetic is the queen of mathematics‚Äù are the words of the famous German mathematician Karl Gauss. </p><p>  The history of mathematics begins around the time that our ancestors realized that the number of pots and hunting equipment required accounting.  So there were prototypes of numbers and the very first mathematical operation - addition. </p>

    <p>  The need for mathematical calculations grew every day.  It was necessary to be able to accurately calculate not only the number of people in his community, but also the number of livestock and pasture area.  With the rapid development of trade and construction, the possession of elementary mathematics became completely the key to prosperity.  To survive and feed the family, people had to be able to count. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Indeed, mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and arithmetic is what this science began with and cannot exist without. </p><h2>  Egyptian system </h2><p>  It is not surprising that very soon it was very inconvenient to carry a large number of stones and sticks for counting.  The ancient Egyptians solved this problem.  Around the III millennium BC.  e.  they introduced the first generally accepted numbering system.  So, the unit was depicted with a short vertical stick, the number 10 was indicated by a hieroglyph in the form of a horseshoe, and the number 100 by a measuring rope.  And the largest number - 10 million - was portrayed by the god Amon Ra as the rising sun. </p>

    <p>  Recording any large composite number took a very long time, and any mathematical work required time and knowledge, therefore only priests or other people associated with the cult were engaged in mathematics. </p><p>  There was no separate science of mathematics; according to Aristotle, there was a metaphysician who united all sciences.  She was an element of secret knowledge held by the priests. </p><p>  The only mathematics a person has encountered is the account of money.  In general, from the moment the ‚Äúcommodity-money-commodity‚Äù formula appeared, calculations are of great importance for a person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Arabic numerals </h2><p>  The Arabic numbers familiar to us appeared only after several thousand years.

    <p>  It happened at the end of the 1st millennium BC.  e.  The numbers belong to the Indians, but at first they had a completely different meaning. </p><p>  It is amazing that such an exact science was formed under the influence of esoteric and religious beliefs.  Representatives of ancient civilizations often chose sacred signs to represent numbers. </p><p>  Mathematics is the queen of sciences, and numbers are its unique tool.  If you look around, it becomes obvious - they surround us everywhere. </p><h2>  Math in music </h2><p>  Each of us likes harmonious music.  It causes pleasant emotions, helps to relax, can raise the mood.  But is it only thanks to the skill of the musician?  It turns out that mathematics is behind a harmonious combination of sounds.  The Queen of Sciences has ordered that two notes, separated by such a musical interval as an octave, sound great together.  This is the most perfect combination in music.  An octave is the ratio of frequencies between sounds that can be mathematically written as 1/2.  A pure fifth is 3/2, a large third is 5/4.  However, any combination of notes is recorded in the usual mathematical proportion.  The connection between music and mathematics was guessed in ancient times, and Pythagoras was the first to think of it. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúMusic is the secret arithmetic of the soul, which does not know what it calculates,‚Äù the famous philosopher and mathematician Leibniz once remarked. </p><p>  The universality of mathematics never ceases to amaze.  It seems that the power of this science is generally unlimited.  Mathematically, even natural disasters can be calculated. </p><h2>  Elementary Mathematics </h2><p>  A group of Russian mathematicians has found a way to model and calculate the natural disasters of the future.  Using mathematical pattern recognition, scientists calculated zones for predicting the most powerful earthquakes.  An algorithm has also been developed that helps prevent accidents in enterprises. </p><p>  Children begin to study this subject at a preschool age, and in schools it has already become the traditional wall newspaper ‚ÄúMathematics is the queen of sciences‚Äù, which students draw during the week's passage of this subject within the walls of the educational institution.  They depict various mathematical problems, crosswords and interesting stories. </p>

    <h2>  Fairy tale story </h2><p>  Why is mathematics the queen of science?  In one fabulous dimension, the Kingdom existed.  The head of it was Natural History, Mathematics, his wife was the queen, and Literature, their daughter, the princess.  The family lived in perfect harmony, and they had a lot of servants - auxiliary sciences. </p><p>  But once Math - the queen of sciences, had a fight with her husband, and offended, she simply left the Kingdom. </p><p>  Very quickly, a real mess began in a fabulous state.  The Princess Literature could not number pages in books and chapters in novels.  Natural science could not count planets, stars, days of the week, or months of the year.  History could not determine the exact dates of events, and geography calculated the length of the rivers and the distances between the seas.  Chaos came because the cook could not weigh the products, and the builders could not build the tower.  Not a single resident of a fabulous country could do without Mathematics. </p><p>  Then the King ordered all the ambassadors and messengers to find the princess and return back to the kingdom.  And when Mathematics, the queen of sciences, returned, order and harmony again entered the Kingdom of Sciences. </p>
