Tourists from all over the world come here.  Phuket is located off the west coast of Thailand and leads the list of its largest islands.  For a long time, Phuket was not a tourist center.  Today he has changed a lot.  The number of hotels here is growing every year, for every taste and budget you can find a place that will remain in your memory for a long time. </p><h2>  A few words about the island </h2><p>  Phuket is an amazing place.  This is the largest island of Thailand.  It is located in the west of the country and is a separate province.  Phuket is not only a tourist center, it is a large economic zone of the country.  Hevea is grown here, from which rubber is made.  Profitability rubber is comparable only with the tourism component.  Pineapples are also grown here and jewelry is made. </p><p>  The climate of the island is hot, tropical.  It is warm all year round and there is no sharp difference between summer and winter.  The air temperature averages 28 <sup>¬∞</sup> C. From the end of October to the April month, the dry season is set here.  At this time, the flow of tourists increases significantly.  During this period, all sea excursions are open, including long-distance ones that attract citizens of other countries.  In the summer, these excursions become inaccessible due to frequent precipitation and monsoon winds.  The number of tourists is somewhat reduced, but they still come here to rest. </p><p>  According to statistics, several thousand citizens of foreign countries live in Phuket permanently. </p>

    <p>  On the island there are over a thousand hotels.  No one keeps such statistics in detail, so there is no exact data.  Here you can find a hotel of any level at any cost.  However, there are hotels that deserve special attention.  One of these is Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort 5 *.  It is located between Karon and Patong beaches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Phuket beaches</span> and their importance for hotels </h2><p>  Phuket has many beaches, some of which have earned special popularity among tourists.  Many hotels indicate the name of the beach in their name.  This is done so that the tourist can understand where the institution is located. </p><p>  All the beaches of Phuket are qualitatively different from each other.  There are no similar ones. </p><ul><li>  The most famous beach of the island is Patong.  It is very large and located on the west side.  This is a tourist attraction center.  There are enough discos and shops, so tourists from other areas of the island come here in the evening.  At the same time, Patong is the most polluted beach, the water here is not as clean as in other areas.  The reason for this is the large concentration of guests. </li><li>  Karon is another major beach in Phuket.  It is located south of Patong.  Karon is famous for its yellow quartz sand.  It is very beautiful, but walking on it in sunny weather without shoes is not recommended.  Karon has a large number of hotels and cafes. </li><li>  The third most popular beach in Phuket is Kata, which flows smoothly into Kata Noi.  These are cozy little beaches in the south of the island.  A sailing regatta is held here annually. </li><li>  The beach, where a large number of large hotels are located, is Bang Tao.  It is located in the northwest of the island, away from noisy discos. </li><li>  The small but cozy beach of Surin is famous for its boulders and emerald water. </li></ul><p>  In addition to these beaches, Rawai, Nai Harn, Kamala and Nai Yang deserve attention. </p>

    <p>  If you do not want to swim in the sea, you can always take a seat by the pool.  The pool complex is very beautiful.  It includes several tanks at once, connected with each other by bridges. </p><p>  Vacationers can go snorkelling, diving with instructors, windsurf in windy conditions and enjoy water skiing.  On the beach they play with the ball. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort 5 * Booking.com, TopHotels.ru, Tripadvisor.ru and other tourist portals are called one of the best on the island.  He takes one of the leading places in the ranking. </p><p>  The first thing that vacationers pay attention to is a large territory.  Buildings are buried in flowers and greenery.  This attracts guests.  A certain atmosphere of privacy created by placing in a separate sandy bay creates coziness.  The hotel is located away from the highway, so the noise does not interfere either night or day. </p><p>  They also praise the spa and gym, pay attention to the elephant calf, entertaining the guests of Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort 5 *.  The photos of the beach, rooms and grounds are very bright and attract attention. </p><p>  Among the minuses are the rather high prices in the restaurant and for some types of paid services, including taxi.  Due to the fact that a transfer to the same Patong costs money, tourists often stay at the hotel in the evening, because the cost of a taxi in Phuket is quite high. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the hotel is most suitable for demanding tourists who want to relax from the hustle and bustle.  Those who come to have fun will have to look for bars and discos beyond. </p><h2>  What excursions are worth paying attention to? </h2><p>  When choosing an excursion program, you can contact the bureau directly in the lobby of Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort 5 *.  The reviews also suggest that those who want to save money should buy tours directly at the stands along Patong Beach.  There you can bargain. </p>

    <p>  Once in Phuket, you should definitely pay attention to sea excursions.  There are a lot of them, they vary in duration and cost, but impressions will give unforgettable ones. </p><p>  From short excursions - a tour to the <span>island of James Bond.</span>  It is a large rock in the sea, worn out at the base.  A film was shot here about agent 007. They say that very soon the rock will fall into the sea, so it‚Äôs worth taking a picture of it as a keepsake. </p><p>  Another paradise that is definitely worth a visit is Pi-Pi islands.  There are several types of excursions in Pi-Pi, but each is full of adventure.  The islands are associated with the filming of another Hollywood movie - ‚ÄúThe Beach‚Äù with Leonardo DiCaprio.  The places here are very beautiful. </p><p>  The longest sea excursion is a visit to the Similan Islands.  They are called Thai Maldives, here the sand is white, like flour.  <span>Similan Islands</span> is a large <span>group of islands.</span>  To get there, you have to go to the mainland and from there go on a boat on a long trip.  The sea route will take about 40 minutes.  There are several options for excursions, so you can visit the islands several times in a row. </p><p>  In addition to sea excursions, various show programs are offered, for example, in Fanta Sea, near the Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort.  2015 reviews also praise excursions to Khao Lak and Khao Sok National Parks.  Here guests ride elephants and offer river rafting.  Phuket has its own zoo and a new good water park located behind the airport.  There are a lot of excursion programs, it is simply impossible to describe them all. </p><p>  Phuket is a large island, you can come here every year and still find something new and unknown.  Everything is pleasant here: a light breeze, a variety of beaches, delicious cuisine and interesting entertainments.  Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort is a great place to relax in a quiet, cozy place.  He will remember a bay of incredible beauty, the warm Andaman Sea and the highest level of service. </p>
