Characteristics and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  APC, whose existence legally ended in 2007, has still left its mark as one of the best brands of uninterruptible power supplies.  Due to its takeover by Schneider Electric and the prospect of development, it was decided to leave the APC brand itself. </p><h2>  Uninterruptible power supplies </h2><p>  The task of <span>uninterruptible power supply</span> includes maintaining the operability of units, mechanisms and devices from unexpected power outages or power surges. </p><h2>  General design of autonomous power units </h2><p>  The main part of the UPS is the batteries, which accumulate a charge when the power is supplied from the mains and gives the consumer in the event that the circuit is broken for some reason. </p>

A maximum output power of 240 W will protect one small household device, such as a laptop or TV. </p><p>  The UPS is able to stably operate and equalize the voltage in the network in the range from 180 to 266 V. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The battery of the device is lead-acid, with the use of thickening electrolyte, which guarantees protection against leaks.  The battery is maintenance-free, that is, when a failure occurs, you only have to change it. </p><p>  The notification panel is quite ascetic - it has only two indicators - network and battery operation.  There are also two special sound signals - for a dead battery and overload. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="uninterruptible power supply apc back ups" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1966777.jpg" width="544"></div>

    <p>  The APC BE400 - RS uninterruptible power supply has several levels of protection.  For example, there is a noise filter, voltage surge limitation and others.  If there is a need to protect communication lines, the device has ports for telephone and network - RJ-11 and RJ-45, respectively. </p><h2>  BX650CI </h2><p>  A more powerful and functional uninterruptible power supply 220 V from APC, in comparison with the previous model.  Its output power is 390 watts. </p><p>  The voltage range in which the device is capable of working is 140-300 V. The battery is a similar type to the previous one - that is, maintenance-free and with a thickened electrolyte. </p><p>  The control and display panel is slightly expanded - there is a notification about normal operation, the battery, its replacement and overload.  The sound signal does not differ from the previous model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  BX1400U-GR </h2><p>  A more technological instance of IPC APC.  The output power is 700 watts.  What should be enough to protect a personal stationary computer and any small device additionally. </p>

The battery is a standard solution for this line of UPS - maintenance-free with condensed electrolyte. </p><h2>  APC Smart UPS Uninterruptible Power Supplies </h2><p>  This series is designed for comprehensive protection of powerful server solutions and networks.  One power supply can handle up to 2100 watts of power. </p><h2>  SC620I APC Smart-UPS SC 620VA 230V </h2><p>  Designed to protect the power supply of entry-level servers, workstations and small network devices. </p><p>  The maximum output power of this model is 390 watts.  The voltage range in which it is able to work is from 160 to 286 V. </p><p>  On the front side is the power button of the device, an indicator of operation from the network, from the battery, its replacement and overload. </p>

    <p>  To control the device from a PC, there is a DB-9 port with an RS-232 connector. </p><h2>  SMX 1000I APC Smart-UPS X 1000VA LCD </h2><p>  This representative of the UPS is made in an unusual form factor, in the form of a rack.  One of the interesting features of the model is the ability to connect additional external batteries to it, which increase the total battery life of the protected devices. </p><p>  The output power is 800 W, which is quite enough for use both for domestic purposes and for small offices. </p><p>  Management is carried out using the console with a liquid crystal display.  There are USB and SmartSlot connectors for connecting to a PC. </p><h2>  SUA750RMI1U APC UPS </h2><p>  The model is designed to fit in a 19-inch server rack.  Accordingly, this UPS is able to protect small network solutions and configurations. </p><p>  There are three different ports for connecting the source to a personal computer. </p><p>  A set of LEDs and sounds is used for indication. </p><h2>  Back-UPS PRO Series </h2><p>  This line is a cross between Smart-UPS and Back-UPS. </p><p>  Products can be used both in small industrial enterprises and in everyday life.  They have built-in systems of protection against voltage surges, noise filtering.  Many of their models have built-in support for remotely controlling the network and connecting to a PC for this. </p><h2>  APC Back-UPS Pro 1200 VA </h2><p>  The output power of the model is 720 watts.  The voltage range that the UPS can equalize is between 176-294 V. A full recharge cycle is 8 hours. </p><p>  The kit comes with a USB cable for connecting to a PC, as well as special software. </p><p>  The unit itself has an LCD display with a large list of indicators and settings. </p><p>  The most commonly used ports are for securing the network and telephone lines. </p><h2>  APC Product Reviews </h2><p>  APC has long been producing reliable and high-quality uninterruptible power supplies for a wide variety of applications.  Accordingly, there are thousands of people who have somehow used them.  So, there are reviews about the products. </p><p>  IPB for a computer is almost always seen by users as a great way to finish the system before it shuts down.  True, some note that the actual battery life does not always correspond to the declared one. </p><p>  There are also reviews about the use of IPB for boilers and similar devices in private homes and regions where unplanned power outages are frequent.  As a result, people are satisfied that there is no sharp equipment failure.  During the battery life of the UPS, you can manage to switch to an alternative power source.  And the possibility of expanding many UPSs with additional batteries can save you from this. </p>

    <p>  Server solutions also live up to expectations.  In addition to APC, there are many similar products on the market, but more often preference is given to small companies and enterprises. </p><p>  Of the existing problems, it can be noted that often users talk about battery life.  It does not always correspond to the declared. </p><p>  A separate line is the battery life.  He also often does not achieve his ideal performance. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  APC provides a wide range of products for a wide variety of solutions.  From home computers to huge industrial server systems.  Each user is able to choose from the whole mass exactly the product that is most suitable for him at the moment.  These may be requirements for manufacturability, ease of operation, power, additional functions and voltage range. </p><p>  The price of devices is also aimed at being uplifting to most users.  There are both budget versions and high-tech, with all sorts of additions and "goodies." </p>
