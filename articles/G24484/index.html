  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TVs with Internet access: an overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those times when TVs were used only for their intended purpose are a thing of the past.  Modern technologies have made it possible to turn them into the likeness of personal computers.  And now you will not surprise anyone with a TV with Internet access. </p><p>  Responsible for communication with the World Wide Web functional Smart TV.  If the specification for the device has this line, then it supports access to the network.  Televisions with the Internet and a Wi-Fi module are able to organize not just passive, but active leisure, where the user acts as not only a spectator, but also a direct participant in the events.  This is mainly about game plan applications and other similar entertainment content. </p><p>  But not all TVs with Internet and Wi-Fi are equally good and cope with the task.  Some models get the line ‚ÄúSmart TV‚Äù in the specification just for show, and full-fledged work with the Network in this case, alas, is impossible.  Therefore, there is something to understand. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out which TVs have Internet access and use it 100%.  We will designate the most popular and sensible models that have distinguished themselves by their quality component and an abundance of positive feedback from users. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  Televisions with Internet access are classified according to various parameters, but the only critical one is the operating system.  The chosen platform directly affects usability, variety of content, as well as complexity of settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.euronics.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smart tvs" class="if uuid-2506220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506220.jpg"></div><p>  Many manufacturers offer their own branded OS, but judging by the numerous reviews of televisions with Internet access, there are only three options to stop.  This is the familiar and universal Android platform, the development of Samsung - Tizen and the proprietary OS of LG - WebOS.  As such, there is no brand binding to the operating system, so these shells can be seen among a wide range of manufacturers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  To the question of how much does a TV with Internet access cost, there is no definite answer.  The line "Smart TV" in the specification for the device does not affect the price tag so much.  And the cost still depends on the usual qualities of the TV: matrix, brand, design, additional functionality, etc. </p><p>  Next, we consider specific models of TVs with Internet access, that is, with the Smart TV function. </p><h2>  Telefunken TF-LED48S39T2S </h2><p>  Distrust of unfamiliar manufacturers is justified, but there are some exceptions to each rule.  This can be called a television with Internet access Telefunken TF-LED48S39T2S.  The model boasts not only an attractive price tag and high-quality assembly, but also decent functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sidex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smart tv" class="if uuid-2506216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506216.jpg"></div><p>  Smart TV runs on the Android platform, and the interface is correctly localized into Russian.  Therefore, there are no problems with the settings and subsequent use.  The model is also notable for its wide diagonal (48 inches) and full support for Full HD-sweep. </p><p>  In addition, the device can please with its own memory of 8 GB and an abundance of interfaces for connecting peripherals.  And all this at a more than affordable cost. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The estimated price of the model is about 23,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony KDL-48WD653 </h2><p>  Sony TVs have always been distinguished by exceptional build quality and excellent image.  This model with support for Smart TV was no exception.  As for the platform for ‚Äúsmart‚Äù TV, then about ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù users leave mixed reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m3.idg.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony tv" class="if uuid-2506217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506217.jpg"></div><p>  For some, these are native penates, and on this operating system it feels like a fish in water, but someone is forced to dismiss the interface scornfully and deal with non-standard functionality.  Nevertheless, the model has all the necessary tools for working with the Internet, and, in fact, there is nothing to reproach it with. </p><p>  The device also boasts an excellent matrix with Full HD-sweep, support for wireless protocols Wi-Fi and DLNA (home network) and stereo sound with support for modern technology "Dolby Digital".  Perhaps the only serious drawback of the model is the meager set of interfaces: 2 HDMI outputs are clearly not enough for connecting peripherals. </p><p>  The estimated cost of the TV is about 37,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Philips 55PUS6401 </h2><p>  The main advantages of the 55-inch device, in addition to the full support of Smart TV, are a matrix with 4K resolution and an ultra-thin body that attracts the eye.  It is also worth mentioning the presence of the sensational dynamic Ambilight backlight, which is mainly equipped only with premium segment gadgets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearopen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv Philips" class="if uuid-2506218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506218.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚Äúsmart‚Äù part of the TV runs on the Android platform, so there should not be any problems with adaptation and settings.  The user has a lot of pre-installed software like a browser, games and multimedia applications. </p><p>  The model is good for many, but the only thing users complain about in their reviews is the inability to remove the programs installed by default.  Yes, someone likes the variety, and the extra icons on the screen do not bother him at all, but there are those who want to organize their own desktop, and such a ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù will be clearly inappropriate. </p><p>  The estimated price of the model is about 60,000 rubles. </p><h2>  LG OLED55C6V </h2><p>  Many people rightly consider the LG brand to be a pioneer in terms of trends and various kinds of innovations in this area.  The invention of screens based on <span>organic LEDs</span> alone is worth what, not to mention the proprietary Smart TV on its own WebOS platform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv lg" class="if uuid-2506219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2506219.jpg"></div><p>  The 55-inch OLED55C6V model from the venerable brand is perhaps the best that the smart TV segment can offer.  The device has been worked out to the smallest detail, and there are simply no minor flaws. </p><p>  First of all, the model boasts the exceptional quality of the OLED screen with support for 3D mode, the extremely friendly interface of the proprietary WebOS platform, surround sound of the Dolby Digital standard, which is provided by 4 speakers, as well as the presence of all the necessary interfaces for connecting peripherals. </p><p>  Reviews on the LG TV are all positive, and the only thing the domestic consumer complains about is its price.  Yes, the price tag of the device is too high for the average user, but the exceptional quality has never been distinguished by its affordable cost.  In addition, the model has no direct analogues, and venerable competitors like Sony or Samsung have no attractive prices. </p><p>  The estimated cost of the TV is about 100,000 rubles. </p>
