At the same time, they use not only the necessary functional lighting, but also a variety of decorative lighting, such as a curtain garland.  In the light of modern developments and numerous improvements in the production <span>of lighting systems,</span> LED light sources have become very popular. </p><h2>  What is the essence of LED lighting </h2><p>  The device of each LED lamp provides for the presence of an anode and cathode, as well as an active semiconductor crystal and a reflector.  When electricity is applied, current flows from the anode to the cathode and provokes the occurrence of optical radiation. </p><p>  LED light sources can also be lamps for traditional chandeliers with a classic base, and a variety of bulbs for auxiliary lighting and illumination.  Also, LED lamps are presented by manufacturers as tapes with evenly spaced LEDs or as a garland (light curtain for indoor and <span>outdoor lighting).</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="light curtain" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1177197.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages of LED Lighting </h2><p>  The main argument in favor of LEDs is their efficiency and extremely long service life, up to 100 thousand hours.  In addition, they are characterized by the following qualities: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  No delay when turned on.  They light up instantly and work with stable brightness. </li><li>  Their service life does not depend on the number of on / off cycles, as with traditional lamps. </li><li>  Since there are no incandescent filaments or other sensitive components in LED lamps, they are vibration resistant. </li><li>  Safety due to the lack of high voltage and overheating of the LEDs during operation.  The average temperature of a working device is about 60 degrees. </li><li>  Ability to function in an environment with a very low temperature. </li></ul><p>  In addition, LED lamps are classified as environmentally friendly lighting, as they do not contain toxic and hazardous substances (mercury, phosphorus). </p><h2>  The use of LED lamps for decorative lighting </h2><p>  Illumination and decorative lighting perform several functions: </p><ul><li>  Attracting attention to individual elements of the interior or exterior. </li><li>  Zoning of space and organization of partial lighting. </li><li>  Masking surface imperfections (light curtain-fringe). </li><li>  Emphasizing the status of the institution (hotel, retail or office space). </li><li>  Room decoration, creating a festive atmosphere. </li></ul><p>  LEDs can be placed in the form of a luminous strip in niches or on ledges, as spotlights or retractable elements, as well as a <span>garland curtain on the wall</span> or in the opening of the building.  In addition, trees decorated with flickering garlands look very attractive. </p><h2>  Light curtain with LEDs </h2><p>  Quite unusual and extravagant looks one of the ways to decorate the interior and facades of buildings, which consists in placing a long garland with threads hanging in a fringe.  As a rule, the material for the manufacture of a flexible cable-base garland is plastic or silicone, its standard length is two meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="window curtain" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1176068.jpg" width="581"></div>

When choosing this <span>decorative lighting</span> system <span>,</span> it is worth paying particular attention to the length of the hanging threads.  It is advisable to measure the height of the wall or opening that will be decorated.  If necessary, you can assemble a curtain of light of any length.  On the edges of the base of each garland there are special connectors that allow you to connect several elements of the same type into a chain (up to 20 units). </p><h2>  Types of LED Curtains </h2><p>  Based on the purpose of the garland, its location, as well as the personal preferences of the owner of the premises and his financial capabilities, choose a monochrome or color backlight.  A multi-color luminous curtain can be equipped with a controller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garland light curtain" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1176064.jpg" width="500"></div>  This device allows you to select, fix and, if necessary, quickly change the mode of flickering lamps.  Elements of a curtain can burn evenly or blink with a certain periodicity and intensity.  Also, garlands can have lamps of various configurations.

    <p>  There is a kind of curtain called fringe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="light curtain fringe" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1176069.jpg" width="501"></div>  Such a system includes a standard loop base and LEDs hanging on the cords.  The difference between a fringe curtain is that these cords have uneven lengths.  As a rule, manufacturers use the alternation of long curtain elements with short ones.  This light curtain is used to decorate cornices, walls, roofs and windows.  It is placed directly along the top line of the decorated plane.

    <p>  Curtains with large lamps in the form of tubes or cones have a rather elegant and unusual appearance.  Being in the selected dynamic mode, such lamps create the effect of falling drops or meteor shower.  Garlands with a large number of lamps that shimmer and create the effect of pouring water look extremely attractive.  They are called that: light rain.  This type of curtain is installed on vertical planes, in niches, around columns or along glass display cases in retail premises, cafes or restaurants.  This model is suitable for creating volumetric sculptures and sagging ceilings. </p><h2>  LED lights for street lighting </h2><p>  Given the features of the operation of LED curtains when illuminating the exterior of buildings, developers have provided waterproof designs.  Their case and all the joints are hermetically sealed, so there is no need to remove the light curtain during rain and snow.  And the ability of LEDs to work at very low temperatures allows you to use them for New Year's decoration of many objects: </p><ul><li>  Facades of houses. </li><li>  Peaks and roofs. </li><li>  Fences. </li><li>  Trees and bushes. </li></ul><p>  Models designed for outdoor use, like other curtains, can be multi-color, monochrome, with or without a controller.  They can also have various dynamic modes of flicker or generate even lighting. </p><p>  Speaking about the possibility of decorating trees, it is worth noting that a light curtain with LEDs used for this purpose is much more convenient than a traditional ribbon with LED lamps.  This model is easier to mount, remove and change the location of the decor on the branches. </p><h2>  Installation of a curtain for the street </h2><p>  LED garlands designed for outdoor use can use batteries or a traditional home network connection as a power source.  Their installation consists in fixing the loop base along the upper edge of the vertical plane, which is planned to be decorated.  First you need to take measurements and make sure that the length of the curtain corresponds to the width of the surface to be decorated.  The curtain can be fixed using any available fasteners: brackets, clamps, cords, wire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curtain garland" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1176066.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that the light curtain on the windows, facades and roofs of tall buildings should be installed only with the participation of specialists.  It requires knowledge of the methods and methods of high-altitude electrical installation and lifting equipment. </p><p>  However, the placement of garlands on the porch, railing, low fence or bushes can be done on their own. </p><h2>  Indoor <span>LED Curtain</span> Installation </h2><p>  When planning the location of LED lighting in a house or apartment, you should study the <span>lighting standards of</span> residential premises.  Excessive brightness of light sources can be tiring for the eyes.  However, this issue is solved by using a curtain with a controller and a function to control the brightness of the glow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led curtain light" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1176063.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <p>  Light curtains for windows, walls, columns or niches are mounted using various fasteners.  Brackets for attaching wires, double-sided tape, suction mounts or other available materials are suitable for this purpose.  Before fixing the curtain, you need to carefully calculate the area to be decorated and compare their results with the dimensions of the curtain.  It should be noted that insufficient length of the hanging elements of the curtain is as unacceptable as excessive.  In both cases, the garland will not fulfill its decorative function.  If the sizes do not match, the decor will look sloppy, unaesthetic and violate the stylistic integrity of the interior. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, the LED curtain allows you to give a festive and elegant look to almost any room.  A variety of types of such garlands opens up wide possibilities for decorating residential and office premises, retail, hotel and entertainment organizations.  The advantage of street LED curtains, of course, is their frost resistance, waterproofing and ease of installation.  With their help, building facades, trees, columns and fences can be lit.  Regardless of the type of curtain, its installation must be done accurately and efficiently.  Sometimes such work requires the participation of a professional electrician. </p>
