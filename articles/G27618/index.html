    <h2>  Karon and Kata </h2><p>  These beach spots are located fifteen kilometers from Phuket Town and Patong.  We can say that these are the most popular tourist parties on the island.  A lot of hotels, at the same time at very different prices - from Hilton to modest three rubles.  Russian tourists like to settle on Karon, so there are even corresponding signs here.  Many different cafes, including beach ones.  Kata is a more sophisticated place with beautiful streets, fashionable massage parlors and cozy expensive cafes.  Unlike Karon, this beach has more shade.  Hire of sun loungers costs one hundred two hundred baht per day.  There is also a stone cape exit, near which you can snorkel.  On the hill between the beaches is "Dino Park" with figures of extinct dinosaurs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Diamond cottage resort spa 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/693417.jpg" width="600"></div>
