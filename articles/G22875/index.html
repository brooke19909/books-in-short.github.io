Although this is one of the resorts opened back in 1995, the rest here is offered with comfort, by modern standards.  The hotel has four stars on the sign, but tourists leave mostly positive feedback about it.  It is on the first line, its own beach, and the views of the Red Sea are simply amazing.  And now we will tell you more about both this hotel and what tourists say about it.  Moreover, having acquired a package trip to this hotel, you will actually find yourself in three at once. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Aladdin Hurghada Description" class="if uuid-2341420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2341420.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Due to the fact that tour operators have suspended the sale of permits in the Egyptian direction, some travelers who miss the Red Sea resorts get here on their own.  But it is not so simple.  There are no direct flights to Egypt from Russian cities yet, and travel costs have almost doubled.  True, experienced vacationers have found a way out and use the services of Belarusian or Ukrainian tour operators.  From Kiev or Minsk, quite budget charters can take you to the resort hub in 4-5 hours.  The cost of such a ticket, as a rule, includes a transfer.  From Hurghada Airport to the hotel "Aladdin" only eight kilometers.  Therefore, you will not even notice how you find yourself on vacation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="27.1070119" data-lng="33.83218290000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/6/7/1667.png"></div><h2>  How to get around Hurghada </h2><p>  The most popular resort in Egypt is famous for its affordable prices, which will allow even not too rich tourists to spend their holidays here.  The guests of the Aladdin Hotel (Hurghada), a photo of which we provide here as an illustration, are no exception.  Tourists advise to leave the hotel in any district of the city by minibus.  It is inexpensive, but to stop it, you just need to wave your hand anywhere on the track.  It is advisable to immediately name the destination and carry small Egyptian pounds.  For example, not too far from "Aladdin" is a large water museum - Hurghada Aquarium.  It is easy and inexpensive to get there by public transport.  It is worth going to the old district of the city - El Dahar, wandering along the winding streets, bargaining and feeling a real oriental flavor. </p><h2>  What is nearby </h2><p>  A ten-minute walk from the hotel is the Senzomall shopping center.  There you can cheaply buy underwear, beach accessories, fruits (strawberries, mangoes).  Also nearby is the Cleopatra Bazaar.  There is less choice, but lower prices.  Be that as it may, tourists are not left without shopping.  Opposite the hotel, across the road, towards the desert, is the Titanic Waterpark Resort Hotel.  Guests of the Aladdin Hotel can visit it for free once during their stay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Aladdin (Hurghada): description of the territory </h2><p>  The hotel complex is spread over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã134 thousand square meters.
