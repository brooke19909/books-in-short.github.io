    <h2>  Art.  220 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation: property tax deductions </h2><p>  In the process of determining the taxable base, in accordance with paragraph 3 of rule 210, the subject has the right to reduce the amount of deductions to the budget.  In particular, he may receive a <span>property tax deduction</span> upon the sale of property, a share in it or the authorized capital of the company.  This feature occurs when: </p><ol><li>  Leaving the organization. </li><li>  Transfer of funds in connection with the liquidation of the company. </li><li>  Decrease in the par value of the share in the authorized capital. </li><li>  Assignment, if an agreement was signed on the acquisition of a residential building on the basis of shared participation in construction. </li></ol><p>  The subject can expect to reduce the amount of mandatory deduction in the amount of the redemption price of the land plot or the structure located on it, which he received in kind or in money when the object was seized for municipal or state needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Costs of an entity to purchase objects </h2><p>  When determining the base, a subject can compensate for its actual expenses for the purchase of an apartment, room, building or shares in them intended for permanent residence, as well as for their new construction.  The amount of deductions can be reduced by the cost of the purchase of a land plot provided for individual housing construction, as well as within the boundaries of which there is a building that is becoming the property. </p><h2>  Features of the calculation </h2><p>  <span>The tax deduction is</span> granted to the entity in the amount of the expenses incurred by him for the construction or purchase of one or more objects.  Moreover, its size should not be more than 2 million p.  If a person took advantage of this opportunity partially (received less than the specified amount), the balance may be taken into account in the future.  For example, a person can again reduce the mandatory deduction to the budget when erecting another structure or receiving the object in private possession within the unused amount.  A similar rule applies to land, shares in them.  The limit value of the deduction is equal to the size that was in effect in the period in which the subject first had the opportunity to receive it.  When purchasing a land plot or a share in it intended for private housing construction, the amount of mandatory deduction can be reduced after receipt of the relevant title documents in the manner prescribed by the relevant law. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="st 220 nk rf property tax deductions" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1230364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other cases </h2><p>  When selling property in connection with the liquidation of a company, withdrawing from it, reducing the par value of a share, assignment under an agreement on shared participation in construction, an entity may reduce the object of taxation.  The amount of confirmed costs relating to the purchase of these valuables is taken into account.  The taxpayer expenses may include: </p><ol><li>  Contributions to the authorized capital upon foundation of the organization or upon increase in the company's monetary fund. </li><li>  Costs to purchase or expand a stake. </li></ol><p>  In the absence of the above-mentioned expenses certified by securities, the amount of the budget deduction may be reduced by the amount of receipts received upon termination of participation in the organization.  Moreover, in general, they should not be more than 250 tons. </p><h2>  Accounting income </h2><p>  Its order also defines the Tax Code.  Art.  220 indicates that when transferring a share in the capital of a company owned by an entity, the costs of its receipt are taken into account in proportion to its decrease.  Profit can be paid to the participant in kind or in cash due to a decrease in the company's fund.  In this case, the funds spent by a person on its purchase should be accounted for in proportion to the decrease in the capital of the organization.  An increase in the fund of an enterprise may occur due to revaluation of its assets.  In such cases, when reducing the costs of the entity are taken into account in the amount of payment in excess of the increase in the nominal value of its share. </p><h2>  Liquidation of a foreign company </h2><p>  The tax code (Article 220) in this case also provides for the possibility of the subject to reduce the object of taxation.  The procedure applies to the shareholder, founder, shareholder, participant, controlling person.  Upon the sale of property obtained upon termination of the activity of a foreign company or structure without the formation of a legal entity, the profits of which were exempt from taxation under paragraph 60 of rule 217, the object is reduced by an amount equal to the value of material assets.  It is determined in accordance with the accounting data of the liquidated enterprise.  The information taken is generalized at the date of receipt of property from such an organization.  It is indicated in the papers that the subject attaches to the application.  In this case, the value of the property should not be higher than the market, determined by the provisions of Art.  105.3 Tax Code. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="actual acquisition costs" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1230366.jpg" width="600"></div>
