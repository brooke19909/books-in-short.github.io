    <h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  What excursions can I take from Miramare Ariadni Village 4?  Crete is an island that attracts travelers with its secrets of ancient history, as well as marvelous landscapes.

But if car rental is not for you, you can take advantage of the proposed excursions.  One of the hotel‚Äôs favorite trips is a ferry to <span>Chrisi Island.</span>  This is something like the Greek "Dominican Republic", and not without reason many tourists characterize it as a paradise on earth.
