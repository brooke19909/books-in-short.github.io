    <h2>  Italy, Lake Iseo: description </h2><p>  A beautiful reservoir is located in the Pre-Alps, between two well-known and larger lakes - Garda and Como.  Iseo is narrow and long, ‚Äúguarded‚Äù by rebellious mountain peaks.  The reservoir area is 65.3 square kilometers.  The set maximum depth is 251 m. </p><p>  A small lake, rarely visited by tourists from other countries - why did it become popular among "friends"?  The fact is that its waters are washed by the most famous in Europe and the highest inhabited island (600 m above sea level) - Monte Isola, which translates as "mountain island".  Also on the territory of Lake Iseo there are two more small islands - San Paolo and Loreto. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The river Olo flows through Iseo, and its banks are rocky and steep.  However, this is not surprising for a country like Italy.  Lake Iseo fills the basin of an ancient glacier.  By the way, Olo is the left tributary of the Po River, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake (in a narrower sense, that is, the part of the reservoir that passes between the hills and mountains) is called Sebino.  At one end it flows into Brescia, the other at Bergamo.  In the valley, a place was discovered where an ancient civilization supposedly once existed.  Excavations have been carried out here, and today this territory is an object protected by UNESCO. </p><p>  Iseo is characterized by high coasts and homogeneous, but such impressive landscapes.  Settlements are located along the banks.  Among them are Sarnico, Lovere, Pisone and, of course, Iseo.  All these cities are famous for their sights, in particular medieval objects. </p>

    <h2>  Why is it worth choosing Iseo for the trip, and why are tourists from other countries rarely here? </h2><p>  There are many beautiful places, especially in a country like Italy.  Lake Iseo is worth a visit no less than the rest, if only because there are many picturesque coasts, and in general it is a real paradise for young people.  There is a swimming pool, as well as ample opportunities for windsurfing, sailing and rowing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We must not forget about the architectural treasures that you can see during a tour of the surroundings of Lake Iseo.  In short, in this area you can enjoy the pleasing views of landscapes painted by Mother Nature herself, and architectural objects created by the hand of man. </p><p>  Why are tourists from other countries rarely visited here?  As a rule, when a person comes to a foreign country, he tries to explore the sights that play a crucial role for the whole world, or only for a certain people / state.  It is also worth saying that few people know about the existence of Iseo.  Therefore, it is not surprising that guests of the country are practically not here.  Yes, and swim in it will not work - the water is cold.  It so happened that more often the Italians come to Iseo who want to be alone with nature. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions in the area </h2><p>  In the area where Lake Iseo <span>(Italy) is located,</span> there are many <span>attractions</span> .  First of all, tourists cruise around the three islands.  These are the main attractions of the Pre-Alpine zone (Monte <span>Isola, Isola</span> Loreto and Isola San Paolo). </p><p>  Monte Isola is divided in half by the mountain.  One part is forested, with steep slopes, and the second is more even and free from thickets.  People live here.  You should see this magnificence: small houses with spacious terraces, surrounded by olive trees and vineyards!  At the very top is the main attraction - Madonna della Cheriola - a chapel resembling (like many other objects in the area) the medieval period.  Noteworthy are the villages with villas - one more beautiful than the other.  For example, in Sincignano there is the Church of St. Michael of 1648, and nearby - Oldofredi Castle.  In Karzano, it is worthwhile to devote time to visiting the church of St. John the Baptist, and in Massa - the church of Saints Rocco and Pantaleon. </p><p>  On the island of Loreto are the ruins of the town of Iseo, abandoned in the 16th century, and the ruins of an ancient fortress with two towers and a chapel were also found here.  In general, it is a very picturesque island. </p>

    <h2>  Italy, Lake Iseo - how to get there? </h2><p>  The easiest way is to fly to the city of Bergamo (by plane), then take the bus at the bus station opposite the railway and get to the city of Lovere, in the north of Iseo.  You can also get to the lake by train from cities such as Milan and Brescia.  If you have a car, you need to follow the A4 highway from Milan in a northwest direction. </p>
