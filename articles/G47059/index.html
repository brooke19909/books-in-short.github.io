    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  <span>The tax social benefit</span> is valid for as long as the documents submitted for its receipt are valid.  Legal exemptions are provided not only for citizens, but also for organizations.  The state pursues certain goals by introducing benefits.  First of all, the authorities thus seek to increase the level of protection of the population, to support the development of small business and production.  In this regard, often during a period of economic crisis, laws are introduced that establish a particular <span>tax benefit.</span>  <span>This</span> relief is intended, among other things, to improve the material condition of some categories of citizens.  These include, in particular, people with disabilities, large families, senior citizens, and so on.  By and large, any <span>tax benefit is a</span> decrease in revenues to the budget revenues, that is, damage to the state.  Nevertheless, under certain conditions, such exemptions are necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to exercise your right? </h2><p>  It is worth saying that many citizens do not know that they are beneficiaries.  You can get the necessary information at the territorial division of the Federal Tax Service.  To use the right to receive benefits, you need to collect a certain package of documents.  The specific list of securities will depend on which category the citizen belongs to.  So, for example, a pensioner will need his ID, a large family - a birth certificate for children, and a certificate from a medical institution for persons with disabilities.  Documents (originals and copies) are submitted to the territorial division of the Federal Tax Service.  An application is filled out there.  Documents are submitted by February 1 of next year. </p><h2>  Additionally </h2><p>  In addition to the above types of benefits, there are other specific reliefs.  For example, the law provides for the removal of certain values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the category of taxable objects.  For example, the educational institution received equipment for educational use.  It will not be taxed.  The law also provides for tax rebates.  They represent a decrease in the base by a certain percentage. </p>
