    <h2>  Exotic zoo </h2><p>  In the shopping center on the same floor there is another unique place with no less interesting inhabitants.  The discoveries of the ‚ÄúExoPark‚Äù were awaited with the same impatience as its neighbor - the oceanarium. </p><p>  The area is about 2500 square meters.  Fifty species of exotic animals collected from all over the planet live on this territory.  In addition to them, there are still more than four hundred inhabitants, such as various reptiles, mammals and amphibians. </p><p>  Each species is located in its own aviary, where their habitual habitat was specially created for them.  That is why ExoPark is divided into Africa, South America, Australia and Southeast Asia. </p><h2>  Other entertainments </h2><p>  When visiting the aquarium, you can go to the cozy cafe-restaurant of the family-type Jungle Land.  The amazing interior of this place will appeal to both adults and children.  This institution is decorated in the style of the <span>Mesozoic era</span> and is a real illustration of the dinosaur era. </p>
