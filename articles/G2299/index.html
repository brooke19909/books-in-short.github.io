The end to it was the signing of the Gulistan Peace - an agreement concluded between the government of Russia and Persia (Iran) in 1813.  He laid the foundation for a new period in the life of the Caucasian peoples and for many years saved them from the encroachments of aggressive neighbors. </p>

    <h2>  Russian fortresses on the Terek </h2><p>  In order to fully understand the significance that the Gulistan world (1813) had, one should turn to history and trace the ongoing series of invasions of Iran and Turkey on the territory of the Caucasus.  It began in the sixteenth century, when in Russia, after the accession of the Astrakhan and Kazan Khanates to it, the process of establishing a centralized state was completed. </p><p>  Despite all the difficulties of that period, in 1567, Tsar Ivan the Terrible found the opportunity to build several fortresses on the Terek, blocking the path of Turkish and Persian conquerors.  This was the beginning of the process of establishing friendly relations between Russia and the peoples of the Caucasus, one of the links of which was the Gulustan peace signed two and a half centuries later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Meanwhile, the construction of fortresses on the Terek has caused tension between Russia, Iran, and especially Turkey, which was planning to expand its expansion throughout the North Caucasus.  Russia, in turn, was also interested in strengthening its position in this strategically important area, and repeatedly reflected the advance of the Ottoman forces. </p><h2>  Seeking help from a northern neighbor </h2><p>  In the ensuing eighteenth century, tensions intensified even more, becoming a consequence of fierce competition between Iran and Turkey, which was trying by all means to win over local khans and thus gain priority. </p>

    <p>  In this situation, the <span>population of the Caucasus,</span> and especially the Dagestanis, found it very difficult, and they repeatedly appealed to the Russian authorities with requests to come to their aid during the 18th and subsequent 19th centuries.  In the future, this served as a factor due to which the Gulistan Peace was signed. </p><h2>  The desire of the Caucasian rulers under the scepter of Russian tsars </h2><p>  Based on the wishes of the inhabitants of Dagestan themselves, the founder of the Romanov Dynasty, Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich, a year after his accession to the throne, took under the Russian jurisdiction the Avar, Erpelinsky, Kazikumukh and Kumyk khans along with their territories. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Later on, throughout the 17th century, several more khans followed their example, which contributed to an additional strengthening of Russia's position in the Caucasus.  All local rulers who voluntarily entered the scepter of the Moscow Tsar took upon themselves the obligation to protect the Russian merchants, as well as replenish the ranks of the regular army with their compatriots.  Subject to compliance with these requirements, they received a salary from the treasury, otherwise they were declared illegal. </p><h2>  Turkish aggression in the guise of a religious war </h2><p>  The peace thus established in the Caucasus turned out to be short-lived.  Already in the next XVIII century, Turkey, which intensified its actions, brought discord.  This time, the reason for the expansion was, according to the statements of its rulers, the retreat of a number of Caucasian peoples, and especially the inhabitants of Dagestan, from Sharia law.  By declaring them a holy war of jihad, the Turks launched an open aggression. </p>

    <p>  In fact, Turkey was prompted by the weakening of Iran (Persia), which was observed during that period, which was the result of the protracted economic crisis.  Since this particular state was considered by Istanbul as the main competitor, this moment seemed to the Sultan the most favorable for a radical solution to territorial disputes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  18th century territorial disputes </h2><p>  However, the plans of the Shining Port (so often called Turkey) were hindered by the very same Russia headed by Peter I. By carrying out the Caspian expedition in 1722 and concluding a peace treaty with Persia, he annexed Baku, Derbent, Rasht to the Russian Empire, as well as a number of provinces claimed by Turkey. </p><p>  Then the sovereign took the citizenship of several more Dagestan feudal lords.  Even though the Ottomans managed to devastate Armenia, Georgia and a significant part of Azerbaijan, the sultan was forced to recognize Russia's rights to acquire it in the Caspian Sea region.  However, the concluded diplomatic agreements could not put an end to the continuous wars that torn the Caucasus throughout the eighteenth century. </p><h2>  Signing a peace treaty with Turkey </h2><p>  Despite the fact that in the first decade of the 19th century, the whole of Dagestan and the eastern part of Georgia were officially under the jurisdiction of the Russian tsars, both Turks and Iranians again intensified their actions, wishing to take advantage of the difficulties that Russia experienced at that time. </p>

    <p>  However, in spite of everything, the representatives of the <span>diplomatic corps of</span> Alexander I in 1812 managed to conclude a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire, putting an end to the Russo-Turkish war, which lasted for the past six years.  The signing of this document for some time forced the Turks to abandon active actions in the Caucasus.  It remained to resolve all issues with Persia (Iran), and such a case soon presented itself. </p><h2>  Agreement signed in Gulistan </h2><p>  The following year ended the Russian-Persian war, which continued for the past nine years, in which the Persians suffered a crushing defeat, and their commander in chief, heir to the throne, barely escaped captivity.  Such deplorable results of the military campaign demoralized both the country's population and the ruling elite. </p><p>  As a result, Russian diplomats were given the opportunity to conclude the Gulistan Peace Treaty (1813) on favorable conditions for Moscow.  Russia signed this document with Iran on September 12 in the small Karabakh village of Gulistan, which gave it its name and thus went down in history. </p><p>  The British diplomat Sir Gore Ousley acted as a mediator in the negotiations.  On the Russian side, the Gulistan peace, the terms of which were formulated in 11 articles, was signed by Lieutenant General N. Rtishchev, and on the Persian side by Abul-Hassan Khan. </p>

    <p>  The worked out agreement was welcomed by all the peoples of the Caucasus.  This is not surprising, since the preceding hostilities greatly undermined their economy, the restoration of which was facilitated by the Gulistan Peace Treaty.  You can summarize its essence by focusing on the main provisions contained in it. </p><h2>  What did the next contract with Persia bring with it </h2><p>  First of all, it provided for the cessation of mutual hostile actions and the establishment of peace between Russia and Persia.  Further, the document clearly stipulated the borders separating the two previously warring parties, and listed the territories that had ceded to the Russian Empire, including Abkhazia, Imereti, Kakheti, Dagestan, Guria, Megrelia, Kartli, as well as a significant part of modern Azerbaijan.  In turn, Russia, by signing the Gulistan Peace, committed itself to provide comprehensive assistance to Persia. </p><p>  In addition, the agreement reached provided for the right of each of the parties to free swimming throughout the Caspian Sea and the exchange of prisoners captured during the past war.  In the field of further diplomatic relations between Russia and the Persian state, the status of ambassadors and ministers was clearly defined. </p><h2>  Establishment of legal norms in the field of trade </h2><p>  Of the eleven articles of the treaty, three were rules of trade between the two countries, also included in the Gulistan Peace Treaty.  The terms of the agreement provided for freedom of commercial activity of merchants of both sides in the territories of both states.  In addition, the amount of duties collected was determined, and issues related to non-customs trade were also considered. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the Gulistan world clearly and clearly established legal norms that allowed us to hope for a speedy increase in trade turnover between the two states, in fact it came with a long delay, the reason for which was bureaucratic delays. </p><p>  Due to the fault of Russian officials, a customs duty was levied at the customs of Astrakhan and Baku for the next five years, stipulated by the ‚ÄúRestrictive Tariff of 1755‚Äù, which had long outlived its duties, and implying payment of 23% of the value of the imported goods. </p><h2>  Consequences of the conclusion of the Gulistan Treaty </h2><p>  The current situation normalized only after the Gulistan Peace Treaty was officially promulgated in 1815.  The conditions briefly listed in the previous sections of the article created the legal basis for establishing peaceful relations, which ultimately led to positive shifts in the commercial sphere.  As a result, the entire economy has won. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the Gulistan peace was concluded primarily with the goal of normalizing relations between Russia and Persia, it also had a number of side effects - both positive and negative.  On the one hand, he saved the peoples of Transcaucasia from the invasions of the Persian and Turkish invaders, helped to eliminate the centuries-old feudal fragmentation and boost the economy, and hence the standard of living to a new height.  But on the other hand, the resulting rapprochement between the Russians and the inhabitants of the Caucasus often became the cause of conflicts that arose between them on ethnic and religious grounds. </p>

    <h2>  A new war and another peace treaty </h2><p>  In addition, the peace that reigned as a result of the conclusion of the Gulistan Treaty turned out to be fragile.  Already in 1826, Persia, instigated by Great Britain, violating the agreement reached earlier, unleashed a new Russian-Persian war, which lasted two years and ended in its next rout. </p><p>  When the guns fell silent, and the initiative passed from the military to the diplomats, a peace treaty was concluded, called Turkmanchay.  According to his articles, Russia retained all the territories that had ceded to it as a result of the Gulistan Agreement signed thirteen years ago.  Moreover, it received under its jurisdiction the Nakhichevan and <span>Erivan Khanates,</span> as well as the territory of Eastern Armenia.  It is known that the prominent Russian poet, playwright and diplomat Alexander Sergeyevich Griboedov took part in the development of the terms of this agreement. </p>
