    <h2>  Children's game or adult hobby? </h2><p>  Oh, these boys!  It just so happened that from early childhood they were surrounded by all kinds of soldiers, cars, tanks, railroads, etc. And some of them did not want to part with this fascinating world, although not real, but technology.  As children, they try to copy their favorite car models from toy boxes, cardboard, paper.  And later, when they grow up, this childhood hobby for many of them becomes an interesting and <span>unusual hobby.</span>  Often young dads inherit it to their children.  So there are whole collections of models of various brands of military equipment, racing cars and other exhibits created from improvised means.  And if your kid tries to make something himself by screwing, for example, an empty tin can (supposedly a wheel) to a shoe box, maybe it‚Äôs worthwhile to help him, and not scold him because of the eternal mess in the nursery?  Let the first theme of your joint studies be a craft - a cardboard tank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard tank models" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/406876.jpg" width="560"></div></h2><h2>  Materials for creativity </h2><p>  Since we are talking about manufacturing armored vehicles, though not real, you need to choose thick cardboard, and even better, large boxes from under shoes, products, etc., which have a multilayer texture.  In addition to conventional scissors with long blades, a knife with a point in the form of a serrated file will not hurt, which will significantly speed up the process of preparing and cutting parts.  Of course, only an adult should use such items.  When making crafts during independent creative activities, give your baby only small scissors with blunt ends, <span>colored pencils,</span> paints and glue.  Having mastered the simple technique of connecting parts, you can offer him a new method of connection - using flexible wire.  And so, through gradual improvement, we can gradually move on to the production of more complex models with the addition of other improvised materials - unnecessary hoses, caps, plastic bottles, etc. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard tank" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/406879.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Basic assembly order </h2><p>  Let's get acquainted with how to make a tank of cardboard or thick paper.  The basic assembly order, no doubt, each master can have his own.  In addition, the manufacturing technology of certain machines will not be understood at all by a simple layman.  But it describes how to make a tank of cardboard, for a beginner who is just starting to take his first steps in the science of "paperwork".  It will be very good if there is a pattern found on the Internet.  The procedure is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Fold the body part out of two large sheets of cardboard.  In the middle, make a hole for the tower. </li><li>  Decorate the body with a few long or triangular stripes imitating armor. </li><li>  Cut the wheels, which are painted with felt-tip pens. </li><li>  On top of them, fasten the rim from a strip of paper. </li><li>  The tower may be simply rectangular, or may have a more complex structure.  Make it according to your desire and skill.  Mount the tower on top of the tank. </li><li>  Fold the paper into a tube and glue it.  Attach the resulting muzzle to the front of the tower. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard tank" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/406878.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  How to make a cardboard tank neatly and quickly </h2><p>  The assembly of a simple model of equipment is completed.  Comprehending the basics of this applied art, it is necessary to follow the following rules and recommendations with further work: </p><ul><li>  It is better to take transparent glue so that the material does not have any contaminants. </li><li>  Cutting out the layout, do not immediately rush to get to the right size.  It is better to carry out the work gradually, in several stages, so that there are no defective parts due to lack of material. </li><li>  For used cans, immediately after opening, bend the serrated edge inward to avoid a cut. </li><li>  Plastic bottles may change shape when heated.  This interesting property will help to find application for this material. </li><li>  Use proven drawings.  This will significantly save time in the manufacture of subsequent crafts.  Therefore, the construction of schemes is most responsible. </li></ul><h2>  Different models of cardboard tanks </h2><p>  By learning how to make simple models, you can try more complex design.  Having made a tank of cardboard as the first craft, the boy will proceed to the next.  It can be not only other brands of armored vehicles, cars, jeeps and vans, but also helicopters, airplanes.  Who knows, maybe the child will in the future become a design engineer of real sea ships or spaceships.  And it all started with a simple tank, which in appearance looked more like an ordinary box, rather than a model of armored vehicles.  Therefore, from childhood it is necessary to instill in children the ability to think figuratively and the desire to translate their dreams into reality! </p>
