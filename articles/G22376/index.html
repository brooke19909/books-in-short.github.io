Their creation was preceded by a centuries-old history of the development of science and technology.  The space age, which allowed people to take a look at the world in which they live, lifted us to a new stage of development.  A rocket in space today is not a dream, but a matter of concern for highly skilled specialists who are faced with the task of improving existing technologies.  The types of spacecraft that are distinguished and how they differ from each other will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  Spacecraft - a generic name for any device designed to work in space.  There are several options for their classification.  In the simplest case, spacecraft are manned and automatic.  The first, in turn, are divided into space ships and stations.  Different in their capabilities and purpose, they are similar in many respects in structure and equipment used. </p>

    <h2>  Flight features </h2><p>  After launch, any spacecraft passes through three main stages: launching into orbit, actually flight and landing.  The first stage involves the development by the apparatus of the speed necessary to enter outer space.  In order to get into orbit, its value must be 7.9 km / s.  Complete overcoming of gravity implies the development of a second <span>cosmic velocity</span> of 11.2 km / s.  This is how a rocket moves in space when its target is remote areas of the universe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  After liberation from attraction follows the second stage.  In the process of orbital flight, the movement of spacecraft occurs by inertia, due to the acceleration given to them.  Finally, the landing stage involves reducing the speed of the ship, satellite or station to almost zero. </p><h2>  "Filling" </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spacecraft engines" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/750495.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Each spacecraft is equipped with equipment to match the tasks that it is designed to solve.  However, the main discrepancy is associated with the so-called target equipment, which is necessary just for obtaining data and various scientific studies.  The rest of the equipment in spacecraft is similar.  It includes the following systems: </p><ul><li>  energy supply - most often the spacecraft are supplied with the necessary energy by solar or radioisotope batteries, chemical batteries, nuclear reactors; </li><li>  communication - is carried out using a radio wave signal, at a significant distance from the Earth, the exact pointing of the antenna becomes especially important; </li><li>  life support - the system is typical for manned spacecraft, thanks to it it becomes possible for people on board; </li><li>  orientation - like any other spacecraft, spacecraft are equipped with equipment for the continuous determination of their own position in space; </li><li>  motion - spacecraft engines allow you to make changes in flight speed, as well as in its direction. </li></ul><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  One of the main criteria for separating spacecraft into types is the mode of operation that determines their capabilities.  On this basis, the devices are distinguished: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  located in geocentric orbit, or artificial Earth satellites; </li><li>  those whose purpose is to study remote areas of space - automatic interplanetary stations; </li><li>  used to deliver people or necessary cargo to the orbit of our planet, they are called spaceships, can be automatic or manned; </li><li>  created for people to stay in space for a long period, these are <span>orbital stations</span> ; </li><li>  engaged in the delivery of people and goods from orbit to the surface of the planet, they are called descent; </li><li>  able to explore the planet, directly located on its surface, and move on it - these are planet rovers. </li></ul><p>  Let us dwell on some types. </p><h2>  AES (artificial Earth satellites) </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="artificial earth satellites physics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/750492.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The first vehicles launched into space were artificial Earth satellites.  Physics and its laws make putting any such device into orbit a daunting task.  Any device must overcome the attraction of the planet and then not fall on it.  For this, the satellite needs to move at the <span>first cosmic speed</span> or a little faster.  Above our planet, the conditional lower boundary of the possible satellite location (passes at an altitude of 300 km) is distinguished.  Closer placement will lead to a fairly rapid braking of the device in atmospheric conditions. </p><p>  Initially, only launch vehicles could deliver artificial Earth satellites into orbit.  Physics, however, does not stand still, and today new methods are being developed.  So, one of the methods most commonly used recently is launching another satellite from the side.  The plans for the application and other options. </p><p>  The orbits of spacecraft orbiting the Earth can lie at different heights.  Naturally, the time required for one lap also depends on this.  Satellites, whose circulation period is equal to days, are placed in the so-called <span>geostationary orbit.</span>  It is considered the most valuable, since the devices located on it, for the earth observer seem motionless, which means that there is no need to create mechanisms for turning antennas. </p><h2>  AMS (automatic interplanetary stations) </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spacecraft motion" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/750496.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Scientists get a huge amount of information about various objects of the solar system using spacecraft sent outside the geocentric orbit.  AMS objects are planets, asteroids, and comets, and even galaxies that are accessible for observation.  The tasks that are posed to such devices require enormous knowledge and strength from engineers and researchers.  AMC missions represent the embodiment of technological progress and are at the same time its incentive. </p><h2>  Manned spacecraft </h2><p>  Devices designed to deliver people to their intended purpose and return them back are technologically not inferior to the described types.  It is to this type that Vostok-1 belongs, on which Yuri Gagarin made his flight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spacecraft orbits" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/750493.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most difficult task for the creators of the manned spacecraft is to ensure the safety of the crew during their return to Earth.  Also a significant part of such vehicles is the emergency rescue system, which may be necessary during the launch of the spacecraft using a launch vehicle. </p><p>  Spacecraft, like the whole space program, are constantly being improved.  Recently, in the media one could often see reports on the activities of the Rosetta probe and the Fila descent vehicle.  They embody all the latest achievements in the field of space shipbuilding, calculating the movement of the device and so on.  The landing of the Fila probe on a comet is considered an event comparable to Gagarin‚Äôs flight.  The most interesting thing is that this is not the crown of human capabilities.  We are still awaiting new discoveries and achievements in terms of both space exploration and the structure of <span>aircraft.</span> </p>
