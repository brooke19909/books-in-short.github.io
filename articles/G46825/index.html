This gadget is of interest to many buyers.  After all, the model was announced by a fairly well-known manufacturer of mobile phones.  Should I pay attention to it?  What are the pros and cons of the manufacturer?  How satisfied are customers with the products?  To understand all this will help the feedback left by consumers.  In some issues, they may diverge - each has its own phone calls.  Therefore, one characteristics seem powerful, the other - weak.  Nevertheless, this factor does not significantly affect the overall quality of the gadget. </p><h2>  Availability </h2><p>  The first thing that attracts Fly 454 is its accessibility.  This smartphone model was released several years ago.  Therefore, now it is not difficult to find it in online stores or in an ordinary hardware store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 454" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1409719.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The fact that ‚ÄúFly‚Äù is not faked is also encouraging.  So, the purchase will give the consumer a guarantee.  If during the year any claims arise, they can be eliminated free of charge. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Fly 454 is a modern smartphone, which in its design is practically no different from its other counterparts.  Buyers point out that the device looks like a typical touch-screen phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, there are no flashy and superfluous elements here.  The case and panels are single-color, the corners of the smartphone are smooth, not pointed.  This allows you to easily carry the device in your pocket. </p><p>  In general, Japanese minimalism is felt in the design.  Nothing special, but the smartphone attracts the eyes.  The size of the gadget is quite large, it can not be called ultra-thin - 11.2 millimeters.  But this does not repel consumers, rather the opposite.  Indeed, large smartphones have large and good screens.  Just for fans of internet surfing and games! </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The next point that you pay attention to when choosing a phone is the screen.  The Fly 454 is large, but it does not have the highest resolution.  What is it about?  The smartphone offers a diagonal of a touch screen of 5 inches, but at the same time the resolution is 864 by 480 pixels.  Many say that is not enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone fly 454" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1409720.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Indeed, the image quality on the display could have been better.  But taking into account that the ‚ÄúFly 454‚Äù was published several years ago, there are no significant complaints in this area.  The picture as a whole is clear, bright and without flaws.  The eyes of such a display do not get tired even with long work. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  What other important characteristics are buyers interested in before deciding on a particular gadget?  For example, they pay attention to the camera.  Any modern Fly 454 phone is also a photo / video camera included. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this area, the smartphone is not getting the best reviews.  It is noted that the model has only one rear camera.  Its quality, according to customers, is ‚Äúmarching‚Äù - 5 megapixels.  Not too much for a modern phone. </p><p>  For shooting in motion or at night, the camera at the Fly is not suitable.  Also, in poor daylight, problems can occur.  But for ordinary pictures and amateur videos, you can easily use the capabilities of the presented phone. </p><p>  Some indicate that the disadvantage is the lack of a front camera.  Indeed, for video calls this phone model is not too good.  Not the most significant drawback, but it does occur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 454 feature" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1409721.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Further, an important feature is the memory of the mobile device.  There are 2 of them in modern gadgets - operational and ordinary.  The first is Fly 454 512 MB, the second is 4 GB.  In this case, you can optionally insert a memory card for user data.  A separate slot is provided for this purpose. </p><p>  Potential buyers indicate that the phone under study is not suitable for modern games and applications.  RAM in it is not enough.  And this is truly a true observation.  Nevertheless, for Fly 454 there are a considerable number of programs and toys that run without problems on the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are no claims to the built-in volume as such.  Yes, 4 GB of memory for the modern user is extremely small.  But if you wish, you can increase the free space.  Fly is more a business smartphone than a gaming one. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Many are interested in how firmware is produced for the studied product.  Fly 454 is a smartphone that allows you to easily launch a variety of games and applications, although not the newest.  The phone is equipped with the Android operating system version 4.2.  This assembly is considered the most successful, it does not require any additional manipulations like the next firmware. </p><p>  The studied smartphone has a standard operating system, it works without failures and malfunctions.  A convenient and simple interface is what attracts many buyers to the model.  Android lovers will love this phone.  Do you want to use the mentioned operating system along with a decent brainchild from "Fly"?  Then the 454th model is perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="firmware fly 454" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1409723.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Fly 454 reviews get mixed.  Some say that this phone is well suited for any purpose.  Someone says the opposite.  In fact, judging by the characteristics, the studied smartphone is more suitable for business and the Internet than for games. </p><p>  It does not differ in speed.  "Fly 454" sometimes slows down and takes a long time to respond to user commands.  Especially such sticking is noticeable with the simultaneous operation of several applications or games.  A normal phenomenon, in order not to encounter it, it is enough not to load the smartphone with processes. </p><p>  Nevertheless, over time, the operating system of the Fly 454 really begins to slow down.  This factor upsets many.  In this case, the speed decreases slightly.  There will be some discomfort at the very beginning, only they quickly get used to it. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the battery of the mobile device.  He makes many think about acquiring a gadget.  The thing is that the Fly 454 battery has a capacity of 2,000 mAh.  On average, with active use, the device works for about 2-3 days without recharging.  This includes browsing the internet (long), as well as listening to music.  Not too long, but not enough.  Most Android-based phones require recharging after active work a day later.  Therefore, "Fly" is clearly worthy of attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 454 case" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1409717.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are those who speak out negatively regarding the battery of a smartphone.  Some believe that 2-3 days of work without charging is not enough.  However, as already mentioned, this is more than similar phones can offer.  In standby mode, the gadget is able to work for about a month.  With inactive use - up to 8 days.  If there is a need, you can change the damaged battery yourself, which saves not only money on the phone repair, but also the buyer‚Äôs time. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Also, some pay attention to the configuration of the device.
