  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gigaset SL910: manual, review, photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the development of technology, smartphones are becoming more accessible every day.  In the ultra-budget segment, you can look at very good models for 4-5 thousand rubles.  In this regard, traditional fixed-line telephones are a thing of the past. </p><p>  We recall the latter only when we have long conversations with relatives, colleagues or friends.  Although this part of our everyday life was actively begun to take on all kinds of instant messengers with social networks. </p><p>  So the manufacturers of such equipment are not going through the best of times.  Despite this state of affairs, some of them are trying to stay afloat by releasing original phones that copy the usual mobile gadgets.  One of the most prominent representatives of this segment is the Siemens Gigaset SL910. </p><p>  The device turned out to be very successful, and most importantly - in demand by a wide range of consumers.  The phone‚Äôs presentation was held a long time ago, but it can still be found on sale, both in branded mobile phone stores and on the same Amazon with Ebay. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of the Gigaset SL910.  Consider the main characteristics of the device, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the opinion of experts and ordinary consumers regarding the performance of the model. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device comes in a pretty box of hard enough cardboard.  On the front you can see the image of the device itself, and on the back there is a small instruction for the Gigaset SL910 and a brief specification. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The end parts are reserved for the usual barcodes, labels and other dealer elements.  The interior is very sensibly organized, and the accessories do not beat apart and sit tightly in their grooves. </p><p>  Contents of delivery: </p><ul><li>  Gigaset SL910 phone </li><li>  instruction in Russian; </li><li>  dock station; </li><li>  base; </li><li>  battery. </li></ul><p>  There are no covers, handbags, films and other related accessories here.  So, if necessary, protection and other decorations will have to be bought separately.  Judging by the reviews, many owners were pleased with the instructions for the Gigaset SL910.  It is not as voluminous as that of competitors, but nevertheless very informative.  Few sections are designed essentially without water.  After reading it, there are no questions left, and my head does not go round about the amount of information received. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The bored design of most home phones no longer surprises anyone, so in the case of the Gigaset SL910, the manufacturer took a non-standard path.  The brand did not completely copy the appearance of smartphones, focusing on ergonomics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gigaset sl910 instruction" class="if uuid-3223611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223611.jpg"></div><p>  The device is not as thin as a regular mobile gadget, but very convenient.  The dimensions of the Gigaset SL910 cordless telephone are 134 x 58 x 16 mm and weighs 160 g. In the hand, it is very noticeable, but judging by the reviews, the owners do not consider this point a minus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fact is that when you talk on an ultra-thin smartphone, there is a feeling of fragility and fear for the device.  In addition, because of the "thinness" of the gadget, it does not lie completely in the palm of your hand, you have to constantly hold its edges with your fingers.  The Gigaset SL910 phone, unlike modern smartphones, lies perfectly in the hand, and talking on it is really convenient. </p><p>  Part of the front panel and edging around the chrome.  This solution looks very impressive, although you can‚Äôt call it practical.  Judging by the reviews of the Gigaset SL910, the front panel collects fingerprints with dust, like a vacuum cleaner.  The back cover also has a glossy finish with smooth-to-touch material. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  There is nothing to complain about.  All elements of the Gigaset SL910 case are tightly fitted to each other, and the device itself looks monolithic.  Users in their reviews do not note the presence of squeaks, backlashes, crunches and other shortcomings.  The same can be said about the docking station of the device. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the front of the Gigaset SL910, you can see the speech speaker.  Judging by the reviews, users characterize its volume above average.  The interlocutor on the other end of the wire is heard very well.  The proximity sensor behaves adequately and eliminates accidental clicks on the touch screen.  Directly above the speaker is an event indicator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="archiwum.allegro.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone gigaset sl910" class="if uuid-3223610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223610.jpg"></div><p>  At the bottom of the front panel there are three keys - ‚ÄúReceive‚Äù, ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnd call‚Äù.  Mechanical buttons with minimal stroke and clear pressure.  The keys are backlit so that they are clearly visible in the dark.  A bit lower is the microphone grill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the bottom there are interfaces for recharging the battery and mini-USB for synchronization with a personal computer.  On the flip side you can see the speakerphone and the name of the phone is the Gigaset SL910. </p><p>  The back cover can be removed by prying the bottom edge.  It is removed quite easily, but thanks to a well-thought-out design, accidental slippage is eliminated.  Under the cover is a branded Gigaset SL910 battery. </p><h2>  Dock station </h2><p>  The phone stand is made in the form of a trapezoid with a chrome-plated coating in one part and plastic in the other.  Dimensions of the station can be called small - 33 x 74 x 57 mm.  Behind the stand there is an interface for connecting the cable.  On the one hand, we have the usual plug for the outlet, and on the other, a specific contact pad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ligo.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gigaset sl910" class="if uuid-3223608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223608.jpg"></div><p>  The docking station stands on rubberized legs, so that sliding on a glossy surface is excluded.  The phone sits quite tightly in the slots of the receiver and does not go.  It is easily pulled out if you do not change the angle of the apparatus. </p><h2>  Base unit </h2><p>  This part is a black rectangle with a large mechanical key in the central part of the case.  The button is required to search for the device or register it.  If you look at the appearance of the docking station and the phone itself, then against their background the base unit looks faded and dull.  So it‚Äôs better to hide it out of sight somewhere in the nightstand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.helpdeskcomms.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gigaset sl910 battery" class="if uuid-3223612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223612.jpg"></div><p>  The base received RJ-45 interfaces and a specific RJ-11, as well as a proprietary power connector.  The device can be placed both on a horizontal surface and on a vertical one.  For this, rubberized legs and a pair of holes for fasteners in the rear are provided.  The dimensions of the base are quite modest - 105 x 132 x 46 mm, so there should be no problems with the placement. </p><p>  According to the instruction manual, the range of the phone ranges from 50 meters in block buildings and up to 300 meters ‚Äúin the open field‚Äù.  Judging by the feedback from users, the device stably receives a signal within the indicated limits, no disconnects were noticed. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  If we compare the display of the phone with the analogues of modern smartphones, then here we have a mediocre solution.  The device received a diagonal of 3.2 inches and a 320-by-480 scan of pixels on a TFT-VA matrix.  But considering that this is a phone, and not the entertainment center, which are smartphones, it can be argued that for its segment this is a very good option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cordless telephone gigaset sl910" class="if uuid-3223613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223613.jpg"></div><p>  The screen of the gadget is capacitive and touch.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, his sensitivity is excellent.  It easily fulfills even light touches.  It is also worth noting that you can adjust the sensitivity in the menu. </p><h2>  Screen features </h2><p>  Image quality is at a very decent level for this diagonal.  Color saturation and brightness with contrast have shown themselves very well.  The only negative that all TFT-VA-type matrices suffer is viewing angles.  At an incline, colors begin to rush and the contrast decreases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gigaset sl910 review" class="if uuid-3223614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223614.jpg"></div><p>  The backlight turns on automatically as soon as you take the device in your hand.  The solution is original and many users, judging by the reviews, liked it.  In general, the owners did not make any serious claims to the screen.  He copes with his task, and this is displaying information about calls, perfectly. </p><h2>  Platform </h2><p>  The phone is running a proprietary platform UI.  The developers of the operating system managed to come very close to the usual analogues that we see on smartphones.  Plus, the platform looks very pretty. </p><p>  Three desktops are available to the user.  The first is reserved for widgets.  In order to pull out a new icon from the manager, just hold your finger on an empty place on the desktop, and after the panel appears, drag the desired item to its place.  All widgets are square, and a glow effect was added to give them volume. </p><p>  On the second desktop are all current events: missed calls, agent messages and active notes.  The third table is entirely occupied by the dialer - a digital block with labels below: call, reset, directory and speed dial. </p><p>  To navigate the desktops, you can use both the usual swipe with your fingers and tapes on the visual elements at the top of the interface.  Scrolling is cyclic, which, judging by the reviews, not all users liked it.  Moreover, it cannot be undone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ligo.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gigaset sl910 reviews" class="if uuid-3223615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3223615.jpg"></div><p>  The platform interface also allows you to call the system curtain with a swipe down.  There you can activate the "Eco" mode, turn on bluetooth, bar all calls, set an alarm, etc. Users generally respond positively to the platform‚Äôs interface and its operation. </p><p>  Tables do not slow down and smoothly turn over at the first press.  Many were pleased with the original animation effects.  The only thing users sometimes complained about was the too small font for the existing screen diagonal.  Those who have vision problems will have to look for a special firmware for the device, because it will not work to change the size with local tools. </p><p>  The platform has all the necessary functionality for the phone: directory of subscribers, notes, date / time, SMS, call lists, network box, etc. Separately, it is worth noting the presence of a functional baby monitor that works fine. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a lithium-ion battery brand X447 1000 mAh.  If you believe the operating instructions, the battery provides autonomy to the handset up to 200 hours in standby mode (about a week) and up to 14 hours of continuous talking. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, in practice, the data presented is not entirely correct.  In standby mode, the phone lasts an average of no more than four days, and continuous calls will drain the battery in 5-6 hours. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this is a very good indicator for a mobile gadget, especially if you look at gluttonous smartphones that can not last a day.  In general, for a landline phone, which most of the time you spend on the base, the autonomy indicator is not critical. </p><p>  While in the dock, the handset charges in 8-9 hours with a fully discharged battery.  There are no problems with reloading.  So you can safely leave the phone at the base without regard to the time spent there. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, users have no complaints exactly as to the telephone set.  The model works calmly day and night and pleases with a stable connection.  In addition, the manufacturer managed to attract consumers with an original design and a generally high quality device. </p><p>  This device should be treated like a stylish little thing that complements the interior of an office or apartment.  In this role, he looks extremely attractive.  As for practicality, the model repays the money invested in full, and overpayments for some chips do not smell here.  In a word, if you need a stylish, reliable and functional landline phone, then the Gigaset SL910 is what you need. </p>
