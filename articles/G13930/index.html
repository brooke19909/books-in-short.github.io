    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kaplan Paradise Hotel 5 *: reviews of vacationers from Russia </h2><p>  As you know, modern tourists with great attention and responsibility approach the process of choosing a hotel.  And this applies to both hotels in Russia and abroad.  After all, no one wants, having spent a lot of money and finally arrived on a long-awaited vacation, to experience unpleasant emotions and become disappointed in their own choices.  So today, travelers not only study the official description of the hotel and listen to the advice of managers from travel agencies, but also try to independently familiarize themselves with as many comments as possible of real people staying in a particular hotel.  This approach allows you to make the most complete and close to reality impression.  In this regard, today we bring to your attention the generalized reviews of our compatriots regarding their recent stay at the five-star Hotel Kaplan Paradise (Kemer, Turkey).  Running a little ahead, we note that the vast majority of tourists were quite satisfied with their choice.  According to them, this is an excellent budget "five", where you can spend a great summer vacation.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaplan paradise hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1011988.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, almost all the guests were satisfied with the proposals he made at the Kaplan Paradise Hotel (Turkey).  So, according to our compatriots, the rooms here are medium in size, with good repair, bright and clean.  Furniture and appliances are not very new, but everything works fine.  If you are on vacation with a small child, then upon arrival you will be installed in the room arena.  The travelers were satisfied with the quality of cleaning.  So, it was carried out every day.  Towels, according to vacationers, were updated every other day, and bed linen - a couple of times a week.  The only drawback, according to our compatriots, was the fact that the room has only one free outlet.  In this regard, seasoned travelers advise everyone who goes to this hotel to take a tee with them from home or purchase it already in Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaplan paradise hotel reviews" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1011990.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Our compatriots claim that the Kaplan Paradise Hotel 5 * hotel, the reviews we are considering, has a rather large, very green and well-groomed territory.  There are many nice places where you can take a walk and take beautiful photos as a keepsake. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As tourists note in their reviews, since this hotel belongs to the category of budget ‚Äúfives‚Äù, one does not have to rely on the same varied menu as in more expensive hotels.  However, according to most guests, the choice of dishes here is quite wide and will satisfy everyone.  So, with regard to meat dishes, most of them are represented by chicken and turkey.  However, there is always beef and fish on the menu.  In addition, in the restaurant you can taste perfectly prepared soups, snacks, salads, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as delicious sweets.  During the day you can grab a bite to eat at the snack bar.  In addition, as guests noted in their comments, many enjoyed treating themselves to magnificent Turkish cakes with fervor and heat. </p><p>  As for drinks, there were no complaints from the guests.  So, their choice is standard for most hotels in Turkey - local beer, wine, crayfish, juices, carbonated drinks, tea, coffee.  Local drinks were available at an additional cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaplan paradise hotel turkey" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1011991.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Kaplan Paradise Hotel, reviews of which we are currently studying, is not on the first coastline, this fact did not cause any complaints among our compatriots.  Moreover, many say that they were even pleased to take a short walk, especially after a hearty meal in the hotel restaurant.  Moreover, you can walk to the beach in a leisurely step in just 7-8 minutes, and the path runs along a pretty shady pine alley.  In addition, hotel guests can reach the coast by shuttle, which runs all day in this direction.  But still, most vacationers preferred to walk. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, tourists were generally satisfied with it.  So, according to them, it is large, with enough sunbeds and umbrellas.  So there is no need to pre-occupy the sun loungers, because you can find free space at any time of the day.  There is a bar on the beach, there are toilets and changing rooms.  The only drawback, some vacationers considered an insufficient number of garbage cans.  In this regard, not all tourists bring garbage to the bins, leaving it right on the beach.  However, as many travelers note in their comments, the point here is not so much the lack of tanks as the culture of vacationers. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, it is sand and gravel here.  The entry into the water is smooth, at the bottom - large pebbles.  Most tourists entered the water barefoot without any problems.  However, some vacationers still recommend purchasing special rubber shoes. </p><p>  There is a pier on the beach, and for an additional fee you can ride a banana, fly with a parachute, jump on a trampoline, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaplan paradise hotel 5 kemer" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1011993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, you can have a great time not only on the beach, but also on the territory of Hotel Kaplan Paradise.  So, there are several pools.  One of them is large with a sun terrace and a bar.  There is also an indoor pool and a pool for the youngest tourists.  In addition, the hotel has a small water park.  Here, both children and adults enjoy frolicing on water slides. </p><p>  In the afternoon, a team of animators works near the large pool.  They offer vacationers a little exercise and fun, taking part in yoga, gymnastics, water aerobics, learning to dance belly, playing water polo, darts, etc. In the evenings, shows are organized in the local amphitheater organized by the hotel‚Äôs animators and guest artists .  Many tourists, they said, enjoyed visiting these recreational activities.  After the show, a disco is organized. </p><p>  Guests at Hotel Kaplan Paradise who wish to relax and enjoy their time can visit the local spa.
