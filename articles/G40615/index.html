A lot of rumors and legends are connected with it.  In June 1934, it was demolished.  According to the indigenous Muscovites, the city was orphaned without it.  According to V.A.  Gilyarovsky, the pink tower is a beauty, was "... turned into a pile of ruins of the living." </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery of the dry tower" class="if uuid-2292387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292387.jpg"></div><h2>  Moscow construction </h2><p>  The Sukharev Tower in Moscow is inextricably linked with the history of the city.  Therefore, in order to more clearly imagine what will be discussed, it is necessary to imagine where she was. </p><p>  Moscow was built gradually.  As the city walls expanded, which divided the city into parts-rings, a new territory was fenced.  The Kremlin originally went - it was the center, after it came the later settlement of Kitay-Gorod, which, as it was built, was surrounded by a fortress wall.  After him is the White City.  Gradually, as unnecessary, the internal walls were dismantled. </p><h2>  Earth city </h2><p>  Behind the White City, the Earth City was being built.  Here, near the walls of Moscow, villages were located, there were lands of monasteries.  At the time of the construction of the tower there was a wall enclosing the White City.  It was a city line beyond which the suburbs or, as they would say now, a suburb began.  It was called the Arbat, which, as scientists suggest, came from the Arabic word "rabat", which means "suburb." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Walls with a rampart and a moat were separated from the White Earth City; gates were made to get to Moscow.  In place of the Sretensky Gate, the Sukharev Tower was built.  The Earth City itself was surrounded by a rampart, which was fortified with prison (pointed logs) and towers, the number of which was 57. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldmos.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://oldmos.ru/old/photo/view/108588"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharev tower in Moscow" class="if uuid-2292389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292389.jpg"></div><h2>  Tower Background </h2><p>  The Sukharev Tower was a monument in honor of the successful escape of the young Tsar Peter I from his sister, Tsarevna Sophia, seeking to take control of the Moscow throne with the help of archers.  Moscow was captured by the rebels, and the young tsar with his mother decided to take refuge in Sergius Lavra.  To get there, it was necessary to go outside the White City through the gate. </p><p>  Sretensky gate was guarded by a regiment of archers under the command of Lavrenty Sukharev, who released the retinue of Peter I through the gate, and he safely reached Sergius Lavra.  In gratitude for his salvation, the future emperor ordered to build instead of a wooden gate a stone with a tower, which was named in honor of Lavrenty Sukharev.  This is the beginning of the history of the Sukharev Tower. </p><p>  But reliable sources confirming this story have not been preserved.  In Moscow there are many names associated with archers, most likely, there was a settlement of archers of Colonel Sukharev, so the street and the tower on it were named after his last name.  Therefore, the version of the grateful emperor is considered to be an urban legend. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gate building construction </h2><p>  The construction was started in 1692, and completed in 1695.  The project was developed by the outstanding architect of that time M.I.  Choglokov.  In 1698, reconstruction began, as a result of which the building with the tower took its final form, in which, without significant changes, it reached the beginning of the twentieth century. </p><p>  The building was large, massive and, according to her contemporaries, heavy.  However, the Byzantine vaults, many unique architectural details gave it extraordinary lightness and originality.  The building was decorated with a high tower with a tent roof and a double-headed eagle on a spire.  The tower was decorated with a clock.  It resembled a European town hall, standing on a hill, and looked like a huge building. </p><p>  In recent years, the tower has been painted pink.  With white-stone platbands, carved details and balusters, she gave the impression of an elegant and majestic beauty.  It was the Sukharev Tower that M.Yu.  Lermontov, Yu. Olesha, V.A.  Gilyarovsky. </p><p>  The photos of the Sukharev Tower in Moscow have survived to this day.  From these black and white photographs, one can imagine the beauty and grandeur of this mysterious building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldmos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharev tower of legend" class="if uuid-2292398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292398.jpg"></div><h2>  What was located in the Sukharev tower? </h2><p>  Since the construction of this structure, a lot of different institutions have been located in it.  Her name is associated with many rumors and legends.  At first, the Sukharev Tower in Moscow was chosen by F. Lefort and J. Bruce, whom the Muscovites called the sorcerer.  Here were meetings of the secret Neptune Society, of which they were chairpersons.  It was no accident that a building was built near the tower that is associated with the Masons, now the Sklifosovsky Institute is located here.  Its facade is decorated with Masonic signs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the early years of the 18th century, the Naval Naval School was located here, which was later transferred to St. Petersburg.  J. Bruce had a hand in equipping the school, equipping classes, an observatory, a laboratory for conducting physical and chemical experiments, living quarters for students, as well as a fencing hall, where the Neptune society supposedly gathered. </p><p>  Later, the office of the Moscow branch of the Admiralty College was located in the tower building.  In subsequent years, the tower building was used for various purposes.  There were barracks and warehouses. </p><h2>  Water tower </h2><p>  Taking advantage of the fact that the masonry of the walls of the Sukharev Tower was very powerful and durable, a water tower of the Mytishchi water supply was built here.  There were two tanks.  One was a capacity of 6, the other 7 thousand buckets.  The aqueduct remained from the water supply. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharev tower - photo" class="if uuid-2292402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292402.jpg"></div><h2>  Moscow Municipal Museum </h2><p>  After repairs in 1926, the Moscow Communal Museum was opened here.  Its founder P.V.  Sytin, who put a lot of effort into opening the museum, planned to create a corner of old Moscow around the Sukharev Tower.  According to his plan, ancient lanterns were to be located here, various bridge masonry were arranged. </p><p>  It was planned to open a viewing platform on the tower itself, since the tower was 60 meters high, and it was located on the highest hill of the city.  But all these dreams were not destined to come true. </p><h2>  Tower Demolition History </h2><p>  The fact that this is not a simple tower, says the events that unfolded around it.  Take at least the story of its demolition.  Around this building a whole "battle" broke out.  The entire advanced public of Moscow opposed the demolition. </p><p>  Famous architects, historians, writers, and others have requested a cancellation of the demolition of the tower, which supposedly interfered with the expansion of the movement.  Their opponent was Koganovich, who subsequently led this process.  Petitions were written to Stalin himself, but he, having read all the letters, made the decision to demolish the tower. </p><p>  But the amazing thing is that the place where the beautiful tower once stood was free to this day.  There is a square on it.  What is hidden behind unconditional demolition - a class principle or is there really a secret of the Sukharev Tower?  After all, it‚Äôs not without reason that for several hundreds of years, conversations related to the close associate of Peter the Great, Jacob Bruce, who was nicknamed the sorcerer, have not ceased. </p><p>  Also, a lot of talk was caused by the fact that the building was taken apart literally "brick by brick".  It seemed that they were looking for something important. </p><div class="photo" data-original="neglinka-msk.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="breadboard tower model" class="if uuid-2292411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292411.jpg"></div><h2>  Neptune Society </h2><p>  The name of Jacob Bruce is closely related to the Sukharev Tower.  It was here that the Neptune Society met, initially under the leadership of F. Lefort, after his death, J. Bruce.  It studied astrology and magic.  It consisted of 9 people, including: F. Lefort, J. Bruce, Peter I, A. Menshikov, P. Gordon - Russian general, rear admiral. </p><p>  As the researchers suggest, it was a secret Masonic society.  Although there is no documentary evidence of Freemasonry of Peter I, there are enough documents about relations with the box of masons J. Bruce.  The assumption of involvement in the Freemasonry of the Russian Tsar is based on the symbolism of St. Petersburg, which is called into question by serious historians. </p><h2>  Jacob Bruce </h2><p>  Companion of Peter I, a descendant of the Scottish kings, Field Marshal, scientist, student of Newton and Leibniz, was born in Moscow and was in the service of the Russian Tsar.  In 1698, he trained for more than a year in England.  His hobbies were exact sciences, in particular, astronomy. </p><p>  He was just an outstanding person.  He wrote the first published in Russia scientific work on astronomy and gravity, "Theory of planetary motion."  A great influence on Bruce had a communication with I. Newton, who belonged to the English Masons.  According to documents, the great scientist brought the Russian Scots closer to the first Freemasons in England. </p><p>  As the most educated person, he hated court fuss, slime-eaters, which made him many enemies.  He was devotedly devoted to Peter I, loved him.  He remained faithful to his emperor and refused Catherine the Great's offer of service, because he could not stand the mouse fuss around the throne. </p><p>  His patronage was sought by A.I.  Osterman, but left with nothing.  The end of the days, the retired field marshal lived out in Moscow, working in the office of the Sukharev Tower.  Therefore, one should not be surprised at the incredible rumors around his person who survived him and his ill-wishers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lemur59.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://lemur59.ru/node/9409"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bruce on the background of the tower" class="if uuid-2292715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292715.jpg"></div><h2>  The Legend of the White Paper </h2><p>  All the legends about the Sukharev Tower in Moscow are connected with the name of Bruce.  There are very few facts on which historians would rely.  Basically, they confirm his connection with the secret societies of Europe.  His addiction to books is well known.  According to astronomy only, he had more than 200 books.  Part of the huge library was in his office, located in the Sukharev Tower. </p><p>  The first legend says that Bruce was the owner of the oldest manuscripts, including the so-called "White Book", which belonged to King Solomon himself.  From this book it was possible to predict the future and the fate of any person.  But she had one "whim", she was given into the hands of only the initiates.  According to legend, Peter I, being in Bruce‚Äôs office, couldn‚Äôt even pick her up. </p><h2>  The Legend of the Black Book </h2><p>  According to legend, the Black Book was the most valuable copy of the Bruce library in the Sukharev Tower.  It has been sought after for hundreds of years.  Legend has it that Empress Catherine II ordered to investigate all the walls of the magician‚Äôs office in the tower.  The analysis of the building itself in the Stalin years is also associated with the search for the Black Book. </p><p>  What is the mystery of this mysterious tome?  Legend has it that its owner will own the world.  Jacob Bruce treated this book with trepidation.  Knowing the time of his departure from this life, he made sure that she did not fall into the hands of random people, and hid her securely.  It was believed that it was walled up in the walls of the tower, which surprised everyone with its incredible massiveness. </p><p>  After the tower was dismantled, all searches moved to the preserved dungeons.  Some seekers of the mysterious book disappeared without a trace.  Some when searching came across mysterious ghosts or black crows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.m24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharev tower - ruins" class="if uuid-2292409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2292409.jpg"></div><h2>  Secrets of the Sukharev Tower </h2><p>  After Jacob Bruce departed to another world, the fear of him did not leave Muscovites.  The light of candles that lit up at night in his office, located in the tower, scared Muscovites for a long time.  It was believed that he died during his witchcraft experiments, and his ashes did not find reassurance after death. </p><p>  So, during the reconstruction of old Moscow at the beginning of the 30s of the last century, on the Radio Street, when the old church was demolished, a crypt was allegedly discovered by J. Bruce.  The remains were transferred to the laboratory of the anthropologist Gerasimov, from where they strangely disappeared. </p><h2>  Do I need to restore the tower? </h2><p>  We have to regret the irretrievably lost Sukharev Tower.  Photos, drawings and plans of it have survived to our time. </p><p>  There are proposals for its restoration.  Powerful foundations have been preserved, and the place has remained unoccupied.  But it will be something similar to the scenery, a feeling of fake will remain. </p><p>  Should I redo the past and make my own adjustments to it?  The tower was demolished, with this the city has existed for almost a hundred years.  The demolition of the tower spawned new legends that some believe.  The new tower will still remain so.  The old one will not be returned.  Therefore, let everything remain as it is. </p>
