Key specs, owner reviews and customization</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  ASUS USB N13 wireless adapter is indispensable in cases when you need to connect a personal computer to the computer network without using wires.  It is his specifications and tuning procedure that this small overview material is devoted to.  Owner reviews will also be given, strengths and weaknesses of the device in question are indicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mans.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="asus usb n13 adapter" class="if uuid-2271122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2271122.jpg"></div><h2>  Fields of application </h2><p>  To function normally, ASUS USB N13 needs a universal USB serial port.  Its version can be 1.X, 2.0 or 3.0.  In addition to this, a control computer system is needed, which can be any laptop or a stationary system unit.  From the position of software, for the normal operation of the adapter in question, drivers are required. </p><p>  Therefore, it is most rational to use such a wireless network card as part of personal computers that do not have a built-in Wi-Fi transmitter, but there is a need for such a connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mans.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi asus usb n13" class="if uuid-2271126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2271126.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  ASUS USB N13 includes these components: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The wireless adapter covered in this review with a special removable cap. </li><li>  A disk where you can find drivers and documentation. </li><li>  User guide in short format. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ol><p>  There are no comments on the above list.  The eminent and world famous manufacturer included in it all the essentials for the first launch of the device.  With further operation, problems should also not arise. </p><h2>  Main technical parameters </h2><p>  The following specifications are declared by the manufacturer for the Wi-Fi adapter ASUS USB N13: </p><ol><li>  The connection interface is USB. Also, for the normal functioning of such a network card, you need a free physical port of the same name. </li><li>  The peak value of the speed of receiving and sending information is 300 Mb / s. </li><li>  Type of antenna - built-in. </li><li>  List of wirelessly supported 802.11 b / g / n standards.  But with the outdated 802.11a and the newest 802.11ac, such an adapter is not able to work.  But this is not critical for the reason that the first of them is extremely rare in practice, and the latter has not yet become widespread.  In addition, 802.11ac is backward compatible with 802.11n. </li></ol><p>  Among other features of this device, it is possible to note the presence of support for the proprietary technology of ASUS EZWPS.  With its help, the security level of the network connection is further enhanced, which is implemented using such an adapter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mans.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi adapter asus usb n13" class="if uuid-2271127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2271127.jpg"></div><h2>  The setting procedure.  Checking the health of the wireless network card </h2><p>  The ASUS USB N13 adapter is configured as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Carefully remove the external wireless transmitter from the transport plastic box.  Do not forget about the other components of the supply, a list of which was previously given. </li><li>  We find a free USB connector on the computer and install the device in question into it.  In this case, you must first remove the protective cap from the network card connector. </li><li>  Then from the CD you need to install the drivers and restart the PC. </li><li>  At the next stage, we start the search for available connections.  In the list that appears on the screen, select the SSID of our network.  After that, you need to enter the password to gain access to it in full. </li><li>  We launch the browser and check the operability of the created connection. </li><li>  In the end, it is recommended to visit the official website of the company ‚ÄúASUS‚Äù, download the latest version of drivers and install them. </li></ol><p>  After that, the adapter configuration is completed, and the network connection is fully implemented. </p><h2>  Price today </h2><p>  At the moment, the ASUS USB N13 Wi-Fi network card can be purchased at a price of 950 to 1200 rubles.  If the purchase is carried out in an online store, the price will be closer to the first value.  But at the same time there will be a time delay associated with the delivery of this device.  As a rule, it is 2-3 days.  If you need such an adapter urgently, then you can overpay 200-300 rubles and buy it at the nearest electronics supermarket.  In this case, the network card will be provided instantly. </p><h2>  Strengths of the network adapter and the main disadvantages.  User reviews </h2><p>  The presence of pluses in this model of a network card is indicated in the reviews by the owners: </p><ol><li>  Affordable cost. </li><li>  Excellent level of functionality. </li><li>  Simple customization algorithm. </li><li>  Reliability. </li></ol><p>  Its disadvantages include the lack of support for wireless standards versions 802.11a and 802.11ac.  But the first of them, as noted earlier, is outdated and is extremely rare.  And the second has not yet received wide distribution and is compatible with 802.11n.  The latter is fully supported by this model of wireless adapter.  Therefore, this device essentially has no significant disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mans.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="asus usb n13 advantages" class="if uuid-2271128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2271128.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A really great <span>network device</span> by today's standards is the ASUS USB N13.  Only a special demand for such products does not exist now.  All modern systems are equipped with already built-in transmitters of this type.  Therefore, they buy such adapters only in those cases when their integrated analogue has failed. </p>
