Some designs are very simple in construction, but their performance is worse.  Others require a significant investment of time, but the result will be much better and more reliable.  In any case, plastic bottles are an affordable material that is great for such purposes.  So if the question arises of what to make a fence from, then the answer suggests itself.  Especially if the budget is limited, but at the same time, it is urgent to identify the boundaries (of a summer cottage, for example).  It is in such a situation that this is the most rational decision.

    <p>  <strong>Option number 1 - the easiest</strong> </p><p>  Such a fence of plastic bottles is done very quickly, but it does not differ in special strength.  That is, he simply plays the role of the ‚Äúborder pillar‚Äù.  With a step of 2 meters, columns are buried (can be either wooden, metal or </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to make a fence from?" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/196428.jpg" width="400"></div>  concrete).  What material is, such can be used.  If necessary, the base of the fence can be cemented.  Then 2 cross ties are made: one - at the top of the columns, the second - at their base.  Here, too, you can use the means at hand.  Then the bottles are pierced on the bottom and on the lid and put on the wire.  Moreover, it is necessary to dial a section of such a length so that it is end-to-end located between the couplers of the fence.  The first section was done and installed.  Then, in a similar manner, the second section is made, which is installed right next to the previous one.  And so, step by step, the fence is made.  If there are no special requirements for its strength, then this is the optimal solution.

Next, you need to install </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fence from a plastic bottle." class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/196430.jpg" width="300"></div>  bottom screed made of wood at the base of previously installed supports.  Before this, screws of greater length are screwed into the screed than the diameter of this screed.  A bottle is punctured on the protruding part of the screw and then screwed up to the stop.  And so on, one by one.  You can make a small gap between them, but it is better if they will fit snugly.  The upper screed is made similarly with the only difference being that the lid is not screwed onto it.  The upper section is set at double the height of the bottles.  On top of it can be installed another such element.  This can be continued until the fence of plastic bottles reaches the required height.  The remaining parts of the fence are made in a similar way.

    <p>  <strong>The most difficult performance</strong> </p><p>  The most difficult option requires that a trench of the required depth be dug along the entire perimeter of the future fence.  With a step of 2 meters, columns are installed (only metal or concrete are suitable).  Their base is concreted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Everything is very easy and simple." class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/196427.jpg" width="250"></div>  The trench is also fully concrete.  Previously, it is necessary to install a metal mesh in it to give strength.  Be sure everything should be fenced with formwork.  After the solution has hardened, the formwork is dismantled.  Plastic bottles are filled with sand or soil.  It turns out more original "bricks", and quite durable.  Then the cement mortar is mixed, and the ‚Äúbricks‚Äù prepared in advance are laid with its help.  Such a fence is characterized by increased strength, but its maximum height should not exceed 1 meter, otherwise the design ceases to be strong and can easily collapse.  After the solution has dried, the work is completed and the fence from the plastic bottle in this design is ready.

    <p>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> </p><p>  It is not necessary to make a fence of a summer cottage out of something special and quite expensive.  It can be built using improvised means.  And one of the most striking examples is the fence of plastic bottles. </p>
