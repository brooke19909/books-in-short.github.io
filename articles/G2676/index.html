At the same time, there is always not enough time to create a large-scale masterpiece.  A simple solution is to <span>crochet the hat.</span>  For a woman, this is one of the main elements of the image.  By creating a hat model, you can maximize your personality.  The bound web is relatively small and the work will be completed quickly.  Crochet technology will allow you to try on the product in the process, adjust the size of the item and easily correct any defects.  Strictly speaking, even for beginners, a hat crocheted will be a feasible task. </p><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To calculate the number of loops and rows, two measurements must be taken. </p><ol><li>  Head circumference.  A centimeter tape runs in front of the eyebrows, behind - on the most protruding part of the head.  This will be the widest part of the cap - the rim.  The tape should clasp your head tight so that the measurement is accurate.  Oversize allowances are added later. </li><li>  Cap depth (minimum).  This is the distance from the top of the head to the earlobe.  For a modern beanie hat, the depth can be almost doubled.  For beret - only one third. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beanie hat" class="if uuid-2374790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2374790.jpg"></div><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  The yarn is selected according to the purpose of the cap - warm or decorative. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a winter hat, textured wool yarn is needed.  A headdress from such a thread will keep the shape perfectly and the pattern from it will turn out to be very effective.  Light and soft mohair is not inferior to wool in popularity.  Its main advantage is that the mohair cap does not wrinkle your hair and does not weigh down your head.  Berets work well from fine wool and mohair. </p><p>  For hats for spring-autumn choose acrylic and viscose.  Yarn containing artificial fiber will allow the product to maintain its original appearance longer, the fabric will not deform and will not be covered with spools. </p><p>  Openwork summer hats are made of cotton, and the hat can be knitted even from jute. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zaprixr.tumblr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="summer hat" class="if uuid-2374876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2374876.jpg"></div><p>  The hook number corresponds to the thickness of the yarn. </p><h2>  Tips for beginners: how to crochet a hat </h2><p>  Most often, the hat is knitted round.  You can start work from the rim.  A chain of loops is matched, equal in length to the circumference of the head.  In order not to make a mistake in the number of loops gathered, it is necessary to tie a sample to calculate the density of knitting.  Two thirds of the total depth are knitted in height.  Further, the number of columns in the row decreases uniformly.  To make the top of the cap smooth, without wrinkles and folds, make reductions through a row, not more than 7-8 columns in a row.  When a hole remains about three centimeters in diameter, a strong thread is pulled into the extreme columns and the crown is tightly tightened.  This method justifies itself when working on a tight hat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="white hat" class="if uuid-2374788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2374788.jpg"></div><p>  But usually a female hat crocheted begins with the crown.  First, a ring of 5-6 loops is tied.  Making uniform additions, bring the number of columns in a row to the necessary for girth of the head.  Continue to knit without adding the remaining depth of the product.  This is especially true for summer hats.  Any scheme of circular lace allows only this order of work.  The edge can be trimmed with a series of loops.  So the product will take on a finished look and will not stretch along the rim during wear. </p><p>  Some models require a transverse pattern.  A rectangular cloth is knitted, along the length it should be equal to the girth of the head.  In width - about two thirds of the total depth of the cap.  On one long edge, knitting is continued with columns being reduced, about 7-8 cm. From the wrong side, the product is sewn with a knitted seam or crocheted.  The last few columns tighten the thread around. </p><p>  Popular hats with ears do not require any reduction.  A rectangular blank, sewn on the top, is worn on the head.  The depth of the pinches for the ears is noted.  At the right distance, the corners are sewn up diagonally.  This seam must be done on the front side of the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The basic scheme for a tight hat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crown for cap" class="if uuid-2375126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2375126.jpg"></div><p>  How to crochet a hat according to this pattern?  Gather six air loops.  Of these, 12 double crochet stitches.  In the next row, the number of loops doubles again.  In the third row, the circle is divided into 12 wedges.  In each of them one crochet column is added.  Further, the addition occurs evenly in each sector.  Only 12 loops in each row.  The circle increases until its diameter is equal to the circumference of the head / 3.14 (this is the number pi).  In order for the crown to be rounded with a neat dome, the last two additions are made through a row.  Further, the hat is knitted directly, making an equal number of columns in each row until such time as sufficient depth is gained.  The last two or three rows are crocheted with a smaller size so that the rim does not stretch. </p><h2>  Round knitting methods </h2><p>  The biggest problem will be the junction of the rows.  The column of each next row will be located to the right than the column of the previous row approximately ‚Äúhalf a step‚Äù.  A seam tilted to the right appears on the knitted fabric.  How to crochet a hat to hide it?  Experienced knitters use two methods for this: </p><ol><li>  Spiral knitting.  The whole canvas fits as if in one row, twisted in a spiral.  With this method of knitting, it is easy to stray and lose the expected beginning of the row.  Therefore, each new turn is marked with a contrasting thread or pin.  In the last row (for its smooth completion) a double crochet, a double crochet and a single crochet are tied.  The edge of the product is smooth. </li><li>  The second method is based on a little trick.  The row begins with two lifting loops.  The next column is tied from the base of these loops.  Runs the entire row.  The connecting column is knitted not in lifting loops, but in the first column of the previous row.  So you can get a seam rather noticeable, but smooth. </li></ol><h2>  Schemes for an openwork light version </h2><p>  Crocheted summer hats for women are always in fashion.  They help keep your hair tidy and protect it from the sun.  Openwork creates airy lace accents for any look.  Such patterns are well made from white cotton yarn. </p><p>  Scheme for the crown number 1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crown for openwork cap 2" class="if uuid-2375128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2375128.jpg"></div><p>  You can use this scheme.  And below is another simple openwork.  Scheme of the crown number 2. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crown for openwork hat" class="if uuid-2375122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2375122.jpg"></div><p>  How to crochet a hat using a circular pattern of lace?  In the same way as in the previous version.  A circle of the right size is tied.  Two thirds of the total depth are knitted with a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù, that is, without additions.  For the top of this hat is suitable pattern "shell". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for tulle" class="if uuid-2375131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2375131.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoration Techniques </h2><p>  If the finished hat requires a twist, you can supplement it with some accessories.  The choice in the shops is huge.  Rhinestones, beads, decorative buttons, shells (for summer options) will go into business.  Winter headdress is decorated with fur pompons.  They are also easy to buy ready-made.  You can make them from yarn yourself, especially if the pompom is needed in a tone hat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with pompom" class="if uuid-2375039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2375039.jpg"></div><p>  How to <span>crochet jewelry</span> for vintage patterns?  Fantasy will tell.  They are decorated with flowers, leaves and spirals, knitted separately from contrasting yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thewhoot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="summer hats" class="if uuid-2374888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2374888.jpg"></div><p>  Decoration of knitted fabric with embroidery is very popular.  You can embroider with a thick thread, ribbons and leather cords. </p><p>  A well-made thing will always attract well-deserved attention. </p>
