Everyone knows that today it is a US National Historic Site.  Ross is the last name of two English polar sailors.  It is they - the uncle and nephew, John and James Clark - who have the honor of discovering the Earth‚Äôs North Magnetic Pole.  And a few years after this event, James Ross almost came to the South Magnetic Pole. </p><h2>  John Ross (uncle).  Arctic </h2><p>  John Ross (1777-1856) began his service in the Royal Navy of Great Britain with a 9-year-old youth, was smart and inquisitive.  He sailed in the Mediterranean and North Seas, took part in the Napoleonic Wars.  In the Baltic, he fought with Russian sailors, was in Swedish captivity, and upon returning, served in the North and Baltic Seas. </p>

    <p>  As a <span>polar explorer,</span> John Ross made three Arctic voyages.  In the first (1819), he explored the western coast of Greenland, discovered the polar Eskimos (the most northern inhabitants of the Earth), reached almost 77 degrees north latitude, tracked the eastern coast of the Baffin land and made adjustments to the maps existing at that time. </p><p>  In the second campaign, in 1829-1833, with four winters, with the participation of his nephew James, John Ross made many discoveries.  In addition to determining the location of the Earth‚Äôs North Magnetic Pole, his expedition discovered <span>the Butia Peninsula</span> and explored its shores, discovered King William Island and James Ross Strait (this is one of the straits between Butia Peninsula and King William Island). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The third campaign (1850-1851) was equipped for John Franklin's search, but was unsuccessful. </p><h2>  James Clark Ross (nephew).  Antarctic </h2><p>  James Clark Ross (1800-1862) made his first serious voyage at the age of 12 under the supervision of his uncle, and he was already an experienced sailor by the age of 18.  On his account several campaigns in the Arctic, including in the team of John Ross.  But the main fame brought him unprecedented in those days of research near the South Pole. </p>

    <p>  In 1839, the youngest Ross went to Antarctica on two old slow, heavy, but strong ships.  In 1842, James became the first sailor to reach 78 degrees south latitude.  He discovered two <span>Antarctic volcanoes,</span> which he called the names of the expedition ships: Terror and Erebus.  He discovered the sea off the coast of Antarctica and the largest ice shelf, which are named after him.  Due to the severe weather and ice conditions, sailing ships were not easy. </p><p>  Despite this, Ross made a large number of measurements off the coast of Antarctica and pretty accurately determined where the South Pole is.  However, landing on the mainland was not possible.  The Ross expedition, which is of great importance to the geographical sciences, lasted four years and in 1843 returned almost completely to England. </p><p>  Today, Ross is not just the name of the famous polar sailors.  The Ross expeditions brought the world many benefits and laid the foundation for further exploration of the Arctic and Antarctic. </p>
