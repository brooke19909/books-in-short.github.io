Hotel reviews and hotel ratings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is no secret that the Quartes are the most suitable resort hotels in Egypt, in which the price and quality of services are balanced.  Budget "triples" significantly lose in terms of service.  And the chic of the ‚Äúfives‚Äù most often lies in the vast territory of the hotel complex and the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trip to a la carte restaurants.  Therefore, many tourists stay in their choice of hotels on the status of "4".  Tamra Beach Resort 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt) is just a typical "four".  Therefore, we will take this hotel as a model for describing other hotels.  At least located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh.  Even the most biased tourists have left very favorable reviews about Tamra Beach Resort.  Of course, in this hotel there is no glamorous chic, but no one expects it for that kind of money.  So what should you count on at Tamra Beach Resort?  Read about it in our article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  4 * Tamra Beach Resort is located in Nabq Bay.  This is the northeastern outskirts of Sharm El Sheikh, closest to the international airport.  Only seven kilometers from the hotel.  Does the rumble of aircraft violate the peace of guests at the Tamra Beach Resort?  Reviews say no.  The airport does not accept flights at night.  And from morning to evening, a distant rumble only occasionally reaches the ear, which does not interfere with rest.  But when transferring guests are brought to the hotel first, and pick up the last.  The old city of Sharm El Sheikh is located twenty-five kilometers from the hotel.  Many hotels in Nabq practice free buses to Naama Bay, where all the cafes, restaurants and shops of this resort are located.  Tamra Beach is on the front page of its own beach.  Hulls from the sea are separated by a maximum of one hundred meters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is Nabq Bay.  Location specifics </h2><p>  This is the name of this section of Sharma.  But the name "bay" to Nabq is unacceptable, since there is no bay here.  The flat coast is famous for winds, which makes it attractive for wind and kite surfers.  Another feature of Nabq is its extremely shallow bottom.  This is a plus for young children who can splash around in shallow water as much as they like, and a minus for lovers of swimming.  To get to the depths, "coral slippers."  You can go down into the water and from the ladder on a long pontoon.  They are equipped with almost all the beaches of hotels with 4 * status.  Tamra Beach Resort also has one.  Also on Nabq Bay beach there are big ebbs.  But in this case, as the reviews assure, you can catch the outgoing sea from the ladder on the pier.  But Nabq is adjacent to the natural national park of the same name, which is part of the world-famous Ras Mohammed.  Here, not just fish, but the whole coral jungle!  This reserve reviews are strongly advised to visit.  Another attraction of Nabq is Tiran Island.  Excursions go to him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamra beach resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1096298.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Since Nabq is a new district, the local hotels are not limited in footage.  Spacious 5 * and 4 * class hotels are built on the front page.  Tamra Beach Resort is just surrounded by greenery.  Around the flowers, palm trees, cute shady paths.  The hotel consists of a number of two-story buildings.  The best tourists consider the fifth, sixth and seventh.  When you check in, you should ask for a room in these rooms.  Many reviews mention the design approach in the design of the territory.  Everything is very beautiful, and the pools seem to be natural lagoons in this paradise oasis.  The buildings are built in such a way that from almost all rooms you can see the sea.  On the ground floor, guests can sit on their own small terrace, while the second-level rooms have a balcony.  As for the orientation of the hotel, it is intended for a relaxing family vacation.  Maybe this is one of the reasons why the hotel has a guest limit policy for Russians: no more than five rooms (if there are more than two hundred and thirty).  The main contingent of holidaymakers is Italians.  There are Germans and other tourists from Western Europe.  A great option for those who want to take a break from their compatriots and have a little knowledge of English or Italian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamra beach resort 4 sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1096297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The guest rooms have everything you need for hotels with 4 * status.  Tamra Beach Resort has double and triple rooms of standard and deluxe class.  What pleased the guests was a separate entrance.  There is no this dull and noisy corridor, as in Soviet-style hotels.  The buildings are built in the Saracen style, painted in warm terracotta tones.  And the rooms are designed in a modern European design.  Of the services in the room, reviews mention a minibar, a safe, air conditioning, and a TV with satellite channels.  Separate bath and shower in the bathroom.  Daily stocks of cosmetic accessories, as well as bottles of drinking water are replenished.  They clean the hotel well, and for a fee they spin different funny shapes from towels.  Despite the lush greenery of the garden, no insects were noticed in the rooms.  Many tourists slept with an open balcony, and mosquitoes did not disturb them. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at Tamra Beach Resort 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) </h2><p>  Like all Fours in Egypt, this hotel also practices All Inclusive.  The food is very diverse, tasty and of high quality.  According to the guests in their reviews, the whole kitchen is aimed at satisfying the Italians.

In addition to the main restaurant, there is another one - ‚ÄúLl Isola‚Äù, which specializes in seafood.  The beach cafe serves authentic Italian pizza, which is baked in a special oven.  Every Wednesday and Friday, the main restaurant hosts themed gala evenings.  There are five bars on site.  Some of them work from eight in the morning until sunset, while others pour ‚Äúfree alcohol‚Äù only after midnight. </p>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  There are 4 * five in Tamra Beach Resort.  The main swimming pool, beautifully fitting into the landscape, without heating.  In winter, vacationers prefer to swim in two smaller tanks.  They are heated.  There is another indoor pool and a shallow paddling pool for children.  The shores of these artificial ponds are lined with plank beds with soft mattresses, on which the servants lay your <span>beach towel.</span>  There is no shortage of these places of rest.  The main contingent - Italians - prefer to sunbathe by the pools, but there is no crowd feeling.  Everything is very nice, soft and unobtrusive music plays.  From 16 o'clock in the pool bar you can get ice cream. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Tamra Beach Resort Hotel is on the first line.  Her own beach is sandy, with a lot of sunbeds and umbrellas.  As already mentioned, Nabq is a windy area.  With this, he attracts a large number of windsurfers.  But you can always hide from the wind behind wicker screens.  Corals are a national treasure of the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt).  Tamra Beach Resort 4 * cleared for its guests only a narrow path for passage to the depths.  But reviews are still advised to acquire special shoes.  During low tide, you can step on sea urchins, which are hidden in the indentations among the stones.  Best of all, tourists advise using a pontoon.  From its edge you can immediately go down the ladder to a depth.  Inhabitants of coral reefs can also be seen in shallow water - some fish swim very close to the shore.  Windsurfing and kite-riding are available at the beach at an extra cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 tamra beach resort 4 sharm el sheikh egypt" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1096294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tamra Beach Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists advise this hotel to lovers of a relaxing holiday.  On the question of whether the hotel is suitable for children, opinions were divided.  The Italian hotel management is doing everything possible to make small guests comfortable.  A mini club, a games room, a playground, a shallow pool are equipped for them.  The kids here are treated with typical lovers of Italians.  But, on the other hand, the specifics of the beach is such that children can splash around the very edge of the water, and even then at high tide.  After all, not every parent ventures to go down the ladder from the pontoon with a baby.  As for the decoration of rooms and meals, the tourists described the Tamra Beach Resort 4 * hotel as a full-fledged "five". </p>
