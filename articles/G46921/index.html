Description and causes of positional warfare</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Positional warfare is a period when battles take place on continuous continuous fronts, the borders of which are practically unchanged.  At the <span>same time, the defense of</span> each of the warring parties is deeply echeloned.  Such a war is characterized by a large density of troops in individual sections.  All positions have good engineering support and are constantly being upgraded. </p><h2>  The general picture of positional warfare </h2><p>  During such a confrontation, the strategic and political situation has been stable for a long time.  Military operations give little result, but they are more methodical.  Positional warfare is when the goal is to ‚Äúexhaust‚Äù, exhaust the enemy.  The offensive is short, with a retreat to pre-prepared positions.  They give a very small effect and then, rather, moral than physical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="positional war this" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/662203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Even with the successful completion of the attack, for example, the capture of the first row of enemy trenches, the result is very weak.  Because each side has a well-designed defense.  That is, it will not be possible to hold out on the captured first line, the enemy will destroy the attackers with machine-gun and artillery fire.  Therefore, in order to maintain manpower, one has to return to their positions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are the basic principles on which a positional war is based.  The definition of its goal, rather, can be described as the gradual depletion of the enemy in economic and demographic terms.  At the same time, they attach great importance to a powerful artillery attack, to strengthened fronts and to maintain their positions. </p><h2>  Trench warfare </h2><p>  This is what is sometimes called positional.  Because great maneuverability in such a war is not observed.  Opponents try to stay in their positions.  The war is fought, so to speak, ‚Äúfrom the spot‚Äù, often turning into a meaningless slaughter, such as, for example, in the First World War.  Positional warfare is short, "choking", almost inconclusive attacks with heavy losses.  People die in thousands for every meter of conquered land.  Machine-gun lines mow down soldiers in droves, you can only survive while in the trench.  But enemy shells sometimes fly there too. </p><p>  Therefore, positional war got its second name - trench warfare.  Whole galleries rummaged through the earth, supported by stakes and props.  All this happened slowly, especially when moves were made to the enemy.  And at this time, the bulk of the troops tried to hold their ground and exhaust the opponent.  For fights with the enemy, there were even special trench knives that were used to hit the enemy‚Äôs trench.  However, not one of the warring parties achieved significant successes in positional warfare.  The losses were colossal, and moved forward by meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World War I positional war" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/662202.jpg" width="400"></div>

This led to the transition to deep defense.  Opponents began to dig in on their front line, pull barbed wire, and establish machine-gun bunkers.  In other words, a positional war has begun.  This led to the establishment of a stable and motionless front line that suited everyone. </p><p>  To win in such a war is almost impossible.  The troops are deprived of maneuverability and mobility.  Losses on both sides are regularly replenished with fresh reserves.  The reasons for the transition to a positional war lay in the technology of that time, its use did not give large-scale results.  It was almost impossible to use vehicles and tanks in the trenched area, so they were not widely used.  And technology at the beginning of the 20th century was poorly developed.  For example, the same tank was easily stuck in a trench.  It was possible to stop it with ordinary logs, which were thrown at him under the tracks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the transition to a positional war" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/662201.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Each country believed that it could sit in the trenches with minimal losses until its allies inflicted serious damage on the opponents.  And then it will be possible to collectively finish off the enemy.  Also, many expected that the enemy‚Äôs economy could not withstand the huge costs of supplying the army.  And the funds were really spent enormous.  The positional war lasted several years and required the constant supply of the army with shells, small arms, fodder, ammunition and more. </p><h2>  World War I Strategy </h2><p>  The strategic plan initially consisted precisely of defense, forcing huge efforts to strengthen the already conquered territories.  Thus, the parties tried to prevent the attack of the enemy and make their future offensive easier and more convenient.  In preparing for defense, the geographical position of states, their borders, population, army, its training and composition were taken into account.  That is, maneuverability was reduced to almost zero. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="position war definition" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/662200.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  World War I crisis </h2><p>  The crisis was the impossibility of breaking through the defense and securing success.  The problem was the communications of the advancing army.  Even without getting directly under fire, it was very difficult to deliver food and reinforcements to the occupied territory.  The delivery speed was also hindered by their own fortifications left behind. </p><p>  The defending side, while the enemy was dragging ammunition, food and human reserves, organized the defense again.  And it turned out that the success achieved did not matter much, I had to gather strength and attack the well-fortified enemy again.  As a result, the situation was equalized again, and everything began anew.  The position war of the First World War was a kind of massacre, where thousands of soldiers died, trying to capture every 100 meters of the front. </p>
