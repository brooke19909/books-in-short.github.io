And indeed, a very interesting topic.  How are they dispersed?  How much money does it take?  In general, it is worth noting that you really have to spend a lot.  This pleasure is now very expensive.  So, one of the last holidays cost the Russian government 430 thousand rubles.  This is a very large amount.  Many consider this a waste of money.  But it’s interesting anyway.  How to disperse the clouds? </p>

    <h2>  What holidays are clouds breaking up for? </h2><p>  Let's see <span>how the clouds disperse over Moscow.</span>  What holidays do they do?  And how do rain clouds disperse?  In general, the main dates are: May 9, July 12 and the first Saturday of September.  This is <span>City Day.</span>  At four in the morning the plane rises.  Its goal is very simple - to scout the current situation.  If there is a threat of rain, then aircraft with reagents rise.  There are also special generators of fine particles.  Reagent cylinders are connected to them.  After that, they dissipate under high pressure.  As a result, precipitation falls. </p>

    <h2>  When did the clouds begin to disperse? </h2><p>  The first attempts began shortly after the Second World War.  In this area, all the advanced developments went to the Americans.  They proposed the use of two substances - <span>liquid nitrogen</span> and <span>dry ice</span> for these purposes.  The Soviet Union began to do this somewhere in the early 60s.  That is quite late. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How do airplanes disperse clouds? </h2><p>  There is nothing complicated in the process of <span>dispersing clouds</span> .  But this process is called a little wrong.  Still, this is not cloud dispersal.  In fact, the clouds rain and simply disappear.  To disperse the clouds in the classical sense of the term, you need to be able to create a very strong wind.  Unfortunately, they have not yet learned to do this.  By the way, it would be nice.  After all, you can save a lot in this case.  But while completely different cloud dispersal techniques are being used. </p><p>  They can also do this with special self-opening containers.  The technology is cheaper, but there is a risk that they will not open on their own and fall to the ground.  And they are far from easy.  Therefore, this can even lead to personal injury.  Although these arguments are not so critical due to the fact that often you have to disperse the clouds over the uninhabited areas of the country.  But if you have to do it over some village, you need to be careful. </p>

    <h2>  When did the ability to disperse clouds come in handy in practice? </h2><p>  The ability to disperse clouds in practice was needed after the Chernobyl disaster.  The rains were very dangerous at that time.  Therefore, it was necessary to be able to create precipitation directly in the exclusion zone and in no case to allow them in other parts of the planet.  This was a very responsible task.  Then there was really practical benefit from dispersing the clouds.  But now there is no particular sense, to be honest.  Although one of the people may think otherwise.  Still, good weather is the key to a good mood. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What reagents are used? </h2><p>  Now let’s take a closer look at how to disperse the clouds.  What reagents are used to bring this task to life? </p><ol><li>  A liquid nitrogen. </li><li>  Dry ice. </li><li>  Granular carbon dioxide. </li><li>  Special cement.  This material also raises doubts regarding environmental friendliness. </li><li>  Silver iodide.  It is used in completely hopeless cases. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, a fairly large number of reagents are used to implement this task.  It all depends on which cloud layer you need to disperse.  It also affects what material is used, the type of cloud.  Not every cloud can be dispelled, as it turns out.  So there is still room for science to grow.  However, the technology for using a substance such as silver iodide is quite new. </p>

    <h2>  Arguments for overclocking clouds </h2><p>  Naturally, there are defenders and opponents of dispersal of clouds.  And there is nothing strange here.  This procedure is really ambiguous.  For objectivity, you need to consider the arguments of both sides.  And you yourself decide.  So, clouds need to be dispersed, because: </p><ul><li>  Good weather improves mood.  And these are not unfounded statements.  Indeed, under the influence of light, and even more so sun rays, the level of serotonin in the blood of a person rises.  It is called the "hormone of happiness."  Consequently, the feeling of celebration is intensified. </li><li>  No events in which money was invested will fail.  This is especially true as an argument against supporters of the opinion that the cost of overclocking is very high.  In general, holidays cost a lot of money.  Does it then make sense to carry them out? </li><li>  The technological level of the country is shown.  This is more about foreign policy.  Although this argument is rather doubtful.  But since some people use it, it makes sense to bring it here. </li></ul><p>  There are not many reasons.  Indeed, they are powerful enough for some people.  Especially if some outdoor events are held. </p><h2>  Arguments against dispersal of clouds </h2><p>  There are also arguments of people who do not care how to disperse the clouds, if it is so expensive.  For them, just knowing the amount that you have to spend on it is enough.  Moreover, there are more loyal people who are still against it.  But it’s not so categorical.  What arguments do they have? </p><ol><li>  Cost does not justify the results.  Everything is extremely simple here.  The money spent on such work can be used in a more constructive direction.  For example, you can implement the construction of new parking lots or traffic intersections.  These are more constructive elements.  Or, for example, you can improve the sewage system and rainwater drainage system.  Global warming is now underway.  Therefore, precipitation has become more widespread.  Soon the city sewer will not withstand such stress.  But people want a clear sky.  In general, a controversial decision.  Still, the question "how much does it cost to disperse the clouds" is in the first place. </li><li>  Problems with the environment.  Some people think that reagents are not environmentally friendly.  Of course, this is a moot point.  Many researchers say that there is nothing wrong with that.  But sometimes, because of the dispersal of clouds, farms suffer.  Many villagers complain that when they carry out this work, they just need rain.  And the clouds never reach the fields, spilling over the city.  Everything should take its course in nature.  Now it is not known exactly what the precipitation of locally so strong precipitation can lead to.  The same goes for human exposure to these reagents.  After all, mercury and radiation were previously considered safe.  But then these theses were refuted. </li></ol><p>  In general, the arguments are no less weighty than those of supporters.  We figured out how to disperse the clouds.  It turns out that there is nothing very complicated about this.  If you have money, you can do the same.  After all, you now also know how to disperse the clouds.  You have to do this over Moscow quite often, especially in overcast rainy autumn. </p>
