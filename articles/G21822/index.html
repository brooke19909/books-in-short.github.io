Chalets on Nugush</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Previously, it was the most common thing to relax with savages.  Young people took tents, a guitar and went somewhere to nature, since then there was no question of choosing a place.  Now there are almost no territories left, from the point of view of beauty and convenience, of territories not occupied by civilization.  One of the few is man-made lake Nugush.  Rest by the savage there is still possible, although there are plenty of camp sites on its shores.  Let‚Äôs try to find out how the current romantics relax. </p><h2>  Bashkortostan, or Bashkiria: Nugush </h2><p>  For the uninitiated: Nugush is a river in Bashkiria, a tributary of Belaya.  It stretched from the Yurmatau Range to the mouth at 235 km.  This is the fastest river in the republic, incredibly popular among rafting enthusiasts, however, here it is more entertaining than dangerous.  There is even a real <span>waterfall (Cuperlya)</span> and its canyon (Pyatilistnik) on Nugush.  In 1967, a river near the town of Meleuz was blocked by a dam.  So the <span>Nugush reservoir was</span> born <span>,</span> which many call the lake.  Getting there is easy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nougos card" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/465056.jpg" width="520"></div>  From Ufa you need to drive 225 km, and from Orenburg - about 150 to Meleuz, and then another 40 km, and here it is - the famous Nugush.  A card that is always useful to take with you will help you not get lost.  I must say that throughout the entire route travelers will enjoy the surrounding landscapes of forests and pretty villages.  True, in some places the road looks a little like foreign freeways, but the views from the windows of the car compensate for all the inconvenience.

This pond is rightfully proud of Bashkiria.  Nugush impresses with its beauty even inveterate skeptics.  Majestic mountains, bizarre outlines of ledges, silently reflected on the surface of the water, relict forests ringing with a bird's hubbub, crystal-clear, warm water in the summer, and there are schools of fish ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nougos rest savage" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/465050.jpg" width="600"></div>  Everyone who comes here falls in love with Nugush for life.  But let's move from the lyrics to the real numbers.  The lake covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25.2 square meters.  km  In length, it stretched for 20 km, and spread in width for 5 km.  The depth of this reservoir in some places reaches 30 meters, but on average is 15-16 meters. Not far from the lake there is a very young and also very beautiful reservoir - Yumaguzinsky.  In a straight line through the forest, it is only 5 km away.  Those who came to rest as a savage on Nugush and did not find a suitable patch of land there can try their luck in Yumaguzinsky.  On its shores there is not a single camp site yet, almost absolute deserts.

    <h2>  What is Nugush famous for </h2><p>  Without exception, everyone will answer - with beauty, extraordinary air, clean water, excellent fishing, wonderful surroundings, because this is the territory of the Bashkir National Park.  Some will add - comfortable tourist camps and children's health camps located on the coast.  That‚Äôs true, but not only this can offer its guests Nugush.  Rest (savage or civilized) for many involves, in addition to swimming in the lake and barbecue, also interesting excursions.  One of the most popular among all categories of vacationers is a short but impressive boat trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="savage on nougos" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/465052.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is worth the pleasure of 300 rubles per person.  Typically, the route runs up the reservoir to the mouth of Uryuk (a tributary of the Nugush river).  You can also rent or bring a motor boat with you and go all the way yourself.  The reward will be fantastic landscapes and a first-class photo shoot.  A must visit is the karst bridge located in the upper reaches of the lake.  For the most restless, you can offer to drive to the Beautiful Glade (such a tract), and then - about 40 minutes on foot, and the eyes will see the Cuperl Waterfall.  Well, in the evening - barbecue and disco.

For example, in ‚ÄúSail‚Äù there are houses with a toilet, shower, even a microwave, and there are those in which all the amenities in the yard, that is, on the territory.  The rooms have only the necessary set of furniture and a refrigerator.  The same is true in Solar.  But in the "Care", located in the village of Nugush, each room has a toilet, shower, air conditioning and a kitchen.  Prices depend on the capacity of the accommodation you want to rent: for 2, 3 or 4 people.  They also differ on weekdays and weekends, in summer and in winter.

    <h2>  Half-savage rest </h2><p>  Many who have visited the lake note rather high prices for using rooms, and even more so for renting an entire cottage.  For those who do not want to pay a lot, but are not yet ready to stay alone with nature, there is a way out - relax in half savages.  Almost all camp sites on Nugush provide this opportunity.  The aforementioned term means accommodation in the base, but not in the room, but in the campsite.  You can also use the property provided or your own tent.  The cost of such a vacation is about 4-6 times lower, but there are no amenities, as you know, only a berth.  However, you can use the toilet and showers located in the base, eat in the dining room (payment for all categories of vacationers is not included in the room price), leave the car in the parking lot.  Children are allowed to play on the playground, and adults are allowed to cook barbecue on the grill, relax on the comfortable beach.  The cost of a car entering the territory is approximately the same everywhere - from 200 rubles.  Place in a tent will also cost 200 rubles (minimum) per person per day. </p>

    <h2>  Rest Savage: beyond </h2><p>  Many who came to Nugush as a savage rest consider the best, despite all the domestic difficulties.  They are placed outside camp sites in their own tents, cooked at the stake.  Of course, such a vacation has its own highlight.  The advantages are: </p><ul><li>  the opportunity to save (you have to pay only for food and, in rare cases, for a car ride); </li><li>  complete freedom, that is, you can do whatever your heart desires, no one will say a word; </li><li>  romance and cognition of cooking at the stake; </li><li>  almost absolute unity with nature, which means a lot of new experiences. </li></ul><p>  In <span>Ufa, Orenburg</span> and other cities of Bashkiria, there are companies that provide citizens with the opportunity to experience all the delights of such romance.  That is, people are brought to Nugush, company representatives set up a tent camp and cook. </p>

    <h2>  Rest savage: against </h2><p>  No matter how magnificent Nugush is, the rest of the savage has its drawbacks.  Their list depends on the individual preferences of each person, because for someone the lack of a bath with a hydromassage seems like a nightmare.  The main disadvantages of the savage rest are as follows: </p><ul><li>  complete lack of amenities; </li><li>  low suitability of the territory, because all the best has long been occupied by camp sites; </li><li>  defenselessness against the tricks of the neighbors in an impromptu <span>tent camp,</span> if you suddenly get very unpleasant. </li></ul><h2>  Impressions and Tips </h2><p>  People of any age go to Nugush.  The rest as a savage, according to numerous reviews, is most suitable for unpretentious young people, for whom the process itself is important, and not such trifles as a toilet in the room, comfortable beds or air conditioning.  Young people who came to the lake for just a couple of days off do not plan to sleep at night, and have fun at the disco until the morning, since the music from the camp sites is heard perfectly.  But for parents with children, it‚Äôs not very convenient for the savages to rest, for the kids still need basic comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nougos" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/465057.jpg" width="500"></div>  Also, rest outside the camp site is not suitable for those who have health problems, because the food will be significantly different from home, and you will have to sleep on a hard bed.  But how many new experiences!  A tent under the canopy of trees, an ear with a smoke from a fish caught personally, talking around a fire, a starry night ... Just keep in mind that on Nugush it is cool at night even in summer, so warm clothes will not hurt, just like a panama hat by day.  As well as firewood, dishes, and drinking water.
