Sample Envelope</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article, we‚Äôll talk about <span>how to fill out an envelope</span> (Russian Post).  In the recent past, people most often used mail services, since not everyone had a telephone.  What to say about cellular communications and the Internet - they simply did not exist.  Now, Russian Post is less likely to send letters.  Most often, people order and receive packages from friends, acquaintances, and through online stores. </p><h2>  It's time to write a letter </h2><p>  The older generation still remembers how to properly fill in envelopes, which can be put in it in addition to a piece of handwritten text.  Young people have almost no idea that you can not only communicate via email and ICQ.  Imagine the girl who just saw the guy to serve the motherland.  Surprisingly, the modern army has preserved the tradition that existed at almost all times: lovers communicated through letters.  Despite the fact that officers allow conscripts to sometimes call relatives on their mobile phones, no one canceled the letters there.  In some or many military units, soldiers are given special white envelopes with a red frame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian post envelope filling" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1115307.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Back to the girl.  It was time for her to write a letter.  She will take one piece of paper, or maybe a few.  You can attach one or more photographs of a suitable size to the finished text so that they fit in the envelope.  It must be remembered that money is not supposed to be invested in an envelope.  This is not only unsafe, but also forbidden to do "Russian Post."  We will consider filling out the envelope below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Note for the erring </h2><p>  When <span>filling out the envelope</span> for the first time, difficulties may arise.  First, you need to make sure the address you gave is correct.  Secondly, without errors write the correct coordinates.  Of course, it also happens that envelopes filled with errors reach the addressees, but it‚Äôs better not to abuse it.  Writing an index is necessary both in cells and in a small field. </p><p>  You need to write in legible handwriting so that Russian Post employees can read it.  Below we see a sample envelope, albeit almost empty.  At the moment, it is important to notice all the necessary lines, fields and cells. </p>

    <p>  Above left is written ‚Äúfrom whom‚Äù and ‚Äúfrom where‚Äù.  It is recommended that you check yourself - you do not need to write your address on the machine.  In the lower left corner always in the cells you need to enter the sender index.  A sample fill is on the back.  It is advisable to display the numbers according to it. </p><h2>  What to write and how? </h2><p>  We will now take up the crucial part.  How to fill in an envelope (Russian Post)?  We got acquainted with the front side of the envelope.  Note that in the previous image there are stamps of mail and stamps.  The seal is placed by the Russian Post when the letter arrives at the mail whose index is indicated in the letter twice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In the picture at the top there is an example of writing index numbers.  In the lower left corner we see the recipient index.  We repeat again: it is important not to make a mistake! </p><p>  Now you should correctly write the name in the line ‚ÄúTo‚Äù and the address in the column ‚ÄúTo‚Äù.  It is worth noting that if the region is written first, then the settlement, street, house, then this will not be a mistake.  You can fill in as shown in the figure. </p><p>  Be sure to write your address in the From and From columns, as it may turn out that the addressee will not receive the letter and the mail will be returned back with the corresponding mark.  And if you didn‚Äôt provide the address, you will never know whether the letter reached or where it disappeared, if not. </p><h2>  About stamps and envelopes with a stamp </h2><p>  In past decades, it was important to buy envelopes and stamps separately.  What does the modern Russian Post offer?  The cost of envelopes varies from 3 rubles to 40-50 rubles.  It all depends on whether it is a simple envelope or with a stamp, large or small. </p><p>  The sample above is not branded.  The rectangular box in the upper right corner is unmarked.  Such an envelope, even if it is perfectly and correctly filled, no one will send.  The absence of a stamp is the invalidity of a letter.  It is not paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope filling sample" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1115311.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The price of an ordinary envelope 10x15cm without a stamp is about 3-5 rubles.  But is it worth it to send letters?  Most likely, no - it will be more useful for personal needs.  So that you can safely send a letter, it is better to purchase an envelope marked "A" (that is, sending in Russia) or "D" (if the letter needs to be sent to Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and other countries around the world).  Ready-made envelopes are, of course, more expensive, about 18-40 rubles.  Remember that the price depends on the weight of the letter.  If the mass is more than 20 grams, then you have to pay extra. </p><h2>  Sending letter </h2><p>  Above, we looked at how to fill out an envelope.  Russian Post recommends adhering to the rules so that the letter accurately reaches the addressee.  We list again: </p><ul><li>  legible handwriting; </li><li>  the correct filling of all fields and index; </li><li>  the presence of the stamp on the envelope. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs worth taking useful advice.  If you are sending a letter for the first time, it is best not to drop it in a blue mail box, but take it to employees in the department for receiving and delivering letters.  Let them check if everything is correct, whether it is necessary to pay extra for an advantage (if the letter weighs more than 20 grams). </p><p>  Sent letters go to the recipient for a long time, at least 10 days.  It also depends on the distance, the work of postal services.  Even if the <span>letter was sent</span> around the city, you still need a stamp on the envelope. </p><h2>  A letter has come to my beloved! </h2><p>  Let's get back to our heroine, a girl who is waiting for a guy from the army.  After a while, the young man will receive a letter if she correctly understood how to fill out the envelope.  "Russian Post" has sent.  It is worth noting that you must additionally indicate the company, unit and <span>military unit</span> in the line "where."  It is very important.  If the letter does not arrive for a long time, no need to worry.  Mail at a military unit may be unstable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian post envelope cost" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1115310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This article looked at a <span>sample of envelope filling.</span>  Russian Post permits to attach not only photographs and postcards to the letter, but also small flat crafts and drawings.  This will be a pleasant plus for those who like to please their loved ones with small gifts. </p><p>  In conclusion, we note that there is nothing complicated and scary in sending a letter.  On the contrary, such an activity is truly creative, bringing joy. </p>
