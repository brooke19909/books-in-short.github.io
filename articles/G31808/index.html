    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  For the formation of a <span>payment order</span> , a partial acceptance of the payer and the lack of the required amount of funds in the account are necessary.  In banking practice, this document is designated as an order that was not executed until a certain time. </p><p>  The procedure for issuing a <span>payment order is</span> similar to the procedure provided for filling in settlement securities. </p><p>  All copies of the document must contain the stamp of the bank, the signature of the responsible officer and the date.  The first copy is certified by the signature of the bank employee.  The payment order form has the code 0401066. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  On the front of the payment order is marked " <span>partial payment</span> ".  On the flip side, the responsible bank officer records a partial transfer.  In particular, the payment number, the number and date of the order, the amount and amount of the balance are indicated.  These data are certified by the signature of the employee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash warrant" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2041796.jpg"></div>

The remaining copies are issued to the payer along with the last copy of the <span>cash warrant</span> , which is attached to the extract from the l / s. </p><h2>  Debit Document </h2><p>  It is worth saying that a <span>cash</span> debit <span>order</span> is rarely used in banking practice.  A document is created in the automated system of a financial organization and a specific type of transaction is selected: </p><ul><li>  Payment to the supplier. </li><li>  Loan / loan calculation. </li><li>  Transfer of tax payment. </li><li>  Refund to buyer. </li><li>  Other settlements with counterparties. </li><li>  Transfer to another company account. </li><li>  Salary transfer. </li><li>  Transfer of funds to an accountable person. </li><li>  Another write-off of non-cash funds. </li></ul><p>  <span>The payment order</span> for debit is <span>filled</span> out on the basis of a bank statement.

    <p>  During the collection operation, the following is formed: </p><p>  <em>- db</em>  <em>51 cd</em>  <em>57</em> - by the amount deposited to the bank account. </p><p>  Money is credited to account 57 when a collection operation is reflected with a cash order (account) of the corresponding type.  At the same time, when you select it and specify the corresponding subaccount 57 of the account, the following is posted: </p><p>  <em>- db</em>  <em>57 cd</em>  <em>50</em> - for the amount of collected funds. </p><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  In case of partial payment, on all copies of the order affix: </p><ul><li>  Bank details. </li><li>  The number of operations that has been completed. </li><li>  Signature of the responsible employee. </li></ul><p>  The first copy must be certified by the employee of the banking organization that controlled the execution of the order.  Partial payment should be indicated on the top, right on the front side. </p><h2>  Payment order </h2><p>  It is a settlement document expressing a written order of the account holder sent to the banking organization to transfer a certain amount to the recipient's account.  The latter can be opened at this or another bank. </p><p>  The execution of the order shall be carried out within the time period established by the legislation, or in another, shorter period, if this is provided for in the service contract of the Russian Federation or defined by customs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filling out a payment order" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2041799.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Using this settlement document, funds are transferred: </p><ul><li>  For the supply of goods, the provision of services, work. </li><li>  To the budget of any level, extra-budgetary funds. </li><li>  In order to repay / place a loan / loan, pay interest on borrowed funds. </li><li>  For other purposes provided for in the contract or law. </li></ul><p>  In accordance with the main contract, the order can be used to transfer an advance (prepayment) of services, work, goods or to perform periodic settlement operations.  The document may be presented within 10 days (calendar).  The deadline starts on the day after the discharge date. </p><h2>  Payment order and payment order: differences </h2><p>  These two documents have one common attribute.  Both the order and the warrant are used as a way to carry out operations related to partial payments.  However, the documents have significant differences. </p><p>  The first is that a payment order cannot be used to fully pay an invoice or receipt.  A payment order, by contrast, usually performs just such a function. </p><p>  A payment order is a direct money transfer.  At the same time, it is not intended that a client of a banking organization issue an order for a settlement transaction.  The payment order, in turn, provides for the transfer to the banking structure of the right to transfer money from the client’s account to another payment system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment order form" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2041800.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A payment order can be used, for example, by judicial authorities.  The authorities apply to a banking organization with a request to write off a certain amount from the debtor's account in favor of another person or some structure.  In this case, the account holder is not notified in advance about operations that will be carried out with his money.  He can learn about the transfer after the transfer of funds, that is, upon the execution of the order.  For example, it can be an SMS alert.  He may not know about the operation before visiting the banking structure (if, say, a mobile bank is not installed). </p><p>  Accordingly, a payment order and an order are documents of various contents.  They can be executed independently of each other or be interconnected settlement securities. </p>
