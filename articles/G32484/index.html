    <h2>  Excursions and trips </h2><p>  Tourists claim that this is the most advantageous hotel in the vicinity - Ramayana Koh Chang Resort 4 *.  O. Chang has several main attractions, and almost all of them are not very far from the hotel.  Travelers recommend riding an elephant farm and waterfalls.  In addition, if you are a lover of trekking, the hotel can advise you on many hiking trails through the jungle, mountains and waterfalls.  Tourists also praise the good five-island boat trip.  They take you all day by sea, give you a swim with a mask, and also conduct an individual tour of the national park.  The hotel is an excellent starting point for independent travel to Cambodia.  Transfer from it to Siam Riepa costs three hundred butts per person. </p><h2>  Ramayana Koh Chang Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel does not stand at sea, tourists really like it.  They call the hotel fabulous.  Here you can live in a real jungle and at the same time feel very comfortable.  Everything is very clean and tidy.  The hotel leaves the most pleasant experience.  The restaurant sings European classics in the evenings.  But, of course, it is most suitable for those who know how to ride a bike.  Then you can easily reach the shops, cafes and everything that your heart desires.  You can come here at any time.  The rainy season on Ko Chang is not pronounced, so showers happen once a day, mainly in the morning or at night.  With all its features, this hotel is just a piece of paradise in faraway Thailand.  Such an aroma of flowers and an abundance of greenery is probably not found anywhere else.  There are few tourists and a clear sea with fine sand. </p>
