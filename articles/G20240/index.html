    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  So, national communism is <span>a political movement whose</span> representatives tried to combine the unconnected: communism and nationalism.  The occurrence of this phenomenon is attributed primarily to Ukraine in 1917-1920, which was part of the former Russian Empire.  The goal of National Communism was to create, firstly, a socialist state, and secondly, a communist society, which is based on national interests, cultural and territorial features of a particular nationality. </p><p>  And the main representatives of this movement in Ukraine were: Nikolai Khvylovy, Nikolay Skripnik, <span>Alexander Shumskoy,</span> Mikhail Volobuev. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  As mentioned above, this movement was responsible for the creation of a communist society, but it had to be based on the interests of a certain nationality.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnational communism, the parties that supported it, was a complete rejection of the replacement of national culture with some other universal language and culture.  It is important to note that this trend supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa separate independent state, which joins the union of socialist republics on a voluntary basis.  In accordance with the foregoing, the movement of National Communism opposed the ideas of both globalization and cosmopolitanism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The territory this political movement has spread to </h2><p>  Of course, this movement existed not only on Ukrainian territory, but also in some republics of the Soviet Union, for example, Georgia. </p><p>  But as for Ukrainian National Communism, it remained the strongest among the republics.  Moscow actively struggled with such phenomena, and it succeeded in eliminating them, but in the situation with Ukraine, the government failed.  After all, Ukraine has always shown an active struggle for its independence, which it sought.  The same thing happened after the Revolution, when the Ukrainian Republic achieved the right to be called an independent state in 1920.  However, Moscow left this agreement only on paper and continued to represent Ukraine in international communities, to which the government responded with a protest. </p><p>  However, after the creation of the USSR, the status of independent Ukraine began to rapidly lose.  After all, her government wanted to conduct a full Ukrainization and replace the powers that be with those with only Ukrainian roots.  However, the Moscow authorities took these measures for the national oppression of the Russian people in the territory of the Ukrainian Republic.  Under such pressure, the political movement in Ukraine was defeated on the spot by National Bolshevism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  National Communism.  Political History </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the origin of this trend is attributed to Ukraine.  It was formed from the very first years of <span>Soviet power.</span>  Important at that time was the brochure of Mazlakh and the Fraudster, which was called "Wave".  Its authors were convinced that to destroy the phenomenon of national oppression, remaining after the hated tsarist regime, is possible only with the separation of Ukraine from the Russian Empire.  They also believed that the Communist Party of Ukraine should be transformed into a separate <span>political organization.</span>  Mazlakh and the Fraudster harshly criticized the attitude of the government, which was in Moscow, to the Ukrainian national problem.  The authors of the brochure dreamed of a communist and independent Ukraine, but these are two completely incompatible things. </p><p>  Thus, the brochure "Wave" became the first source that expressed the ideas of national communism, and the basis for the emergence of a new trend, doomed to inevitable collapse. </p><p>  On the whole, this movement combined various political trends and directions, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was "the communist restructuring of all layers of Soviet society." </p>

    <h2>  The causes of the movement of social communism on Ukrainian territory </h2><p>  The emergence of this trend in Ukraine was due to the political realities of that time and, possibly, the immaturity and split of the Ukrainian democratic trend.  It is worth noting that a fairly impressive number of Ukrainian democrats understood that only cooperation with the Bolsheviks would help to avoid a terrible situation.  Perhaps it was for this reason that National Communism, whose history is so closely intertwined with the Soviet regime, was doomed to death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ukrainization and its achievements </h2><p>  This action began in Ukraine in the 1920s.  The goal of Ukrainization was, firstly, to replace all the personnel in the leadership with people of Ukrainian origin, and secondly, to introduce the Ukrainian language at all levels of society. </p><p>  The main achievement of Ukrainization was the full implementation of the Ukrainian language at all possible levels.  Representatives of the movement also achieved the legitimacy of the national amateur initiative of the Ukrainian Communists.  Success was also achieved in the field of organizing the cultural process, which opposed Russian chauvinism and Ukrainian nationalism.  Representatives of the current created a branching of the cells of the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian culture. </p><p>  National Communism under Stalin was severely suppressed.  And all who supported this idea and movement were sent to be shot.  For this, of course, representatives of the movement terribly hated and feared the ruler of the Soviet Union. </p>

    <h2>  The reasons for the emergence of social communism in Russia </h2><p>  So, the first information about social democracy in Russia, which after many years degenerated into communism, appeared when George Plekhanov translated the Manifesto of the Communist Party into his native language. </p><p>  The abolition of the shameful serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861 was the direct cause of the emergence of capitalist relations on the territory of Russia, which was not the case before.  However, the country still retained its former foundations: autocracy, privileges for the nobility, large land tenure.  For this reason, a revolutionary mood began to grow in the people.  Then various political associations began to organize, including the Russian Social Democratic Party.  Thus, things were slowly moving to colossal changes throughout the country. </p><p>  And now the beginning of the real party building was laid by the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903, which was held in London.  At this congress, basic documents and programs for the development of social communism in Russia were signed.  It is important to note that such congresses could not be lawfully held on the territory of the Russian Empire, because such activity at that time was simply impossible in Russia. </p><p>  At the same 2nd congress, the very division into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks occurred, which subsequently entailed irreversible historical events that completely changed Russia. </p><h2>  Manifestations of this movement in Vietnam </h2><p>  What is remarkable about Vietnamese national communism?  History has it that the Communist Party in Vietnam originated in 1951 and existed until 1981.  The decision to create a communist party in Vietnam was made at the Congress of the IKP in the 51st year.  When it began to exist, it separated from the French Communist Party and, in turn, was itself divided into 3 parties: the Khmer People's Revolutionary Party, the Lao People's Party and the Vietnamese Labor Party. </p><p>  After the end of the Vietnam War, an active continuation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãforming a communist society in the country began.  And the first step towards communism was the nationalization of all banks and large companies.  Already in 1976, the South and North of Vietnam united and became known as the Vietnam Socialist Republic. </p><p>  Already in the mid-1970s, Vietnam established a strong relationship with the USSR, and in 1976 they entered into a friendship treaty.  All the time, the Union actively helped rebuild Vietnam after fierce hostilities on its territory.  The Soviet Union also actively contributed to the consolidation of communism in the Republic of Vietnam.  Russian specialists from various fields were often sent there.  The Vietnamese exchange came to the Union to study at Soviet universities. </p><p>  But then in Vietnam, war broke out again with Cambodia, and then with China.  The war did not last long, only three weeks, from February 17 to March 5, 1979.  It ended thanks to the Soviet Union, which intervened and helped to end hostilities between Vietnam and China peacefully.  But despite the quick resolution of the conflict, a lot of people left Vietnam, which caused the country's economy to stagger. </p><p>  Copying the Soviet regime by Vietnam led to its complete misery.  Indeed, in some parts of the country, the economy rested only on private enterprise.  In connection with this phenomenon, a number of reforms were carried out, as a result of which some restrictions were lifted, and the peasants could sell part of their products on the markets. </p><p>  But after the collapse of the <span>Soviet Union,</span> respectively, assistance to the republic ceased.  The country had to come out of the terrible crisis on its own, to fight inflation and absolute poverty.  In connection with this depressing situation, Vietnam has opened its borders to European entrepreneurs who have begun to invest in the economy and industry. </p><p>  Nowadays, Vietnam is also a socialist republic.  Now the tourism business is actively progressing there.  Holidays in Vietnam are now in great demand among the Russian population. </p><p>  Communism in Vietnam appears in a slightly relaxed form, although it resembles the Soviet Union.  The republic is open for economic relations with other countries. </p>

    <h2>  Definitions </h2><p>  So, it is necessary to define such concepts as "national socialism", "communism" and "fascism".  Because quite often people, thinking that they know the story perfectly, are mistaken in these definitions. </p><p>  National Socialism is a form of social organization that includes socialism and nationalism (racism).  It is important to note that this movement, in turn, is divided into right and left.  Moreover, the right refers more to the word ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and is adjacent to the USSR, while the left focuses on ‚Äúnationalism‚Äù, which is referred to as Hitler‚Äôs policy based on racism in its most severe form.  Many attribute this definition to fascism and do not see much difference. </p><p>  Fascism is a political direction that includes dictatorship and the use of extreme forms of violence (this especially affected the Jewish people).  It is combined with nationalism and racism.  This movement leads to a complete denial of human rights and freedoms, carries a threat to the whole world.  Therefore, today the whole world is actively fighting against any manifestations of fascism.  The constitutions prescribe a whole series of articles that criminalize any action of a fascist nature. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, despite the fact that the courtyard is the 21st century, the manifestations of fascism, unfortunately, take place in European countries.  But, fortunately, there is an active struggle against such phenomena. </p><p>  However, there is a difference, and very significant.  So what is it manifested in? </p>

    <h2>  The difference between National Socialism, Communism, Fascism </h2><p>  And the difference between these concepts is as follows.  If fascism regarded the state as the primary element and said: ‚Äúthe state creates a nation‚Äù, then National Socialism set forth the idea that the state acts as a means to preserve the people.  His goal was to rebuild the state into society.  National Socialism supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcleansing the race, discarding all other elements.  In the case of Germany, this idea was embodied in the Aryan nation.  The Nazis sought absolute power over all aspects of the life of each individual.  This trend provided for the abandonment of many basic human rights. </p><p>  In the early 1930s, social-nationalists led by Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.  Therefore, almost immediately the persecution of the Jewish people began, and then they began to be massively destroyed.  This operation in history is called the Holocaust.  After the extermination of the Jews and the capture of the whole world, the National Socialists planned to use other peoples, enslaving them. </p><p>  Fortunately, this idea did not come true, although it managed to bring a lot of grief to the entire human population.  A huge number of Jews were exterminated in the camps, many people were shot. </p><p>  As for communism, there are also some features.  But first you need to define what communism is. </p><p>  Communism is a political ideology that denies any private property.  It is believed that this ideology is utopian.  The meaning of <span>this idea is</span> reflected in the following phrase: "from each according to his capabilities, to each according to his needs."  A striking example of communism is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  They tried to build communism there for 70 years, but, unfortunately, these attempts were unsuccessful, because the USSR fell, proving only the utopianism of communist ideology. </p><p>  National Communism in Russia was associated with fear, a lack of humanity and any hope that a person would be pardoned for his act. </p>

    <h2>  Common Features of National Socialism, Communism, Fascism </h2><p>  National Socialism and Fascism have common features.  The main one is the complete subordination of the interests of each individual to the state and the absolute control of the state over all layers of society and man. </p><p>  Both of these ideas are the embodiment of cruelty and injustice, because we can evaluate these movements, judging by the final results that they came to as a result.  There is no doubt that representatives of these political trends did not wish harm to the country.  They tried to build a new ideal society (in their understanding).  However, they did not take into account one thing - the interests of the common people, who suffered, suffered so much grief.  Surely mankind suffered grief during that terrible time thousands of years in advance. </p>
