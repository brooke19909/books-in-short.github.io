    <h2>  On the eve of vacation </h2><p>  So, you have finally decided: this vacation will be spent outside the walls of your home.  It doesn’t matter where you want to go - abroad or, for example, to the nearest resort.  The question is one: is there enough money for a decent working days of rest?  And is it possible to save so as not to limit yourself to absolutely everything?  It turns out that there is such an opportunity. </p><h2>  We are looking for options </h2><p>  Most people in the old fashion prefer a "wild" vacation.  To some extent, the end really justifies the means.  You can save, for example, on housing, choosing accommodation in tents, or on food, cooking at the stake from those products that you stocked up in advance.  But are there many difficulties for a modern person?  Perhaps it is better to prefer confidence, calmness and modern benefits?  That is what rational people do.  The easiest way to book a ticket in advance is with a travel agency that you trust.  You will only have to pay the specified amount, and specialists will take care of the road, place of residence, food and even entertainment.  But what if the amount is too large? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="last-minute tours from Moscow" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/446117.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can save on last-minute tours.  This is one of the best options.  What are last-minute tours?  They are not planned in advance by tour operators and appear depending on the situation in the market.  For example, if the season ends, and vouchers are not sold out, then the price for them will definitely begin to fall.  The tour operator reduces the cost.  This happens if customers suddenly abandoned the purchased tour, or if the charter is paid, but the vouchers are not sold out.  Sometimes tour operators set a price that is lower than the real cost.  This is done only in order to reduce losses.  So, what are the burning tours, we figured out.  The question is ripening: what are the risks of getting poor quality service as a result? </p><h2>  Fair concerns </h2><p>  The fear of beginners who have not previously encountered last-minute packages is understandable.  But you should not be afraid to get them.  “Burning” does not mean “poor quality”.  All conditions that were proposed earlier will remain without the slightest change.  The main thing is to contact a serious agency that already has a good reputation.  The only thing you have to sacrifice is the time to collect documents (although agents can do this for you, but, of course, for an additional amount).  It may, however, happen that you will only have a couple of hours to pay and get to the airport.  The downside, as you know, is that the ticket appears suddenly.  But you have a real opportunity to seriously save.  We will consider this moment in more detail. </p><h2>  Cheaper but not worse </h2>

Sometimes it can be very noticeable - for example, 40% of the total cost of a regular tour.  Sometimes the difference can be quite insignificant - 10-20 euros ... Also, of course, not bad.  Especially if these are “burning” tours from Moscow, and you yourself live in another city.  Thus, you pay the road to the place of departure.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most profitable tours can be purchased at the height of the season (midsummer, "velvet" season, Christmas holidays).  It is almost impossible to predict when a cheap ticket will appear.  Last minute <span>tours to Turkey</span> may appear in the winter, and special offers for trips to Thailand in the spring, in the least popular season.  The problem, as you know, is that discount vouchers appear almost before the departure, so ordering them in advance is quite difficult.  It may happen that you planned to go to Spain, and you are offered Egypt.  Last-minute tours are always a surprise.  However, there is a solution here.  In order to get a ticket in the right direction, you can contact several agencies in advance.  Be sure: if a burning tour appears, they will contact you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt last minute tours" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/446136.jpg" width="521"></div>

    <h2>  Do-it-yourself searches </h2><p>  In the meantime, you can stroll through the sites of local tour operators and get acquainted with offers for the season.  Check prices to calculate the amount you need for your vacation.  Do not forget only that not all countries have last-minute tours.  There are practically no discounts on sightseeing tours, cruises, various islands, and skiing.  But it’s quite realistic to relax on the beach somewhere in Egypt, Thailand, the UAE and other countries popular with Russian-speaking tourists.  Here, the rest on last minute packages is quite real.  It is important that, by purchasing a last-minute tour, you get all the same advantages that would be applied to an ordinary trip: transport, comfortable hotels, service, but much cheaper.  An ideal option for acquiring such a ticket is when a thirst for relaxation arose suddenly, and in the near future it is free to travel.  Then the burning tour will be, as they say, “cheap and angry.” </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="last minute packages" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/446355.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  What do Russian tour operators usually offer? </h2><p>  The most popular holiday in countries with eternal summer.  This may be Turkey, and Egypt, and Cuba, and the Seychelles, and the Dominican Republic, and the Maldives, and Sri Lanka, and Greece, and Cyprus.  These areas are usually the most popular.  This means that in these countries trips are planned by tour operators in the greatest quantity, therefore it is more realistic to buy last-minute tours there.  Cruises are also in demand, allowing you to visit several countries at once, for just one tour (for example, in the Mediterranean Sea).  It's simple, you just need to make a choice. </p><p>  Egypt (last-minute tours here is not uncommon) will give you a truly unforgettable experience of the famous pyramids and temples, and will allow you to plunge headlong into the great Nile.  Its splendor and wealth will conquer the Red Sea.  You can count on a ton of impressions for an acceptable amount. </p><p>  Traveling to Thailand will not only allow you to admire amazing landscapes and relax on really beautiful beaches, but also introduce you to Buddhist culture, <span>Thai cuisine</span> and a special kind of massage.  Winter trips are especially attractive - getting out of the cold winter, you will plunge into the warm summer, like a fairy tale. </p><p>  Holidays in the UAE will appeal to those who love a high level of service.  You will get in touch with the ancient culture, you can visit the best SPA resorts, improve your health.  This is the choice of those who love countries of bright contrasts. </p><p>  There are always suggestions.  The main thing is to decide and make a choice, which, by the way, will definitely be in your favor, because now you know what burning tours are. </p>
