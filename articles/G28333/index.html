In world practice, it is accepted that participants in this form of construction are called "equity holders". </p>

    <h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  According to the terms of the contract, the developer, having received permission to put the property into operation, must transfer all the documents to the participants in shared construction.  The role of the latter, as mentioned earlier, can be both legal entities and individuals who have timely concluded an agreement to participate in this type of construction of residential and public buildings.  Thus, from the context of this article it can be revealed that the meaning of the word "builder" implies any legal entity that has ownership or lease rights to a particular land plot and is engaged in the search and subsequent attraction of funds from the so-called "equity holders" . </p>

    <h2>  Important Details </h2><p>  Currently, more and more often you can see <span>ads</span> on <span>billboards</span> containing similar phrases: "apartments, offices, new buildings from the builder."  What is meant by these words?  Let's take a closer look.  As mentioned earlier, the developer is a legal entity that undertakes to carry out all measures for the implementation of the investment project.  However, all of the above does not allow an accurate definition of the concept under consideration from a legal point of view.  Thus, the following wording was adopted by the current legislation: the developer is an authorized person who has the right to manage capital investments for a specific period of time.  However, in the event that the organization in question acts as a customer, it is given the name "customer-developer". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Field of activity </h2><p>  A legal entity endowed with such status is often engaged in the search and conclusion of contracts with contractors, suppliers and other organizations that may be necessary for the successful completion of construction work.  In addition, it must be remembered that the developer himself is, in a sense, a contractor.  Only the general.  Consequently, he himself can not only oversee the implementation of construction works, but also engage in them.  As a rule, this can be the development of a design project, installation of an alarm system, installation of internal communications, etc.  In addition, since the customer-builder for the most part is represented by fairly large organizations that have existed for quite some time, then, accordingly, he has considerable experience in the field of the work under consideration.  So, he knows all kinds of aspects and nuances that may arise at each stage of construction.  Therefore, such an organization can predict in advance possible options for the development of events and, thus, avoid the most unfavorable of them. </p>

    <h2>  Feature List </h2><p>  Often the average citizen, having seen the inscription on the advertising brochure of the following content: "New buildings from the builder", does not think about the functionality provided by the construction company.  But knowing their complete list will help each person to make an accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe opportunities that open up.  The material below describes the most important functions that you are entitled to require from the developer.  Of course, a more specific list can be found only directly from the selected construction organization.  Nevertheless, there are common points for all.  Let's consider some of them.  So what is a builder and what can he offer?  The activities attributed to the performer include all aspects, from the beginning of the design to the time the foundation is laid.  They traditionally include: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  competently prepared terms of reference; </li><li>  reliable support of <span>working documentation,</span> as well as the implementation of all developments in the shortest possible time; </li><li>  full compliance of the project with all approved building rules and regulations, as well as legislative documents; </li><li>  organization of <span>construction</span> management and <span>control</span> ; </li><li>  obtaining the necessary approvals; </li><li>  commissioning of the <span>construction project</span> . </li></ul>

    <h2>  Detailed description </h2><p>  A wide range of various services described earlier, traditionally includes a huge number of different options.  Let's consider some of them.  Obtaining the necessary documentation is associated with verification of title papers and a detailed study of the territory of the future construction site.  The preparation of the design assignment includes the following items: selection and subsequent coordination with the customer of the developed routes, as well as their connection to the existing networks;  development of calendar terms for each stage;  preliminary selection of contractors and so on.  Technical support of <span>design work</span> traditionally includes the selection of the organization with which a contract is concluded for the supply of all necessary equipment;  physical preparation of the site;  representation of the interests of the customer;  organization and conduct of acceptance of objects to the contractor and other persons involved at this stage.  Legal confirmation of construction work can not do without the coordination of architectural decisions and expertises in the manner prescribed by the state and so on. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Based on all of the above, we can conclude that the slogan "Apartments in new buildings from the builder" offers you a huge selection of services, starting from freeing you from bureaucratic red tape and ending with the first stages of construction.  And indeed it is! </p>
