What to do?  Recreate the missing funds from friends?  Or delay a purchase until better times?  Credit cards really help us out at such moments. </p><h2>  <span>What is a credit</span> plastic card? </h2><p>  This is a modern financial instrument, which is a plastic <span>bank card</span> with a certain amount accrued on it.  The bank provides a limit under which the cardholder can pay for his purchases and services received.  The size of the limit is determined individually and depends, as a rule, on the income of the card recipient and his credit history. </p>

    <p>  Modern credit cards, such as, for example, a Tinkoff credit card, are distinguished by ease of processing and ease of use.  Thanks to this tool, it is not possible to borrow money from friends and relatives or to apply for a loan from a bank.  But it should be understood that the funds on the credit card are borrowed, and they are subject to obligatory return. </p><h2>  About Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank </h2><p>  The history of Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank (hereinafter referred to as TCS) begins in 1994.  Then the credit institution was called "Himmashbank".  The bank was renamed in 2006, when it was acquired by <span>well-known businessman</span> Oleg Tinkov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  After receiving the card, you must activate it.  To do this, just call the call center and, following the instructions of the voice service, get a PIN-code.  Now the card can be used. </p><h2>  Is it possible to close a Tinkoff credit card? </h2><p>  Opening a TCS card is a simple process.  It is enough to fill out an application on the site and wait for confirmation.  What about closing?  Perhaps you no longer need the card and you decided to refuse it.  How to do everything right and not remain in debt at the bank? </p><p>  There is always less information about closing credit cards.  Most often, the holder just needs to come to the bank branch and contact a consultant.  But what if the bank works remotely?  After all, Tinkoff Credit Systems has no representative offices in Russian cities. </p>

    <p>  It turns out that it is impossible to close the card?  Not at all!  Remember how you opened it.  Remotely.  Consequently, the Tinkoff card can be closed in the same way, that is, online.  This procedure is simple and accessible to everyone. </p><h2>  Online close card TCS </h2><p>  If you no longer need a credit card, do not rush to drop it in the far box.  It is very important to close the card first.  Otherwise, even without using it, you can accumulate debts to the bank.  It‚Äôs not just about the annual card maintenance fee.  Additional services may be connected to your account.  For example, SMS informing or insurance. </p><p>  How to close the Tinkoff card online?  This is not difficult.  First you need to make sure that you have no debt to the bank.  To do this, just call the call center or check your account using online banking. </p><p>  In the absence of outstanding loans, you can close the card at any time.  Call the operator and inform about your intention.  Be prepared for the fact that a call center employee will ask you to tell him your passport data and card code word. </p><p>  But you can do something else.  In our age of information technology, use the Internet banking system.  Block the card in your account, and then contact the call center and ask to terminate the contract. </p><h2>  Card closing features </h2>

    <p>  You have decided to close your credit account and already know how.  You can close the Tinkoff card (apply for closure) at any time.  But it should be understood that it will not be blocked immediately on the day of treatment.  It will be necessary to wait for a certain period in which your application for closing the account will be considered, and the absence of debt verified.  It is also necessary to pay the remaining balances that could appear during the period of consideration of the application for closure. </p><p>  After receiving confirmation of the account closure from the operator, check the status in your account.  You can dispose of the Tinkoff credit card yourself. </p><p>  It should be noted that the remote closing service, despite its convenience, is a rather rare phenomenon among Russian banks.  Tinkof Credit Systems Bank is one of the few financial institutions that provide it. </p>
