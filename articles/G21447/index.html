Its area is 29.5 thousand km square.  It is the largest bay after the Bothnian Bay, the area of ​​which is 117.0 thousand square kilometers.  From the north, south and east, the Gulf of Finland is limited by mainland land, it washes Finland, Estonia and Russia, respectively.  The imaginary line between Cape Pyizaspea and the Hanko Peninsula is the western boundary of the bay. </p><p>  Its eastern shores are called the <span>Neva Bay.</span>  Neva flows into the top with several sleeves.  The Gulf of Finland in St. Petersburg (see photo in the article) is one of the main water areas of the city.  The northern capital is located in its easternmost part.  Most of the major rivers that flow through the territory of the Leningrad Region and St. Petersburg itself flow into the gulf. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  The average width of the bay is 80 km.  In some places, it expands to 130 km (the area of ​​the Narva River).  The length is about 400 km.  The Gulf of Finland in St. Petersburg is shallow, so the water warms up quickly enough.  The average depth of the local waters (in the region of the Neva Bay) is only 6 m, while the average depth of the bay is 38 m, and the maximum is 121 m. </p><p>  The waters of the Gulf of Finland are replete with small islands and skerries - small rocky archipelagos located near the coast.  Also in the bay are artificial islands that previously served to protect coastal cities from attacks from the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Gulf of Finland in St. Petersburg is almost fresh.  The salinity of the local waters decreases due to the discharge of more than 20 rivers into the bay, the most significant of which are the Neva, Keila and Porvonyoki. </p><p>  The shores of the gulf, especially in the north, have an extremely rugged relief, remotely resembling the <span>Norwegian fjords.</span>  The southern border is flooded and has a slightly less rugged topography than the northern part of the bay. </p><h2>  Temperature mode </h2><p>  The average water temperature of the bay in winter is 0 ° C, and in summer about 15 ° C.  The climate is temperate.  Summer is wet and short, winter is long, cold and damp.  This is exactly the weather that awaits tourists who want to visit St. Petersburg.  The Gulf of Finland is covered with ice at the end of November; it opens in the second decade of April.  However, in warm winters, this area may <span>not freeze</span> at all <span>.</span>  In May-June in these places you can observe an amazing natural phenomenon - white nights.  At this time, astronomically (“by the hour”) night falls, but the illumination is maintained at the level of early twilight.  Many seek to visit Peter to watch this unique picture.  White nights last about fifty days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gulf of Finland in St. Petersburg photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1251455.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vegetable world </h2><p>  The coast of the Gulf of Finland and the surrounding area is considered to be part of the southern taiga.  Pine, spruce and deciduous forests are common here.

Also, many aquatic plants grow here, such as a water lily, egg-pod, acute sedge and valerian maritime. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  Representation of the fauna of these parts is also impressive.  Among the birds you can find several <span>species of ducks</span> and partridges, geese, hazel grouse, woodpeckers and blackbirds, cuckoos and tits.  Small and large mammals are found: from the field mouse, squirrels and beaver to the wolf, wild boar and bear.  The Gulf of Finland in St. Petersburg favors the development of fishing.  The most important fishing spots are located on the north coast.

    <h2>  Gulf of Finland in St. Petersburg: rest </h2><p>  Due to its diverse, colorful nature and rich history, the Gulf of Finland is very attractive in terms of tourism.  In spring, the bay could more than satisfy the needs of the most avid fisherman: the fish resource here is large and quite diverse.  In summer, lovers of tanning and marine procedures, this area provides for use its coast.  In the warm season, the water of the bay warms up well, but due to the unsatisfactory environmental situation, swimming here is well-earned, but you can ride a boat or boat.  There is something to satisfy cultural needs, because many want to visit St. Petersburg, and those who have already visited these places more than once come back here again. </p>
