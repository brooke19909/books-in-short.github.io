There are many narrow streets, ancient palaces and churches.  Despite the fact that Genoa is a city in which less than 600,000 people live, it is known throughout the world due to the fact that Christopher Columbus himself was born here.  The city has one of <span>the world's largest aquariums, the</span> castle where Marco Polo was imprisoned, and much more. </p><h2>  Genoa Central </h2><p>  Acquaintance with a new city always starts from the central square.  In Genoa, this is Ferrari Square.  No, the name was not given in honor of a famous <span>Italian automobile brand,</span> but in honor of a very famous diplomat, financier and philanthropist.  Today Piazza De Ferrari is quite large, although a few centuries ago it was much smaller and was adjacent to the monastery and the temple, which today you will not see here. </p><p>  The thing is that when Napoleon ruled in Genoa, barracks were set up in the monastery, and in a fairly short period of time it was very dilapidated.  It was decided to demolish it and reconstruct the area.  A significant year for the central square of Genoa was 1828, when its reconstruction was completed.  Piazza De Ferrari has become much larger and has become square.  Around it were built new beautiful buildings.  Not far from the opera house is the famous monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi, erected in 1879. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walkingwithawareness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central square" class="if uuid-2449411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449411.jpg"></div><p>  After more than a hundred years in the center of the square, one of the most important attractions of Genoa, Fontana di Piaggio, was established.  The fountain has a round shape.  Of course, in the world there are larger and more original fountains, but there is something magical and enchanting in it, so it is definitely worth a visit.  Even if you have absolutely no time and you will explore all the sights of Genoa in one day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bank of St.  George </h2><p>  Since Genoa is a huge port, the coastline is 130 kilometers long.  It was here that, many centuries ago, incredible amounts of transactions were already carried out.  Coins from around the world rang in this city, so it was decided to open the first bank.  Here, the first check was issued for the first time. </p><p>  One interesting story was connected with this place: at the bank of San Giorgio, Christopher Columbus himself asked for a loan for his expedition.  He took the money exactly for the trip when America was discovered.  But the bank refused to issue money to him, and the great discoverer had to find it elsewhere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First bank" class="if uuid-2449413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449413.jpg"></div><p>  Napoleon ‚Äúinherited‚Äù enough in this city, therefore, after his decree in 1805, the bank ceased to exist.  Today it houses a museum, which is one of the main attractions of Genoa. </p><h2>  Italy's largest aquarium </h2><p>  This city is famous for its huge aquarium or, as the locals call it - an aquarium.  The construction is incredible in size: 6 million liters of water are used here to maintain a normal standard of living for marine inhabitants.  It is believed that the aquarium is the second largest in Europe in terms of size and number of species of aquatic animals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The aquarium works from 9:30 to 21:00, but since it is a very large structure and it takes at least 2 hours to view it, you can go only until 19:00.  Admission for adults is 25 Euros (1,500 rubles), for children under 15 years old admission is 15 Euros (900 rubles).  Children under three years old have free admission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orangesmile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarium in Genoa" class="if uuid-2449414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449414.jpg"></div><p>  In the aquarium of Genoa, you can see such entertainment programs: </p><ul><li>  performance of dolphins (visitors are near the glass with sea inhabitants that swim right next to them); </li><li>  feeding animals; </li><li>  In the contact pool, each visitor can stroke the stingrays. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, experienced travelers advise, if you do not know what attractions you can visit in Genoa, be sure to come to this place. </p><h2>  City port </h2><p>  The port is 25 km long, which makes it incredibly huge.  It connects Italy with all of Southern Europe, at one time it was the most popular among sailors, businessmen and politicians.  And to this day, the port of Genoa is an interesting attraction: there is a huge thousand-year-old lighthouse, there is a maritime museum, a botanical garden and an oceanarium nearby, so if you want to visit all the sights of Genoa in 1 day, you should immediately go to the port and leave from it to other interesting places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.walkingwithawareness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Copy of a pirate ship" class="if uuid-2449412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449412.jpg"></div><h2>  Maritime Museum </h2><p>  There is another interesting attraction in the Old Port, which will appeal to lovers of marine subjects.  The exhibition center here is huge, its area is more than 10,000 square meters, so the Galata Museum is considered one of the largest in marine subjects. </p><p>  There are many ancient navigational charts, instruments of the time, weapons, reconstructed shipyards and much more.  European museums are notable for their accessibility and originality; throughout the tour you will be accompanied by sound effects, which, according to many visitors, immerse you in the right atmosphere. </p><p>  Since Christopher Columbus is a native of Genoa and the most famous person in the city, a lot of attention is paid to the great discoverer.  If you dreamed of visiting a submarine, then this opportunity will appear.  Near the Galata Museum there is a submarine, which can be accessed for a fee.  Another feature of the museum is that at the top of the building there is a cozy terrace with a magnificent view of the port and the central part of the city. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden "Biosphere" </h2><p>  The garden is located very close to the aquarium.  If you find yourself nearby, you can visit this attraction, but you should not go here just for the sake of the botanical garden. </p><p>  It‚Äôs interesting inside, an artificial tropical forest was created here, there are a lot of not only vegetation, but also animals: iguanas, birds, butterflies.  Piranhas are found in brooks. </p><p>  Everything is very interesting and beautiful, but according to the reviews of tourists about the sights in Genoa, the inspection takes no more than 15 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orangesmile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2449415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449415.jpg"></div><h2>  Churches and temples </h2><p>  Many people know that Italy is a country due to which Catholicism began to develop actively.  For all the time hundreds of temples were erected here.  Genoa is no exception.  Very often tourists wonder what to watch in Genoa in 1 day?  There are a lot of attractions here, but since you have limited time, better get acquainted with the historical past and admire the old churches.  The most famous is the Jesuit church of Saints Ambrose and Andrew, which is located in the very center of the city. </p><p>  The structure is very old, the beginning of its construction dates back to the VI century.  Its construction was started by the bishop from Milan, who was expelled from his city and was forced to flee to Genoa.  After 10 centuries, the church passed into the control of the Jesuits.  In the period of the XVI-XVII centuries the building was seriously reconstructed, the facade of the building was completely changed, inside the church was decorated with paintings by such famous artists as Rubens, Merano, Carlone and other masters of that time. </p><p>  At the end of the XIX century, the facade had to be restored again.  There is a special passage between the church and the Palace, which by that time was destroyed.  When carrying out repairs, sketches of Rubens were used, and sculptures of Andrei and Ambrose were installed at the end.  The amazing attraction of Genoa, according to tourists, is fantastically interesting, because inside the church is incredibly beautiful. </p><h2>  Cathedral of San Lorenzo </h2><p>  Another attraction of this city is Cattedrale di San Lorenzo.  The building is located in the heart of Genoa, 150 meters from the central square.  The temple is named after the saint who died the death of a martyr.  This saint was buried here, later a small chapel was erected at this place, and several centuries later the construction of the monumental cathedral began.  The construction began in the XII century. </p><p>  The Pope consecrated this temple in 1118, but construction work continued for another 300 years.  That is why the building from an architectural point of view looks unusual: initially the cathedral was planned to be built in the Romanesque style, but over time it turned into a kind of French Gothic.  The building can be entered through one of the three entrances, which are faced with two-tone marble.  At that time, it symbolized nobility. </p><p>  On the roof of the building are two belfries.  The bell tower on the right side was finished in the 16th century, so it has vivid features of the Renaissance style.  The left was never completed, much later a loggia was made of it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.panoramio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church in Genoa" class="if uuid-2449418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449418.jpg"></div><p>  Inside is insanely beautiful, majestic.  Here you can see old paintings, murals and statues of masters of different times.  The peculiarity of the temple is that in the right nave you can see the roof, which was damaged by a bomb, but it did not explode, so the structure remained intact.  All believers believe that this is a testimony of God's power. </p><p>  In the basement of the cathedral there is a treasury-museum, there are not many exhibits, however, there are some very valuable ones.  Among them is the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper, as well as the dish on which they brought the head of John the Baptist to the insidious Salome. </p><h2>  Royal Palace Museum </h2><p>  One of the most colorful buildings of this city.  The palace was erected in the seventeenth century for the Balbi family.  However, she did not own this building for long, and soon a very influential Durazzo family became the new owners.  They lived here for quite a long time, until 1824, since then the palace became the residence of the kings of Savoy. </p><p>  Since the most distinguished people lived here, the interior of the room has undergone major changes.  Incredibly expensive and high-quality furniture was put inside, paintings by famous masters were hung.  The facade of the building has also changed a bit.  One hundred years later, the <span>king of Italy</span> transferred this building to the government department. </p><p>  Unfortunately, during the Second World War, the palace was bombed and very badly damaged.  However, for Italians this building is very important, therefore it was quickly restored and a museum was made here, which anyone can visit.  For tourists, the Throne and Ballrooms, as well as royal bedrooms, are open here.  You can see old sculptures, elegant furniture, chandeliers and stunning medieval decor here.  All together, a person is immersed in the unique atmosphere of the XVII-XVIII centuries. </p><p>  Not only this is famous for the Royal Palace: in the backyard there are magnificent flower beds with exotic flowers and plants.  Separately, you need to pay attention to the beautiful paths, which are laid out from small pebbles.  Going out onto the royal terrace, you can see the beautiful landscape of the Gulf of Genoa. </p><h2>  Archaeological Museum of Liguria </h2><p>  A very good museum for a quick visit.  It is located in the former villa of one famous public figure in this city.  The building was erected in the XII century; rich and famous families lived in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dayofarchaeology.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archaeological Museum" class="if uuid-2449420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449420.jpg"></div><p>  The museum has collected a large number of ancient exhibits, starting from prehistoric times and ending with the Roman Empire.  In addition to the standard exhibition around the museum is located a stunning beauty park.  Here orchids, camellias, palm trees, bananas, ferns and much more grow that every tourist will certainly enjoy.  The attraction is interesting, so if you have little time and want to see the most, be sure to visit this museum. </p><h2>  The main attractions of Genoa: what to see in 1 day </h2><p>  Very often, tourists do not have enough time to get acquainted with the city.  In this case, you need to decide on the route in order to see everything, but not to spend a lot of time. </p><p>  So, when you arrive at the airport, it is immediately recommended to go to the city center.  You can get to it by taxi (about 3,000 rubles) or by bus - the cost is 6 euros (about 450 rubles). </p><p>  When you get to the center, take a walk along the central square, visit the church of St. Andrew and Ambrose.  Next, decide what you value most.  If you are interested in the history of the city, if you like to visit castles and temples, then in this case you do not need to go far from the center - all the main attractions are located here. </p><p>  If you are a fan of modern entertainment, you need to travel a few stops by public transport to the port.  You can, of course, go on foot, fortunately, the distance is small, but the road passes through the dysfunctional area, where a large number of emigrants live, so tourists are not recommended to appear there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100waystochangetheworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The troubled area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGenoa" class="if uuid-2449422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449422.jpg"></div><p>  When you get to the port, be sure to admire its beauties, look at a copy of the pirate ship - a very interesting and free sight.  Visit the Maritime Museum, even if you are not a fan of this topic - European museums are much more interesting than domestic ones. </p><p>  There is also a thousand-year-old lighthouse famous throughout Italy, the history of which begins in 1128.  The height of this structure is 77 meters, it is an excellent viewing platform with a beautiful view of the city.  Another advantage of this attraction is that it is located right next to the Maritime Museum. </p><p>  In the surrounding area there are many cozy cafes and restaurants where you can have a tasty snack and relax after a walk.  After that, head to the botanical garden.  When all the main attractions will be visited, feel free to head to the aquarium and admire the marine life. </p><p>  If the issue with an overnight stay has not yet been resolved, do not worry, there are a lot of decent, in the opinion of experienced travelers, hostels and fairly inexpensive hotels in this area.  More expensive hotels are located in the central part of the city. </p><p>  Have you visited all the main attractions of Genoa?  San Remo is nearby - take it by train or bus.  This city has some of the best beaches in the country. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  As you already know, Genoa is one of the main port cities in Europe.  In ancient times, this place was one of the richest, every day influential merchants, politicians and other figures came here.  There were no hotels then, so the locals built very beautiful and large houses so that noble people paid attention to their home and decided to spend the night with them. </p><p>  Locals constantly competed with each other to make their home the most comfortable, roomy and beautiful on the outside.  It was on the facade that visitors chose where they would spend the night today.  Thus, the indigenous inhabitants of this city could make new profitable acquaintances with influential people from other countries.  For this reason, on the central streets of the city there are a lot of houses with magnificent architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100waystochangetheworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genoa central street" class="if uuid-2449421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2449421.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know the most popular attractions of Genoa.  This city is not very large, so you can get around it in just one day.  But if you want to study the history of the city in more detail, we strongly recommend staying here for 2-3 days and enjoy the contemplation of historical sites. </p>
