What attracts them primarily is the visa-free regime and the low cost of trips.  In addition, the flight takes only a few hours, and the excursion program when visiting the country can always be combined with a wellness stay.  The most famous resort city of Georgia is Borjomi, located in the south-west of the country.  A lot of hotels are open here, including for wealthy tourists.  If you want to improve your health and relax in the highest class, then pay attention to the Borjomi Palace sanatorium ("Borjomi Palace").  It is about this respectable hotel that we will describe in more detail in this article. </p><h2>  Hotel Details </h2><p>  First of all, Borjomi resort is famous for its mineral and mud springs, so tourists come here to improve their health and relax from the bustle of the city.  Almost all first-class complexes here are simultaneously sanatoriums.  The Borjomi Palace was no exception.  It is located in the central part of the city in a picturesque area.  A modern medical center has been opened on its territory. </p><p>  The complex occupies a historic building, the construction of which was completed in the 70s of the XIX century.  It is decorated in the classical Baroque style and its appearance is vaguely reminiscent of an ancient fortress towering on a hill.  It is noteworthy that once members of the imperial family were resting in the building.  The hotel has preserved the rooms in which they lived.  They were completely restored, while maintaining their original historical appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Territory view" class="if uuid-2963280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2963280.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel itself was opened in the building only in 2013, so do not think that it has an outdated and in need of repair rooms.  In addition, on the territory there are two buildings built in 2014-2015.  Borjomi Palace Hotel in Georgia offers its guests a total of 164 rooms, 42 of which are located in a historic building. </p><p>  The staff in the sanatorium is fluent in not only English, but also Russian.  The cost of accommodation, if desired, can include a set of medical services in the wellness center.  The hotel accepts tourists with children of any age, but pets are not allowed here.  As a rule, registration of guests starts from 14:00 local time. </p><h2>  Where is the sanatorium </h2><p>  In their reviews of the Borjomi Palace in Georgia, guests indicate that they liked the location of the complex.  It is located in the central part of the city, located on a small hill, so some rooms offer amazing views of the surroundings.  A lot of infrastructure facilities are open next to the hotel, including restaurants, cafes, bars and shops.  800 meters from the complex is the famous Mineral Water Park, where you can admire the natural beauty and enjoy the famous healing drinks that are produced in the city for free.  The park is approximately 1 km from the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Borjomi is located in a mountain gorge, therefore, if desired, tourists can combine a healthy holiday with an active one.
