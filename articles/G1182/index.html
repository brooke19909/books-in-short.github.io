Many employees understand the Russian language, so communication problems simply do not arise. </p><p>  Tourists speak well of the Rainbow Castle Hotel 3 * restaurant.  The food here is always fresh, and the chefs are trying to diversify the menu.  Nobody is hungry.  Despite some remoteness from the sea, the beach can easily be reached on foot.  An undoubted advantage is the low cost of living, especially considering the level of service.  Value for money at this hotel is just perfect. </p>
