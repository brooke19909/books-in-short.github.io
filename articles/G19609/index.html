  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami "Santa Claus"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Decorating a house for the holidays is a sweet and kind tradition that allows us to create high spirits for ourselves and our loved ones.  And the New Year is generally a special topic.  Unfortunately, recently <span>Christmas decorations</span> and toys are very expensive.  But in this case, hand made can easily save the situation.  You can easily make jewelry yourself.  How?  We suggest you put down the origami "Santa Claus", detailed instructions for the implementation of which will be provided in this article.  However, for starters, you better try to learn the basic techniques and terms of the technique of folding paper shapes.  For example, you need to know for sure that origami can be single and modular.  What does it mean?  In the first case, the figure is made from one solid sheet, in the second - from several.  Santa Claus from paper - origami, which will be performed in a modular manner.  That is, we will make several parts of different paper, and then glue them with glue.  So, you can use multi-colored paper, but you should make sure that the sheet on both sides is the same color.  Santa Claus from modules - origami, which will look very realistic. </p><p>  Let's proceed to the execution of the figures.  You must remember that Santa Claus has a white beard and collar.  And the coat and hat are red.  Therefore, to complete the origami "Santa Claus" you will need 1 white sheet, 5 red and 1 <span>flesh-colored</span> sheet <span>.</span> </p><p>  First, we make a face on the basis of faces for dolls.  On it you need to draw eyes and a <span>red nose.</span>  After that, we proceed to the implementation of the beard, collar and fur on the cap. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The coat of our Santa Claus will be made of paper with a perimeter of 24 centimeters.  We bend this sheet two times in half. </p><p>  Then you will need to deploy the top.  The left corner of this top must be turned to the right.  Then turn the workpiece face down.  After that, you will need to open the upper part to connect the lower and right corners.  And the left will just need to be connected to the right.  We do the same thing from behind. </p><p>  By the way, to make the figure more beautiful, and the angles perfectly even, you need to iron the part with an iron.  Turn the craft over, bend the corners to the center.  Then we bend each corner on ourselves.  In order to get a hand, you will need to bend the right wing of our figure.  The same thing needs to be done on the other hand to make the second. </p><p>  The face will be a circle with a diameter of 3 centimeters.  Glue it to the workpiece.  Just like a coat, we make <span>Santa Claus a hat.</span> </p><p>  You can make origami "Santa Claus" in another way.  This figure is more stylized as Santa Claus, so the coat will be blue.  But you can also make red if you wish.  The grandfather will turn out to be quite large, so a lot of paper will be required. </p><p>  To begin, add the standard triangular modules.  They should get 25 white.  We put them in three rows with a ring.  Then it will be necessary to make blue or red triangular modules - they should also be 25 each. They form a 4 circle. </p><p>  Father Frost's beard is white, so the 5th row will consist of three white triangles.  In the same row add 22 blue. </p><p>  Then you will need to increase the beard in width: add 4 white and, accordingly, 1 less blue.  Then we go in proportions - 5 and 20, 6 and 19. And so on until the 11th row.  At 11 you will need to place your mouth - this is one <span>red triangle.</span>  There should be 24 whites. </p><p>  Then you will need to make a hat for our Grandfather.  First we make 22 white triangles - this is the fur on the hat.  Then 20 blue ones, and then reduce again - 18, 16, etc.  Now you need to make hands.  These are 9 blue triangles and 3 white.  Combine white with blue, make a mitten. </p><p>  Sometimes there are difficulties with the face.  Origami "Santa Claus" can be decorated with paints, or you can cut out <span>facial features</span> from paper and stick to the figure.  You can also use eyes for soft toys: the pupils in them are somehow fun to roll over. </p>
