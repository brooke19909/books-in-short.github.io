As for nutrition, there is always a lot of food, so no one has ever remained hungry.  In addition, judging by the reviews, the cuisine here is very tasty.

Animators who try to make it fun were also praised. </p><p>  Some Russians were so pleased with their stay at the hotel that they did not even want to go on excursions.  The hotel, in their opinion, was so good that many did not want to return home. </p><p>  The only drawback is the beach, which is not always clean, and some did not like to go to it through the underpass.  But this, according to most guests, is not worth paying attention to.  But in ten minutes walk there is an excellent park with a playground where you can relax and take a picture.  Nearby is the local bazaar, which sells souvenirs and inexpensive clothes. </p>
