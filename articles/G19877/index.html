The contrasting combination of poverty and luxury, natural wonders and mountains of garbage makes you think about a lot.  Goa can be considered one of the most heavenly corners of India.  It is here that the Park Avenue Resort 2 * hotel is located, which also leaves a very mixed impression among tourists. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Park Avenue Resort 2 * is a miniature hotel, which is located near the famous Calangute Beach along the highway of the same name.  The hotel is quite far from the main transport links.  To get to Dabolim International Airport, you will have to overcome 45 kilometers, to Tivim Train Station - 20, and Mapus Bus Station - 8 km.  The sea coast from the hotel is only 500 meters.  In addition, within walking distance from the hotel there are many infrastructure objects: shops, cafes, restaurants, clubs. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Externally, the Resort Park Avenue Calangute 2 * hotel looks rather modest, and the equipment of its rooms at the first glance at it disheartens.  Nevertheless, tourists have long been fond of this hotel, because it is located in the most advantageous place of the city of Calangute - in terms of accessibility of infrastructure facilities.  In addition, it is worth noting the fact that the owners of the hotel care about the development of its service.  There is a cafe, bar, laundry, library, tour desk and many more things that are so necessary for tourists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  <span>Park</span> Avenue Resort 2 * <span>hotel</span> offers its guests one of 60 rooms, which are located in 5 small buildings.  It is worth saying that all rooms can be classified as double standard, although judging by the reviews of tourists, many of the rooms do not even reach the economy class. </p><p>  Each room is equipped with a TV, a bathroom, and a minibar.  Some rooms also have air conditioning and a private balcony, however, and such accommodation will cost a little more. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  The unsightly view of the Park Avenue Resort 2 hotel * owners and staff are trying as they can to compensate for the wide range of services provided to tourists.  So, the service available at the hotel includes: </p><ul><li>  the ability to deliver drinks and food directly to your room; </li><li>  dry cleaning and laundry services, as well as ironing of customers' clothes; </li><li>  it is possible to rent a car relatively cheaply; </li><li>  there is a left-luggage office where it is possible to hand over bulky suitcases; </li><li>  there is a tour desk where you can get advice and book a trip to the main attractions of Goa with an experienced guide; </li><li>  the reception is open around the clock where tourists can get answers to their questions; </li><li>  there is a library where a huge collection of literature in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world is collected; </li><li>  there is also the opportunity to visit a beauty salon, where you can provide basic hairdressing services; </li><li>  to get access to using wireless Internet, you will have to upload 100 rupees per day - about 100 Russian rubles. </li></ul>

    <h2>  For those traveling with children </h2><p>  Due to its specific characteristics, India is not the best place to travel with children.  Nevertheless, for those who even take their kids with them on a long trip, Resort Park Avenue Hotel tries to create the most comfortable conditions.  So, if you come to Goa with children, then you should know the following features of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  The hotel allows children with absolutely any age (even the smallest). </li><li>  If you arrived at the hotel with a child under the age of 6 years and you do not need an extra bed for him, then you will not have to pay for it. </li><li>  If you need an extra bed, then be prepared that for it you will have to lay out 300 rupees per night. </li><li>  It is not allowed to add more than one bed in each room.  This is due to the fact that the dimensions of the room simply do not allow to exceed the established limit. </li><li>  There are no cots provided by the hotel by default.  In some cases, such a service is possible if the agreement is made in advance (still at the stage of booking). </li><li>  Even if you have agreed in advance on the need for extra beds or cots, the initial payment will only be charged for standard room equipment.  For everything else, you will have to pay on arrival at the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Already many tourists managed to visit the Resort Park Avenue 2 * hotel.  Reviews about him are rather mixed.  Among the positive aspects, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  the efforts of the hotel staff and management to create the most complete infrastructure for their customers; </li><li>  friendly attitude of hotel workers towards tourists; </li><li>  convenient location where all the main attractions are within walking distance; </li><li>  round-the-clock supply of hot water; </li><li>  delicious homemade breakfasts; </li><li>  affordable price; </li><li>  well maintained clean area. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, you can find negative reviews that note the following points: </p><ul><li>  The hotel staff speaks only Hindi and English; </li><li>  you cannot come with a pet; </li><li>  the hotel is practically unsuitable for children; </li><li>  gray linen (sometimes dirty); </li><li>  very high noise levels in and around the hotel; </li><li>  poor condition of the rooms (old furniture and lack of repair); </li><li>  the dominance of insects and lizards; </li><li>  in many rooms the kitchen is locked; </li><li>  valuables are dangerous to leave in the room. </li></ul><p>  Hotel "Resort Park Avenue 2 *" (North <span>Goa, Calangute)</span> is a rather ambiguous place that can cause completely different feelings and impressions.  We can only say with confidence that this hotel is not suitable for lovers of a comfortable stay on the All-Inclusive system.  Picky tourists who come to India to get an unforgettable experience of local color and attractions stop here. </p>
