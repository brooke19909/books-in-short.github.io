However, the greatest interest is caused by the houses in which real people lived and worked.  One of such magnificent historical buildings that we inherited is the English courtyard at Varvarka. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.75234409999999" data-lng="37.62696110000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/5/7/17857.png"></div><h2>  Medieval building history </h2><p>  The history of the courtyard began in the fifteenth century, when a certain Ivan Bobrishchev, the king‚Äôs prisoner, built a small house.  After his death, the building passed to the state, since the owner of the house did not leave any heirs and did not bequeath the house to anyone. </p><p>  In 1556, the then reigning formidable Tsar Ivan decided to establish trade relations with Europe.  Three years earlier, British navigator Richard Chansler discovered the so-called Northern Sea Route.  This path connects Russia and England.  One of the first decrees of Ivan the Terrible was to provide British citizens with all trade privileges and privileges in all Russian cities.  Thanks to a favorable trade agreement, Russian merchants delivered furs, hemp, wood and wax to England, and in return received lead, gunpowder, cloth and tin ware of outlandish coinage.  For the English sales office was allocated a house, which is now located in Zaryadye.  Over time, British trade in Russia grew so much that in almost every city, English merchants had their own representative offices.  But the story of the Old English Court does not end there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="raven-yellow.livejournal.com" data-author=": raven_yellow, "><img itemprop="image" alt="English courtyard on Varvarka" class="if uuid-3234759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234759.jpg"></div><h2>  Recent story </h2><p>  Warm trade relations between Russia and England abruptly ended in 1649.  The English king Charles the First was executed, and this led the relations of the two countries into a deep political and diplomatic crisis.  Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, who was then on the throne, ordered all British trade missions to be expelled from the country.  The English court passed to the boyar Miloslavsky, a relative of the tsar, who owned the building for twenty years.  After his death, the chambers again transferred to the state treasury. </p><p>  Tsar Peter organized the first Arithmetic School in the English Court, then for a long time the chambers were in private hands.  During this period, the number of outbuildings increased, the house itself underwent reconstruction and reconstruction many times, as a result of which the original elements of the decor and foundation almost disappeared.  In the mid-20th century, the architect Pyotr Baranovsky, who directed the demolition of old buildings for the construction of the Stalinist skyscraper, discovered the historical foundation and defended its significance in the highest circles of power.  The English courtyard has turned into a historical museum.  During its opening on October 18, 1994, Queen Elizabeth II of England and her husband visited Moscow and became honored guests of the ceremony. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="35photo.pro" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of Varvarka" class="if uuid-3234761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234761.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you do not know how to get to the Old English Court, then Red Square should serve as a guide: </p><ol><li>  The first way.  Get by metro to the Okhotny Ryad station or Ploshchad Revolyutsii.  Go through the Resurrection Gate, the arch at the chapel, go out to Red Square.  Next, keep the path along the GUM.  Without turning anywhere, you get to a traffic light.  There will be a street on your left.  This is Varvarka street, on which the object is located. </li><li>  The second way.  You need to leave at the metro station Kitay Gorod and turn onto Varvarka Street, which starts immediately at the exit of the metro.  The exact address of the English House is 4a Varvarka Street. </li></ol><p>  It is best to walk or rent a bike if you walk in old Moscow in the summer or fall, as there are always traffic jams in the center of the capital, and it is always a pleasure to walk around historic places.  Opening hours - from 11.00 to 20.00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.babyblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="English courtyard" class="if uuid-3234756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234756.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  The English courtyard in Moscow is not only a historical architectural structure.  The walls of the building hide unique instances of not only the device of Russian and English life of those times.  Among the exhibits you can find items related to trade and maritime affairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The interior of the English Court was recreated according to documentary sources, and during the reconstruction all the rules were strictly observed.  Inside you can find a stove, which was used to heat the room, an oak table with writing utensils.  Ancient navigational charts are hung or mounted on special pedestals along the walls, on which you can see all the parts that were applied to them, known at that time. </p><p>  Among the exhibits there are items related to trade.  Barrels carrying wheat, gunpowder, corned beef, tin dishes, weapons and even harpoons for catching large sea fish.  The museum provides guided tours for adults and children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.4-sezona-tour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tour scene" class="if uuid-3234755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234755.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's excursions </h2><p>  Excursions in Moscow are one of the most popular types of leisure.  There are also in the Old Courtyard.  The English Courtyard Museum is on the list of cultural education leaders.  A popular excursion is "Tales of a Foreign Merchant".  Together with children under 17 years old, the heroes of that era in appropriate costumes walk around the halls, listen to stories and legends, and are completely immersed in the world of English life. </p><p>  The minimum age for children to visit old English excursions in Moscow is eleven years, since young children are not able to perceive and consciously perceive historical information, albeit in the most light and interesting form.  Individual tours are not available.  To visit the school group, you must pre-submit an application indicating the exact number of people and time of arrival.  One adult accompanying person is allowed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="master-class24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="household items" class="if uuid-3234754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234754.jpg"></div><h2>  Navigation school and merchants </h2><p>  On the territory of the museum there is a wonderful historical game, or, as it is commonly called, a quest.  Museum workers and guides provide the participants with real tools, talk about their purpose and offer children to try themselves in the role of sailors.  Children are trying to calculate the sea route, use astrolabe, with its help determine the coordinates of the ship. </p><p>  Another interesting lesson will be the study of merchant affairs.  Trade, in modern terms.  Children themselves will try to calculate the amount of goods, put the goods in barrels, write a cover letter. </p><h2>  Walking tours </h2><p>  For adults, there are interesting walking tours throughout the English Court.  Moving from building to building, guides tell interesting stories that have accumulated at this architectural pearl for nearly 500 years.  Sightseeing tour, a journey through the old house, the secrets of the ancient chambers of Moscow - all this will tell and show the employees of the museum complex.  Walking tours last one hour.  This time is enough to fully immerse yourself in the era of the emergence of Russian-British trade relations, to feel the charm of old life and, of course, enjoy magnificent views of the historic Varvarka Street and the new Zaryadye park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="panorama of Varvarka" class="if uuid-3234767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234767.jpg"></div><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Those who happened to visit one of the oldest and most interesting museums in Moscow say that they are happy with such a fruitful time.  What tour guides and guides say is not to be found in ordinary school books on history and geography.  The exhibits carefully kept by the caretakers of the museum complex are impressive.  Inside there is a small trading shop where you can buy gifts and souvenirs to relatives, friends and yourself, of course.  Tourists also like the location of the object: there is no need to spend time and money on additional transport, everything is within walking distance from the main attractions of Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radiovera.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old barbarian" class="if uuid-3234771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3234771.jpg"></div><p>  You can safely come here with children, they say reviews about the museum of the Old English Court.  If the walk is very tired, you can sit on a bench in the shade of trees and shrubs, restore your strength in a small cozy cafe, designed for an average excursion group. </p><p>  Satisfied with the views of old Moscow, it is enough to turn one hundred and eighty degrees, and in front of the tourists there is a high-tech, modern Zaryadye park. </p>
