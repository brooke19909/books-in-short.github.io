Cost and Features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Collecting coins</span> is not just a way of earning money, but an opportunity to touch a piece of history.  Each of them has its own peculiarities, which surprise both connoisseurs and ordinary inhabitants. </p><h2>  Tsarism </h2><p>  Over the long reign of the monarchs, a huge amount of money was released, there were ordinary copper, interesting silver specimens, and, of course, the majestic gold representatives of the past.  A lot of reforms took place during the tsarist period, so some coins were also made from alloys. </p><p>  Issued in one year, the currency varied in the mass of details.  So, money of a similar denomination was distinguished by the place of coinage or the presence of a special marriage of the mint. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  Simple coins of the Russian Empire made of copper are not the most popular goods.  However, everything depends on many factors. </p><p>  The main cost-raising item is the minting yard.  Sometimes, depending on the minting yard, the price of a coin rises to amazing heights.  For example, a penny released in 1711 can cost from six to ten thousand rubles.  This difference in value appeared due to the place of coinage. </p><p>  However, the main factor for the coin of the Russian Empire is its safety.  That state will be the main point for the sale of such <span>an antique product.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver coins of the Russian Empire" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39041/1004370.jpg" width="600"></div>

Do not find a collector who will not appreciate the <span>silver coins of the</span> Russian Empire.  Products made from this material have a cost ranging from several rubles to hundreds of thousands. </p><p>  Without a doubt, silver products are incredibly popular and very much appreciated.  Of course, a bad state will lower the cost, but imperial silver is just a godsend for numismatists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins of the Russian Empire photo" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39041/1004363.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Next come the more rare coins of the Russian Empire made of gold.  The cost of some representatives reaches several hundred thousand.  However, adding such a coin to your collection is incredibly difficult.  And the problem is not the price, but the complexity of the search, because such gold is a rarity. </p><h2>  Where to sell? </h2>

    <p>  Having coins of the Russian Empire, one should not expect any special difficulties in marketing.  Such a product is in demand and will bring a large and quick income.  The main difficulty will be to choose a suitable point of sale. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most natural selling point is to find a numismatist club.  Similar groups can be found in many large cities.  In such a place, money is able to appreciate and make an advantageous offer. </p><p>  A simpler, but somewhat unprofitable place to sell will be shops that accept antiques.  The disadvantages of this option is that a very expensive copy may not be bought.  In addition, the proposed price in such an institution will be slightly lower than the real cost. </p><h2>  Online Sales </h2>

    <p>  You can sell money without difficulty using the Internet.  In fact, this will be one of the best ways to sell a coin. </p><p>  The best option would be to put coins of the Russian Empire at auction.  But this method will take a lot of time.  It is at the auction that you can get the real value of the royal currency. </p><p>  This method has tangible disadvantages.  In addition to the duration of the auction, there are difficulties with the delivery of goods.  In addition, the winner may refuse to redeem the lot.  As a result, the time allotted for trading was lost. </p><p>  A more compromise solution would be selling on specialized sites created to buy up coins of the Russian Empire.  The photo of the lot will need to be sent to the buyer's site, where it will be evaluated.  After that, the seller will be offered a price at which the site is ready to buy the goods. </p><p>  The disadvantage of this way is that the cost is significantly underestimated, and the seller will lose a significant amount on a truly valuable specimen. </p><p>  An easier way to sell a valuable copy is to advertise on social networks and on message boards. </p><h2>  Fakes </h2><p>  When buying rare money, you should be extremely careful: there is a high probability of getting a regular modern copy instead of a rare instance. </p><p>  When buying, it is worth examining the order in detail, it is advisable to compare with the original, if it is available.  Particular attention should be paid to the herd, to study the features of coinage and the initials of the Mitzmaster. </p><p>  Very often, fakes differ in small fragments, so you need to check the goods thoroughly.  Copies of the worst quality can be recognized by color, usually in such coins it is more prone to metal in color. </p><p>  The highest quality fakes are created using the same material, and sometimes they even undergo artificial aging.  Such copies are incredibly difficult to distinguish by eye, but this is very rare and only in really <span>expensive coins.</span> </p><p>  Exposing a fake can only be done with the help of special expertise. </p><p>  You need to purchase antiques in proven places with an established reputation in order to avoid fraud. </p>
