It stretches from the city of Marseille to the very border with Italy.  This region has very beautiful landscapes, a clean Mediterranean Sea, with its many bays, but most importantly - it is here that the most luxurious hotels and penthouses are built.  That is why this resort has become a favorite vacation spot for the wealthiest people, movie stars and show business from around the globe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="French Riviera" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/229802.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This region is a place where the cultures of such wonderful countries as Italy and France have mixed.  <span>The Cote d'Azur, the</span> prices of vacations in which are higher than in other regions of Europe, is primarily famous for a variety of resorts.  Among these, it is worth noting St. Tropez, Antibes, Nice, Cannes, Juan-les-Pins, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and Menton.  However, among the recreation areas that are located on this coast, it is also worth mentioning the tiny <span>state of Monaco.</span> </p><p>  The French Riviera is a resort that only makes sense to visit in the summer.  The beach season here begins in April and ends in October.  In the remaining months, the air temperature here may drop to +7 degrees Celsius, and with it the sea cools.  In the swimming season, it‚Äôs not as stuffy here as in Asian countries, which is why the French Riviera is considered one of the most elite and acceptable recreation areas in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="france cote d'azur prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/229801.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, their width is not so great - about 40 meters.  In Nice, the sea coast is already covered with pebbles, however, for the comfort of tourists there are many loose sandy beaches.  All other resorts that stretch all the way to the border with Italy are also pebbled.  Therefore, one of the universal and multifaceted resorts is considered to be the French Riviera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cote d'azur france photo" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/229800.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <p>  Photos, souvenirs and inexhaustible memories - such a bouquet is most often brought by everyone who has ever visited this paradise.  And in order for your vacation to be as positive as possible for you, you should decide on a resort in advance.  As a rule, all the stars and oligarchs gather in St. Tropez.  Therefore, it is from there that you can bring the largest photo archive, which will be a whole year to remind you of the enchanting time that you spent in France.  Juan-les-Pins is the epicenter of restaurants, bars, nightclubs and casinos.  Therefore, if there is a desire to lower all vacation pay and to the full extent come off, then welcome to this noisy resort.  But you can spend a quiet and mysterious vacation in Antibes, visiting its many museums, exhibitions and pacing around the ancient palaces. </p><p>  It is important to remember that the French Riviera is closely bordered by Italy, so you always have the opportunity to look into this country for at least one day.  Most often, the guests of the descendants of the ancient Romans are those tourists who stayed in Menton.  This city has best absorbed the traditions of both France and Italy.  And while relaxing there, you can simultaneously visit two countries, study their history and customs, and, of course, enjoy the warm sea and first-class wine. </p>
