It offers a restaurant, an outdoor pool, and parking and Wi-Fi (free).  Many tourists consider the Kamala Resort Spa one of the best options they have chosen for their vacation. </p><h2>  Kamala Beach </h2><p>  Kamala (Phuket) is a beach on the resort island, which may appeal primarily to lovers of measured, calm and inexpensive relaxation.  The cost of living in a hotel here is much lower than in Karon Beach or Patong.  The coastline is about 2 km.  This significantly exceeds the length of coastlines on other popular beaches in Phuket. </p>

    <p>  In general, Kamala (Phuket) is a kind of village.  So, if Patong can already be compared with Pattaya, then here the development is still, one might say, in its infancy.  This is partly due to the tsunami that occurred in 2004.  The whole island turned out to be affected, but most of all went to Kamala beach. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the beach is quite spacious and long, this, of course, captivates many.  There is no such crush that can be seen on Patong.  Many people like the relative few people and the tranquility of Kamala Beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  One of the main features of Kamala Beach is the Phuket Fantasea (Fantasy show) held here.  This is an amazing performance, based on the story of Prince Kamala.  The show is incredibly colorful, it is distinguished by the use of unusual beautiful costumes, the participation of illusionists, acrobats and clowns.  But the main feature of the performance are elephants who are actively involved in the performance and amuse the audience. </p><p>  It should be noted that Russian tourists are practically absent here.  Rest here is more suitable for older people and couples with children.  Undoubtedly, Kamala will be comfortable for those who do not like noise and vanity. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Kamala Beach is accessible from any of Phuket's popular beaches.  If you discard the option with your own bike or taxi, you can use the shuttle bus that runs along the route to Kamala from Phuket Town.  In general, several types of bus routes are provided here, with the help of which popular beaches are connected. </p><p>  If traveling from the city, you should take a bus to Ranong Market and follow to the final stop.  The fare is 40 baht (71.20 rubles) per person.  This is a bit more expensive than other beaches, but the distance from the city to Kamalu is somewhat longer. </p><p>  Experienced travelers advise tourists, returning home from the beach, to walk along the road up several hundred meters.  Here you can find a wonderful place for memorable photos, similar to the observation deck.  It offers a stunning view. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach description </h2><p>  About the water, sand and the degree of cleanliness on the territory, tourists who choose Kamala beach for relaxation, speak favorably.  Here, in their opinion, everything is quite acceptable.  They note a huge aground, because of which those who want to swim at low tide have to go very far from the coast. </p><p>  When the sea is restless and there are big waves, sand rises from the bottom.  Some might think that the water is dirty, but this is by no means the case, knowledgeable tourists say.  Nevertheless, it is unlikely to see the fish at such a time. </p><h2>  Where can I eat? </h2><p>  As elsewhere in such places, there are many cafes throughout the coastline.  The cost of food is average in Phuket.  Together, you can eat well for about 150-200 baht (267‚Äì356 rubles).  You can also have a snack on the beach with sweet corn, which can be prepared here on the grill. </p><h2>  Kamala Beach: which hotel to choose? </h2><p>  Although the infrastructure of Kamala Beach is far from ideal, as many believe, still there are plenty of hotels here.  Especially popular is Novotel, located its comfortable houses directly on the seashore. </p><p>  The cost of rest here is not cheap: from 5000 baht (890 rubles) per day.  This is understandable: such a price is justified by the location directly on the sea itself.  There are also Andara Resort Villas, luxury villas, the price of which starts at 32,000 baht (56,960 rubles) per day! </p><p>  Kamala Beach also has many small hotels and guest houses.  If desired, you can stay in one of them. </p><p>  Those who plan a long vacation (from 2 months), it makes sense to rent a town house.  It is a spacious cabin with many amenities, including a swimming pool.  In Kamala, unlike Patong, where everything is becoming more expensive, such housing, according to tourists, can be found for 20,000 baht (35,600 rubles) per month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A fairly wide selection of accommodation provides vacationers Kamala Beach.  Kamala Resort and Spa 3 * is one of the most popular hotels. </p>

    <p>  One of the best options for accommodation is called Kamalu (resort spa hotel).  The hotel, according to vacationers, is consistent with its category.  The reception staff is friendly, housekeeping is daily, the hotel has a swimming pool, spa.  It offers free parking, a restaurant, Wi-Fi (free). </p><p>  Amenities include a balcony, air conditioning, a TV (flat screen), a private bathroom and a seating area.  Guests have the opportunity to stay in family rooms. </p><p>  The hotel, as indicated in the advertisement, has a reception desk (around the clock), food and drinks are delivered to the rooms.  You can also request a shuttle service, tour desk, laundry. </p><p>  Loved the location of Kamala Resort.  It is absolutely quiet here, vacationers share, there are no crowds of passers-by, as in other places. </p><p>  Nearby there is a market and a large supermarket with reasonable prices, which is especially relevant when going to the beach, because there is no need to overpay twice (prices are more expensive on the beach). </p><p>  Vacationers consider their spaciousness as a special advantage of the rooms, as well as large windows from the floor to the ceiling, which give the room a special charm. </p>

    <h2>  About the disadvantages </h2><p>  The disadvantages of the hotel include the fact that the pool is a lot of local people.  Floors, according to some vacationers, are poorly washed here.  And, which may be important for ladies, the rooms do not have full-length mirrors (all the size to the chest). </p><p>  In addition, vacationers are asked to take into account that, contrary to advertising, there are no cafes and restaurants in the territory. </p><p>  Unfortunately for many vacationers, there is no direct communication between the buildings, so you have to get to the reception on the roadway, through the pool or take the elevator.  Overcoming such a path with children is not very convenient, the authors of reviews share. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel itself is located on a hill.  This should be considered for those who do not plan to use the shuttle bass. </p><p>  And yet, all who have left their feedback about him are mostly speaking positively about Kamal.  Phuket will long remain in the minds of tourists a pleasant, beautiful memory. </p>
