  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rules for the purchase of real estate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  First of all, I want to say that the most reliable way to buy an apartment is through real estate agencies.  Professionals have more information both in terms of transaction security, and in terms of the market and market prices for apartments.  But there is one significant minus in the execution of a transaction through an agency - the payment for professional services.  That is why we will consider the basic rules that should be followed when independently finding and buying real estate. <br>  Search for real estate. <br>  It is best to buy property from friends or acquaintances.  Naturally, not everyone has such friends, so there are two more options: placing ads and searching for ads.  First option: write the ad text you need, for example, “ <noindex>  <span>residential and commercial real estate in Syktyvkar</span> </noindex>  "Then post it on the Internet, in newspapers and so on.  The second option: go to the Internet and read the relevant ads on various resources. <br>  Real estate seller. <br>  When purchasing an apartment from the developer, you need to collect the maximum amount of information about it and make sure its reliability.  Find out what time this company works in the construction market, read reviews about the quality and compliance with the deadlines.  You should also request some documents proving the legality and professionalism of the works performed by the developer. <br>  In cases where real estate is purchased from an individual, you will also have to collect information, but already about the owners of the property.  Find out how many people are registered in this housing, make sure that they are all discharged by the time the money is transferred, as well as in their legal capacity.  If one of the owners of the apartment is incompetent, then you need to get an official document from the guardian of this person confirming his consent.  Otherwise, such a transaction may be terminated in court. <br>  Payment. <br>  Be especially careful when inspecting the property and its surroundings.  If you find any shortcomings, do not immediately refuse to buy it.  Remember that even very small defects can cause a price reduction. <br>  You should not transfer or transfer money to the seller’s account before you receive the documents.  In addition, along with the documents, you should immediately ask for the keys to the apartment, as this moment can also present some unpleasant moments.  The time for transferring money also applies to those cases when you prefer to work with agencies, as this moment will be your protection against certain types of fraud. </p></div></article>
