    <p>  The origin of Easter is Old Testament.  In the Jewish tradition, the dog is marked by the slaughter of a lamb, which was eaten in memory of the times of exodus from Egypt.  It is possible that this holiday existed even in the pre-Mosaic days, but finally acquired its significance after the Jews were expelled by the pharaoh and left their homes in a hurry.  The Jews were saved, which was facilitated by the wondrous divine interventions, because the people could die in the barren desert, pursued by hordes of enemies, but this did not happen.  The haste of flight was reflected in another Jewish holiday.  Unleavened bread was celebrated the day after Passover.  The meaning of this holiday was that the sons and daughters of Israel carried with them into exile the still not sour dough. </p><p>  Thus, the origin of Easter is associated with deliverance from excruciating bodily death and bondage.  By Jews, it was traditionally celebrated in the family circle, at night, during the full moon at the <span>spring equinox.</span>  The astronomical determination of the date of Easter prescribes marking it on the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan, before the captivity, called Aviv. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter holiday" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/148083.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ritual of Passover has evolved over the centuries and acquired new features.  After the introduction of Deuteronomy, he ceased to be family and began to be celebrated in the temple.  The lamb was slaughtered on the altar, and his blood was no longer stained with the <span>doorposts</span> and canopies of the tents, but with the altar.  The main characters in the sacrifice ceremony are Levites and priests.  Easter was the main holiday in which all the Jews were obliged to take part.  Affirming the divine origin of Easter, the Hebrew priests strengthened their position in public life and contributed to the establishment of Israeli statehood. </p><p>  Christians around the world celebrate the Resurrection of the Lord as the day of their spiritual salvation.  On <span>Good Friday,</span> Jesus, who gave the New Commandment to the world, was executed, and on the night of Saturday on the first day of the week he was resurrected.  The sacrifice offered by the son of God became atoning.  <span>As a holiday, Easter</span> acquired a new meaning.  Jesus took part in the Jewish rite of Passover, called the <span>Last Supper.</span>  However, instead of the traditional praise of Hallel, He pronounces completely different words.  Instead of the lamb, he offers to eat His flesh and blood.  That was the first Eucharist.  Since that time, believers receive communion, making a bloodless sacrifice. </p>

The body of Christ symbolizes bread, and His blood is wine.  Instead of the Messiah expected by the Jews, designed to save the Jewish people from suffering, a new Savior of all mankind came with the commandment “Love one another,” and he opposed vengeance (eye for eye) with forgiveness.

    <p>  Saint Seraphim of Sarov greeted the people he met all year round in Easter: “Christ is risen, my joy!”  By this he made it clear that the Resurrection of the Lord is not immediate, it is eternal, and there is no end to it. </p>
