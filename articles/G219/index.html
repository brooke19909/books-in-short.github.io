  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Knight Tournaments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A special entertainment of the nobility of the XI-XVI centuries was a jousting tournament.  And although it was created to train military qualities and demonstrate the ability of a knight, the tournament often turned into a fun sight with elements of a theatrical performance.  The authors of many works glorify the heroes who obtained the location of ladies through battles.  Educated, respectful in dealing with ladies men at tournaments turned into cruel warriors who rushed at rivals without fear of anything. </p><div class="photo" data-original="clipart-library.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The appearance of a knight" class="if uuid-2291699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2291699.jpg"></div><h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  The homeland of heroes chained to steel is France.  In this country, strong and hardy warriors were given special attention, and high-quality weapons were worth its weight in gold.  Choosing a good horse for a knightly tournament guaranteed half the success of the fight.  Geoffrey de Preilly formulated the rules for pre-existing battles and made the process attractive to princes, dukes and barons.  At one of the tournaments he was killed by a more agile opponent, guided by his own rules. </p><p>  Geoffrey ruled that a knight tournament needed an excuse: a prisoner of peace, a newborn firstborn, a wedding or a <span>holiday.</span>  The instigator (the organizer of the event) summoned a defender to the battle, who was to become an opponent.  This was all done very decently, in a polite manner.  The opponent was presented with honors with a beautifully issued letter calling him to the tournament.  The future rival could accept it, having sent for their part the competition of judges, but he could have refused, citing any valid reasons.  If an agreement was reached, preparations for the tournament began.  The place had to be chosen wisely.  A large glade near a large city could become a venue.  She was fenced with a wooden fence.  After this, benches and an arena were prepared. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temporary town </h2><p>  For the time of the knightly tournament, an independent settlement appeared, because spectators gathered at the tournament from many regions of the country.  Not everyone wanted to rent a house in the city.  Many were satisfied with temporary tents.  They were installed near the venue of the tournament.  Since everyone needed to eat, merchants arrived there with food and water, jewelry, clothes, as well as <span>knight's outfits.</span>  In addition, all the feudal lords sought to take more servants to show their greatness.  Therefore, the temporary campground turned into a real small town. </p><p>  In addition, the knightly tournament was a kind of fashion show, because both the participants and the audience sought to dress very beautifully.  The rules of the tournament stipulated that only a nobleman, in whose family there were four generations of noble ancestors, could participate in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stivesmedievalfaire.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knight Tournament. Scenario" class="if uuid-2291703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2291703.jpg"></div><h2>  Planned to the smallest detail </h2><p>  The script of the knightly tournament in color could be compared with a theatrical performance.  At first, upon the arrival of all the judges and the two founders of the tournament, their emblems were hung out: at the top - the instigator and defender, and below - the judges.  Then, the banners of the participants were checked to allow participation in the tournament.  In the evening, to familiarize the girls with the participants, <span>knight helmets</span> were displayed <span>!</span>  The ladies examined them with interest.  If any knight had the imprudence to offend the lady, she could touch his helmet.  Based on this, the knight was removed from the tournament.  In the evening, dancing was organized. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next morning, everyone gathered for mass and swore an oath.  The church was initially opposed to such cruel games, but when they began to use blunt spears with tips, the clergy calmed down.  On the basis of such ornate rules and lists were held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bradburyphoto.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can participate only to noble nobles." class="if uuid-2291707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2291707.jpg"></div><h2>  Knight Tournament.  The game </h2><p>  The game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which is quite attractive in its prefecture, perfectly describes the small details of the life of heroes on horseback.  Guillaume is a warrior who came to a knightly tournament for his beloved.  To make feats for her sake becomes the meaning of his life, but the girl is not happy about this turn of events.  Having met Herold (the witcher), the knight asks for help from a friend.  Already experienced in battle, the witcher again helps Guillaume to win. </p><p>  The Witcher gives a description of the knightly tournament in a very colorful way, because it is precisely such details that make this story alive.  The very conduct of battles in the game has fairly simple rules: the hero is given three spears.  He can fight until they are broken.  Serious wounds or death means losing.  A more recent innovation was the introduction of glasses.  They are given for hitting the enemy‚Äôs helmet with a spear, in the bib, or for the warrior being able to knock an opponent out of the saddle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapersite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knight Guillaume in The Witcher" class="if uuid-2291715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2291715.jpg"></div><h2>  Tournaments these days </h2><p>  Now many forgotten traditions are being revived.  A vivid example of this is the knightly tournament in Vyborg.  This event is gaining in popularity.  The organizers are trying to recreate the fights that took place more than 500 years ago, with maximum accuracy.  For example, if in the 13th century the helmet was supposed to weigh 5 kg, then in a modern tournament it will be the same.  Much attention is also paid to the design of competitions, heraldry, clothing, ceremonial. </p><p>  However, not everyone agrees on this.  In 2017, an unexpected incident occurred that called into question the further holding of tournaments.  The city authorities were offended by the fact that no one asked them permission to reconstruct the competitions of the Middle Ages, and the knights themselves are quite quick-tempered people.  Tournament management now has to deal with accusations against participants, as well as paperwork. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconstruction of events in Vyborg." class="if uuid-2291712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2291712.jpg"></div><h2>  Heritage </h2><p>  Thanks to the beauty of battles, knightly tournaments entered the cinema, perfectly complementing the plot.  We present to your attention films created on the theme of chivalry, although some of them do not even mention the exploits: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThe Hobbit,‚Äù in parallel with it, ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings.‚Äù </li><li>  "How to Train Your Dragon." </li><li>  Star Warriors are all parts. </li><li>  "The story of a knight." </li><li>  "The gate of the warriors." </li><li>  "Troy." </li></ul><p>  Literature enthusiasts are especially good at representing this era and will not limit themselves to films alone.  It is pleasant to realize that even now many men adhere to the traditions of chivalry.  They achieve their goals in a fair and honest way, politely treat girls, and fail in critical situations.  Knightly tournaments left a remarkable mark in history, clearly showing what a hero should be like. </p>
