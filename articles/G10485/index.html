That's just about such a device, we would like to talk today.  Meet: this is the Oysters T72HM 3G tablet.  As noted in the description provided on the website of the online store where it is sold, this device is intended for use by drivers as a GPS navigator. </p><p>  About how well the device copes with this task, as well as in more detail about its characteristics, we will tell in this article.

    <h2>  Oysters T72HM 3G: appearance </h2><p>  Traditionally, it is customary to describe any electronic gadget, starting with its appearance.  So, at least, we can present the design of the tablet, the way it is outside.  Regarding this issue, it should be said that the device looks like we have before us a typical inexpensive <span>Chinese tablet.</span>  At least, its front side clearly testifies to this. </p><p>  Moreover, on the reverse side, the device looks more attractive, since the entire surface of its back is divided into three sections, the middle of which is made of metal.  This gives additional effect to the overall style of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The inserts in the model‚Äôs case slightly improve the overall design, conveying to him the ‚Äúhigh-cost effect‚Äù inherent in higher-class models.  At the same time, if you look closely, the Oysters T72HM 3G tablet does not belong to this.  With a gadget cost of 2.5 thousand rubles (excluding the cost of mobile services) there is nothing surprising in this.  Obviously, the developer saved as much as possible on all components. </p><h2>  Gadget kit </h2><p>  In addition to a brief description of the appearance, I would like to draw attention to the set in which the Oysters T72HM 3G is offered in the Megafon store.  So, since this is a <span>car tablet, it is</span> expected that the developers equipped it with a cord for charging from a car battery (through the connection to the ‚Äúcigarette lighter‚Äù).  Therefore, such a cable comes in a standard set with the device. </p>

    <p>  In addition, speaking of software, it is important to note the presence of an additional package of navigation charts.  With them, the driver will be able to navigate the terrain, because it is a navigator.  The device comes with such kits as Yandex.Navigator and Yandex.Maps.  Obviously, Megafon (the company selling the device in its stores) has some agreements with the software developer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to what was mentioned above, the tablet also includes a design for mounting it in a car.  This is relevant, since everyone knows the problem of how to fix the navigator screen in the most convenient position. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Next, I would like to characterize the display of the device - the most significant element in the tablet.  Since our version of the gadget, as already noted above, was assembled taking into account the maximum savings, you should not expect high quality ‚Äúpictures‚Äù on its screen.  On the contrary, the image here is more of a ‚Äúbudget" character, and the developers do not hide this.  In addition to its not the highest definition (with a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels) and a 7-inch display, one can also note its low brightness from the negative side, which complicates the working conditions and interaction with it.  According to <span>reviews, Oysters T72HM 3G</span> is a kind of ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù (in terms of damage) device.  So, if you break the screen, thinking about replacing is pointless, since the cost of repair exceeds the total price of the device.  In this case, it is easier to throw out a non-working device and purchase a new gadget. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The main ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device, its <span>MediaTek MT8132C processor,</span> has a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  In total, two cores interact in the module. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, the Mali-400 graphics accelerator, which is also responsible for drawing the picture, can also be noted. </p><p>  In general, analyzing these indicators, we can call the reviews true: the Oysters T72HM 3G is really not the most powerful equipment from a technical point of view.  However, this does not prevent him from successfully working and performing all his tasks at the highest level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone oysters t72hm 3g" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1210037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Although we characterize a <span>tablet computer</span> that will be used in a car, the developers made a small ‚Äúbonus‚Äù for customers by equipping it with two cameras at once.  In fact, this is the result of the fact that the classic variation of the tablet computer was taken as the basis of our Oysters T72HM 3G model (the firmware of which confirms this). </p><p>  Therefore, roughly speaking, in the process of designing and assembling the device, no one thought that the gadget would not need cameras.  Because of this, now we can work with two matrices (front and rear) with a resolution of 2 and 0.3 megapixels, respectively.  The software and hardware of the tablet allows you to talk about images with a resolution of 1600 x 1200 and various options such as flash and videos.  It turns out, if you try hard, you can turn the tablet-navigator into a tablet-recorder. </p>

    <h2>  Navigator </h2><p>  On the other hand, on the device, in addition to the standard Google maps present on all Android, there is a software package from Yandex.  It deserves special attention because there are negative reviews about these programs on the network.  Oysters T72HM 3G, according to them, may get confused in the city, show the wrong route or distance.  All this negatively affects the general opinion about the device. </p><h2>  Other features </h2><p>  In addition to the presented ones, there are other options available to the owners of the gadget.  For example, the ability to work with a SIM card.  It means the availability of support for 3G mobile Internet.  Also describing Oysters T72HM 3G characteristics indicate the presence of 2 simultaneous SIM.  True, the logic of the developers in this case is not entirely clear: the device is locked to one operator (MTS), so it will not work with other providers (at least, as the rules say). </p><p>  The solution may be to ‚Äútune‚Äù your tablet and untie it from the operator.  As recommendations regarding the Oysters T72HM 3G show, unlocking the device so that it ‚Äúsees‚Äù other operators is real.  This will give you the opportunity to choose between different service providers, choosing more favorable tariffs. </p><p>  It can also be noted that a computer from a reliable roadside assistant can turn into a full-fledged multimedia center if you know how to handle it.  After all, he has all the necessary components for this.  In particular, there is a slot for a memory card.  With it, you can increase the amount of data stored on the device and upload your favorite movies here, for example. </p><p>  True, the negative point is the battery.  Without connecting to a car, the device will last literally 4-5 hours with a 2500 mAh battery. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  If you believe what is indicated in the technical specifications, the model runs on the Android 5.1 operating system.  This is not the newest version of this firmware, however, an Oysters T72HM 3G update may be released for it (in the future).  Thus, the interface will be improved and the entire logic of the OS will be simplified, as it is implemented in the sixth generation of the Android OS.  In any case, there will be no problems with working on the device, since its ‚Äúnative‚Äù technologies are used here, which every user is used to intuitively. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  To purchase a device, as already noted above, you can on the website (page-store) of Megafon.  Here, opposite the Oysters T72HM 3G model, the price is 3290 rubles.  They include: the cost of the model (2490 rubles) and the fee for connecting services, more precisely, the package ‚ÄúInternet S‚Äù.  As promised on the site, it will operate for several months, because it is profitable. </p><p>  True, a significant drawback is the ‚Äúbinding‚Äù of the device to one operator, which eliminates the transition to the services of another company (unless you use illegal methods of ‚Äúuntying‚Äù). </p><p>  In general, obviously, on the Oysters T72HM 3G the price is set at such a low level for the reason that the gadget will be guaranteed to generate revenue for the operator, since the user will have no alternative. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews in general </h2><p>  What about the opinions of people who bought this product?  In principle, the overall impression is the same as described in this article: the <span>tablet is cheap,</span> but it looks satisfactory.  In terms of functions, it is quite universal (it can be used as a regular device), but at the same time it has far from the most powerful parameters, which is why you should not think about some colorful games on it, the maximum is launching a browser, mail, social networks etc. </p><p>  Given all of the above, people's opinions were also divided.  Someone believes that the device is too cheap and low quality to think about buying it.  And to some, the tablet seemed very useful, affordable and functional.  Therefore, the entire assessment of the model is based more on a personal impression of it and on how much the author likes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing such a device - a budget, but rustic. </p><p>  If you would like to purchase such a device, there is nothing complicated about it.  Contact any nearest MegaFon communication salon or write a letter to the support service, and they will tell you the address where you can buy such a gadget.  Given its price, you can try to experiment on your own to understand how convenient it is to drive and navigate on such a map. </p>
