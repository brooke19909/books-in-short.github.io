    <p>  Very soon after Stalin died, in 1953, the concept of "Stalin's personality cult" appeared.  The first to start the fight against this phenomenon was Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich, as well as <span>Malenkov George</span> Maximilianovich. </p><p>  In Soviet literature of the thirties and fifties of the twentieth century, one of the central ones was the image of Stalin.  Foreign writers-communists also wrote about the leader, among them - Pablo Neruda, <span>Henri Barbus.</span>  In the USSR, their creations were replicated and translated. </p><p>  The works that glorified Stalin also appeared in the publications of folklore of almost all the peoples of the USSR. </p><p>  In Soviet sculpture and painting during this period, a cult of personality of Stalin was also traced. </p><p>  Particularly in the formation of the propaganda image of this leader, Soviet printed posters, which were devoted to various topics, played a special role. </p><p>  During the lifetime of Stalin, a very large number of objects were named, including settlements, streets, factories, and cultural centers.  Most likely, the first of them was Stalingrad.  In the Civil War (in nineteen twenty-seven), Stalin participated in the defense of Tsaritsyn. </p><p>  In many states of Eastern Europe after 1945, cities appeared that were named in his honor. </p><p>  The formation of the Stalin personality cult became one of the fragments of the political regime of the USSR in the thirties. </p><p>  Fifty years old, he was twenty-first of December 1921.  Up to this point, all members of the Politburo were called "party leaders" and listed in alphabetical order.  But from that moment on, the ‚Äúinstitute of leaders‚Äù was liquidated and Stalin was declared the only ‚Äúfirst student of Lenin‚Äù and ‚Äúleader of the party‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stalin was called brilliant, great, wise.  The ‚Äúleader of the world proletariat‚Äù appeared in the country.  He was also called an outstanding commander and creator of the Red Army, the organizer of the October Revolution, and the great strategist of the five-year plan.  Party workers, workers, artists, academics from each other disputed the primacy for praising Stalin.  However, Dzhambul, a <span>Kazakh</span> national <span>poet,</span> surpassed everyone, in Pravda he wrote that ‚ÄúStalin is deeper than the ocean, higher than the Himalayas, brighter than the sun.  He is the teacher of the universe. ‚Äù </p><p>  The personality cult of Stalin was exposed by Nikita Khrushchev during the <span>Twentieth Congress of the CPSU</span> in 1956, on February twenty-fifth.  It lasted from the fourteenth to the twenty-fifth of February 1956, it was attended by a decisive vote of one thousand three hundred and forty-nine delegates, with an advisory vote of eighty-one, representing four hundred nineteen thousand six hundred and nine party members and six million seven hundred and ninety-five thousand eight hundred and ninety-six members party. </p><p>  The exposure of the personality cult of Stalin by Nikita Khrushchev was set forth in a closed report "On the personality cult and its consequences." </p><p>  In it, Khrushchev voiced his point of view on the recent past of the country, and also listed numerous facts of the history of the second half of the thirties and early fifties, interpreted them as crimes where Stalin was blamed for them.  The problem of military and party leaders who were repressed under this ruler was also raised.  The report, despite this conditional closeness, was distributed to all party corners of the country, and in some enterprises even non-partisans were brought to its discussion.  Even in the cells of the Komsomol it was discussed.  Around the world, the report, which exposed Stalin‚Äôs personality cult, attracted much attention, was translated into many languages ‚Äã‚Äãand distributed even to non-communist circles.  However, only in the nineteen eighty-ninth year it was published in the Soviet Union itself in a journal called "Proceedings of the Central Committee of the CPSU." </p>
