Sometimes there is an urgent need to do something extraordinary and funny, without resorting to the dreary and costly ways of spending time.  Especially such a burning desire arises when their own fidget children are buzzing and languishing from boredom.  Here in a similar situation, the ability to make a miraculous toy in handicraft conditions is very useful in order to have fun in your house.  And specifically, paper models of missiles will help us.  There are many ways to design a ‚Äústar Pegasus‚Äù for yourself, so now we will introduce you to the course of affairs and tell you what and how to do. </p><h2>  First way </h2>

The necessary materials: a piece of paper in the amount of one piece, electrical tape, scissors, a tube (in order to start the starship) and a glue gun (although the usual PVA is suitable for it, but with this choice you will have to be patient, because everything will dry for a long time).  The first thing to do is cut the leaf into two parts (about 5 cm wide each).  Next, get a tube.  It is best to disassemble a ballpoint pen.  Then attach a piece of electrical tape to one of the halves of the ‚Äúoperated‚Äù sheet, turn this part over and cover the handle.  Something like the shell of the desired rocket will come out.  Secure the paper curled around the pen with a ‚Äúsolid‚Äù electrical tape, and then blow out the writing instrument.  If there are bumps at the tips, simply remove them with scissors.  Now one of the ends of the case should be clogged with the same electrical tape.  You need to prepare three pieces of duct tape and fold them in such a way that stabilizers for your device are obtained.  One of the pieces must be carefully folded in half, but not completely glued.  Next, using scissors, by eye, cut off the tape at an angle equal to about 45 degrees.  We do everything in such a way that the result is a triangular shape of the stabilizer.  With the rest of the prepared pieces of adhesive tape, we do the same manipulations.

They should be attached at an equal distance around the base of the spacecraft.  Now we take in our hands the remaining piece of the sheet and give the appearance of a cone, which is perfect for the body.  We cut off part of the nose segment of the rocket as unnecessary.  We wrap the cone with electrical tape so that it is properly prepared for long flights.  Be especially careful with the tip of the nasal fragment.  Approximately ¬æ press the adhesive into the cone.  Place the rocket body in the cone with the clogged part.  Wait a while until the parts grasp well.  It has happened - a means of fun is made.  It remains only to launch it, for which you just need to insert the tube from the handle into its body, hold it and blow it as hard as possible. </p><h2>  Cardboard </h2>

Such a version will be able to outdo its fellow paper in all respects.  Materials that will be required in the manufacture: cardboard tube, colored paper and scissors.  You can use pencils with felt-tip pens, and other cosmetic tinsel.  But this is a purely individual aspect.  The beginning will be laid by manipulating a colored piece of paper.  It is necessary to carefully cut a quarter circle out of it with scissors.  From the resulting we make a cone, slightly trimming it, if necessary, and apply a couple of cuts.  It is time to stick this cone to the cardboard tube.  The resulting rocket is decorated in various ways.  Any device of this class is clearly not prevented by a pair of wings.  So you need to cut them out and add them to the rocket.  Do not forget about the valves for fastening (cuts).  Once the wings are fixed in place, the case can be considered completed.

    <p>  Such rocket models are a great solution for conscientious parents who want to spur the development of fantasy in their child.  As a basis, a disposable deep bowl is useful.  Make a cylinder of foil to then pile a rocket out of it, relying on the first method of creation.  Get paper and make a tube out of it.  Then, make a hole in the bowl whose diameter is equal to or slightly exceeds that of the tube.  We pass a paper tube through the hole, securing with duct tape for greater durability of the structure.  The thing is small: just put the rocket, created by the first method, onto the tube and blow hard so that the device soars. </p><h2>  Cigarette paper </h2><p>  Further in the queue we have quite non-laborious rocket models.  For the next craft, the hull and stabilizers are made of colored paper, and the parachute, which serves as the main aid for the descent, is created from cigarette.  We find a leaf with a size of 177 x 250 mm and transform it into a simple cone.  In order to make things easier for yourself, it is better to stretch the paper between the table and the ruler.  Grease the edge of the cone with glue and fasten.  It‚Äôs better to crouch over the template for the base of the cone, as this is very useful when cutting the rocket body.  We put the template on the cone, mark the line with a pencil, then we get rid of the excess with scissors.  Now it's up to the stabilizers.  We need 3 sheets of thick and colored paper 8 x 17 mm.  Each sheet is refracted in half lengthwise and superimposed on each template.  Circle the dotted line on which we cut out the stabilizers. </p><p>  We protrude the edges of the stabilizers and connect them thanks to the bonding properties of the glue.  These stabilizers will give missiles stability during the flight.  On the above template, we outline 3 points.  Due to the template and pencil marks, we make points on the aft segment of the rocket, and then connect them to the nose of the rocket.  We fix stabilizers, relying on our own notation.  It is time to tackle the parachute dome. </p><p>  Remember the tissue paper.  The main thing is that its size be 280 x 280 mm.  Using simple manipulations create a dome.  Next, we make loops of thread.  You need 8 equal-sized blanks.  Here it would be better to carefully calculate: we calculate 1.5 lengths of the diameter of the parachute canopy and add the length of the rocket hull to the resulting number.  We fasten the hinges to the dome.  To do this, it is better to enlist the help of paper patches.  Scrupulously and delicately fold the dome.  We squeeze all the involved slings into the inside of the rocket body - it is best to wield a small hook in this process.  We fix the second node on the rocket nose, this time using a thread with a needle.  We push the parachute into the stern segment of the rocket.  The aircraft has been completed and is ready for operation. </p><h2>  Flight </h2>

We prepare a square piece of paper.  Make a mark in the middle with a pencil in the form of a line.  We cut.  On the first strip, we leave two points: one in the middle of the upper part, the second in the middle of the bottom.  We outline the inclined fold to the point marked on the lower side, and then we outline the second fold, but in the opposite direction, to the upper point.  We notice the crease line that passes through the intersection of the inclined lines.  We make the top of the rocket.  We add the sides to the midline.  It was the turn of the remaining strip obtained from paper.  We outline on it a line in the middle.  Fold the sides of the leaf to the middle, and lower the lower corners to the top.  It remains to fit one section of the rocket to another.  We blow into the upper triangle and observe the graceful flight of our apparatus.  Now you know how different rocket models are made.
