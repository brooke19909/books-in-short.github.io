    <p>  The car DVR (model 688) is fixed with a suction cup to the windshield, just like the Mio MiVue 358, which also has a similar mount.  The suction cup has a flexible material resembling rubber, which makes it easy to fix the device.  The mount is reliable enough and holds the device firmly during movement, preventing it from vibrating, swinging and bouncing off the glass.  The size of the mount is half the size of the device itself. </p><p>  In order to install the DVR, you need to park the car on a level road.  Next, the suction cup should be pressed firmly against the windshield in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rearview mirror.  Subsequently, it remains only to adjust the desired location of the device. </p><p>  The charger is connected to the cigarette lighter, the cable should be located on the ceiling and the front pillar of the car, so that it does not interfere while driving and does not interfere with the deployment of airbags and the operation of other vehicle components. </p><p>  After installing the device, make sure that it is parallel to the road.  In this case, the ratio of earth and sky should be 6: 4.  The device must not block the view of the driver while driving.  It should be noted that tinting a car reduces the quality of the recording. </p><p>  Mounting the device allows it to rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äã¬∞ in the horizontal plane.  Such manipulations can be done thanks to the presence of a special ball joint, which is located inside the bracket.  This feature allows you to set a more accurate location of the device and prevent its possible displacement.  The suction cup itself is fixed by a small bar for greater reliability.  In the vertical plane, the maximum deflection angle is 180 ¬∞.  In the most extreme positions, the device can abut against the windshield. </p><p>  The device mount is convenient and reliable, and the installation of the Mio MiVue 688 DVR (the black color of the device is the main one and the manufacturer does not provide other options) is carried out within a minute. </p><h2>  Software </h2>

    <p>  MiVue Manager software is installed on the <span>Mio</span> MiVue 688 dashcam, which comes bundled with it on a mini CD.  The program for the operation of the device can be downloaded from the website of the manufacturer. </p><p>  To view the video recorded earlier, you must specify the location of the folder with the file.  The memory card can be either direct access or through the card reader, as well as through a connected device or a copy of the disk from the memory card. </p><p>  After specifying the location of the file, a list of documents appears in the chronological order on the right.  There is also a calendar that allows you to access files by the date they were recorded. </p><p>  Here you can expand the video to full screen without enabling the playback function.  In this situation, the picture will be much clearer.  The device supports a change in the playback speed of the recording and has quite wide possibilities, among which it is worth noting the construction of a data graph from the built-in three-axis shock sensor.  It is possible to create still pictures. </p><p>  The highlight of this device is the auto-construction of the transport route, which can be seen on Google Maps.  During video playback, the mark on the map displays the location of the car according to the data of the map.  The software utility allows you to sort records, which makes finding the desired file more convenient.  You can also share the recording made in the DVR on Facebook or upload it to Youtube. </p><h2>  Management basics </h2>
