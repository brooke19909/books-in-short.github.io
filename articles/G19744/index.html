From the airport to the hotel, the distance is only 7 km.  The price of the tour with accommodation in a double room at the current time is $ 382 per person.

    <h2>  Description of the territory of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel territory is quite spacious (38 thousand square meters) and remarkably well-groomed.  Numerous neat pedestrian terraces and paths are laid along it, between lawns and flower beds.  It immediately catches the eye of guests of <span>Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 *.</span>  Description of the hotel in the reviews of tourists notes thoughtful landscaping of its territory. </p><p>  Especially comfortable are the recreation areas around the pools.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are placed here to protect from the sun.  Lots of greenery.  The hotel area is carefully cleaned and maintained by the efforts of staff in perfect condition. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Landscape designers planted and decorated a classic Mediterranean-style garden.  A good stretching around the perimeter of the pool area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Regina Aqua Beach Park Resort 4 * avenue from royal palm trees.  Lawns are well-groomed and generously watered (in Egypt, only through careful care the grass has a bright green color.) The landscape of the garden is organically decorated with shrubs and trees neatly trimmed in the form of geometric figures by topiary craftsmen. </p><p>  Between trees and shrubs, invisible during the day, garlands are hung artificially.  But when it gets dark on the street, they are turned on together with lights and spotlights, and this creates a very original evening landscape that you want to admire. </p><p>  The hotel hall, the reception area, which the newcomers are the first to see, looks presentable: marble flooring, double ceiling heights, marble columns. </p><h2>  About hotel rooms </h2><p>  New arrivals are populated immediately upon arrival.  The staff understands Russian well.  <span>The language barrier is</span> therefore uncritical.  The rooms of the Regina Aqua Beach Park Resort 4 * hotel are located in the main side buildings and bungalows.  Of these, 70 standard rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã42 square meters with a sea view with a capacity of 2x2 people, 108 rooms in a bungalow with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã38 square meters with a garden view, 230 standard family rooms, 28 double rooms (standard, interconnected by doors). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regina aqua park beach resort ex royal regina resort 4 egypt hurghada" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090777.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rooms have balconies (terraces), air conditioning, TV, hairdryer, kettle, landline telephone.  The furniture is not made of expensive wood (after all, an economic hotel), however, in the rooms everything is in order, equipped, functional.  Cleaning is done daily and thoroughly.  Faults are eliminated within 15 minutes. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  The food of the guests of the Regina Aqua Beach Park Resort 4 * hotel is provided by the main restaurant, three restaurants by appointment and three bars.  At the same time, we note that the menu of a four-star hotel is quite diverse.  The main dishes are prepared from chicken, turkey, beef, fish.  Enough salads.  There are a lot of pastries and sweets.  Of the fruits, most orange and dates.  Melons are rarer, and watermelons are even rarer.  However, in the main menu there are no delights designed for the taste of gourmets than it happens in five-star hotels. </p><p>  In general, according to tourists, the food is hearty, varied, but not wonderful. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The distance from the buildings of the Regina Aqua Beach Park Resort 4 * hotel to the beach is approximately 100 meters.  For the most part (except for the extremities) it is sandy and regularly cleaned.  Moreover, the textured sand: white and coarse.  There is a pontoon for convenient entry into the sea.  It is spacious, comfortable, with sun loungers and umbrellas in sufficient quantity for relaxing beach people.  Reviews of tourists about beach vacations are extremely positive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regina aqua park beach resort ex royal regina resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090776.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From noon a buffet is working here by the sea.  Bathing people have the opportunity to try refreshments, snack pastries, sandwiches, pizza both within the all-inclusive system and for an additional fee.  Also, for an hour and a half in the afternoon, buffet workers cook meat on the grill and treat them to vacationers. </p><p>  Animators are actively working here, organizing the game of beach volleyball. </p><p>  At the Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort ex Royal Regina Resort 4 * hotel, there is a diving school, and beginners who want to get acquainted with the beauties of the reefs, which are located on both sides of the beach, take several basic lessons. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  The pools of the hotel complex are located just in the middle - between the sea and the buildings.  Large - for swimming, swimming and games (water aerobics, water polo) for adults, and the smaller - for children.  In the adult pool, 5 water slides of various degrees of difficulty are equipped. </p><p>  No wonder the word "water park" is contained in the name of the hotel complex Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 *.  Description of the delight of children from games on them under the supervision of parents and animators in itself can take pages.  What could be more beautiful than the world of childhood?  When they function (and this is a couple of hours before lunch and a couple after), the pool area becomes the epicenter of joy and fun.  This process is skillfully and unobtrusively led by animators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regina aqua park beach resort ex royal regina resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, lovers of a relaxing holiday here are also not deprived.  Artificial ponds have created a complete comfortable relaxation area with sun loungers, parasols.  In addition, royal palm trees provide additional protection against direct sunlight. </p><p>  Children's animators organize a play holiday for small spa visitors (4-12 years old) as part of a mini-club.  There is a playground near the children's pool.  In addition, the restaurant is equipped with special places for them, and the chefs prepare food adapted to the tastes of small holidaymakers as part of a special menu. </p><p>  The buffet in the pool area is good in that, in addition to soft drinks and pastries, you can enjoy ice cream, a glass of beer, and local wine as part of the all-inclusive system.  The recreation area by the pool is so good that some of the guests of the Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort ex Royal Regina Resort 4 * do not reach the sea.  Their feedback on the recreation area by the pools, which allows you to relax in the style of the lounge, is positive.  However, they also express regret that the hotel does not have a pool with heated water.  And he would not be in the cold season, when the water temperature for natural reasons is about 18 degrees Celsius. </p><h2>  Animation team </h2><p>  The hotel has all the features to have fun.  A cool animation team works here!  And for this they express respect to the entire hotel complex Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 * reviews.  The photo below captures a fragment of their work when smiles illuminate the faces of vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regina aqua park beach resort 4 theft reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the friendly and perky team of lyceum from the hotel, vacationers distinguish Fabio (the leading entertainment program), positive and sociable Jessica, groovy and cool Abdullah and, of course, the Russian animator Sveta.  This team really does not let vacationers get bored. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Fans of outdoor activities, in addition to water recreation and beach volleyball (which we have already talked about), have the opportunity to play classic tennis on a dirt platform and, together with animators, do yoga and aerobics in the pool area.  In the evenings, animators soundly and always organize a performance with a twinkle, and then a disco in Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 *. </p><p>  The description of paid entertainment for vacationers is also quite wide: </p><p>  - Turkish bath, sauna and massage within the spa; </p><p>  - classes in the fitness center under the guidance of experienced trainers; </p><p>  - Tennis lessons, racket and tennis rental in the evening; </p><p>  - Diving classes in a special club at the hotel; </p><p>  - billiards; </p><p>  - squash. </p><h2>  Hurghada Resort Infrastructure </h2><p>  After walking a few minutes, the hotel guests find themselves in the city center: on Sheraton Street, stretching from the historic center of the old city to the seafront.  That is, you do not need to spend money on transport to get to the shops (the huge Hurghada Marina Boulevard hypermarket, the textile Karkush, Levis jeans, the Pharaoh leather, dozens of original souvenir shops), restaurants (McDonald's, Pizza Hut) , KFS), entertainment complex (Senzo Mall). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regina aqua park beach resort 4 hotel description" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1090820.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Having traveled a bit to the old city, tourists find themselves in a huge oriental bazaar, open from 13-00 to 23-00. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  They can be booked directly at the reception.  Tours are also offered by agents from the tour desk.  Signing up for a mini-trip around the Land of the Pharaohs is easy and simple.  However, the price for it will be one and a half to two times higher than in urban travel agencies with a similar level of service.  Many tourists save money this way. </p><p>  In addition, it is advisable not to focus on long excursions (the valley of the pyramids of Giza, Luxor) in January-February during a 50-day seasonal wind.  At this time, sandstorms are not uncommon.  But the rest of the year, of course, these places should be visited at least once.  The National Archaeological Museum in Cairo is magnificent. </p><p>  Traditionally, outdoor enthusiasts buy sightseeing tours to the southern and northern islands, rich in wonderful exotic beaches and waterfalls. </p><p>  A separate bonus of staying in Egypt is the possibility of a two-day excursion to Jerusalem. </p><h2>  About theft in Egypt </h2><p>  However, the sites of travel agencies also contain recommendations to take into account the theft factor in the hotel in question.  There are few such reviews: only two.  But they should be taken into account.  In both cases, cash was simply stored in a suitcase. </p><p>  In one case, the laptop disappeared.  However, the vast majority of vacationers in their reviews argue that they did not encounter such a problem.  It may well be that they were written by representatives of competing hotels.  Who to believe?  In any case, it is recommended to be careful and keep money and valuables in the safes of Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 * reviews. </p><p>  Theft at the hotel is sporadic.  However, when heading to markets and shops, ladies should not take handbags with them.  By the way, all Egyptians on the streets do not carry this accessory familiar to our women.  In the modern Land of the Pharaohs, theft of handbags is thriving just on the street in broad daylight among women.  Half the trouble, when a runaway man grabs a handbag.  However, there are cases when a thief-motorcyclist drags a woman behind her bike who could not get free from the handle of her purse ... </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up the description of the Regina Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 * hotel, we note that tours here are invariably popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regina aqua park beach resort 4 description" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1038240.jpg" width="579"></div>  The economy class hotel complex has a wonderful beach, its own water park.  The manager of any five-star hotel can dream of his animation team.  Here, under the supervision of the employees of the mini-club and in their company, the children feel carefree and joyful.
