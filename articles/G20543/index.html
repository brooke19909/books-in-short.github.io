This monument of history and architecture is also a sacred place for representatives of several religions at once. </p><h2>  Mount of Olives (Israel) and its geography </h2><p>  In terms of orography, this is not even a mountain, but a ridge of hills stretching along the northeastern, eastern and southeastern tip of Jerusalem.  It consists of three separate peaks, the highest of which reaches an absolute height of 826 meters. </p><p>  On the south side of the ridge is bordered by a mountain of grief (or death).  The Mount of Olives is separated from the city by the Kedron Valley.  Below, on the western slopes, is a place called Gethsemane.  It is here, according to the scriptures, that <span>Jesus Christ prayed</span> before his arrest. </p>
