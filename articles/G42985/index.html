  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attractive and Cozy Paris Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year, hotels in Paris take a large stream of various categories of guests.  Numerous tourists and business people come and settle in <span>Paris hotels</span> from all over the world, cultural figures and fashion designers, people of creative professions, students and pensioners, couples making honeymoon trips come - all find cozy rooms here. </p><p>  Why is everyone so attracted to Paris?  Many of us from childhood know about him from the books of Dumas, later read the book of Hugo "Notre Dame de Paris".  The famous Eiffel Tower is known to almost every child, the names of the Louvre, the Seine, the <span>Champs Elysees</span> and Montmartre are not just empty words, but symbols of the city.  This is the <span>European capital of</span> fashion, where the most famous fashion houses are located.  Here <span>Coco Chanel</span> and Edith Piaf became famous all over the world.  These are magnificent French wines, exquisite aromas, a stunning variety of cheeses, culinary and still bohemian atmosphere preserved in the old quarters.  On the streets of the city it is pleasant to bask in the sun, watch young mothers with children, Parisian old people.  This is an idyllic sight. </p><p>  For those who spend their holidays in Paris, the most convenient hotels are located in the city center.  It is very convenient to see the sights, visit museums.  Tourists will find old streets and cozy cafes with a cup of aromatic coffee and an indispensable fresh croissant.  In Paris, a large number of three-star and four-star hotels.  Of course, there are also 5-star hotels, however, such Paris hotels provide luxurious, almost royal accommodation with appropriate prices. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the very center of the city is the three-star Carlton's Hotel, its guests can daily walk around Montmartre, watch the shining bright lights of the Moulin Rouge.  This small hotel has only 10 rooms, but here is amazing, just a homely atmosphere.  Despite its small size, there is a business center and all the necessary conditions for living.  Many hotels in Paris, located in its center, are very small in size, here you will rarely find hotel complexes with 100-200 rooms.  Most often, Paris hotels have from 30 to 50 rooms.  In the Opera district, there is one of such hotels Opera Louvre Paris, in which the famous artist Henri Toulouse-Lautrec once lived. </p><p>  Not far from Montmartre is the Montrose Hotel.  Near it there are many shops, theaters, restaurants and bars.  This small hotel complex includes only 36 rooms, but it has everything you need for a good rest and for work.  Four-star hotels in Paris are usually larger than three-star hotels.  This is not surprising, because the higher status of the hotel requires the provision of a wide variety of services and makes higher demands on their quality.  Of course, this requires a larger number of staff and it is advantageous to serve a large number of rooms. </p><p>  Paris hotels are incredibly cozy and romantic, they attract many lovers.  They are drawn to commit such a forbidden event as dinner in a hotel room.  This is not an official service when you are ceremoniously served food in your room, but a smuggled half- <span>fried chicken, a</span> bottle of wonderful French wine and cheese.  It is worth grabbing fruit for dessert, they are sold in abundance right in the streets all year round.  Mangoes, strawberries and lychees are incredibly sweet and delicious.  To extend the unforgettable pleasure of a trip to Paris, buy as many souvenirs as possible.  Among them must be the most noble <span>French cheeses</span> and the most popular French Bordeaux.  Remember that a trip to Paris is a mandatory magical and romantic experience, it is a bright holiday that is always with you. </p>
