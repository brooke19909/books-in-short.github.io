And at sea, the main force was the English Royal Navy, which introduced a sea blockade in France, affecting its trade and mobilization of naval forces.  Despite several fairly successful campaigns, the French were not able to finally break through the blockade.  And then Napoleon switched to the same policy, establishing a <span>continental blockade that</span> forbids all countries dependent on him from trading with Great Britain.  This, in turn, disrupted the connection of the <span>British Isles</span> with Europe. </p><p>  Such was the military-political situation in this part of the world, it was under these conditions that the Battle of Trafalgar took place. </p><p>  Napoleon was well aware that England was the main obstacle to his conquest plans.  In parallel, he developed the capture of Malta, Corsica, Corfu - the islands that belonged to his opponent and were strategically important support bases. </p><p>  The Battle of Trafalgar is a historic battle between the French-Spanish and English naval forces.  It began in October 1805 on the coast of the Spanish Atlantic near Cape Trafalgar, by whose name it was named. </p><p>  Not limited to his plans to capture the British colonies, Napoleon intended to land a large landing on the territory of <span>Misty Albion,</span> and called the preparation for this operation a ‚ÄúBoulogne expedition‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Actually, this is how the Battle of Trafalgar began, the English Channel literally swarmed with French warships, which distracted the attention of the <span>British fleet.</span> </p><p>  In this naval battle, which became decisive in the second hundred-year war, France and its ally, Spain, lost more than twenty frigates, while there were no military equipment losses from Great Britain.  However, it was the Battle of Trafalgar that put an end to the heroic life path of British Vice Admiral Nelson.  After this battle, his legendary name became a symbol of English naval power. </p><p>  The joint fleet of Spain and France was commanded by a Frenchman, Admiral Pierre Villeneuve. </p><p>  The English squadron blocked the Franco-Spanish squadron.  Admiral Villeneuve received orders from Napoleon to break through the environment and break into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea to reunite with the Spanish detachment there.  However, contrary to the Admiral's Council, Villeneuve adhered to the old single-line tactics.  He lined up the Franco-Spanish fleet in one line. </p><p>  The Battle of Trafalgar was accompanied by a strong wind, which worked in favor of the British: a strong current impeded the movement of coalition ships.  Nelson, without hesitation, took the opportunity and broke the chain of ships, directing the fastest of them forward.  French and Spanish frigates were scattered. </p><p>  Legend has it that the Battle of Trafalgar began when Vice Admiral Nelson triumphantly raised a flag signal on his Victoria flagship, meaning "England expects every soldier to do his duty."  This phrase remained forever in the minds of the British, years after the end of the battle, it is often quoted and paraphrased. </p><p>  The Battle of Trafalgar became an integral part of the Third Coalition War and one of the most significant naval confrontations of the nineteenth century.  And the victory of England only confirmed the water superiority of this country, established in the XVIII century.  After his defeat, Napoleon left an aggressive plan of attack on southern England, in exchange for starting a war against other main forces in Europe: Austria and Russia. </p>
