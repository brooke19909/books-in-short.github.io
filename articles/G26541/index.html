    <p>  Before figuring out what distinguishes the state from other <span>political organizations,</span> you need to understand the terminology.  This term refers to the mechanism of direct political power.  All other public organizations that operate within the framework of the social system influence indirectly.  That is, they do not directly give instructions to the state, but cooperate with it in one form or another.  Of course, the role of an individual organization may have a decisive decision, but it is still impossible to completely equate them. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  There are a lot of them.  To better perceive the information, the signs were divided into groups.  Now we will consider the state as a <span>political institution.</span>  So, if you approach from a territorial point of view, then: </p><ol><li>  The state within its borders is a single official representative of the whole society.  The union in this case is based on citizenship and territory. </li><li>  The state as a special political organization has special sovereignty.  It is understood as the supreme leadership on its territory and independence when it comes into contact with international relations. </li><li>  Only the state has the right and obligation to issue laws and regulations within controlled borders.  This legislation has the highest legal force.  It contains generally binding rules of possible and proper behavior, which are called the rule of law.  They are universal in nature.  In other words, their effect extends to all municipal, state, private and public organizations, as well as to individuals.  At the same time, the principle of "all are equal." </li></ol><p>  This is what the state represents as a political institution.  Of course, other public organizations can also make certain decisions, which are drawn up in normative acts, but they are valid only within them.  In the country, lawmaking is the exclusive prerogative of state power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Company management </h2>

    <p>  What distinguishes the state from other political organizations when influencing society?  It is a complex mechanism that governs society, regulates <span>social processes</span> and spheres.  It is a system of government bodies, which includes the material means they need.  Moreover, the latter should be spent on achieving certain tasks and performing specific functions.  The peculiarity of the bodies forming the state mechanism is their state-imperious recognition.  This provision is legally enshrined.  The activities of the authorities include the formation and presence of specially selected individuals who receive the status of civil servants.  Their main task is the implementation of the function of managing society and providing it with the most optimal living conditions.  These are important internal features of the state that distinguish it from other organizations.  Of course, there are charitable foundations and similar institutions, but they can only help physically, while their influence on the formation of conditions is very low. </p><h2>  Systematic approach </h2>

So, it exclusively has law enforcement (or even punitive) bodies, such as the prosecutor's office, the police and the court, and so on.  They are created specifically to maintain law and order and protect the rule of law.  To do this, use the path of coercion to fulfill the accepted norms of law.  It is also exclusively the state that has armed forces and security agencies whose task is to ensure the country's defense capability, sovereignty and territorial integrity.

In addition, it should be noted that the association is carried out regardless of racial, national, religious and so on affiliation of people.  The state also manages national resources.  He has his own flags, hymns and coats of arms, which show that the subject is sovereign.  In addition, the state has its own tax and financial systems.

Thus, proponents of Marxism believed that it was only a tool in the hands of the governing class to impose its will on all other people.  But the most common thought is that the state is a social compromise between different sections of the population.  Thanks to him, the general social orientation of his actions is ensured.  Thanks to this, it is both a universal and a class principle at the same time.  And this is the main difference between the state and other organizations at this point in time.
