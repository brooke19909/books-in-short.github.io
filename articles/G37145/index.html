If you think about it, there is nothing special about this.  In any case, when it comes to an individual.  But legal, as well as individual entrepreneurs or organizations, will not be easy.  Therefore, you need to know about all the features of opening a bank account in a particular case.  If you prepare correctly, then there will be no problems either with receiving money or with concluding a contract.  So what should citizens pay attention to?  How to open your own bank account?  What advice do people give each other regarding the issue under study?  In reality, everything is not so simple.  Especially when it comes to an individual entrepreneur.  Often, such people wonder what account and where to open them.  More about this later. </p><h2>  Different types of accounts </h2><p>  The procedure for opening a bank account begins with a study of the types of accounts that are offered in a particular case.  Without awareness of this feature, you should not start an account opening event.  Why?  Because each account usually has its own purpose.  Accordingly, the terms of service will be different. </p>

    <p>  At the moment in Russia you can meet the following options: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  payment account; </li><li>  current; </li><li>  budgetary; </li><li>  correspondent; </li><li>  escrow; </li><li>  special. </li></ul><p>  What are all the above accounts for?  Knowing the answer to this question, you can easily decide which option is suitable for a citizen or organization.  There are many factors to consider.  Especially when it comes to large companies. </p><p>  A checking account is the most common option.  Suitable for individual entrepreneurs, legal entities, and individuals.  Designed for cashless payments.  In fact, this is a universal type of account.  Quite often, it is recommended to open it. </p><p>  The current account is intended primarily for the general population.  It is ideal for calculations that have nothing to do with profit.  Organizations usually do not use this option. </p><p>  Budget - a bank account that is intended for actions with state money.  This solution is suitable for legal entities.  Usually rarely opened, mainly by those supported by the government.  In practice, budget accounts in banks are a repository of funds of state institutions. </p><p>  Correspondent - suitable for servicing institutions that offer loans. </p><p>  <span>A deposit account</span> is another common option.  Needed specifically for storage and a small increase in cash.  It is opened either by individuals or legal entities. </p><p>  Special - intended for special operations.  Usually customers do not open.  It is predominantly internal. </p><p>  From the foregoing, we can conclude that the procedure for opening a bank account is not so simple for an ordinary person.  The first challenge facing citizens is to choose the type of cell to open.  Most banks even offer separate accounts for individual entrepreneurs and legal entities.  Moreover, on fairly favorable terms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  After a person has decided what for and what account he needs, you can proceed to the next important stage.  What is it about?  About choosing a bank with which cooperation is planned. </p><h2>  Bank selection </h2><p>  It is hard to believe, but this feature is extremely important for citizens.  The fact is that if you turn to an unreliable bank, you can lose almost all the money.  Also, experts advise not to put all the money in one account and in one financial company, if we are talking about individuals.  Or about any "deposits" that are intended to save money. </p><p>  You can invest in: </p><ul><li>  National Bank; </li><li>  non-governmental (commercial) organization; </li><li>  foreign financial company. </li></ul><p>  For work in Russia, it is recommended to pay attention to resident banks.  In other words, those located on the territory of the country and working inside it.  Preference should be given to state organizations.  They, as practice shows, are more stable. </p><p>  Where is the best way to transfer funds?  At the moment, it is recommended to pay attention to the following organizations: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  VTB 24. </li><li>  "Opening". </li><li>  Gazprombank. </li></ul><p>  They are distinguished by their stability and quality of service.  Also, these companies offer favorable conditions when opening certain accounts.  Just what is so necessary for all citizens and organizations.  But what other features does the procedure for opening a bank account include? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  About collecting documents </h2><p>  You should pay attention to such a moment as the collection of all necessary papers.  In fact, this process takes a lot of time.  Especially when it comes to an organization or a legal entity.  For ordinary citizens, as a rule, documents do not cause trouble. </p><p>  It is recommended that both copies and originals of all securities provided be submitted to the bank.  <span>Accounts</span> will have to be opened in person.  If it is an organization, then the leader / director must act.  Registration through legal representative is allowed.  But then you need to have an additional certificate - a power of attorney. </p><h2>  Age for opening accounts </h2><p>  <span>The procedure for opening a current account</span> with a bank or any other necessarily includes such a feature as an age limit for potential customers.  At the moment, not all citizens are able to open and close accounts in financial companies. </p><p>  Individuals have the right to carry out such a procedure from the age of 14-16, but only with the permission of their legal representatives.  Until adulthood, it is not possible to manage the money stored in the account without prior approval from the parents and the provision of written confirmation from them. </p><p>  Most often, bank accounts are opened after adulthood.  So citizens will have all the rights to use the funds that are on the balance sheet. </p><p>  If we talk about legal entities, companies, firms and individual entrepreneurs, then they are allowed to open accounts in financial organizations from the moment of registration.  Or rather, after receiving all the registration documents. </p><p>  The procedure for opening accounts in banks of the Russian Federation is not limited to this.  All this is just the beginning.  Next, you need to consider the documents that citizens should bring with them to the selected financial institution in a particular case. </p><h2>  Documents for individuals </h2><p>  The procedure for opening a bank account for an individual does not cause trouble.  As a rule, a citizen should bring only a few documents with him.  If we are talking about a resident of the Russian Federation, then we can limit ourselves: </p><ul><li>  identity card (passport); </li><li>  statement of established form; </li><li>  by credit card (if any) with a signature sample (optional); </li><li>  cash that is planned to be transferred to the account (optional). </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is required from the citizen.  But what about a non-resident?  If a foreign person wants to use the account opening service, he will have to show: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  certificate of registration; </li><li>  extracts that confirm the legality of being in the country; </li><li>  statement in Russian. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is not so difficult.  The procedure for opening and maintaining bank accounts in relation to individuals is the easiest option.  Individual entrepreneurs and legal entities have to try pretty hard in this regard. </p><h2>  For an entrepreneur </h2><p>  What documents will need to be submitted to the selected organization if the applicant is an individual entrepreneur?  There are several options.  It all depends on the selected account.  For example, the procedure for <span>opening a bank account for an</span> individual <span>entrepreneur</span> may be similar to an individual.  What does it mean? </p>

    <p>  At the moment, individual entrepreneurs who work "for themselves" without employees (this is an optional item, it is necessary so that the bank does not have additional questions), have the right to open an account as individuals.  And use it to generate income.  Only it will be necessary to inform the tax authority about this event.  Then the IP provides the exact same documents as in the case of individuals. </p><p>  If we talk about a specialized account, then the procedure for opening customer accounts in a bank is somewhat difficult.  After all, documents will have to bring a lot.  An individual entrepreneur must provide: </p><ul><li>  identity card (passport); </li><li>  TIN; </li><li>  written statement; </li><li>  certificate of registration with the tax authority; </li><li>  extracts from the FIU and the FSS. </li></ul><p>  In this sense, the procedure for opening an account in a commercial bank and a state one is no different.  After checking the information about the applicant, the organization will make one or another decision.  As a rule, it is positive.  And it will be possible to proceed to the final stage.  About him a little later, because he is the same for all situations. </p><h2>  Legal entities and companies </h2><p>  The last category of applicants is organizations and legal entities.  What awaits them on the way to the implementation of the task?  What is the procedure for opening bank accounts for legal entities?  At the moment, according to the established rules, it will be necessary to provide a lot of documents to the selected financial institution. </p><p>  As a rule, among all the necessary papers, the following items are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  passport of the applicant (usually the head); </li><li>  constituent documents and their copies (with certification); </li><li>  application for opening an account of one type or another; </li><li>  certificates from the FSS and PFR; </li><li>  certificate of registration and registration with the tax authorities; </li><li>  a card with samples of the seal and the imprint of the company (certified by a notary); </li><li>  extract from the Unified State Register. </li></ul><p>  If the account is not opened by the head of the organization, then, as already mentioned, you will have to bring a power of attorney to carry out the operation.  You will also need to take the company seal with you to the bank.  This is precisely the procedure for opening a current account of an enterprise with a bank of the Russian Federation at the moment.  Everything is not so difficult if you prepare correctly. </p><h2>  Agreement with the bank </h2><p>  Filing the previously listed documents is only part of the case.  As soon as the bank has given its approval for the conclusion of the transaction, it will be necessary, as already mentioned, to proceed to the final stage.  Which one?  What is the procedure for opening a foreign currency account in a bank, as well as a ruble account in one case or another? </p><p>  The basis for customer service of any category is the contract to be concluded.  Accordingly, the parties must conclude a transaction.  The text of the contract indicates all the details of use, as well as account closure.  The type of his ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù is also specified in the agreement. </p><p>  It also indicates which option was chosen - currency or ruble.  The first option is allowed to individuals and organizations that work with foreigners.  But IPs most often use the second sentence.  It should be noted - the transformation of the account from one type to another in relation to currencies is not provided.  That is, if you need to close a ruble account, for example, and open a currency account, this is done.  First, a citizen comes to the bank with the appeal in the prescribed manner and terminates the previously open account.  At the same time it concludes an agreement for a new one.  There is nothing complicated or specific about this. </p>

    <p>  Experts recommend carefully reading the terms of the contract.  After all, it is often possible to clarify questions regarding the replenishment of the balance sheet, the cost of maintenance and the interest rate, if any. </p><h2>  In foreign banks </h2><p>  What is the procedure for opening an account with a foreign bank?  The process as a whole does not differ from everything previously described.  The principle of opening an account is the same everywhere.  The main task is the choice of a country and a financial organization that provides services to citizens of the Russian Federation.  It is recommended to choose among the allies of the Federation.  So you don‚Äôt have to worry that the account will be frozen due to the existing sanctions.  Nobody needs extra problems. </p><p>  You must open a foreign currency account.  And in addition to all the previously listed documents, reference letters from other banks should be attached.  Of course, if available.  A citizen concludes an agreement, signs it - and that‚Äôs it, the job is done.  According to experts, there is no significant difference where to open an account - in a foreign or state bank. </p><h2>  About closing </h2><p>  But this does not end the conversation on the topic under discussion.  The fact is that the procedure for opening and closing bank accounts is the nuances that every depositor must be aware of. </p><p>  As a rule, an account is closed at the request of a citizen (or organization).  Without this operation, it will not work to realize the idea.  The procedure for applying to the bank is exactly the same as when opening an account.  You can close your account without any problems.  It is recommended that you immediately report this action to the tax authorities.  Especially when it comes to legal entities or individual entrepreneurs. </p><p>  What will happen to the funds in the account?  Much depends on the owner of the ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù.  The procedure for opening and closing bank accounts indicates that a financial institution cannot appropriate money for itself.  This means that the account holder must first worry about withdrawing funds. </p><p>  What are the ways to cancel an account?  Currently allowed: </p><ul><li>  withdraw cash; </li><li>  transfer available funds to another bank account (in any). </li></ul><p>  Most often, the second option is used.  As a rule, the procedure for opening bank accounts (LPR or any other state, it doesn‚Äôt matter) for legal entities provides that all transactions are made by bank transfer.  Therefore, with cashing money, certain problems can arise.  This is quite normal. </p><p>  And if a citizen decided to close his account, he should worry in advance that he does not have money.  Otherwise, cash will be issued upon termination of the contract with a financial institution. </p><h2>  Refusal and termination of the agreement </h2><p>  Do not think that opening an account is that simple.  In fact, the procedure for opening bank accounts (non-resident or resident - this is not so important) indicates that in some situations, citizens and organizations may be refused to conclude an agreement or terminate the agreement by force.  When is this possible? </p><p>  Usually the conditions are written in the contract itself.  But if we talk about early or forced termination, then, as a rule, citizens are given this opportunity if: </p><ul><li>  the bank does not fulfill its obligations; </li><li>  financial company ceases operations; </li><li>  the account owner refuses his own obligations. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, if a person has opened an account, he usually closes it at his own request.  And there are no problems with this. </p>

    <p>  Refusals to conclude a contract may also follow.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter which company it is planned to open an account with.  The main thing is that there are reasons why legal entities, as well as the general population, have every right to refuse. </p><p>  When is this possible?  At the moment, the following options are most often distinguished: </p><ul><li>  provision of an incomplete package of securities; </li><li>  Inconsistency between the status of the applicant and the account (for example, individuals cannot open a budget account); </li><li>  falsification of documents; </li><li>  <span>liquidation of the applicant organization.</span> </li></ul><p>  Perhaps that‚Äôs all.  Groundlessly, no one has the right to prohibit opening accounts.  Therefore, if there is no significant reason for refusal, you can complain about the financial organization.  And it‚Äôs best to open an account in another company.  Where conscientious employees work. </p><h2>  For the bank </h2><p>  The procedure for opening an account to organizations in the bank (or individuals) is now understood.  But this is only on the part of the applicant.  Employees of financial companies should also know how to open an account.  After all, if you do not follow the established rules, certain problems will appear. </p><p>  All accounts must be entered in a special register.  All open deposits are recorded there.  They are made on the day of opening the zero balance on the account.  That is, at the time of conclusion of the contract. </p><p>  It should also be noted that when closing an account, it is entered in another journal.  The document in which information about the "deposit" will be stored is a journal of closed accounts.  It should be in every bank.  At the moment, it can be submitted both in electronic form and in paper.  The second option is required.  The account is entered into this journal after the termination of the agreement. </p><p>  Accordingly, the basis for the discovery of the studied component is the conclusion of an agreement with a citizen or organization.  The agreement is provided for signature to the parties in duplicate.  Legal entities also put their stamp.  Just like organizations.  But IP does not have to have a seal.  It is affixed only if the citizen has the appropriate facility.  Quite often, people simply take shape as entrepreneurs and do not make prints.  Enough of their signature. </p><p>  The basis for closing an account is nothing more than termination of the contract.  How it can happen has already been said.  Therefore, attention should be paid to this. </p><p>   ,  ,    ""    .       .          .      . </p>
