True, this process is accompanied by the collection of a fairly large list of various papers.  Some people ask: is it possible to take a loan with a copy of a passport or with photocopies of other documents?  And if there is such an opportunity, then how and where to bring the idea to life?  All this will be discussed further.  In fact, this issue plays an important role for many borrowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to take a loan with a copy of the passport" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1246752.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What do you need </h2><p>  To begin with, you will have to find out exactly what documents, in principle, are needed to get a loan.  After all, only then does (or does not) make sense to make copies.  Paperwork with this process is more than enough.  So if you are thinking about whether it is possible to take a loan from a copy of your passport, first find out what list of securities you need to present to the bank to apply for services. </p><p>  There is nothing difficult to remember here.  First of all, you must present any <span>identification document.</span>  This is usually a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  If he is not there, it does not matter, but many banks refuse to issue a loan.  Secondly, you need a written application for a loan, as well as a certificate of your income (2-NDFL, work book, 3-NDFL, billing statements, service agreements).  Thirdly, you will be asked for the TIN, SNILS and military ID (for men under 27 years old).  Additionally, a certificate of marriage / divorce, the birth of children, a <span>marriage contract</span> (if any) are required.  As soon as you collect a full package of documents, contact them at the bank for a loan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Copies </h2><p>  Now what?  Often people ask themselves: is it possible to take a loan from a copy of a passport and TIN?  This is a completely normal interest, which is manifested by most citizens.  After all, it is not always possible to present the original document. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to take a loan from a copy of a passport" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1246753.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, it is easy to guess that a copy of any document in itself does not have any legal force whatsoever.  Maybe it's a fake.  Just a piece of paper on which something is written.  Therefore, if you are interested in whether it is possible to take a loan with a copy of your passport and SNILS, the answer should be very clear: no, you can‚Äôt.  After all, it is possible that you are a scammer.  The main role here is played by the fact that copies of documents by themselves do not have any legal force.  So, it‚Äôs impossible to use them in the implementation of certain transactions.  Unless the bank employee himself will take a copy from the original, and then attach it to the full package of documents.  But the script is still used! </p><h2>  Certification </h2><p>  But the solution to our question does not end there.  It's no secret that any copy can be notarized.  And then she will have at least some power.  Very often this is done when they cannot or do not want to present the original documents when applying to one or another authority. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Is it possible to take a loan from a copy of a passport that has been certified by a notary?  Honestly, a moot point.  If we act within the framework of the law, then we can again answer quite clearly: no.  When applying for <span>a loan</span> or a loan, you must present only the originals of your documents.  Especially passports, TIN and SNIL, and this also applies to income certificates. </p><p>  Thus, even if you have a certified photocopy, the chances of receiving services from the bank are almost zero.  And it is right.  Indeed, a notary public simply confirms that the copy is valid.  He cannot certify that the original document was in front of him.  So do not be surprised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to take a loan from a copy of another person‚Äôs passport?" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1246754.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Practice </h2><p>  But we all live in the modern world.  And in Russia, far from always everything is done according to the law.  Therefore, sometimes, wondering if it is possible to take a loan with a copy of your passport, you will be able to get a positive answer.  According to the law, as already mentioned, there is no such possibility and will not be.  In any case, no amendments to the law that give copies of legal force are not being developed. </p><p>  But in practice, there are exceptions.  Yes, there is nothing to do in large banks with copies of any documents - not a single conscientious company will take on such a big responsibility.  Therefore, here it is already lucky - someone makes concessions and works with photocopies, while someone does not.  Most often, of course, you run the risk of being refused, but you can also rely on the approval of your application.  It is not just that many without originals manage to get a loan or a loan. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  What to do to have a better chance of success in our current issue?  Can I get a loan from a copy of my passport?  We have already found out that, in principle, such a prospect exists.  Although not on an ongoing basis and not in all cases.  Nevertheless, there is advice that will help you in solving the problem. </p><p>  If you want to get a positive answer to the question of whether it is possible to take a loan with a copy of your passport and other documents, do not contact large organizations and banks for services.  Either private companies or financial associations such as microloans (for example, "Quick Money") are suitable for this purpose.  Such communities often do not focus too much on documents.  True, there is a possibility that you will have problems in the future, for example, with payments.  This will have to be taken into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to take a loan with a copy of the passport and inn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1246750.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Remember: there is nothing to do in large banks with copies of documents.  You can attach them to the application, but the originals will still be required of you without fail.  If you need to replace a particular paper, do it first.  And only then get a loan. </p><h2>  Scammers </h2><p>  Most often, fraudsters are interested in our current issue.  They constantly think whether it is possible to take a loan from a copy of another person‚Äôs passport.  In general, as we have already seen, the answer definitely will not work.  In principle, it is possible, but very difficult to bring the idea to life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to take a loan from a copy of a passport and snls" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1246751.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  However, if you contact the right organization, they will give you a copy.  From here a new way of fraud appeared.  More and more often, citizens find that they are ‚Äúhung up‚Äù with loans, which then need to be repaid.  In practice, this is usually either a microloan or simply not too large amounts.  If you notice that you have become a victim of such fraud, you should immediately contact the police for help.  Try to remember where you went with photocopies of your passport, this will help to catch criminals. </p>
