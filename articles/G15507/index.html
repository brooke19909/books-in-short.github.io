Embroidery is also attractive to those people who themselves are not fond of creativity.  There are a lot of subjects for embroidery.  After all, embroidery is an art.  Perhaps one of the most popular motives is the house.  Large old mansions, village houses, rural huts, fabulous palaces and small stylized images - there are many ideas for inspiration. </p><h2>  Cross-stitch patterns of houses - a dream or reality </h2><p>  The process of embroidery at home is not only entertaining, but also embodies, as embroiderers say, the dream of a safe, beautiful own house.  Magic consists in the embroidery process itself and positive thoughts, but the image does not affect the achievement of the goal.  The main thing is that you like the house.  Believe it or not, in any case, beautiful embroidery is the decoration of any room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.giyimcesitleri.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House Scheme" class="if uuid-3211222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116843/3211222.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose materials for embroidery and patterns </h2><p>  The answer is simple - expensive threads look better, it is easier to work with high-quality fabric.  It must be taken into account that the thickness of the threads corresponds to the size of the canvas.  Cross-stitch with a thread folded several times.  At the finished work, the fabric should not be visible.  If there is no experience in the independent selection of threads for the embroidery scheme at home, then you can always buy a ready-made kit.  To the scheme, as a rule, there are always recommendations.  If the experience is small - start with simple patterns, then you can embroider more and more complex pictures.  What are the schemes?  Multi-colored or black and white - the choice is purely individual.  If you are new, it‚Äôs easier to look at the color scheme.  But if cross-stitch patterns of houses contain close colors, it is easier to work with a black and white version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kanavice.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The embroidery scheme of the house" class="if uuid-3211221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116843/3211221.jpg"></div><h2>  Image of the house - a universal plot </h2><p>  Embroidery will harmoniously fit into any interior.  This is a great gift idea for dear and beloved people.  Embroidery is now in fashion, and the house is one of the most popular topics for needlewomen.  After all, this is the place where you want to return, where they are waiting for you and everything is filled with love and warmth.  Choose the scheme you like for yourself, since you can find a myriad of them.  The main thing is that you like it.  Small houses for needle beds, fragrant sachets and bags for cute little things come to life very quickly, and bring joy for a long time.  These are interesting patterns for cross stitch with children.  Cross stitch patterns of houses, usually equipped with a color matching card.  If it is not, in thumbnails the color of the threads is easy to choose or change according to the mood, taking the colors from your own.  This embroidery "Fairy houses" isn't that cute?  And how many places to use! </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House and orange trees" class="if uuid-3211229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116843/3211229.jpg"></div><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  It is important not to pull the fabric while attaching it to the hoop.  Otherwise, the embroidery will appear untidy.  Watch the thread tension.  Do not let the crosses pull the fabric.  Try to choose a hoop so that you don‚Äôt change their location.  A stretched cross-stitch house loses its attractive appearance.  There is no desire to give the picture volume or to focus on some elements of the house?  Embroider the whole pattern the same, a certain number of threads.  If you want to highlight some details of the house, you can embroider in more threads.  With this technique, work takes on a more realistic look.  These nuances are usually displayed on diagrams.  The same effect can be achieved by combining embroidery threads and beads, which is great, for example, for flowers and plants.  In addition, this effect is achieved by alternating cross-stitch and half-cross embroidery.  A cross stitch patterns of houses, as a rule, contain it.  This technique is good for sky or water.  This "House in the Forest" scheme is for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House in the forest" class="if uuid-3211225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116843/3211225.jpg"></div><p>  Pay attention to the back.  She is hidden from view.  Many nodes will make the image uneven.  The ends of the threads should be hidden under the already embroidered crosses.  Finally, do not thread too long a thread into the needle.  She will get confused and slow down the process. </p>
