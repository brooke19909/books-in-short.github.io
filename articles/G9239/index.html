    <p>  The second major shareholder (39.35%) is Shishkhanov‚Äôs uncle, Mikhail Safarbekovich Gutseriev.  He is the founder of a family owned banking business.  Born in Ingushetia, Gutseriev made a fortune from scratch.  Now Mikhail Safarbekovich is the owner of the oil company AO NK RussNeft JSC, the coal mining corporation Russian Coal OJSC, PJSC Mopromstroy (a company building skyscrapers in the capital).  The famous oligarch Gutseriev is a creative person.  He writes poetry for songs from almost childhood and is a member of the Writers' Union. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Less than 1.23% of the shares are distributed among the small shareholders of Binbank PJSC. </p><p>  The feedback from employees already working under the leadership of Shishkhanov and Gutseriev gives a lot of valuable information to the applicants. </p><h2>  About an HR interview </h2><p>  Both experienced specialists and university graduates sincerely rejoice when they read announcements that there is work at Binbank.  Employee reviews, however, make it clear: getting a position in a financial institution is quite difficult.  Firstly, the "entrance exam" includes many stages.  Secondly, interviewers do not behave too tactfully towards candidates. </p>

    <p>  We will tell you a little more about how the selection of future members of the Binbank PJSC team is going.  <span>Employee reviews (Moscow</span> - the city where the organization‚Äôs central office is located) contain the opinion that interviews are unprofessional.  Vacancy announcements attract many job seekers because they will be hired within 1-2 hours after the interview.  However, this promise is not true. </p><p>  In fact, it turns out that the HR specialists who conduct the first stage of the interview do not know what positions they select applicants for and what responsibilities they will have to perform.  The personnel officers are also silent about the conditions of the employment contract: salary, work schedule.  The representative of the HR service makes public only the information that is already stated in the text of the vacancy announcement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The task of the personnel department, apparently, is to make up a general impression of the applicant.  To this end, questions are asked: </p><ul><li>  Why do you want to work in our organization? </li><li>  What is interesting for you this position? </li><li>  Who do you see yourself in the future? </li></ul><p>  Many candidates are embarrassed by the free form of clothing of interviewers at Binbank PJSC.  Employee reviews report that the applicant for the interview should be dressed in accordance with the dress code ‚Äúwhite top - black bottom‚Äù adopted by the company.  HR professionals dress up in frayed jeans and colored T-shirts or sweaters.  This creates discomfort in communication, as well as the fact that interviews, according to reviews, are most often conducted in very crowded rooms. </p><p>  Many people report bad interview experiences, although they really needed a job at Binbank.  Employee reviews give the impression that the candidate, before sending a resume to the company, should familiarize yourself with the rules for passing a stress interview. </p><p>  The first stage of the interview ends with the fact that the applicant is asked to fill out a questionnaire for the security service. </p><h2>  Interview with a security representative </h2><p>  In the questionnaire, the candidate must indicate not only work experience, but also detailed information about the biography: </p><ul><li>  date and place of birth; </li><li>  the presence or absence of a criminal record; </li><li>  Bank loans, loans; </li><li>  property owned; </li><li>  FULL NAME.  all family members and their place of work. </li></ul><p>  Many applicants are indignant, because before they disclose full information about themselves, they want to know exactly what position they are considering and what are the conditions for cooperation. </p><p>  After filling out the questionnaire, the candidate for the position is invited to an interview with a security representative.  In this interview, as reported in the reviews, they ask not only about family members, but also about friends and acquaintances with whom the applicant speaks closely: what are their names, surnames, where they study, work, what positions they hold?  Many job seekers do not understand why the employer needs this information. </p><h2>  Polygraph test </h2><p>  An interview with a security service is a necessary step in getting a job at any bank.  Experienced applicants are used to it.  However, Binbank is not limited to a standard check.  The next step here is a polygraph test (lie detector).  Ultrasensitive sensors are connected to the body of the subject, after which questions are asked one by one: </p><ul><li>  Was the applicant in prison? </li><li>  Was he convicted? </li><li>  Does it have outstanding debts? </li></ul><p>  Interviewers ask a lot of questions regarding the state of health, which candidates do not like. </p>

    <p>  The reviews report that the device often gives the result ‚Äúfalse‚Äù in the event that the applicant tells the truth, but is very worried.  Those who passed the polygraph test say that this procedure is very humiliating.  The applicants were openly accused of lying and denied them further stages of the interview. </p><h2>  Intellectual Development Test </h2><p>  According to reviews, it is quite complicated.  The test includes questions both for solving problems in mathematics and for checking encyclopedic knowledge.  The purpose of the test is to check the level of intellectual development of the applicant and his quick wits.  For example, there may be a question: which poet wrote the poetic lines given in the test? </p><h2>  Interview with the boss </h2><p>  Only at the last stages of the selection is <span>an interview</span> conducted <span>with the head of the</span> profile unit.  During this interview, working conditions are discussed.  Often, individual items of the applicant are not satisfied, and he is annoyed that a lot of time wasted. </p><h2>  Apparatus employed </h2><p>  Often, reviews contain information that HR specialists do not directly speak about the refusal of a device to work.  There are also cases when the applicant was informed of a positive response and accepted for the position.  Preparing to sign the contract.  The applicant was deregistered at the labor exchange.  But a few days later, the post was reduced in PJSC Binbank.  The new employee was again left without work and already without the benefits and allowances stipulated by law. </p><h2>  About income </h2><p>  Currently, a very small salary has been set at Binbank.  Employee reviews confirm this.  The specialist‚Äôs income consists of the minimum salary and bonus, the amount of which depends on the level of performance of the business plan indicators.  At present, the target ratios are set very high, which gives management the right to reduce employee salaries.  If a personal business plan is not fulfilled for at least one set of indicators, the premium is not paid. </p><p>  It is interesting to study the feedback of employees on this topic about PJSC Binbank.  St. Petersburg is a city in which a very large and developed branch of the company is open.  Managers working in this department receive a fixed salary of 20 thousand rubles.  Income tax is deducted from this amount.  The premium is not more than 300 rubles.  in month </p><p>  In the event that the employee fulfilled the plan, but quit before receiving the well-deserved bonus, remuneration over the salary is no longer paid to him. </p><p>  According to reviews, salaries are paid on time.  But you can get good prizes on a regular basis and move up the career ladder only if you devote yourself entirely to work, relegating family matters to the background. </p><p>  The social package at Bibank is not too generous.  The organization does not pay for voluntary health insurance.  Lending privileges for employees are minimal - the level of interest rates is the same as for clients on salary projects.  In descriptions of some vacancies at Binbank, free lunches and snacks for coffee breaks are reported.  In reality, these nice little things are missing. </p><h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  According to the reviews, the work schedule is very busy.  The volume of work is large, it is impossible to manage to complete the necessary tasks within the 8-hour day.  Almost every evening you need to linger.  In most Moscow branches, you can‚Äôt leave the <span>workplace</span> until you have reported on what has been done in a day.  However, many managers are ready to listen to subordinates no earlier than at seven or eight in the evening. </p><p>  Almost all bank employees work informally on weekends.  Processing is not paid extra.  The city in which often indignant comments are left on this topic about PJSC Binbank is Ulyanovsk.  Employee reviews indicate that employees want to have free Saturdays and Sundays, as well as receive annual leave on time. </p><h2>  Workplace, working conditions </h2><p>  Office facilities at Binbank are good.  Reviews confirm this.  In general, employees are satisfied with the interior of the workrooms and their arrangement.  There are all necessary office equipment and stationery.  Some employees of Moscow offices express dissatisfaction with the fact that there are no parking lots near the bank‚Äôs buildings.  This is a great difficulty for both employees and its customers. </p>

    <p>  Note that in different branches, managers express different opinions about working conditions.  One of the cities in which they express positive opinions about how the workflow is structured at PJSC Binbank is Samara.  Employee reviews report that dissatisfaction is caused only by software imperfection.  But they do not consider this a significant minus. </p><p>  But there are also very negative reviews about the work in the branches of PJSC Binbank.  Yekaterinburg is the city where several branches of the organization are located.  Many employees express the opinion that the document management is very poorly organized in this branch.  Papers are often lost. </p><h2>  Communication with management </h2><p>  According to the reviews of employees, a career at Binbank PJSC is more dependent on personal relationships with the manager than directly on the professional qualities of the employee. </p><p>  Individual employees have a strong internal resistance in response to the demands of their superiors.  For example, employees of the call center argue that it is not at all important for management whether the specialist answers customer questions.  The main indicator of the quality of work is the number of insurance sold to people who called.  The city in which they also speak negatively about the leadership of Binbank PJSC is Kazan.  Employee reviews are unflattering.  The head of the department does not consider employees, humiliating them. </p>

    <p>  Such comments alarms many who want to get a job at PJSC Binbank.  The collection department (reviews confirm this fact) is another division in which vacancies often open.  But former employees do not recommend getting there.  On new, not yet proven specialists, the mistakes and shortcomings of colleagues can be ‚Äúhanged‚Äù. </p><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  There are quite a few positive reviews about the team in various branches and divisions of the bank.  One gets the impression that the employees working side by side are rallying, ready to help each other.  Most employees have good friendly relations with colleagues. </p><h2>  Corporate culture </h2><p>  Most employees of the bank positively evaluate the <span>corporate culture of the</span> company.  The reviews report that a lot of activities are carried out aimed at <span>uniting the team.</span>  Holidays are often celebrated together.  Happy birthday to employees. </p><p>  There are also many trainings and seminars aimed at improving the skills of employees.  Therefore, many careerists value Binbank, considering it as a good school, where you can find useful knowledge, skills and experience. </p><h2>  Dress code </h2><p>  In almost all positions, the uniform ‚Äúblack bottom - white top‚Äù has been established.  In the descriptions of many vacancies, it is reported that employees are provided with free suits for working in the office.  This, however, is not true.  New employees are most often unable to pick up clothes of the right size. </p><h2>  Reviews about the work of cashiers </h2><p>  Many are curious to know how reviews of cashier employees sound about PJSC Binbank.  After all, this particular vacancy is most often open in the organization.  The turnover among employees of the cash register, apparently, is quite large.  Reviews report that there are frequent cases of simultaneous dismissal of three or more operational workers at their own request.  What is the reason for this?  There is an opinion that with unbearable working conditions in PJSC Binbank.  Employee reviews (Ufa is another city where bank branches are located) report that cashiers have virtually no lunch.  Meals are allowed only fast, during 10-15-minute technical breaks. </p><p>  Specialists responsible for working with cash are regularly checked for knowledge of new instructions.  To pass professional tests, you must arrive 2 hours earlier.  These refineries are also not paid or compensated by free time.  In emergency cases, cashiers are called to work at night.  Audits are carried out without warning and much more often than it relies on the instructions of the Central Bank. </p>

    <p>  What else is there about PJSC ‚ÄúBinbank‚Äù reviews of cashier employees?  Specialists responsible for working with cash receive small salaries of 13-15 thousand rubles.  It is unprofitable for them to participate in the ‚Äúfolds‚Äù of corporate events.  Cashiers are of the opinion that such spending should be voluntary.  However, it is not yet possible to refuse to deposit funds into the general budget at Binbank. </p><p>  There are also positive reviews.  Many cashiers recall with warmth in their souls the years of work in a financial organization.  They not only improved their own professional level, but also trained new employees from scratch. </p><h2>  Freelance Agent Reviews </h2><p>  Binbank has a number of vacancies that do not include the inclusion of an employee in the staff.  You can work at home, selling financial products over the phone, and receive agent fees for this.  True, getting a job like this, you should be extremely careful.  Sometimes, under the guise of HR specialists on the Internet, existing agents of the bank can communicate with you.  They fraudulently try to sell any banking service to applicants. </p>
