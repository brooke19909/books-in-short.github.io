The trade union boss was the right hand of the party secretary and participated in the distribution of intangible goods: housing, vouchers to sanatoriums and others.  Union property was strictly controlled by the party. </p><h2>  VTsSPS: abbreviation </h2><p>  The Central Council of Trade Unions was created at the First Congress of Trade Unions in 1918.  From 1918 to 1922, the abbreviation of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions was deciphered by the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions.  The USSR was created in 1922, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic entered it as an allied.  Therefore, the decoding of the abbreviation of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has changed a little - the letter B did not mean All-Russian, but All-Union.  He bore this name until 1991, when he announced self-dissolution. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Workers began to unite in trade unions with the advent of cities. </p><p>  In antiquity, the advice of artisans and merchants had a great influence on the life of policies.  On the territory of Russia, the first references to associations of merchants and craftsmen and their elders appeared in Novgorod birch bark letters of the 9th century.  But these were all associations of owners.  Wage workers began to unite in trade unions from the 18th century in England, and in Europe from the 19th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;The right to strike&quot;" class="if uuid-2278931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72468/2278931.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, the first trade unions appeared in the second half of the 19th century, but until the beginning of the 20th century they were semi-legal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the turn of the 20th century, trade unions were politicized throughout the world, and they came under the influence of social democrats and anarchists.  In Russia, from 1903 to 1917, almost all workers were covered by unions and their associations. </p><h2>  From classic trade unions to a faithful assistant to the party </h2><p>  In Russia, trade unions took an active part in all three revolutions.  The right-wing Social Democrats and Mensheviks set the tone in them.  After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks, having seized full political power in the country, began to fight for full control over the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.  Using the conditions of the dictatorship, the Bolsheviks were able to oust the Mensheviks and representatives of other parties from all the governing bodies of the All-Russian Council.  The Council finally came under the control of the CPSU (B.) To the Third Congress of Trade Unions in 1920. </p><p>  The All-Russian Council played a large role in providing workers with food.  Together with the party commissars, emissaries of trade unions were also part of the food detachments requisitioning food from the peasants. </p><p>  In 1930, with the union of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the USSR and the People‚Äôs Commissariat of Labor of the USSR, the final merger of the All-Union Council and the Bolshevik state took place.  The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has ceased to be a classical trade union defending the rights of workers, and has become an instrument of control over workers and the production process. </p><p>  Membership in trade unions has become almost mandatory, a union cell has been created at every enterprise and in every organization.  Full control over the life of the enterprise was carried out by the so-called "triangles" - administration, party organizer and trade union organization.  They took increased labor obligations, distributed bonuses and <span>intangible goods:</span> apartments, vouchers to sanatoriums, scarce goods allocated by order. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="22-91.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The honorary badge of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions" class="if uuid-2278945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72468/2278945.jpg"></div><p>  The unions got a huge amount of real estate requisitioned from the nobility and the bourgeoisie.  In these mansions and estates, sanatoriums, holiday homes, summer camps for workers and their children were opened.  One of the best mansions in large cities and capitals of the Union republics became the House of Trade Unions - the residence of the regional or republican Council. </p><h2>  Years of World War II </h2><p>  The trade unions at the call of the party led the transfer of industry to the military.  Military organization bonds were actively distributed among members of organizations; the largest of them transferred money for the construction of the so-called  "union" tanks and aircraft.  So, the members of the trade union organization of the Sverdlovsk Bakery and Macaroni Factory built the Battle Girlfriend tank at their meager expense. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tankfront.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Built at the expense of workers" class="if uuid-2279056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72468/2279056.jpg"></div><p>  Fight on such machines trusted the best fighters.  The vast majority of male union members went to the front, recognized as unfit for military service - in volunteer workers' battalions.  Many of them did not return from the battlefields. </p><h2>  Stagnation </h2><p>  During the years of stagnation, the final formalization and ossification of union life was completed.  The trade union committee turned into a division of the administration, even the term "trade union nodded" appeared.  The distribution of housing for employees and vouchers continued through the union.  Under Brezhnev, cars, imported furniture sets, and rare foreign trips to the countries of "people's democracy" were added to them.  The All-Union Council also included numerous courses and educational institutions that were not part of the Ministry of Education and DOSAAF. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gubernator96.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House of Trade Unions in Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2278934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72468/2278934.jpg"></div><p>  Collecting membership fees, the All-Union Council accumulated huge sums of money - 1% of any salary paid in the country.  This money was used to build new and repair old resorts, but most of the money went to help the so-called.  "progressive unions" abroad. </p><h2>  The end of the AUCCTU </h2><p>  In 1990, the All-Union Council announced its dissolution.  FNPR inherited the enormous property of the AUCCTU.  Decipher of the abbreviation of the heiress - Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia.  Most of the property has already changed owners and has turned into luxury housing and budget hotels and pensions.  The houses of the Trade Unions have for the most part been turned into business centers.  The influence of the FNPR among the workers of the trade union is constantly falling, the average age of members is growing, young people are ignoring associations that do not provide real support and protection. </p>
