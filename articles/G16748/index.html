One of the most popular holiday destinations at any time of the year is the Republic of Uzbekistan.  This hospitable country will pleasantly surprise even the most fastidious tourist. </p><h2>  Cities museums of Uzbekistan </h2><p>  Uzbekistan is a multinational country with a rich culture.  Not only indigenous people live here - Uzbeks, but also Tajiks, Russians, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Tatars, Turkmens, etc. In this ancient and at the same time modern country, you can see both ancient buildings, ancient minarets, mosques and palaces, and modern architecture. </p><p>  The local population believes that coming to Uzbekistan and not visiting cities such as Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara and Afrasiab is simply an unforgivable mistake.  These cities, like museums, abound with a large number of attractions that must be visited. </p><p>  It is best to come to Uzbekistan in the summer.  The abundance of greenery and flowers make it especially charming.  Although at other times of the year it is no less beautiful. </p><h2>  Tashkent is a city of friendship </h2><p>  Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.  This city consists of two parts - the old and the new.  In old Tashkent there are a large number of prehistoric architectural monuments, such as: </p><ul><li>  Kukeldash Madrasah; </li><li>  Hazrat Imam architectural complex; </li><li>  Barahan Madrasah; </li><li>  Mosques Namozgoh and Tilo Sheikh. </li></ul><p>  New Tashkent is no less beautiful.  In this part of the city, infrastructure is very developed.  It abounds in parks, squares, museums, cultural centers and modern buildings.  The new city was built to replace the old one after the earthquake that happened in 1966. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Architects and workers from different countries came to help the city, who rebuilt the city from scratch, while creating objects similar to those that were in their homeland.  The restored Tashkent became even more beautiful, and the local population christened it the city of <span>Friendship of Peoples</span> in tribute to the help that was provided to them by other republics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eastroute.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tashkent city" class="if uuid-2632654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2632654.jpg"></div><p>  You can move around the city by taxi, as well as by bus or metro.  After graduating from sightseeing, you can go to another historical city - Samarkand. </p><h2>  Samarkand </h2><p>  The length of the road from Tashkent to Samarkand is about 308 km, so getting to the city by taxi is not worth it - it can fly into a pretty penny.  Traveling by taxi and bus is far from the only way of intercity communication. </p><p>  You can get to the city you need on the Tashkent - Samarkand train.  This route is very popular, as you can visit other historical places of Uzbekistan along this route.  Having reached Samarkand and booked a hotel room, you can immediately go on an excursion.  There really is something to see here.  The city is simply replete with cultural heritage sites that silently narrate about the life of the Tajik and Uzbek people.  The most popular attractions of Samarkand are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the complex of mausoleums of Shahi Zinda; </li><li>  Bibi Honum Mosque; </li><li>  Mausoleum of Gur Emir; </li><li>  observatory. <div class="photo" data-original="www.eastroute.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samarkand city" class="if uuid-2632652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2632652.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  But even besides these fascinating historical monuments, the city has something to surprise every tourist with: on the local market you can buy pottery, fancifully curved daggers, colorful fabrics and much more.  But, saturated with spiritual food, it is not a sin to taste bodily.  Indeed, local food is simply mesmerizing with its vibrant taste.  Delicious <span>rich cakes,</span> steaming pilaf, fragrant shurpa, sambusa, manti - all this can be tasted in local establishments, and the prices are quite reasonable. </p><p>  After getting acquainted with the city of Samarkand, it's time to go to the <span>ancient city of Uzbekistan</span> - Afrasiab.  You can get there by train Afrosiab - Tashkent - Samarkand. </p><h2>  Fairytale Afrosiab </h2><p>  Afrosiab is a small settlement with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 200 hectares.  This ancient city is located in the north of modern Samarkand, on the Great Silk Road.  Once upon a time, life in this city was in full swing.  Caravans stopped at local shelters for travelers and traded at the local bazaar.  Afrosiab Bazaar was very famous for a variety of goods, both local and foreign production.  At present, Afrosiab is a museum city where you can come to see the ancient settlement and take pictures for memory. </p><p>  Afrosiab, once considered the capital of Sogd, is now almost deserted.  Only occasionally in the ancient settlement can one observe a crowd of tourists studying the history of Central Asia or scientists conducting excavations on its outskirts.  Despite its antiquity, the ancient settlement Afrosiab has not lost its attractiveness.  Walking along the streets (guzars), you can admire the ancient mosques, workshops and residential buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.centralasia-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruins of afrasiab" class="if uuid-2634033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2634033.jpg"></div><h2>  Bukhara </h2><p>  No less beautiful is the city of Bukhara.  This city along with Samarkand is considered an object of cultural heritage.  However, life in this city is more measured in comparison with other large cities of Uzbekistan.  You can get to Bukhara by train, Tashkent-Samarkand-Bukhara bus or by minibus, which is considered a rather expensive pleasure.  Bukhara is famous for its attractions, therefore, to explore everything, one day will not be enough.  It is advisable to plan your movement around the city in advance and carefully consider your route. </p><p>  History buffs will like objects such as: </p><ul><li>  Ark fortress; </li><li>  mausoleum of the Samanids; </li><li>  Sitorai Mohi Hosa Residence; </li><li>  Poi Kolyan complex, in turn, this complex is divided into three objects: a mosque, a madrasah and a minaret; </li><li>  Madrasah Chor-Minor; </li><li>  Laby house; </li><li>  monument to Khoja Nasriddin. <div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gateway to Bukhara" class="if uuid-2634136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2634136.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  But even those who are completely indifferent to history can discover a lot of new things by visiting the Ovation fashion theater, the gold workshop, the local market and local restaurants.  Even true gourmets will appreciate the taste and benefits of the dishes on offer.  Here you can try oriental sweets (sorbet, the famous Bukhara halva), as well as barbecue, jazz (fried meat), kavurdok (stew), lagman and the famous <span>Bukhara pilaf.</span> </p><p>  Traveling to these historic cities of Uzbekistan is attractive, first of all, because they are all located along the way, and to explore them, you do not need to spend a lot of time on the road.  And the local flavor, attractions and culinary delights will not leave indifferent any tourist. </p>
