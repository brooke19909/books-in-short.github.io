  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow of the 19th century: photos and historical facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it is difficult to imagine that just a couple of centuries ago Moscow was not a capital, but a provincial city.  The emperors still held their coronation here, but the rest of the lives of local residents were far from the capital's gloss.  Serious adversity fell on Moscow‚Äôs share, which is what its occupation of Napoleon‚Äôs troops and a great fire was worth.  When the Russian troops returned to the city, it was almost completely destroyed.  But Moscow did not lose its value, in just a few decades it was completely rebuilt.  Many buildings of that era were not preserved, but you can still see some of them today, just walking around the city. </p><p>  We will tell in this article about the difficult history of the city in the 19th century.  Photos of Moscow at that time you can also see below. </p><h2>  Timeline </h2><p>  To better understand how the city developed throughout the 19th century, it is worth first to talk about its approximate chronology.  Conventionally, historians divide the whole century into several stages.  At the beginning of the century, Paul I had a serious influence on the lives of local residents, whom contemporaries did not like at all.  And although he was killed in 1801, but his actions greatly affected the development of the city.  After the death of Paul in Moscow there were magnificent celebrations.  They were dedicated to the new emperor Alexander.  Even after the capital was transferred to St. Petersburg, the tradition of weddings to the kingdoms in Moscow was preserved and existed until the 1917 revolution, when the monarchy was overthrown. </p><p>  The history of Moscow of the 19th century is difficult to imagine without the French occupation.  This is another important step distinguished by historians in the chronology of events.  The city was partially destroyed and plundered.  But it was precisely after the occupation that the active restoration of Moscow began.  From the old provincial city, it quickly turned into a large commercial and industrial center.  Contemporaries themselves later noted that Moscow, several decades after its ruin, began to look even more beautiful than before. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And of course, telling about the history of Moscow, one cannot but mention the second half of the 19th century.  The city did not experience serious shocks during this period, but continued to develop actively.  It was at this time that the best architectural monuments of Moscow of the 19th century were created, which are partially preserved to this day. </p><p>  We will tell about each of the stages of the chronology in more detail. </p><h2>  The early years of the new century and the reign of Paul I </h2><p>  Moscow lost the status of the capital at the beginning of the 18th century, when Peter I transferred it to St. Petersburg under construction.  He did not like that in her own way she froze in time and could not develop at the pace that he wanted.  And in the early years of the 19th century, Moscow maintained its status as a provincial and quiet city.  Well-to-do noble families still lived here, who were descended from the ancient boyars.  But still, most of them continued to flock to St. Petersburg, where it was possible to build a military career and achieve success in the public service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="classpic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow panorama" class="if uuid-3234779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234779.jpg"></div><p>  Moscow of the 19th century is <span>a provincial city,</span> but nevertheless, it was touched by the peculiar policy of Paul I, which pushed many contemporaries from it.  During his reign, many secret agents appeared on the streets of the city who tried to find out what the rich and influential nobles thought of the emperor.  The government gradually introduced more censorship for local residents.  For example, they had to warn the city authorities about holding balls and festivals.  At such events, the police must have been present.  Restrictions were imposed on printing buildings.  And at the very beginning of the XIX century, the English club, beloved by Muscovites, was closed - it was in it that representatives of the Moscow nobility gathered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not surprising that Muscovites did not like Paul I. Therefore, his death in 1801 did not upset them.  On the contrary, local residents began to actively celebrate and prepare for the coming coronation of a new ruler - Emperor Alexander I. </p><h2>  Coronation of Alexander I </h2><p>  After a short period of the reign of Paul I, Moscow in the early 19th century was greatly transformed.  The locals were in full swing preparing for the coronation of the newly made emperor Alexander, who arrived in the city in September 1801.  But preparation was conducted all summer.  It is known that local merchants and nobles managed to raise a lot of money to build solemn triumphal arches and pavilions.  However, the emperor did not approve of their initiative.  He advised them to invest the funds raised in the construction of more useful buildings - schools and hospitals. </p><p>  Alexander arrived in Moscow in September 1801.  He was married to the kingdom in the Assumption Cathedral with his wife.  It is noteworthy that after the triumph, the emperor took a horse ride through the streets of the city, where he was greeted by enthusiastic locals.  All of Paul‚Äôs unpopular decisions were reversed, and Moscow breathed a sigh of relief.  Alexander himself soon left the city, but the festivities did not subside for several more weeks. </p><h2>  French occupation </h2><p>  In the years following the coronation of Alexander, the city lived a quiet life.  The calm of local residents was disrupted by World War II, which broke out in 1812.  Russian troops could not stop Napoleon, who invaded the country.  They gradually went deeper into Russia, pushing aside the general battle.  And they stopped only at the approaches to Moscow, not far from Borodino.  The battle was not successful for the Russian troops, although it cannot be called devastating either.  One way or another, the command, led by Kutuzov, decided to leave the ancient capital of Russia and give it to the enemy.  This event greatly influenced Moscow in the 19th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zabytye-slova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire in Moscow" class="if uuid-3234787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234787.jpg"></div><p>  Entering the city, the invaders were disappointed with what they saw.  Almost all the inhabitants and troops left the city.  Napoleon was also very angry because he hoped for the humiliating surrender of Muscovites.  But no one was left in the city.  In addition, the French, tired of the war, began to loot. </p><p>  Immediately after Napoleon‚Äôs troops entered Moscow, information about arson began to appear.  The French were sure that they were satisfied with the locals.  A strong fire broke out only after a few days, when the wind rose, which did not weaken for more than a day.  The fire destroyed most of the city and forced Napoleon to ask Alexander for peace.  But he received no answer.  The fire destroyed not only buildings, but also supplies that were supposed to support the French army.  In order not to starve to death in winter, Napoleon was forced to leave Moscow and try to return to his homeland. </p><p>  But before that, he defiled Moscow and the ancient monuments of its architecture.  It is known that Napoleon ordered the placement of stables in the ancient temples of the city.  In October 1812, French troops left Moscow.  But before that, Napoleon ordered the Kremlin to be blown up.  He was badly damaged, but was not completely destroyed.  A few days later, Russian troops returned to the city.  Gradually, the restoration of Moscow began. </p><h2>  Restoration of the city after the occupation </h2><p>  There was no sadder event for Moscow in the 19th century than the French occupation and the devastating fire.  But local residents did not spare the funds to restore their beloved city.  Everywhere at this time on the streets of the city one could hear the sound of axes and the sound of a saw.  The revival of the ruined buildings was proceeding rapidly.  In a matter of weeks, new buildings appeared on the site of the burnt buildings.  A special commission was responsible for the restoration of the city, headed by an architect of Italian origin, Beauvais, who spent most of his life in Russia.  He made sure that new buildings were built in the same style, creating the unique look of patriarchal Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow streets" class="if uuid-3234783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234783.jpg"></div><p>  The central part of the city, which was almost completely rebuilt, underwent the most changes.  First of all, they reconstructed Red Square.  Unappealing externally malls were closed here.  In 1818, a sculpture of Minin and Pozharsky was placed on the square.  This was the first monument unveiled in Moscow. </p><p>  For the improvement of the city, the Neglinnaya River was enclosed in an underground pipe, since water constantly came out of its banks and eroded the streets.  Not far from the walls of the Kremlin, Beauvais ordered to set up a large garden, which later became known as Alexandrovsky. </p><p>  Contemporaries noted that Moscow at the beginning of the 19th century completely rebuilt and changed greatly, becoming only more beautiful.  Fortunately, ancient sights and Orthodox churches were practically not affected.  A few months after the departure of the French troops, Moscow began to live the same life. </p><h2>  Decembrists in Moscow </h2><p>  It is traditionally believed that Moscow of the 19th century was far from the hectic political life of St. Petersburg.  This is partly a true statement, but some of its echoes still reached the locals.  So, in Moscow, the Decembrists were actively involved.  There were fewer of them here than in St. Petersburg and in the south of the country, but nevertheless they played their role in organizing the movement.  It is known that in 1817 they planned an assassination attempt on Alexander I, who was just visiting Moscow on a visit.  He participated in the celebrations dedicated to the opening of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky, and also visited the site of the construction of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  But the Decembrists did not dare to realize their plans. </p><p>  But they tried to support their associates during the Decembrist uprising in 1825.  They planned to march with their troops the day after the start of St. Petersburg, but were late, as he was crushed almost immediately.  And a few days later, the arrests began in Moscow.  All members of this secret society were promptly arrested. </p><h2>  Moscow of the second half of the 19th century </h2><p>  The second half of the XIX century stood out for Muscovites calmer than the first.  At this time, the city continued to actively build up and grow.  Houses in Moscow of the 19th century were increasingly being built of stone, so some of them have survived today.  Walking through the streets of the city, you can see the apartment building on Difficult Street, which was recognized as a cultural monument of regional significance.  In addition, the first Moscow Catholic church and mosque built in the middle of the century have survived to this day.  It was at this time that the characteristic architectural style of Moscow of the 19th century appeared, combining the traditions of Russian architecture and classicism. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin view" class="if uuid-3234781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234781.jpg"></div><p>  In 1851, Moscow was connected with St. Petersburg with the first railway in Russia.  Now the residents of the two cities could freely travel back and forth in a short time.  The station building is also preserved.  Previously, it was called Petersburg, but now it is renamed Leningradsky. </p><p>  In 1861, the population of Moscow increased markedly.  Flocked peasants from all regions of the country flocked here, trying to find a good job.  Therefore, the city began to grow rapidly.  Instead of small mansions of the local nobility, they began to build multi-story stone buildings that did not differ in exquisite design.  Apartment buildings became popular.  These buildings were divided into several miniature apartments, where anyone could settle for a small fee. </p><h2>  End of a century </h2><p>  Moscow at the end of the 19th century is not just a provincial city, but a large industrial center.  The construction boom was beneficial for its development.  If before the French occupation less than 300 thousand people lived here, then by the end of the year the population exceeded 1 million.  The city became a center of industry and trade.  Not only numerous workers lived here, but also wealthy merchant and noble families.  However, Moscow has not lost its external patriarchal appearance.  Global changes will begin here only after the Bolsheviks came to power, who will return the city to its former capital status. </p><h2>  How did industry develop? </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, the leading industrial industry in the capital was the production of textiles.  In those years, there were several manufactories, but the largest of them belonged to the Prokhorov brothers.  It was built in 1799, but its heyday came in the postwar period.  After the liberation of Moscow from the French, the manufacture increased the production of textiles by almost 10 times.  Chintz, cashmere and semi-velvet, as well as scarves, were produced here.  Industry began to develop much faster at the end of the 19th century.  A huge number of freed peasants came to Moscow to earn money.  Over time, they formed new classes.  More and more workers, small traders and industrialists, as well as former soldiers who left the service, lived in the city.  Not only textile, but also paper, woodworking, food and chemical industries began to develop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow industry" class="if uuid-3234786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234786.jpg"></div><h2>  Trade in Moscow </h2><p>  No less rapidly growing trade.  In the photo of Moscow of the 19th century, one can see many richly decorated mansions, most of which belonged specifically to merchants who were able to break through from the very bottom and become real oligarchs.  The center of commercial life in Moscow throughout the course of the century has remained Gostiny Dvor.  After the fire, Beauvais restored the former appearance of the destroyed building.  Muscovites also actively traded on Tverskaya Street and Kuznechny Most.  In the 1820s, they began to sell clothes and shoes fashionable in those days.  Many stores opened, but almost all of them were owned by Europeans, not Russians.  In the second half of the century, trade developed so quickly that Muscovites often noted that the whole city is a large trading area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="classpic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shopping Galleries" class="if uuid-3234778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234778.jpg"></div><h2>  Muscovites lifestyle </h2><p>  At the beginning of the century, Muscovites lived a calm and measured way of life.  Everything changed after the fire and the rapid growth of industry.  Life in Moscow in the 19th century is a reflection of Russian culture.  Unlike St. Petersburg, oriented to the west, nobles and poor Muscovites greatly respected folk traditions.  Christmas season began the festivities, which included New Year's festivities and Shrovetide.  But before Lent, triumphs gradually ceased.  At this time, it was customary to close restaurants and taverns, because no one had visited them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liveinmsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Kremlin" class="if uuid-3234789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3234789.jpg"></div><p>  Nobles and merchants constantly organized balls, it was fashionable to visit theaters, exhibitions and fashion stores.  After Easter, Moscow was noticeably empty, because wealthy residents moved to their suburban estates.  Due to exhaust from factories and plants in the summer, smog appeared in the city.  They returned only in the middle of autumn. </p><h2>  Cultural life </h2><p>  In the XIX century, cultural life actively developed.  Museums, temples, monuments were built, which immediately fell in love with local residents.  In the first half of the century, Muscovites especially loved the performances.  Then the first theaters of Moscow of the 19th century were built.  They are still preserved.  Small was erected in 1824.  And a year later the construction of the Bolshoi Theater was completed.  Most often, cultural entertainment was available only to wealthy nobles and merchants.  Contemporaries recalled that they lived a truly festive life.  They constantly attended balls, masquerades, performances and other special occasions.  Incidentally, Leo Tolstoy describes them in detail in his novel War and Peace. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that Moscow has changed a lot over the 19th century.  From a provincial city, it turned into a large center of industry and trade.  It was this trend that allowed her to successfully successfully challenge the right of Petersburg to the title of the capital of Russia. </p>
