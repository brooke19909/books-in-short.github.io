    <h2>  The advent of the iPhone 4s </h2><p>  The legendary iPhone 4s was introduced to users in the fall of 2011.  The design repeated the previous <span>iPhone</span> 4 <span>model</span> , which many users liked because of the panel made of glass, a mirror logo and metal rims on the sides.  The difference in appearance between the devices was the placement of antennas on the case.  To improve communication, the Cupertinians in the new generation brought them on the sides, and not on top, as it was in the previous model.  The photos taken by the iPhone 4s can still be considered high-quality.  An innovation in this model was Siri - a virtual voice assistant. </p><p>  For the first time in the long years of the company's existence, the presentation of the new product was made by Tim Cook, the man who led Apple after Jobs.  Steve himself died just the day after the presentation of the gadget, and many experts are sure that it was Jobs‚Äôs death that influenced the commercial success of the iPhone 4s. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first problems in the functioning of the phone </h2><p>  When developing the device, the creators made a number of miscalculations.  After the start of sales, many users began to massively contact the service centers of the company with the claim that <span>WiFi</span> and Bluetooth <span>did not work</span> on the iPhone 4s.  After the diagnosis, experts found a marriage in the spare parts that are responsible for the performance of these functions.  The company recalled phones to replace components. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why wifi does not work on iphone 4s" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1326237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite this, part of the devices, as usual after the presentation, managed to get on the black market.  Most iPhone 4s went to countries where there were no official sales, so they could not be replaced.  These phones have not gone anywhere and are actively resold from hand to hand to this day.  If WiFi does not work on iPhone 4s, then most likely this device belonged to the first batch.  You can check this on the company‚Äôs website by driving an IMEI phone, where the assembly date will be indicated.  If the phone was assembled in 2012, then you can fix the problem by replacing the Wi-Fi module. </p><h2>  Demand for IPhone 4s Today </h2><p>  Although the iPhone 4s was discontinued in 2014, it is still actively sold.  There are many who want to become the owners of the legendary device.  This is facilitated by the relatively low cost of the device (from $ 80 to $ 150) and a large number of released devices.  Additionally, the phone has a stylish design with a glass case and features that are not inferior to competitors in terms of efficiency. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main advantage of this model is a fairly good speed, which provides a proprietary Apple A5 processor based on the IOS operating system.  Most modern games do not pull the phone, but for quick and comfortable surfing the Internet, it is more than suitable.  The device can connect to the network using GPRS, 3G or the built-in WiFi module.  The iPhone 4s 4G connection or, in other words, the LTE network mode does not work, since the release of the smartphone fell on the period of the origin of this type of communication, and many telecom operators at that time it was not yet supported. </p><h2>  What you need to know when purchasing an iPhone 4s </h2><p>  Those wishing to purchase iPhone 4s must take into account its age and be aware that some parts have worn out physically and require replacement, and be prepared for the fact that a number of parts could already be replaced. </p><p>  Checking the phone before buying, it is recommended to pay special attention to the working capacity of the connection, to the network level, to test the quality of Wi-Fi signal reception, to type standard SSD commands.  It is necessary to clarify whether the phone was under repair.  If it was being repaired, then you should not buy such a device.  As a rule, in service centers, original, branded spare parts are replaced with cheap Chinese counterparts. </p><p>  No need to be surprised if the network or WiFi does not work while checking the phone.  On the iPhone 4s, communication is ‚Äúthe weakest link‚Äù compared to other features.  The causes of malfunctions can be various factors.  For example, old parts, in this situation, you can solve the problem by replacing them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 4s wifi and bluetooth not working" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1326238.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  There are situations when users cannot understand why WiFi does not work on the iPhone 4s if the phone itself is in a metal protective case.  You need to understand that the antenna of the Wi-Fi module in this model is displayed on the side panel of the device in the form of a small plastic strip.  And the protective coating, which is made of dense material, muffles the signal level on the devices, thereby creating problems in their operation.  As a solution to the problem, it will be enough to replace the metal case with a silicone or plastic one. </p><p>  Another type of communication problem on the iPhone 4s is software malfunctions.  The reason for their occurrence may be the active and continuous use of the device. </p><h2>  A simple solution to Wi-Fi problems on iPhone 4s </h2><p>  If in the intensive use of the device the signal strength indicator on the iPhone 4s WiFi turned gray, the Internet does not work, then most likely the problem arose due to overheating of the Wi-Fi module.  You need to understand that it is in the same zone with the processor, which heats up very much during overloads, and its heat spreads to other parts.  No need to panic and run to the workshop.  Try simply turning off the device and leaving it alone for a few minutes.  When you turn it on again, the phone will work as usual, without any malfunctions.  In the future, actively using the phone, he will need to give at times a little rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 4s wifi turned gray not working" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1326240.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <p>  In situations where WiFi does not work on the iPhone 4s after updating the operating system, just roll back to a previous version.  If the rollback does not solve the problem, you need to make a hard resend on the device, while holding down the home and tab buttons, hold for 4-6 seconds, after which the gadget will reboot and all settings will be reset to factory settings. </p>
