  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a doll with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The abundance of a variety of toys in stores has led to the fact that folk crafts have been forgotten.  In the old days, every girl was the happy owner of a homemade doll.  For its manufacture, straw, shreds and wooden chocks were used.  Barbie can be bought at every store, and rag "miracle" only sew on their own.  If you want to please your daughter with such a craft, you must know how to make a doll at home. </p><p>  Let's look at several manufacturing options using various materials. </p><p>  How to make a doll out of thread </p><p>  We need yarn of any color, shreds and beads for the eyes.  We take a strip of cardboard with a width of 15 centimeters.  We wind threads on it in even rows.  We pass one thread under the yarn along the edge of the cardboard and, collecting all the rows, knit it into a knot.  Cut the yarn along the bottom edge of the cardboard.  Then we remove it.  We collect the cut yarn into a bundle.  At a distance of 3 centimeters from the top we tie a thread and get the head of our doll. </p><p>  We take a small amount of yarn on both sides, braid it and tighten it at the end with a thread.  They will play the role of doll handles.  The rest of the yarn is collected in a bundle and at a distance of 5 centimeters from the head, we drag the thread.  We get the body.  The lower part of the yarn can be divided into two parts by making legs, or fluff and left in the <span>form of a skirt.</span>  Sew on beads instead of eyes, and embroider mouth with thread.  From shreds we sew for a doll a scarf, a sundress and an apron. </p><p>  How to make a fabric doll </p><p>  For this model, you will need various shreds, a synthetic winterizer or cotton wool for stuffing, yarn for hair and beads for the eyes.  We make a doll pattern on paper.  A large circle is required for the head.  The body is made in the form of a rectangle.  And we draw hands and feet right away with feet and palms.  We cut out all the blanks from <span>flesh-colored</span> fabric <span>.</span>  We detail the head with a thread along the edge, put a piece of padding polyester in the middle and tighten the thread, securing with several stitches.  We get the ball of the right size.  Sew to it bead eyes, hair from yarn and embroider or draw a nose and mouth.  The doll's head is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fold in pairs the parts of the hands and feet with the face inward.  We sew them, turn them out and stuff them with synthetic winterizer.  We connect the details of the body, leaving slots for the arms and legs, and then fill it with a synthetic winterizer.  We sew a finished head to it.  Sew hands and feet.  From colorful patches we sew beautiful clothes for the doll. </p><p>  Toys with bent arms and legs are very popular, and the head can turn or bend.  The process of making them at home is quite complicated and requires good artistic skills and a lot of patience.  How to make a <span>hinged doll</span> in a simplified scheme? </p><p>  To do this, we need a ready-made Barbie doll made of plastic, plastic glue and a special gun for it, ready-made hooks for hinges, thin elastic, a mass for crafts.  We disassemble the doll into individual parts.  On each of them we make markup.  Carefully cut the parts into pieces.  We fill each part with hot plastic glue and insert the finished hooks on each side.  We look forward to its complete solidification.  From the ornamental plastic mass we make hinges, pierce them with a thin knitting needle and bake in the oven at a temperature of 90-120 degrees until completely solidified.  We connect the details of the doll with the help of a thin elastic band, fastening it to the hooks and passing through the hinges.  Our product is ready.  It remains only to sew new beautiful clothes, and you can play. </p><p>  If you are thinking how to make a <span>doll with your own hands,</span> you can choose any method that suits you.  It will depend on your skills and the availability of supplies.  Engage your baby in the manufacturing process and it will turn into an exciting game.  Before making a doll, discuss with your child what he wants to receive.  Together, select the shreds and draw a sketch.  Making any crafts is very exciting.  It is possible that sewing dolls will become your favorite pastime.  And your friends and relatives will be happy to receive one of the models as a gift. </p>
