Some forms of obtaining information are available in a limited format or are provided only at the place of registration of the plastic card. </p><p>  How to make an extract on the card of Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  contact the department; </li><li>  print at a terminal or ATM; </li><li>  Call customer support </li><li>  use Sberbank Online; </li><li>  Get information in the Sberbank mobile application; </li><li>  send a request to the number "900". </li></ul><p>  The deadline for receiving information is no more than 24 hours.  An extract is provided free of charge. </p><h2>  Who can get the document? </h2><p>  Only the owner himself can apply for help with a Sberbank card.  An exception is the case when the representative has a duly certified document. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a card account statement with sberbank" class="if uuid-3091424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3091424.jpg"></div><p>  When applying for an extract from the Sberbank card on behalf of another client, the representative must have the original permit and his passport with him.  It is forbidden to use cards of another person in the terminal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of Help </h2><p>  Depending on the type of provision of the document with the account number at Sberbank, you can get: </p><ul><li>  Help for a visa.  It is issued on letterhead or sheet A4, in Russian or English (at the request of the client).  An extract for a visa is paid, the cost of the service is 100 rubles.  The card holder can receive the document only at the bank‚Äôs office. </li><li>  Details of the card.  In addition to the account number, the document contains all the data for transfer to the card from an individual or legal entity.  The certificate provides details for sending an international transfer using SWIFT. </li><li>  Statement for a specific date.  It indicates not only the account number, but also all transactions on the Sberbank card. </li></ul><p>  Sberbank credit and debit card statements are different.

To download the service you must use the App Store or Google Play. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank statement with address of residence of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3091428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3091428.jpg"></div><p>  After installation, the client must register, come up with a password to enter the system.  After logging in: </p><ol><li>  Click on the map. </li><li>  Select the "History" tab. </li><li>  Familiarize yourself with the latest operations (list below, with detailed information). </li></ol><p>  Mobile application - an option on how to make an account statement of a Sberbank card with sending by mail.  The client can transfer information to e-mail, social networks or instant messengers.

The number of requests that can be sent from one account is not limited.  Information will not be provided if the client‚Äôs balance is less than 15 rubles. </p><h2>  Difficulties when using USSD codes of SMS banking </h2><p>  Sometimes the service cannot be performed even if the Mobile Bank service is active.  This may be due to the fact that the "Quick Payment" function is disabled for the cardholder.  Connecting it is available only in Sberbank Online. </p><p>  To do this, go to the tab with the client data, find information about the "Mobile Bank".  In the section with services connected to the owner‚Äôs cards, there is a column about ‚ÄúQuick payment‚Äù.  If it is disabled, the client will see this and can correct the situation by confirming with a code from SMS. </p><p>  The service can be used by customers who have any Mobile Bank package connected. </p>
