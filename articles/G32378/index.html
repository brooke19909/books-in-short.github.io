Serbia, it would seem, is a familiar country, so understandable and familiar.  Nevertheless, the tourist flow there went weakly for many reasons: in the main - this is economic disruption and weak infrastructure.  But there really is a look there.  The heritage of ancient culture, coupled with beautiful natural landscapes will interest many tourists. </p><h2>  Orthodox spirituality and Slavic style </h2><p>  Consider the advantages and disadvantages of Serbian tourism based on the feedback of ordinary travelers.  Firstly, many of them note the low cost of tours and very tasty food.  Of course, this is a plus.  It happens that you come to a country, and the local food is absolutely unbearable for our tourist, you even have to bring food with you or order international dishes. </p><p>  In general, the Serbs themselves are very friendly to Russians, are interested in our culture, especially cinema, and learn the language.  Despite external poverty, mobile communication is well developed in Serbia; you can easily communicate even when roaming.  In addition, good roads and few cars.  You can quickly get to almost anywhere in the country by bus.  Many gas stations, including Gazprom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.putolovac.hr" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.putolovac.hr/putovanja/beograd-i-novi-sad-2-dana/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serbia photo" class="if uuid-3234841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113935/3234841.jpg"></div><p>  We should also mention the thermal springs - this is a wonderful highlight of the Serbian mountains.  The country lies, as it were, at the intersection of the plains, creating unique reliefs of natural varieties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In the days of the Roman Empire </h2><p>  Healing waters come to the surface in many places, their properties were appreciated by the ancient Romans when they ruled in these places.  The capital of Serbia, Belgrade, was once a Roman border camp called Sirmiy.  The country has preserved many ancient monuments and reminders of the early centuries of Christianity.  These are the ruins of amphitheaters and Byzantine basilicas. </p><p>  Serbian princes continued this cultural tradition and supplemented it with medieval castles and masterpieces of Slavic architecture.  Separately, it is worth noting the Belgrade Fortress - a real citadel in the city center, its symbol and decoration.  Mandatory object for visiting by tourists.  Also, travelers will find many other attractions, including traces of the 1999 American bombing, for example, destroyed bridges and a television center.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of tourism in Serbia? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.istockphoto.com/pl/zdjƒôcie/park-narodowy-tara-g√≥ry-serbia-gm598937572-102782207"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of serbia" class="if uuid-3234846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113935/3234846.jpg"></div><h2>  National cuisine </h2><p>  Another major city worth seeing is Novi Sad.  It is located in the north of the country, in the so-called province of Vojvodina, and represents a real European center: modern, multinational, noisy.  This is the part of the country closest to Europe and least affected by political perturbations.  Returning to cooking, travelers especially note the variety of Serbian soups - from light broths to hearty, rich, including the so-called chorba soup - black. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Serbs make it by adding thick butter flour.  Still very tasty local Serbian greens - a variety of herbs and seasonings, berries, vegetables.  Serbian meat pies, like whitewash, are also famous.  When traveling to Serbia, one must take into account the subtleties of tourism in these places, for example, effective treatment.  Among the Serbian balneological resorts, Zlatiborets and Divcebar are especially notable.  They are located high in the mountains and, as it were, echo each other with names - a knight and a damsel. </p><h2>  Wellness centers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.koreni.rs" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.koreni.rs/moja-zemlja-srbija/"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountains of serbia" class="if uuid-3234853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113935/3234853.jpg"></div><p>  The most convenient time to visit them is winter.  In general, the climate in the country is mild and very pleasant, suitable for relaxing in a relaxed atmosphere at any time of the year, without heat or freezing.  Many foreigners celebrate and discover amazing things.  For example, the thoroughness with which Serbs wash the streets of their cities, rightly with some German pedantry. </p><p>  In general, the cleanliness and well-groomed Serbian dwellings amid the surrounding poverty and devastation speak of the internal high spiritual condition of this people.  So it‚Äôs definitely worth a trip to this country.  Hotel prices are high due to their small number, but you can always rent a house with local residents, which will cost many times cheaper.  There is a lot of empty real estate here. </p><h2>  Investments </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nl.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lijst_van_grote_Servische_steden"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serbia river" class="if uuid-3234849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113935/3234849.jpg"></div><p>  This is another way of investing money in this country, and many of our Russians have already taken advantage of this by buying houses for housing or business there.  For the Russians, a thirty-day visa-free system now operates, this is the most suitable time to go and explore this country.  Its territory is approximately the same as the Leningrad Region in terms of area, you can manage to visit all the main attractions and look into rare places, making up your own impression of this picturesque region. </p><p>  In a word, now Serbia is in a state of "intelligence" by the tourist community and is developing its own unique tourist style.  This is, first of all, an emphasis on Slavic themes, in addition, an emphasis on the Orthodox cultural heritage, architecture, painting and natural beauties of the Central European strip.  Here you can have a wonderful picnic in the lap of nature, admiring the mountain views in the distance and valleys with villages located in them, buried in the greenery of beautiful forests. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Many tourists recommend a mandatory visit to Serbian baths.  This is something unimaginable: at the same time similar to both Russian and Turkish, they combine an ancient heritage and a touch of classical Slavic baths with a wood-burning stove.  The classic combination of many cultures gives Serbia that unique image that is characteristic of countries with diverse heritage that have gone through difficult historical trials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nl.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lijst_van_grote_Servische_steden"><img itemprop="image" alt="view of Serbia" class="if uuid-3234850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113935/3234850.jpg"></div><p>  Tourism to Serbia from Russia is becoming increasingly popular.  It is unlike other countries of the Balkan Peninsula, so it can not be recognized by visiting only the resorts of neighboring Montenegro.  It is believed that the Serbs aspire to the European Union and are rather skeptical towards the Russians, but this is only one of the facets of local society.  It is the absence of total Europeanization and some stubborn persistence in this matter that gives tourism in Serbia the unique flavor that experienced travelers especially appreciate and seek. </p><h2>  Extreme vacation </h2><p>  Especially suitable for fans of tents and picnics in the mountains and lovers of historical artifacts.  By the way, the Serbs themselves also love to travel around their own country and will gladly act as guides and guides.  The loss of large territories after the collapse of unified Yugoslavia made them value their own country and protect its heritage more, which is probably why tourism in Serbia is not very developed. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists especially note the patriotism of the Serbs and their awareness of the intricacies of the significance of each historical place.  This country probably has a huge tourism potential for the future.  I would like to say separately about the possibility of a trip to the so-called Republika Srpska - a separate country in the neighborhood within Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Serbs live there, too, and this land is no less saturated with ancient cultural heritage and natural beauties.  Although the infrastructure in the republic is even more miserable, any wallet will "overpower" the price. </p>
