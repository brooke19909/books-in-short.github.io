The model was much cheaper due to the use of cheap materials and the rejection of certain functions.  However, despite the changes, the device has not lost its appeal to fans of the company. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Appearance remained the same, but many small and important changes appeared.  Nokia N-Gage QD has become a little smaller in size, which simplified the work with the device.  The use of cheaper materials also played a positive role.  The apparatus is made of plastic with a rough surface and rubber inserts that do not allow the device to slip out of hands.  Compared to its predecessor, working with the QD version has become much easier. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the <span>Nokia N-Gage</span> case looks less catchy due to cheap plastic, the quality has remained excellent.  Minor scratches and prints are practically not scary to the device.  The device is quite durable and can withstand bumps and drops without problems. </p><p>  Changes have occurred in the arrangement of external elements.  The speaker moved to the front of the device, which greatly simplified calls.  Now the user does not need to attach the device to his ear with an edge.  The microphone was also adapted for a comfortable conversation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the front of the device, the manufacturer placed a joystick, controls, speaker, logo and display.  Although calling has become much more convenient, the layout of the keys creates problems in the typing of messages.  The buttons are convenient because they are made of plastic with a glossy finish and have a smooth ride.  Behind the device is the main speaker. </p><p>  The right end of the device is reserved for the power key and the menu call.  At the bottom of the device is a flash drive slot.  The manufacturer equipped N-Gage with a quick card replacement function, which is convenient for the user.  At the top of the device there is a 2.5 jack for the headset and a charging socket. </p><p>  The appearance of the device is interesting, although much simpler than its predecessor.  Changes only positively affected the use of the updated version of the device. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Equipped with a <span>Nokia N-Gage</span> small screen, only 2.2 inches, with a resolution of only 176 by 208 pixels.  The user will encounter cubes, which are especially noticeable in small icons and images.  You should not expect incredible quality from the 2004 device.  For games, the size and resolution of the display is enough, but more is not necessary. </p><p>  Nokia N-Gage uses a TFT matrix.  The technology is outdated, but for 2004 it is quite relevant and looks decent.  The screen is bright enough, but with some drawbacks.  Viewing angles are low, with a significant tilt of the device, it is problematic to see what is happening on the display.  Working in the sun is also a weakness of the model.  Even at maximum brightness, the screen fades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The duration of the Nokia N-Gage, like all other devices of the company, is high.  A 1070 maH battery is installed in the device, which is slightly larger than its predecessor.  The manufacturer stated that the model will work for about 11 days.  In fact, the figures are much lower.  In standby mode, the device will last about five days.  Minimal use will drain the battery in two days, and active work will put the battery in 10-12 hours. </p><p>  Although the actual performance is much lower than stated, the user will have enough battery capacity.  The battery even with the active use of Bluetooth, maximum brightness and high load ensures decent operation of the device. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the main purpose of Nokia N-Gage is games, the device has a big drawback.  We are talking about a small amount of memory.  Only 3.4 MB is available to the user.  Such a small amount of memory is perplexing, especially in a gaming device.  The ability to expand due to the flash drive improves the situation a bit. </p><p>  Supports MMC card device with capacity up to 1 GB.  You can replace the flash drive without turning off the device.  The card slot is located at the bottom of the device. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2>

    <p>  Since the main feature of Nokia N-Gage QD is games, the manufacturer abandoned many unnecessary functions.  The strangest thing is the lack of an IN port and a USB socket in the device.  To record information on the device, only Bluetooth is available to the user.  The manufacturer refused other functions. </p><p>  N-Gage lacks a player and even an FM receiver.  Most likely, this solution allowed to significantly reduce the cost of the device.  Although it is strange to assume that gamers will do without such useful features.  The browser of the model was also cut.  The device is unable to display HTML pages, and the user will have to be content with normal WML, as well as XHTML. </p><p>  Gaming capabilities have not changed.  The phone has the Arena Launcher application, with which, by connecting via GPRS to the server, you can communicate and carry out updates.  Games for the device are delivered on a special MMC card. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Users in the gaming device are attracted to an unusual appearance.  The company has always been distinguished by an extraordinary design approach, but in N-Gage it has even surpassed itself.  The device is more like a gamepad than a phone. </p><p>  The players liked the changes in the device.  Rubberized sidewalls and rough plastic do not allow the device to slip out even with prolonged use.  I liked the users and the decision to move the speaker and microphone.  Now, conversations do not cause discomfort associated with an inconvenient arrangement of elements. </p><p>  Not without flaws.  The main disadvantage in Nokia N-Gage is the review of the screen and its brightness.  The display fades in the sun and even with a slight tilt, it distorts the picture.  This is forgivable for a regular phone, but in the game model causes a lot of problems. </p><p>  The rejection of useful features also affected the opinion of users.  If the lack of a USB and infrared port is compensated by the presence of Bluetooth, then there is nothing to replace other options.  The manufacturer‚Äôs decision to remove the FM-receiver and even the player justifies only one thing - the low cost of the device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The Nokia company has repeatedly surprised fans with unusual devices.  Even redesigned and simplified devices are of genuine interest.  Despite the fact that the QD version is less functional and not so futuristic, it has many advantages.  Undoubtedly, the N-Gage phone-game console will appeal not only to game lovers, but also to fans of everything unusual. </p>
