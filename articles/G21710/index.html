    <h2>  Why are debts dangerous? </h2><p>  Even small amounts of debt can turn into big troubles, disrupt vacation abroad, delay the receipt of the necessary documents, make it impossible to get a loan, and prevent the registration of movable or real estate.  It can be quite unpleasant if they use the favorite method of influencing defaulters - the arrest of a current account. </p><p>  The sadness with overdue debts is that payment information appears, for example, in the customs authorities, within two months from the date of repayment of the debt - this is how the bailiff service works.  It is recommended to find out debts and pay in advance so that the information arrives at the right address, and you do not suffer from debts that have already been paid. </p><h2>  Travel restrictions </h2><p>  Debt can cause you to not be allowed to go abroad, whether it is a vacation or a business trip, it does not matter.  Therefore, if <span>enforcement proceedings</span> have been instituted against you and a writ of execution has been issued for a debt of more than 10,000 rubles, it is likely that a restriction on exit will become a penalty measure.  The restriction can be removed only by paying off the debt or otherwise reaching an agreement with the FSSP. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The situation is somewhat simplified by the fact that, according to the law, bailiffs are obliged to send registered notifications that, in case of non-payment of arrears, a travel restriction will be imposed.  However, you will receive this notice only if you live at the place of registration.  Therefore, it is important to include an item on information on debts with bailiffs by last name in the plan for preparing for the trip, so that an unpleasant surprise is not waiting for you at the border. </p><h2>  Why donors do not always know what they should? </h2><p>  The fastest and most effective way to collect debt today is to go to court.  Credit organizations are especially fond of filing lawsuits.  The presence of the defendant is not required, the specifics of Russian law allow to consider such cases unilaterally, which means that you can not know anything about the last meeting or the sanctions imposed. </p>

    <p>  Then the <span>writ of execution</span> is handed over to the <span>federal service of court bailiffs,</span> and they are already getting down to business.  Therefore, before you go on vacation to the sea or embark on important matters, you should find out the debts of the bailiffs by last name.  Otherwise, your debt can become a serious hindrance in both business and leisure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are two options for finding out debts.  Bailiffs make a personal visit to their service and learn about debts there, it is not difficult.  Moreover, it is in your interests.  This is the first way to find out debts from bailiffs by last name.  But since the Federal Law obliged the bailiffs to conduct a bank of enforcement proceedings in electronic form, that is, a more convenient and faster way to find out debts from bailiffs is via the Internet. </p><h2>  Getting information over the Internet </h2><p>  To do this, visit the FSSP website.  On the left in the table, the fifth paragraph is the line ‚ÄúInformation Systems‚Äù, when you hover over it with a mouse, a menu opens in which we are interested in the item ‚ÄúDatabank of enforcement proceedings‚Äù.  Follow the link. </p><p>  On the page that opens, you need to find the search table.  To do this, you have to scroll down a bit.  In the table we are interested in the tab ‚ÄúSearch for individuals‚Äù, it is open by default.  If there is a need to check debts for a legal entity or individual entrepreneur, this can be done in the same form, only use other bookmarks. </p><p>  We begin to look for a <span>debt to</span> bailiffs by last name.  In the line "Territorial authorities" select your region.  Let's say the Novosibirsk region.  You can search by scrolling the list with the mouse down to the desired object, but it will faster start to type the name in the line, and the search will substitute the name itself.  Next, enter your last name and first name.  These are required fields.  Middle name and date of birth - the fields are optional, but if you have a widespread surname, for example, Ivanov, it is better to fill out all the fields in the table in order to find out debts faster.  Press the "Search" button. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The site will ask you to take a test, whether you are a robot.  Everything is simple here too - enter the code from the image.  If the characters in the picture are difficult to make out, click on the button with the speaker image and listen to the characters in the picture.  Press the send button, and the site will offer you a table with the records found according to the filter or write very nice words ‚ÄúNo results were found according to your request‚Äù, indicating that the bailiff service does not intend to ask you for debts. </p>

    <h2>  Useful information in the table. </h2><p>  If you still find yourself in debt, then from the table you can draw a number of information that will allow you to quickly deal with an unpleasant story. </p><p>  You can familiarize yourself with the number of the enforcement proceedings and the date when it was instituted.  There you will find out which authority issued the executive document.  This information will be required if you are planning to appeal a court decision. </p><p>  The subject of execution is also indicated here: traffic police fine, loan payment, etc., as well as the amount.  From the table you can find out which department of the bailiffs is conducting your enforcement proceedings and its address.  And finally, you can see the last name, first name and patronymic of the bailiff and phone number with the city code, by which you can contact the contractor to clarify the circumstances of your question. </p><h2>  How to pay debts </h2><p>  How to find out debts from bailiffs by last name, figured out.  Now let's figure out how to pay them.  If you find yourself in the table, you will see that in the column "Service" there is a button "Pay".  By clicking on it, you can pay off your debt using a <span>bank card,</span> electronic money or using some other payment systems (Qiwi, Robokassa).  You can also use the ‚ÄúReceipt‚Äù item and download the completed receipt to your computer, which will only be printed and paid at the nearest bank branch.  Everything is very fast and convenient. </p><p>  After you have paid the debt in any convenient way, you can expect that the record of you from the bank of enforcement proceedings will disappear.  But this will not happen immediately, but within 3-7 days from the moment you make the payment.  Therefore, after a week, it is advisable to use the service again and check whether the record about you has disappeared.  Until you make sure that everything is in order, do not throw away payment documents.  Only by presenting them can you prove that you paid the debt. </p>
