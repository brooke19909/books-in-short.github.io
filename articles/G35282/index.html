Interest in these places on the eastern coast of the <span>Kola Bay of the</span> Barents Sea arose about 150 years ago, when the need was ripened for a large port city beyond the Arctic Circle.  This coast was called Murman, that is, "Norman," "Norwegian."  Consequently, the city, founded on October 4, 1916, meant "the city on Murman." </p><h2>  Monument "Defenders of the Soviet Arctic" </h2><p>  It has many attractions related to the history of the navy, merchant and fishing fleet, as well as the events of World War II.  One of them is the memorial to the Defenders of the Soviet Arctic. </p>

    <p>  The monument to northern shipping is a museum.  It is equipped on the icebreaker "Lenin".  The ship was not written off when the end of his service came, but a museum was built here.  Those interested can thoroughly examine the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monument "Waiting" and other attractions of the city </h2><p>  Since it is a port city, it has an interesting monument ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù, representing the wives, mothers, sisters, daughters who are waiting for the sailors.

    <p>  In Murmansk, there is an unusual memorial to ‚ÄúSailors who perished in peacetime‚Äù.  This building resembles a lighthouse 17 meters high.  Inside it are plates and books with the names of the dead sailors written on them. </p><p>  Since the city is the base of the Northern Navy, it houses a museum dedicated to sailors.  <span>The Northern</span> Fleet <span>Naval Museum</span> is located in the building of the Officers House and has a rather rich and interesting exposition. </p><p>  There are comic attractions in the city, for example, the ‚ÄúShara‚Äù monument, a place of students' pilgrimage before exams.  Nearby is a monument to polar bears, with an always wiped nose.  Because, according to legend, if you rub his nose, there will be great luck. </p><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  Before describing the sights of the Murmansk region, we will talk about those that are in the city itself.  There are Orthodox shrines here.  Church of the Savior of the Miraculous Image (Savior on the Waters).  This is a recently erected magnificent, snow-white building.  Sixteen years ago, the church of St. Great Equal-to-the-Apostles Prince Vladimir was built in Murmansk.  The building is white with a dark blue roof and has tall narrow windows and doors.  The general impression of the temple is modesty and dignity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  What are the sights of the Murmansk region worth seeing?  In Varguz there is the Assumption Church.  This is a unique monument of wooden architecture.  The ancient church was built without a single nail.  One church building is somewhat mundane, the other is tall and somewhat narrow, making it seem like the dome is piercing the skies.  The temple has few strict and original wooden decorations. </p><h2>  Teriberka </h2><p>  In the <span>Murmansk region</span> there is the village of Teriberka, once it was a very developed fishing village, mainly for the extraction of cod and sharks.  This is the only place in the country where you can see the open Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean.  Unfortunately, about forty years ago, the village of Teriberka (Murmansk region) began to decline, the sights for viewing tourists here are not so attractive now.  Nowadays, it is such a ruined and miserable village that it served as the scenery for the cult film ‚ÄúLeviathan‚Äù. </p><h2>  Umba (Murmansk Oblast): attractions </h2><p>  Umba is a very old urban-type settlement.  But here, too, there are a couple of attractions that are worth seeing to the traveler.  For example, the Museum of History, Culture and Life of Terek Pomors.  It was founded in 1991.  The museum presents household items of Terek Pomors, fishing tools.  There are also fishing gear, items of Pomeranian crafts, embroidery and more. </p><p>  In the village of Umba there is also a Museum of rock art "Petroglyphs of Kanozero".  On January 30, 2008, the activities of this institution began.  To this day, the museum is waiting for tourists. </p><h2>  Apatity.  sights </h2><p>  The city of Apatity and its surroundings is considered to be the best place for tourism in the Murmansk region.  What sights are known here?  Apatity <span>(Murmansk region)</span> has three museums: geological, local history and mineralogy.  Outside the city is a modern ski resort.  Apatity boasts its powerful scientific potential.  Here are several institutions, mainly geological, physical and environmental orientation.  Here is a large deposit of apatite-nepheline ores.  Therefore, the city has many processing enterprises.  What other sights of the Murmansk region deserve attention?  Recently, the Church of the New Martyrs and Confessors of Russia was built and consecrated.  This is a wooden building with blue sloping roofs and gilded domes.  There is a Sunday school and a choir at the church. </p><h2>  Natural heritage </h2><p>  What else is worth seeing for those who come to explore the sights of the Murmansk region?  The harsh climate beyond the Arctic Circle does not mean that nature is poor and uninteresting.  In the Murmansk region there are many curious and beautiful places that can deliver aesthetic pleasure to the traveler.  This is Lake Maly Vudyavr, lost among the mountains of the <span>Kola Peninsula.</span>  A pond surrounded by forests, on the banks of which many berries grow.  Nearby is the Botanical Garden Institute. </p>
