Knitting needles for girls, teenagers and women can be associated with interesting summer and winter models.  Selecting unusual patterns, you can create things no worse than store ones.  For girls, choose bright threads, for girls - a neutral gamut.  For one product, it is better to use multifaceted patterns, including several patterns. </p><h2>  The scheme of work when knitting tunics </h2><p>  Start your work by choosing a model.  If you are just starting to knit, then use ready-made schemes, instructions, descriptions of your size.  If you have experience knitting, then draw patterns of the future tunic, choose a pattern and conduct the preparatory phase to study the properties of yarn. </p><p>  To do this, knit a sample of ten centimeters on both sides or according to the size of the pattern repeat.  Measure the number of loops and rows per centimeter.  Next, erase the template, dry, measure again.  This stage protects knitters from mistakes, blooming and low-quality yarn. </p><p>  If you ignore this work, then the tunic for the girl (with knitting or crochet you knit it - it doesn‚Äôt matter) can lose shape, fade, stretch out or sit down when washing.  By the way, when using several patterns, the density of knitting can vary.  Therefore, it is better for beginners to use ready-made models.  For warm tunics, choose patterns with diamonds, braids, cones, plaits, then the product looks more elegant, and in the warm season, openwork patterns will do. </p><h2>  Simple knitting: tunic with knitting needles </h2><p>  Schemes are sometimes difficult to understand, so it‚Äôs better to connect them to present the final result.  It is better for beginners to cheat due to the type of thread.  That is, use unusual yarn with ringlets, bumps, lumps, villi, and pigtails.  Then you can <span>knit with the usual</span> smooth surface, and the pattern will turn out unusual.  The main thing here is to pull all the embossed parts of the yarn onto the face of the product.  Such yarn is often used for children's things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted tunic for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/635727.jpg" width="361"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stylish and warm <span>tunic with knitting needles</span> and <span>knitted</span> from ordinary wool.  Pros focus on combining several complex patterns.  Beginners vary the squares of the front and <span>back loops.</span>  It is enough to indicate the stitches on the sheet in a checkerboard pattern and, due to repetitions, knit an unusual product.  For full girls, use a small square (for example, six to ten loops wide), for slim girls you can choose a large pattern. </p><p>  Simple patterns include alternating squares with vertical stripes.  By varying the front and back loops in a different order, the novice craftswoman can create an original pattern. </p><h2>  Patterns for warm tunics </h2><p>  The most popular pattern among knitters is braids.  Variations on this topic are huge.  In any case, the tunic knitted with needles in this pattern looks elegant, feminine, bright. </p><p>  The main principle of braid knitting is dividing the loops into two parts: the first is thrown onto the auxiliary knitting needle before or at work, the second is knitted with facial loops, and then the same actions are done with the remaining loops.  The direction of the pattern depends on where the auxiliary spoke is located, and the number of loops affects the spike width.  Standardly create a pattern of six loops: three loops for auxiliary and working knitting needles.  Please note: when choosing a braid, you knit a tunic with a collar. </p><p>  Do not make this pattern very dense, as it will work hard with thrown loops.  Consider several patterns that are suitable for women and children‚Äôs products (not machine-made, but hand-knitted). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tunic (knitting) with patterns of embossed patterns among women is most in demand.  Only the same model can have a different designation in fashion magazines.  By default, the odd rows are knitted according to the pattern, the even rows correspond to the pattern, or all are replaced with purl loops. </p><h2>  Narrow braids </h2><p>  The rapport of the first drawing consists of 22 loops and 27 rows: </p><ul><li>  1, 5, 9 p.: 2 facial (Lts), 2 wrong (From), * 6 Lts, 2 From * - repeat twice, 2 Lts. </li><li>  3, 7, 11 p.: 2 Lts-Iz, braid to the right (CPR of 6 loops), 2 purl, braid to the left (KVl), 2 from and Lts. </li><li>  13, 27 p.: Alternation of 2 Lts and From to the end of the rapport. </li><li>  15, 19, 23 p.: 6 Lts, * 2 From-Lts * - repeat twice, 2 From, 6 Lts. </li><li>  17, 21, 25 r: KVl, * 2 From-Lts * - 2 times, 2 From, Kpr. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted warm tunic" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634138.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ul><p>  With such narrow braids any tunic for a girl will look.  By knitting the product it turns out soft, airy, so do not worry because of the massiveness of the clothes.  The child will not feel the weight of the product. </p><p>  The next rapport consists of 20 loops and 29 rows.  Here, the braid consists of 8 loops (four per auxiliary and working knitting needle. </p><ul><li>  1, 5, 9 p.: 2 From, * 1 Lts-From * - 4 repetitions, 2 From, 8 Lts. </li><li>  3, 7 p.: Begins with two wrong sides, * 1 From-Lts * - repeat 4 times, 8 Lts. </li><li>  11 p.: 2 From, 8 Lts, 2 From, CPR. </li><li>  13, 15, 17, 19 p.: * 2 Of, 8 Lts * - 2 times. </li><li>  21 p.: 2 From, CRC, 2 From, * 1 From, 1 Lts * - four times. </li><li>  23, 27 p.: 2 From, 8 Lts, 2 From, * 1 Lts, 1 From * - 4 times. </li><li>  25, 29 p.: Partially repeats the pattern of the previous row, consisting of two wrong, eight facial and two wrong, * 1 Out, 1 Lts * - repeat 4 times. </li></ul><p>  If in the first variant a herringbone pattern is obtained, then in the second rapport the braids are combined with a wicker. </p><h2>  Patterns for the warm season. </h2><p>  Openwork vertical patterns are suitable for spring.  Their report consists of one row, which is repeated throughout the entire product.  It represents the following figure: 1 Lts, 1 yarn (H), 2 Lts, 1 broach (rear throw on the first loop), 1 Lts, 1 crossed (knit back, then the front), 2 Lts, 1 H, 1 Lts.  This pattern is more suitable for sleeves.  The shelves themselves can be connected from rhombs.  This is also easy knitting. </p><p>  <em>Knitted tunic: diamond patterns</em> </p><ul><li>  1 r.: 6 Out, 2 Lts, H, 2 back loops knitted together (2IV), 7 Lts, 2 back crossed loops (2 IP), N, 1 Out, 7 Lts, 2 IS, N, 2 Lts, 6 Of. </li><li>  3 p.: 5 From, 3 Lts, 1 From, H, 2IV, 5 Lts, 2 IS, H, 1 From, H, 2IV, 5 Lts, 2IS, H, 1 From, 3 facial, 5 From. </li><li>  5 p.: 4 From, 3 Lts, 3 From, H, 2 PS, 3 Lts, 2 IP, H, 3 From, H, 2 II, 3 Lts, 2 IP, H, 3 From, 3 Lts, 4 From . </li><li>  7 p.: 3 From-Lts, 5 From, yarn, 2 , front, 2 , , 5 From, , 2 , 1 Lts, 2 , , 5 From, 3 Lts, 3 From. </li><li>  9 p.: 2 From, 3 Lts, * 7 From, H, 2 IS * - twice, H, 7 From, 3 Lts, 2 From. </li><li>  11 p.: 1 From, 3 Lts, 9 From, , 2 , 7 From, 2 , , 9 From, 3 Lts, 1 From. </li><li>  13 p.: 2 From, 3 Lts, 6 wrong, 2 IP, yarn, 1 Lts, H, 2 IW, 5 From, 2 IS, H, 1 Lts, H, 2 II, 6 From, 3 Lts, 2 From . </li><li>  15 p.: 3 From-Lts, 4 From, 2 IPs, double crochet, 3 Lts, N, 2 PS, 3 From, 2 IPs, N, 3 Lts, H, 2 PS, 4 From, 3 Pts, 3 From. </li><li>  17 p.: 4 From, 3 Lts, 2 From, 2 IPs, N, 5 facial, N, 2 PS, 1 From, 2 IPs, N, 5 Lts, H, 2 PS, 2 From, 3 Lts, 4 From . </li><li>  19 p.: 5 From, 3 Lts, 2 IPs, N, 7 Lts, H, 2 IWs, 2IS, H, 7 Lts, H, 2 IWs, 3 Lts, 5 From </li></ul><p>  It turns out that lozenges with front and back loops alternate and are framed by facial zigzags.  This picture is most often chosen by full ladies.  But they will be built by any vertical pattern and ‚Äústraight‚Äù tunic.  Knitting needles for women can create any model, even novice craftswomen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting tunic with knitting patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635458.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  How to tie a tunic to a beginner? </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt have original yarn at hand, and you cannot knit bumps, braids, tows and other complex elements, then you should resort to the following trick. </p><ul><li>  Make a product pattern immediately with sleeves and a flared bottom.  That is, the tunic will look like a dress. </li><li>  One pattern will correspond to the front and back. </li><li>  Draw a diagonal line on the part.  She will distinguish between colors. </li><li>  Now take three colors: black, green and brown.  Black narrow bands are tied, and green and brown distinguish the part in half diagonally, that is, a three-color tunic is obtained. </li></ul><p>  With knitting needles (for a girl - that‚Äôs it!) Individually knit in front and back, starting from the bottom of the product, gradually switch to the sleeves.  You get two details with the sleeves down, like a kimono.  Now grind them at the seam.  Tie the neck, sleeves and bottom of the tunic. </p><p>  If you have not learned how to change colors so that the wrong side is neat, then use <span>melange yarn that</span> is already dyed in several colors. </p><h2>  How to work with patterns? </h2><p>  Choose a pattern from the above schemes.  Create some samples.  By varying with the same yarn, knitting needles of different thicknesses, you can get a pattern of different sizes.  Choose the best option for yourself.  Carry out preparatory work with knitted patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted tunic with knitting patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634114.jpg" width="358"></div>

    <p>  Now make a full-length pattern.  The simplest tunic model - consisting of two shelves (front and back).  If the product contains deflated sleeves or pronounced armpits, then start knitting from the bottom.  If there are no sleeves, then you can start work from the neck (this method will be described below on the example of a children's model). </p><p>  You start work with elastic, then even a knitted tunic keeps its shape.  With knitting needles (with a description of the patterns of difficulties there will be no) we work out each individual drawing on a template.  This method is highly recommended for beginners, otherwise the product will be with many folds or skewed. </p><p>  Use patterns with braids for decorative purposes, for example, for vertical lines on the front shelf on both sides or throughout the tunic through a certain distance (for example, every ten centimeters).  Flat patterns are most suitable for children's models. </p><h2>  Knitted things for children: tunic with knitting needles with patterns </h2><p>  For babies, choose hypoallergenic yarn.  For a one-year-old baby you will need 3 skeins: 1 pc.  wool and 2 pcs.  mixed yarn from merino and acrylic;  circular knitting needles (4 and 4.5 mm).  The density of knitting with mixed yarn is 19 stitches in a ten-centimeter sample. </p><p>  On 4-millimeter circular knitting needles, type 66 loops of wool.  In order not to lose the beginning of the circle, you can use markers or tie with a contrasting thread.  Knit elastic 1x1 - 10 rows.  Then knit a circle with full face loops. </p><p>  Now change the thread to a mixed yarn and alternate the front loop with a crochet.  To make a crochet, you need to grab the loop of the lower row on the left knitting needle and knit it.  The next circle will consist of facial loops. </p><p>  Now take knitting needles with a number of 4.5 mm and 5 rows of knit facial loops.  By changing the thickness of the spokes increases the volume of the product.  At the end of the work, change the yarn to wool and knit 6 rows according to the pattern: odd - with facial, even - with purl stitches.  Please note that this model fits from the neck down (the third photo, where the blue tunic (with knitting needles) for a girl of 1-2 years old). </p>

    <h2>  Armpit and waist shaping </h2><p>  Now move on to shaping your armpits.  To do this, knit 36 ‚Äã‚Äãfront stitches, close the next 30 stitches, knit again 36 stitches with the front stitch and close the next 30.  Now you can see where the armpits and shelves of the tunic will be. </p><p>  Next, knit 36 ‚Äã‚Äãwrong loops, make three crochets, without tearing off the yarn, knit the next 36 loops also inside out and again make 3 crochets.  Mark with a marker or thread the end of the row.  Knit a circle with full <span>face smoothness</span> and change the thread to mixed, with which you make literally 6 rows according to the same pattern.  Proceed to the formation of the waist (row by row it turns out a trapezoidal knitted tunic with knitting needles).  For a 1-2 year old girl, it is important that the clothes do not constrain movements. </p><p>  Now change the thread again to wool and knit 8 rows according to the previously described pattern, where the odd rows are created with front loops, and the even rows with the back loops.  Then proceed to the formation of the hem.  To do this, mark the border with a thread every 13 loops.  It should turn out 6 parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted tunic" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634187.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Knitting a hem in 2 ways </h2><p>  Replace the thread with blended yarn and add 2 loops on each part.  The result should be 90 loops.  Knit 9 front rows.  Then repeat the knitting with increments and knitting with the front rows until the length of the tunic from the armpits is 18 centimeters. </p><p>  Next, change the thread to wool and proceed to the formation of the hem.  It can be connected in two ways.  In the first case, 5 circles are knit either in the front or in the back.  On the last lap you close the loop.  In the second version, a dress is obtained (meaning a trapezoidal knitted tunic with knitting needles). </p><p>  The flared hem pattern is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Front loops. </li><li>  Gum 1x1. </li><li>  Just like the previous row. </li><li>  * Knit 1 front, then from the next loop, knit 2 loops, grabbing them by the front and back walls of the wrong side. </li><li>  Alternate front and 2 wrong. </li><li>  Repeat pattern 5 rows. </li><li>  Knitting is the same as in the 5th row. </li><li>  Again, alternate the front, with 2 loops, knitted from the wrong side and add the wrong loop. </li><li>  Alternate front with 3 wrong. </li><li>  Knit like the previous row </li><li>  Description 9 row. </li><li>  Figure 9 row. </li><li>  Close the loop on the pattern. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted tunic for women" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/634139.jpg" width="240"></div></li></ol><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  The tunic is a long loose-fitting T-shirt or mini-dress with a flared hem.  The original look can be obtained due to the unusual texture of the threads, their bright colors, or through a combination of complex patterns. </p><p>  For babies, choose a simple pattern with bright colors, and for girls and women - a more classic neutral gamut with various embossed or openwork patterns. </p>
