Summer tunics - patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Being fashionable today is pretty easy.  Shops are full of a huge amount of clothing for every taste and color.  However, in this variety of goods, people often lose interest in purchasing them, because who wants to look like everyone else.  In this case, you can try to fantasize and sew something with your own hands for yourself beloved.  In this article I want to talk about how a pattern of a <span>beach tunic</span> can be built <span>.</span>  Several fairly simple options are provided. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach tunic pattern" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460917.jpg" width="401"></div></h2><h2>  Option 1. Baby's undershirt </h2><p>  It is worth saying that in different ways you can sew a tunic for going to the beach.  There are a lot of options.  It‚Äôs better to start with the easiest way.  We will understand how the pattern of a beach tunic should be built on the principle of "vest".  What does it mean?  So, in this embodiment, the sleeve and the main part of the dress will be created from a single piece, that is, the sleeve will not be sewn in, it will be one-piece. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach tunics photo patterns" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460907.jpg" width="285"></div></h2><h2>  Construction of a pattern of a tunic-vest </h2><p>  To do this, you need a fabric with a width of one and a half meters.  You can choose the length yourself.  In this case, let it be 1 meter (it will be necessary to buy 2 meters of fabric).  So, where to start to get a pattern of beach tunic?  Everything must be done on paper (cardboard, paper, on wallpaper).  We begin to draw sleeves.  They will be spread out along the upper fold of the fabric, therefore, they are drawn on paper along its upper edge (one and a half meters wide).  In the very center of the top you need to make a neck: from the center on both sides you need to count 12 cm (neck width - 24 cm), then draw the desired cutout (V-shaped, small, square) to a depth of about 7 cm. Next step: draw the sleeve width .  For the brush it will be 25 cm. The sleeve itself can be drawn at will (it can be straight, flared, ‚Äúbat‚Äù).  In this case, it is simply direct.  Further, it is important to note the Po, i.e.  half girth of the chest.  The tunic can be either tight-fitting or free-cut (in this version, the POg is not particularly important).  Then, at will, a model of the dress itself looms (it can be even, a "bell").  That's all.  Next, the pattern is cut out, superimposed on a double folded fabric, outlined (necessarily with allowances for seams).  Next step: stapling parts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself beach tunics patterns" class="if" height="194" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460918.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Option 2. Tunic with a short sleeve </h2><p>  You can also figure out how to build a pattern of beach tunic with a short sleeve.  This method is also quite simple.  The essence will be approximately similar to the previous option: the tailoring will be all-cut, only the sleeve will be short, and the tunic itself will be made in the style of a ‚Äúbat‚Äù.  However, this option of cutting is good in that it can be varied in different ways.  The sleeve can be made narrower, the tunic can be free cut or fitted, extended or narrowed down. </p><h2>  Open tunic with a short sleeve </h2><p>  So, how is the pattern of a short-sleeved <span>beach tunic dress</span> built?  First draw the sleeves.  Their length will be minimal.  For a girl‚Äôs height of 165 cm, this will be no more than 55 cm. From the center of the upper line of the drawn length of the sleeve, it is necessary to set aside 12 cm on both sides (neck width 24 cm).  Further, if desired, draw the shape and depth of the neck.  The options are the same as in the description of the first option.  It is worth remembering that <span>summer tunics</span> can be completely different <span>.</span>  Patterns may vary as desired.  At this stage, you already need to know what you want to get in the end: a summer fitting dress or a tunic of a free cut.  Depending on this, and draw a silhouette.  At the same time, the sleeve width, waist, bottom of the dress varies.  Further, everything is transferred to the fabric, be sure to leave room for allowances.  The next step: stitching the parts of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic beach dress pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/461473.jpg" width="501"></div></h2><h2>  Option 3. Tunic-hoodie </h2><p>  We study further beach tunics.  Doing it yourself with your own hands is not a problem, so I would like to present another option for cutting and sewing a summer beach dress-hoodie, which will be sewn from a single piece of fabric.  So, for this you will need a fabric with a width of about 120 cm and a length of about 160-180 cm, no more.  On the same piece of paper we are looking for the very middle: there will be a neck, as well as a fold on the shoulders.  The width of the neck can be any, depending on the desired model.  The shoulders may not quite open, in this case the neck width will be approximately 24 cm. However, it is possible that the shoulders will be maximally open, in this case the cutout width will be approximately 38 cm (all figures are given taking into account the height of the girl about 165 cm of standard equipment).  In this case, the cutout will not be deep, it will be a normal cape.  After the width and depth of the neck are drawn, go to the hands.  On both sides of the fold line (on the shoulders) you need to postpone 30 cm (the sleeve will be wide).  Further from the extreme points of the sleeve you need to make a small depression.  To do this, draw a line perpendicular to the sleeve to a length of 10-15 cm (on both sides of the sleeve).  A straight line descends from the obtained point to the very bottom of the tunic.  That's all, the pattern is ready.  It remains only to sew the details, the <span>beach dress is</span> ready!  However, again I want to remind you that when transferring the pattern to the fabric, one must not forget about the allowances, this is very important.  Although in this embodiment, a few "stolen" centimeters will not play a role at all. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer tunics patterns" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460919.jpg" width="340"></div></h2><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  In almost all options for cutting summer tunics, there is still quite a lot of excess fabric.  It will not be good if it disappears.  From it you can make, for example, a simple belt that perfectly emphasizes the figure of a lady.  To do this, cut a strip of fabric with a length of about 90-100 cm (a minimum of 20-30 centimeters more than the waist) and the desired width (the belt can be either narrow or wide).  If there is no whole piece of fabric, it‚Äôs okay, you can grind a belt from two or even from three pieces.  Note: for the tunic of the third option, sewing a belt is not required.  It is also worth remembering that you will also need to grind the neck.  To do this, you need a piece of basic tissue, possibly non-woven.  Having examined various beach tunics (photo), patterns can be chosen for every taste.  It is possible to complicate the models somewhat, for example, in some cases, to make a complicated neck that will be fastened with buttons.  You can make the neckline on ribbons.  In some cases, you can let a couple of lines of rubberized thread under your breast, emphasizing the beautiful lines of the figure.  In fact, there are a lot of variations.  No need to be afraid to create, and then everything will turn out in the best way. </p>
