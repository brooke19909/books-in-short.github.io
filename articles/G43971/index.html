    <h2>  Galician capital </h2><p>  Today the High Castle (Lviv) is the most visited attraction of the city.  However, this ancient settlement has so many beautiful objects, so many unusual things that you can safely set aside a few days for its inspection.  The entire center of the ‚Äúcity of Leva‚Äù is protected by UNESCO as the greatest treasure of the world.  Ukrainian Vienna, or Little Paris, it was founded in the thirteenth century by Prince Daniil Romanovich (later he was proclaimed king).  He also gave the settlement a name in honor of his son. </p><p>  The fortress, which later gave the name to the park and the mountain, was erected here at the very beginning of the city.  However, there was not only the High Castle (Lviv), which was an important outpost of the region‚Äôs defense, but also the Low Castle, which few people know about. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park lions high castle where is located" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845497.jpg" width="479"></div>

In the eighteenth century, the fortress was destroyed by the troops of Charles XII, and then the locals dismantled it for their needs.  In the nineteenth century, the remains of the castle were completely dismantled, leaving only a small fragment of the south wall, and a park was set up on the mountain. </p><p>  But before the fort was almost impregnable.  It consisted of a detinets, a roundabout city and a hedge.  In plan, the stone High Castle (Lviv) had the shape of an elongated rectangle with towers in the corners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high castle of lions how to get" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845498.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  In the wake of time </h2><p>  Park "High Castle" Lviv cherishes and stores.  The city is proud of him and must include in every tourist guide.  But not only lovers of antiquity and fortification architecture should climb the hill.  Castle Hill is located in the old part of the Pearl of the Crown of Europe (one of the names of Lviv) and is its highest point.  The Emerald Park is considered a monument of landscape gardening art, and from its viewing platforms an unrivaled panorama opens.  It was from this place that the history of the city began, which continues to this day. </p><h2>  You see, there, on the mountain ... </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, it is worth to see the High Castle Park (Lviv).  Where it is located, the reader already knows.  It is interesting that this object, included in the number of nature <span>reserves of Ukraine,</span> occupies two terraces at once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high castle of lions photo" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845499.jpg" width="479"></div>

At the top of the artificial mound is a large observation deck.  Romantics should go here on the eve of sunset, as a city buried in the sun is simply charming.  As they say, the eye does not take his eyes.  There is also a television tower and a man-made cave guarded by two stone lions.  These statues used to adorn the old city hall, but now they have been moved here.  On the lower terrace there is another observation deck, a restaurant of the same name with a park and a gardener's house. </p><p>  On the Castle Hill of the city of Lviv there is another object worthy of the attention of lovers of antiquity.  This is the Powder Tower, which is considered one of the oldest buildings.  Built in the sixteenth century, it is a vivid example of military-defense architecture.  As the name implies, ammunition was stored in the tower, and when peace reigned, grain was stored in it.  Now, within its walls is housed the Architect's House. </p><h2>  Park location </h2><p>  Do you want to visit the High Castle (Lviv)?  How to get there from the city, we will tell further.  The hill is not difficult to find, and it is visible from anywhere in the city.  In the center there are a large number of signs that will help you not to miss the attraction.  And if this still happened, then the locals will always be happy to help you find your way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park high castle of lions" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845500.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <p>  There are two ways to get to the mountain.  The first of them is located on the side of the street of the same name (High Castle).  This is a pretty steep but short staircase.  The second way will be longer, but easier.  On the street of M. Krivonos, you can see the beginning of a small serpentine, on which you can even get to the hill by car. </p><h2>  Other sights of the city </h2><p>  Describing the interesting places of the ancient Ukrainian city is not an easy task.  There are so many of them that the article would take more than one page.  Therefore, we confine ourselves to a brief list of the best <span>sights of Lviv</span> themselves <span>,</span> and we invite the reader personally to make an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthem.  So this is: </p><ul><li>  Market Square and City Hall; </li><li>  Latin Cathedral Church; </li><li>  <span>Baroque-style</span> Peter and Paul Church with a book depository; </li><li>  Dominican Cathedral; </li><li>  City arsenal; </li><li>  Bernardine Monastery; </li><li>  Kamenitsa of the family Scholz-Wolfovich; </li><li>  restaurant "Kryivka" and others. </li></ul><p>  We can say that Lviv is a landmark of Ukraine.  The greatest personalities of the past lived and worked in it, events took place here that decided the history of the country.  And now the city does not stand aloof from reality, but actively takes part in it.  It hosts international festivals, colorful celebrations and musical events, which attract guests from all over the world. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Many tourists, having overcome the difficult path to Castle Hill, stay here for a few minutes, and then go to inspect other attractions that Lviv is so rich in.  Do not rush, enjoy the atmosphere, which is no longer anywhere in the world!  Bring bedding and some food and have a picnic in the shade of the trees.  Moreover, after the rise, the appetite will certainly break out.  Have a nice trip! </p>
