Make it much easier than it seems at first glance.  Consider several ways to make a casket. </p><h2>  Paper models </h2><p>  A paper box can be an indispensable part of acquaintance with folk art in a kindergarten or school.  To make it, you will need: </p><ul><li>  tape reel; </li><li>  thick cardboard of the same quality as the bobbin; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  cardboard from under a shoe box; </li><li>  stationery knife, scissors; </li><li>  plain cardboard for schoolchildren; </li><li>  material for decoration. </li></ul><p>  So, how to make a box with your own hands from a bobbin from an adhesive tape: </p><ol><li>  Measure a line 1.5 cm wide on the reel.  This will be the cover detail. </li><li>  Now cut 2 circles of thick cardboard on the bottom of the bobbin. </li><li>  To snap the lid of the box, you need to make the inner part longer than the bobbin.  To do this, add 8 millimeters to the width of the bobbin and measure everything on the cardboard from under the shoes. </li><li>  Lubricate the inside of the bobbin and glue this cardboard. </li><li>  Attach the bottoms to the box and lid. </li><li>  If you will draw on a craft, then glue the reel from the outside with a simple white cardboard to hide all the bumps. </li><li>  If you don‚Äôt draw, but are going to decorate in another way, then you can immediately proceed to decorate the surface of the box. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself jewelry box" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/636658.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Scotch bobbin boxes: a discussion of the nuances </h2><p>  With the above method, the lid snaps into place.  If the inside is not extended, the lid can fly off endlessly.  Children will not appreciate such a gift.  Therefore, fasten the cover with paper with teeth.  The photo shows how the paper with stripes looks and how it is fixed.  Please note: if the crafts on the outside will not be decorated, then glue them with the teeth inside the product.  Do the same with the lid. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boxes from bobbins from scotch tape master class" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/636657.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another option for attaching the cover.  Cut a piece of satin ribbon and fasten between the layers of the inner cardboard and bobbin box / cover, leaving a few millimeters.  On the lid between the cardboard layers, glue the same loop.  Now, when opened, the lid is not lost, but opens with the help of a ponytail. </p><p>  A box of bobbins from tape can be decorated as you like.  Decorate the inner surface with velvet paper or sew a satin bag.  The external side can be decorated, pasted with napkins, beads, decorative flowers, quilling elements. </p><h2>  Where to use cardboard boxes? </h2><p>  In small items, you can store buttons, needles, pins, beads, and beads.  In this case, for beads or floss, you can make one-color boxes, and write the name of the accessories and color on top (for those who buy material endlessly). </p><p>  If you make tall tubes (from rolls of toilet paper, cardboard), then, collecting them on one cardboard surface in a row or in a circle, you can make casket baskets for stationery (pencils, pens, rulers, markers, erasers and sharpeners). </p><p>  Such caskets are useful for crafts - a snowman, cake, needle beds.  They are convenient to use in the kitchen for bulk products or spices.  These products can become the basis for classes on the study of murals in kindergartens and schools (Gzhel, Khokhloma, <span>Gorodets painting,</span> haze). </p><p>  A box made of bobbins from scotch tape is quite suitable for storing jewelry, gum and hair clips.  It can be used as a decorative packaging for a gift or used as an attribute of a candy bouquet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boxes of bobbins from scotch tape" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/636661.jpg" width="400"></div>

In the first embodiment, the product is performed in accordance with all the rules described above.  That is, cut the bobbin, glue the bottom to the base and lid, and insert cardboard inside the product so that the top snaps into place. </p><p>  Then, on the bottom of the crafts and lids, glue <span>double-sided tape,</span> fasten a round piece of fabric on top, smoothing all the folds.  Then, using adhesive tape or glue, also fix pieces of fabric on the sides of the product.  It is better to use a non-flowing and elastic material (velveteen, velvet, nylon). </p><p>  It is necessary to pull the fabric so that the casket from the bobbin from the adhesive tape is smooth.  The edges are hidden on the inside of the product where you sew a satin bag with a hidden seam.  Decorate the side of the cover with <span>decorative braid.</span>  Decorate the top of the casket with beads, kanzashi, artificial flowers.  To make the box multifunctional, simply attach the needle bar to the lid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="box of bobbins from scotch tape ideas" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/636659.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Cloth box: second method </h2><p>  The following method of making <span>crafts from cardboard</span> and fabric is suitable for patients: </p><ol><li>  Tighten the bottom of the cardboard and lid with a cloth.  Cut a circle 3 centimeters in diameter larger than the bottom.  Amass it, insert the bottom, pull the thread.  From side to side, like a web, weave the bottom around the circle, trying to grab the fabric where you need to smooth the folds on the outside. </li><li>  Next, tighten the sides of the casket and lid, stitching a strip on the side.  Tuck the edges of the fabric inward. </li><li>  Attach the bottom of the product and, capturing with a secret seam the fabric of both parts of the product, sew the elements.  Do the same with the lid. </li><li>  Now cut a circle and a strip to the size of the sides of the casket and lid, sew them together to form a pouch.  Sew it to the box so that the product has a face on all sides. </li></ol><p>  Here you are ready for a durable box with your own hands from a reel of tape!  As an option: make the product in the first way, and sew a finished bag from the fabric.  ‚ÄúDress‚Äù the box and decorate it with accessories.  The advantage of fabric crafts lies in the variety of ways to open the lid: with Velcro, buttons, locks, lacing, eyelets. </p><h2>  Knitted crafts </h2><p>  The hook allows you to create unusual jewelry and simplify the work of making a box of bobbins from tape.  The master class will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Gather a chain of four air loops. </li><li>  Knit crochet in a circle, adding them through the same number of loops. </li><li>  Constantly apply a circle to the bottom of the box. </li><li>  As soon as knitting began to cover the bottom of the product, knit without adding loops.  The product will begin to round. </li><li>  Knit to the end of the bobbin (not the inner layer of cardboard). </li><li>  Now also tie the box cover. </li><li>  Try on the received details, try to close the box. </li><li>  At the last stage, stick the ‚Äúclothes‚Äù on the product. </li><li>  The top and sides of the box are decorated with knitted flowers or satin elements. </li></ol><p>  The knitted box made of bobbin from scotch tape with amiguri as an ornament looks original (this is a small toy, no more than 10 centimeters).  Such boxes with toys can be given to parents of newborns to store tags and hair. </p>

    <h2>  How to achieve originality? </h2><p>  Beginners should understand only 2 rules when familiarizing themselves with any new direction in needlework: </p><ul><li>  repeat exactly the master class of the specialist in the manufacture of the craft you like; </li><li>  make your own unique thing from the same material. </li></ul><p>  <span>How to make a box with your own hands</span> from a tape reel so that the work is not mistaken for plagiarism?  Here are some suggestions: </p><ol><li>  To get started, decide on the theme of the gift. </li><li>  Gather all available material at hand. </li><li>  Go to handicraft hypermarkets, construction, floristic, fishing and grocery stores, paying attention to unusual shapes and textures of goods. </li><li>  Experiment with the design of the box, trying to combine incompatible things.  For example, it has now become fashionable for designers to decorate a product with burlap, <span>jute twine</span> and pearls with snow-white satin. </li><li>  Create intricate shapes from a rounded box, for example, making it into a turtle, a ladybug, a caterpillar, a butterfly, a flower, a hat, etc. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="box of bobbins from scotch tape" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/636671.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Casket from a reel of tape: ideas, recommendations, tips </h2><p>  Do not drop the case at the start of the journey.  We decided to create caskets in the style of needle beds - which means you sew a variety of hats, biscuits, zigugs, sachets, turtles to your box.  At the same time, they can be combined in different ways: on the product, under it, or making the casket a part of the decor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="box of bobbins from scotch tape ideas" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/636666.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In order for the product to strike with uniqueness, you need to develop your own style.  And for this, you need to find your own direction.  Maybe it will be crafts designed only for needlewomen.  For example, multi-tier caskets in the form of a long tube, the walls of which are tied to ribbons, are in demand.  When it opens, the walls swing open and 4 round caskets appear, glued diagonally.  The tube is very convenient, since the tiers do not close each other and the needlewoman can see all the material. </p><p>  After creating a new model, do not rush to sell it, but try it in action.  Sometimes the bottom can fall off, despite the quality glue.  Then it is worth fixing the box with a cloth or knitted cover. </p><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Western masters have long realized that the most elegant things are obtained from waste material.  If you make a fantasy, you can make chic caskets from scotch bobbins (choose a master class on their manufacture to your liking). </p>
