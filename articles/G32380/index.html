  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Plasma or LED is your choice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It must be understood that there is no single and unambiguous choice - plasma or LED.  This is due to the needs of the buyer and the conditions in which a particular TV model will be viewed.  Each technology of <span>the models</span> released on the <span>market</span> has a number of its pros and cons.  If we consider the concept of LED-TV, then in reality they are the same LCD-TVs, but they use a different method of screen illumination. </p><p>  <strong>Design Features of</strong> <strong>LED <strong>TVs</strong></strong> </p><p>  The principle of operation of the LED-display or TV is very simple.  By positioning the liquid crystal plane in front of the backlight, you can design a kind of adjustable switch.  The polarization plane of crystals can change due to the influence of a different electric current, so the <span>light flux</span> will either completely pass through or be delayed by the LED display, and light or dark areas will be visible on the screen. </p><p>  Passing through <span>liquid crystals</span> or blinds with a huge number of pixels, the light enters the light filter.  Each pixel is complemented by three subpixels of green, red and blue.  This classic 3-color combination allows you to get any colorful color on the screen. </p><p>  <strong>Design Features of Plasma Screen TVs</strong> </p><p>  Each pixel in the plasma is a microlamp with the presence of neon and xenon gases and a small amount of mercury.  The passage of electric current through them makes them glow, and in different colors - red, green and blue.  To each cone there is a special supply supplying a regulating voltage, the magnitude of which will determine the intensity of the glow of the cone of a given color. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Plasma or LED is your choice</strong> </p><p>  Let's see what is better than LED or plasma.  The LED TV has a very thin matrix, it is easy to place on any plane due to its light weight.  The pixel sizes are very small, and their density is extremely high, which gives a very high resolution image, and this guarantees excellent clarity and compatibility with HDTV.  Models are capable of supporting Full HD.  It is possible to convert 2D format to 3D.  Modern models have a convenient Smart Hub interface with the ability to connect to the Internet using the Internet @ TV and Skype. </p><p>  Enhanced Wide Color Enhancer (Plus) and 800 Hz <span>Clear Motion Rate</span> .  Using the Allshare + function, you can easily, seamlessly connect to any compatible digital device.  The remote control is universal thanks to Allshare +.  Most consumers still prefer LED LCD Full HD TVs due to the lack of high-voltage backlight.  Thanks to the LED backlight, the picture is very bright and high-quality, <span>power consumption, of</span> course, much less. </p><p>  The contrast of modern models, whether plasma or LED, is quite high, but this parameter for plasma TVs is still higher than LED TVs.  Thanks to this, it is possible to obtain an amazing depth (level) of black with an amazing amount of image.  Plasma panels can bore your eyes only with close viewing, but provide comfortable viewing of television shows in a large area, and high contrast is not related to the viewing angle of the screen.  The plasma response time is negligible. </p><p>  Again, to solve the problem - plasma or LED - the processor will help you.  An 18-bit plasma processor delivers trillions of shades of color.  A huge supply of shades with maximum realism conveys the color of any object even in low light, and the volume and depth of the image are fully preserved.  The LED TV has a 10-bit processor, which processes about a billion shades of colors. </p><p>  To increase the clarity of the plasma, the Silhouette Editor function or the removal of false contours is provided.  The Silhouette function determines the contours of an object and corrects transitions from a dark image to a light picture.  The result is a clear picture without false appearances.  Real 100 Hz provides smooth and realistic transitions of the movement of the picture.  A special filter Ultra Filter Bright 2, installed between the glass of the panel and the matrix, refracts and neutralizes external light, but freely transmits the panel image.  Now you do not need to look for a suitable place for plasma, which avoids glare on the screen. </p><p>  Plasma Vs LED TVs may seem identical, but as you can see from this very brief overview, this is absolutely not the case.  Therefore, preferring a particular model, you are limited in the guarantee that it will not be outdated in a month.  Choose quality! </p>
