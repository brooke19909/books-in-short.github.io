The first contributors to the fund were the employees themselves.  And for more than 20 years now, the client base of NPFs continues to grow.  Over the past period, the fund has taken a leading position among similar organizations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lukoil guarantor npf reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146514.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fund Information </h2><p>  Investors are attracted by the stability of the income received by Lukoil-Garant Non-State Pension Fund: reviews confirm this, although many mention the desire to see a greater result.  From 2013 to 2015, the company's profitability increased from 6.6 to 8.7%.  By the end of 2016, the growth trend continued.  The total amount of savings invested in the fund reached 250 billion rubles.  A high level in the rating remained for OAO NPF Lukoil-Garant in 2017. </p><p>  Expert RA, one of the most respected rating agencies, rated Lukoil-Garant in terms of reliability and profitability at A ++.  The highest level of reliability was awarded by the NPF and the national rating agency; it entered the top ten Russian NPFs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The choice of a non-state pension fund </h2><p>  When choosing an NPF, it is very important to make sure that he has a license to carry out this type of activity.  NPF Lukoil-Garant received a perpetual license back in 2014, and it was not subject to revocation.  Since the beginning of 2015, the fund has also been participating in the investment insurance program.  The point is that in case of liquidation or bankruptcy of the fund, all depositors will receive their initial investments.  Payment will be made by the state.  This system adds future retirees confidence in the future. </p><p>  By joining the Lukoil-Garant fund, depositors in the future can count on the following types of payments: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jsc npf lukoil guarantor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146508.jpg"></div>

    <ol><li>  One-time payment of all accumulated funds. </li><li>  Payment of savings monthly for at least 10 years. </li><li>  Lifetime payout every month. </li><li>  Compensation of pension payments to successors. </li></ol><p>  The Lukoil-Garant Fund begins to pay the accumulated funds when the depositor reaches retirement age in accordance with the pension legislation.  Since 2017, adjustments have been made to paragraphs regarding the age of legal leave.  The right to retire was extended to 60 and a half years for men and to 55 and a half years for women.  Each year, the retirement age will increase by 6 months <span>and will reach 63 in women by 2032, and 65 in men by 2027</span> . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entry conditions </h2><p>  Before contacting OAO NPF Lukoil-Garant for processing payments, you should check the amount of funds accumulated in the account.  After that, you can write an application for payment.  <span>The</span> depositor's <span>pension accumulations are</span> paid to successors after entering into the right of succession after 6 months.  In this case, it will be necessary to send to the fund documents confirming the right to dispose of the depositor's funds. </p><p>  Another important point is the investor‚Äôs right to receive a social tax deduction.  This compensation is possible subject to regular transfers of funds within three years to a pension account.  The tax deduction for the application for the card or the passbook is transferred. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146509.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  News about NPF Lukoil-Garant for 2017 </h2><p>  If we consider the activities of NPFs over the past year 2017, we can conclude that the stability and reliability of the fund are far from empty words.  Monitoring conducted at the beginning of 2017, as well as reviews on NPF Lukoil-Garant, showed that up to 80% of depositors are ready to recommend the fund to their friends. </p><p>  In March of this year, the non-state pension fund Lukoil-Garant announced its intention to index the pensions of depositors who have reached 70 years of age.  Since April, three new online services have been launched right away, available to each client of the fund in their personal account on the site.  These innovations made it possible to make requests for documents, update existing data and update information, as well as apply for a pension.  However, not everyone was satisfied with the innovations.  Opinions were expressed that the service could be done alone, and that would be more convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  High positions among non-state pension funds </h2><p>  In April and May, Lukoil-Garant remained at the leading position in the lists of non-state pension funds, as it showed a positive trend in all its performance indicators.  Many put Lukoil-Garant on a par with NPFs from Sberbank.  The competition in this case is justified, since both funds are equally successful in attracting new customers.  Like NPF Sberbank, Lukoil-Garant does not enter into high-risk transactions and does not try to attract customers with the promise of sky-high profits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rating NPF Lukoil Guarantor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146510.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Many believe that it is precisely such a conservative approach to financial issues that allows the fund to remain stable and reliable.  In August, however, the purchase of the Otkritie FC fund was announced.  Change of leadership, as a rule, leads to changes in the policy of the whole company.  Investors hope that there will be no negative consequences for such a union. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  There are many positive reviews on the Internet about NPF Lukoil-Garant.  This is due to the consistently high positions in the most reputable reliability and profitability ratings obtained by the fund for a perpetual license and more than 20 years of existence. </p><p>  The fund experienced a lot during this period, including adverse economic situations in the country, showing stable incomes.  Although the profits were not transcendental, the fund never appeared in the last rows.  High ratings of NPF Lukoil-Garant confirm this. </p><p>  It is these factors that inspire confidence among customers of NPF Lukoil-Garant.  Among the positive features of the fund, in addition to the lack of negative returns, customers also highlight the improvement of online services, stability and confidence in the future.  Progress can be judged by the fact that back in 2015, in order to receive a password from your personal account, you had to contact the office or send notarized copies of documents directly to the fund.  Judging by the reviews of NPF Lukoil-Garant, since 2016 this problem has been resolved and registration in your personal account can be done without leaving your home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lukoil Garant NPF Yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146511.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Identified weaknesses </h2><p>  However, there are quite a lot of negative reviews about the work of NPF Lukoil-Garant.  Some complaints are not directly related to the fund, but the imperfection of the organization system should be recognized.  There are comments about unfairly attracting clients to non-state pension funds without their consent.  This happens when applying for a loan at the bank, when after a while a person finds himself a customer of Lukoil-Garant.  More often than not, Home Credit Bank is found in such reviews. </p><p>  In the future, an involuntary client of the fund has to spend a lot of time visiting the company‚Äôs office to write an application for refusing services of private pension funds.  Another drawback is the need to send notarized copies of documents by mail in case the customer data has changed.  For such cases, the fund does not provide for the processing of electronic inquiries. </p><h2>  Difficulty transferring money </h2><p>  Some reviews mention the difficulties of transferring funds from another non-state pension fund, as well as problems with obtaining statements of account balance and withdrawal of funds after the expiration of the contract.  There are cases of filing a lawsuit, as negotiations on the withdrawal of funds from the fund do not give a result. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in such matters, high rates of NPFs do not save.  There are other points that anger investors.  This is a problem with dialing the hotline of the fund, the incompetence of representatives, the need to pay tax on profits received from the fund, etc. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Address NPF Lukoil Guarantor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146512.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are representative offices of NPF Lukoil-Garant in many cities of Russia, for example NPF Lukoil-Garant in Yekaterinburg, and in this case it is easier to resolve current issues.  However, in the absence of an office of the Lukoil-Garant Non-State Pension Fund in any region, the solution to the problems is delayed, as it occurs through mail and phone calls. </p><p>  Another problem is the lack of feedback from customers online in reviews. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Rating indicators are very important for any large company, as they show reliability and profitability.  As mentioned above, NPF Lukoil-Garant received the highest rating of its activities in the rating of the national agency.  And this indicator really inspires confidence.  The fund's policy provides for the rejection of risky investments and relies on the long term.  This option of doing business allows you to be stable, but does not give high returns. </p><p>  Some compare Lukoil-Garant with Sberbank.  Both organizations have been afloat for a long time and adhere to their strategy of preserving invested funds, not their multiplication.  This is not always liked by investors.  To many, this restraint seems unjustified.  In any case, the funded part of your pension is best added to the fund, and not refuse to form it.  This will give a chance to get a substantial increase in future payments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF Lukoil Guarantor Offices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146513.jpg"></div>
