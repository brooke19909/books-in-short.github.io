Most of these models are not cheap, so not every user is available.  But at the present time you can find an alternative option.  There are manufacturers who produce inexpensive gadgets with a fairly capacious battery.  In this article, we will consider the smartphone of the not very popular Vertex brand.  For many users, it is associated more with accessories than with gadgets.  But it is worth paying tribute, this company produces pretty good smartphones that occupy a certain niche in the budget segment.  In June 2017, the Vertex Impress Lion 4G was introduced.  Owner reviews have already begun to appear on the Web.  This review will be built on them.  Also consider the characteristics declared by the manufacturer.  The price of the phone starts at 5600 rubles.  Is the optimal combination of cost and hardware maintained?  Let's get it right. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Before you start the review of Vertex Impress Lion 4G, let's talk a little about the company itself.  She appeared in 2010.  At the time of formation, it was a venture capital fund, the capital of which was limited to 4 million dollars.  The company did not have a lot of employees, however, this did not prevent it from developing successfully.  Three years later, assets significantly increased and amounted to $ 90 million. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2015, the products of this brand began to appear on the markets of Europe and the countries of the former CIS.  A year later, representative offices were opened in Russia, France, Ukraine, Germany, and Kazakhstan. </p><p>  This company is considered a major supplier of accessories for gadgets.  More recently, phones have also been sold under this brand.  The first line of smartphones is called Impress.  It is not chosen by chance.  Translated from English, this word means "impress."  The manufacturer thus wanted to show that phones, even for little money, can surprise a modern user.  And is it really so, we have to figure it out. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the Vertex Impress Lion 4G packaging, an overview of which will be presented below, is made quite solidly.  Looking at it, you might think that inside is a premium gadget.  Thick cardboard, painted in black, gives presentability.  All labels and images are printed with high quality.  The information is presented in full, so the buyer can immediately get acquainted with all the main characteristics.  The users, of course, were pleased with the packaging box, since for the budget segment, such a luxury is a rarity. </p><p>  But the set of components does not cause applause.  Only 1A power supply and 1 meter USB cable are included with the phone.  The documentation is packed neatly in a special cardboard folder. </p>

    <h2>  Vertex Impress Lion 4G: camera description </h2><p>  Unfortunately, many users were disappointed with the capabilities of the cameras.  As the front, a 2-megapixel module is implemented.  The maximum resolution of pictures taken by her is 1600 √ó 1200 px.  There is a flash LED.  A wide range of settings allows you to easily make custom changes.  With this camera, you can make video calls and record video.  The maximum quality of the rollers is 640 √ó 480 px.  Frame rate - 30 fps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A slightly better used sensor in the main camera.  It has an 8 megapixel camera.  There is also a flash.  There are no special comments on image quality.  Photos are satisfactory with a maximum size of 3264 √ó 2448 px.  The developers have provided in the application menu all the necessary functions.  These include panoramic mode, face recognition, burst shooting and more. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  What do users say about the Vertex Impress Lion 4G screen?  Its characteristics, of course, are far from ideal, but the IPS-matrix provides a good image.  Viewing angles are average.  Contrast and brightness are noticeably reduced when the device is tilted in different directions.  The average diagonal is 5 inches.  In millimeters, the dimensions of the display are 110.69 √ó 62.26.  The side frame, although not very thick, is immediately striking, especially in the light version of the case.  In black, it is visible only when the screen is on.  Image quality is limited to a resolution of 1280 √ó 720 px.  A 24-bit color depth provides good color reproduction.  However, the brightness level disappointed the owners.  The screen looks, so to speak, dim.  Due to the average pixel density (294 ppi) it is impossible to consider the ‚Äúsquares‚Äù with the naked eye, the picture looks complete.  On the street, it will be a little difficult to interact with the <span>Vertex</span> Impress Lion 4G <span>phone</span> - the manufacturer did not provide anti-reflective coating. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance, dimensions, ergonomics </h2><p>  This smartphone looks like most models of the budget segment.  The case is plastic, although from afar it is easy to confuse it with a metal one.  The phone turned out to be not very weighty, but it is still palpable in the hand, since its mass is 162 g. Due to the capacious battery, the developers had to sacrifice thickness, so the user gets a gadget (10.2 mm), which is rather thick, as by modern standards. .  But surprisingly, this did not cause a flurry of negative reviews.  Vertex Impress Lion 4G can not be called compact, its height and width are 144 and 72 mm, respectively.  Black and golden pieces are on sale, so you can‚Äôt count on a wide variety of colors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The side edges of the smartphone are arched, which is quite advantageously displayed on the design as a whole.  Thanks to them, the device lies comfortably in the hand, while touching the surfaces there are pleasant sensations.  The developers arranged all the connectors according to the standard scheme, so the owners will not have to get used to a particular key for a long time.  Two separate buttons act as a ‚Äúswing‚Äù of volume.  Users claim that this is a good solution, as it is convenient to use them. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The budget of the Vertex Impress Lion 4G smartphone is fully open when you check its performance.  The device is based on an insufficiently powerful chipset, which in principle is quite expected in the price category up to 6000 rubles.  The <span>MediaTek MT6737 processor is</span> manufactured using a 28 nm process.  Management is via the ARMv8-A architecture.  It is based on four 64-bit computing modules of the Cortex-A53 type.  The processing speed of duty cycles is limited to 1300 MHz.  The ARM Mali-T720 MP2 graphics card acts as a coprocessor.  It is capable of operating at a frequency of 650 MHz.  Such a "filling" is enough only for everyday tasks and undemanding games.  But ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications will make the device ‚Äúthink‚Äù. </p><p>  RAM in this model is single-channel.  Type - LPDDR3.  Its speed is limited to a frequency of 640 MHz.  Volume - 1 GB.  Built-in storage is small - 8 GB.  Even the most undemanding user will have to use a flash card.  Expand memory up to 32 GB.  But in the reviews, the owners drew attention to the fact that installing the application on an external drive does not work, so you will have to experience some inconvenience, for example, when installing a new game, delete the old one. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Vertex Impress Lion 4G received most of the positive reviews thanks to the battery.  The structure of the battery is lithium polymer.  Type - removable.  The battery is quite capacious - 4400 mAh.  Charges via 5V / 1A adapter.  There is an option that provides quick recovery of battery life.  Using it, you can charge up to 80% in just 1.5 hours. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims that in standby mode the gadget is able to work for about 13-15 days.  The result is undeniably impressive.  Fans of long conversations will also appreciate this smartphone, since the battery life is enough for 12 hours in this mode. </p><p>  In fact, the device with a large load works for at least 2 days without recharging.  Even with the Internet turned on (4G, Wi-Fi), you can expect about 24 hours, and there is no need to limit the time of the active screen.  Such smartphones with a powerful battery and a good camera can be safely taken on hikes, since in a sparing mode of operation, the resource of the battery will last at least 5-7 days. </p>

    <h2>  OS </h2><p>  Another indisputable advantage is the new version of the operating system that runs this phone model.  Developers implemented in the device ‚ÄúAndroid 7.0‚Äù.  Many users have noticed that in the budget segment there are still few devices that run on the Nougat version.  The smartphone does not have a proprietary shell, so you can enjoy a ‚Äúclean‚Äù system without any changes.  Some owners consider this a significant advantage. </p><p>  The main screen looks standard.  In the upper part there is a service line on which SIM cards, battery status, clock are displayed.  Immediately below it is the Google search bar.  In the lower part are the most commonly used applications (calls, messages, camera, etc.). </p>

    <h2>  Vertex Impress Lion 4G: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the review of Impress Lion 4G, we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the gadget.  As for the device‚Äôs strengths, users focused on high-quality assembly, attractive design, excellent 4G performance, battery capacity, seventh Android, and air update. </p><p>  But not without comments.  Most of the negative reviews are addressed towards the firmware.  It is definitely unfinished.  When you first charge the battery, you can‚Äôt reach 100%.  The owners had to reset to factory settings, after which the device starts to work correctly.  Also, I really did not like the lack of the ability to save applications on a flash card.  And the anger of users is understandable, since only 8 GB of memory is integrated in the smartphone. </p>
