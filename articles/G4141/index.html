But we learn more about everything. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  In general, according to our compatriots, the Siagas Beach Hotel 3 * hotel, being a budget, offers its guests clean and comfortable rooms without any frills.  Here you will not find expensive furniture, state-of-the-art equipment, a jacuzzi and designer repairs.  However, the rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay.

    <h2>  Infrastructure, location </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, Siagas Beach Hotel 3 * (Attica) is ideal for those people who do not want to spend too much on the hotel, but plan to spend their holidays enjoying a beach holiday and visiting the sights of Greece.  In Siagas Beach, you will not find any special entertainment, with the exception of a large open-air pool and a sun terrace.  A big plus, however, is the availability of free wireless Internet throughout the hotel.  So, you can use Wi-Fi both in your room and on the beach and in the public areas of Siagas Beach. </p><p>  The village in which the hotel is located is very quiet and calm.  Even to the nearest supermarket you will have to cover a distance of the order of one and a half kilometers.  But the hotel‚Äôs own beach is literally a minute's walk from the residential building.  Therefore, if you do not like to walk a lot, do not plan to rent a car, and also want to have a lot of bars, restaurants, shops and other infrastructure near the hotel, then you should probably choose a different place to stay . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siagas beach hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1525905.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Food </h2><p>  The hotel offers its guests several dining options.  However, most tourists are advised to choose half board (breakfast and dinner) when booking.  So, you can always eat in the mornings and evenings in the restaurant Siagas Beach Hotel 3 * (Greece).  In the daytime, you will not be attached to the hotel in terms of food.  Therefore, you can try new dishes during excursions and walks.  As for the food at Siagas Beach, in general, tourists considered it reasonably acceptable for an economy hotel.  So, the menu here is not very diverse, but you can always choose something to your taste. </p><h2>  Service, staff </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of the travelers, they were mostly satisfied with the service at the hotel in question.  However, some guests note the fact that maids often strive to enter the room and start cleaning, even if the guests have not left the apartment.  Therefore, if you do not want to be disturbed, be sure to hang an appropriate sign on the door.  In general, as for cleaning, the guests were quite satisfied with its quality.  According to them, the maids conscientiously fulfill their duties. </p><p>  Our compatriots also pay attention to the fact that there are few tourists from Russia and other countries of the former USSR in the hotel.  Perhaps that is why the hotel staff does not speak Russian.  In this regard, be prepared for what you have to explain here in English. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Almost all guests of Siagas Beach claim that the main advantage of the hotel is its walking distance to the sea.
