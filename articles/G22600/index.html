This has made it easier for many residents of our country to resolve the issue of summer vacations.  Although why only summer?  Crimea, its southern coast, and especially the beautiful Yalta in October are no less surprising and welcoming. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The name of the city comes from the Greek word "yalos", which means "shore", and the first mention of historians is attributed to the XII century.  After centuries of transition from one conqueror to another at the end of the 18th century, the city fell into decay and looked like a fishing village. </p>

    <p>  But falling into the jurisdiction of the Russian Empire, by the middle of the XIX century, Yalta began to flourish in the literal sense.  For the rest of the reigning persons, magnificent palaces of Oreanda and Livadia were built. </p><p>  In the post-revolutionary period, sanatoriums and hospitals began to be built here.  And the rides of vacationers and patients did not stop after a hot summer.  Many artists, both during the Russian Empire and after the revolution, preferred to come here in the fall, in the so-called velvet season. </p><h2>  Relax in the velvet season </h2><p>  Yalta in October is more beautiful than ever.  She was saturated with the hot sun, had a lot of fun with summer vacationers and now she is preparing herself for rest.  The weather in Yalta in October perfectly contributes to relaxation.  There are already no such crowds of tourists, children are not screaming everywhere, nature gives off the heat collected during three hot summer months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This can be confirmed by any site with a weather forecast - the water temperature in Yalta in October over the past 5 years has not dropped below 16.5 ¬∞ C.  Now, if you observe the weather on the same site, then there is already a slightly different picture.  According to statistics, the air temperature in Yalta in October is on average about 13 ¬∞ C, but can rise to +19 ¬∞ C.  This is due to the fact that there are about 20 sunny days, and precipitation is expected no more than once during the whole month. </p><p>  Before you go, it is worth looking at all the reviews of those who have ever rested here.  People are different, and every opinion is worth considering.  Someone seeks tranquility, solitude, and for others, communication, an active lifestyle, but without depressing summer heat, is important.  Holidays in Yalta in October, everyone remembers differently. </p><h2>  What to do (for active tourists) </h2><p>  The weather in Yalta in October is for delightful walks in the most beautiful surroundings.  There is something to see here - both historical sights, and natural landscapes, boat trips, walks along mountain trails. </p><p>  If time is available, then you can go on a hiking trip to Livadia. </p><p>  And there are also many opportunities to conquer the local mountain ranges.  You can go your own team - with whom you came, or you can contact local travel agencies that will offer any convenient and interesting route. </p>

    <p>  On a beautiful morning, wet from dew, wake up in a tent, disperse the fog with your hands, warm water in a pot, take a sip with pleasure, enjoy a morning drink and look at the amazing opening pictures of the local distinctive nature of Crimea - what could be better? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But for some, the road to Ai-Petri by minibus, and back by funicular will be an excellent occasion to share later memories of a short trip. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  <em>Massandra Palace</em> .  The long history of the transfer of the palace from hand to hand, from favorites to merchants, and then for debts to the treasury of the sovereign ended when Mikhail Sergeyevich Vorontsov got down to business.  He coped well with the construction of the palace, the adjacent church, the layout of parks until his death.  Further, this palace became the hunting house of Nicholas II. </p><p>  In the post-revolutionary period, it was a government summer residence.  Now it is one of the most beautiful museum complexes in Russia. </p>

    <p>  <em>Nikitsky Botanical Garden</em> .  For all lovers of natural beauty, more than 20 thousand species of various plants are represented here.  <span>Lebanese cedar,</span> bamboo thickets, Indian lilacs, Australian eucalyptus trees and many other miracles are impossible to list. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em>Livadia Palace</em> .  Created by Count Potocki, this eye-satisfying palace received a second life after the death of its founder.  It was during the reign of Nicholas II. </p><p>  The magnificent building is eclipsed by a park that spans almost 50 hectares.  Wisteria and roses, peach, plum, almond trees are planted here.  Starting in spring, Livadia Park is filled with the most delicate aromas.  Autumn is not less colorful here.  At any time of the year, the beautiful contours of the palace seem to hover above the park - between heaven and earth. </p><p>  After the revolution, a sanatorium was organized here.  During the Second World War, the famous Yalta Conference of Russia, Great Britain and the USA was held here. </p><p>  Now it is a wonderful museum complex, open to visitors and events. </p><p>  Or you can just walk along the famous <em>Yalta embankment</em> , which is famous for its palm alleys. </p><h2>  Yalta for children </h2><p>  In 1970, the Glade of Fairy Tales was discovered.  The most popular museum in the Soviet Union.  Here, in the vast expanses of beautiful nature, in mild climatic conditions created from wood, bark, moss, figures of popular fairy-tale characters.  And while the baby with pleasure and screeches rushes from one character to another, and there are more than two hundred of them, adults can enjoy the calming landscape and the mesmerizing Wuchang-Su waterfall. </p><p>  It is considered perhaps the highest in Europe.  Its height is almost 100 meters.  Waterfall "Flying Water" fascinates with its power.  But in the heat it dries out very much, and in winter it is just a powerful frozen water block. </p><p>  Like any territory, the Glade of Tales has its own map of the area.  There you can choose a travel route - go see the heroes of American, European tales or spend time with your favorite characters from Russian and Ukrainian legends. </p>

    <p>  There is also a zoo, dolphinariums and the sea ... </p><h2>  Region development </h2><p>  Since Yalta is primarily a spa region, an important factor in the development of the region is the preservation of the environment.  The efforts are made not only by the local administration, but also by the federal authorities actively support the region in this direction.  It is important not only to preserve nature and the environment as a whole, but also to create all the conditions in order to pass Big Yalta to the next generation as the best health resort and natural-climatic resort. </p><p>  Considering the fact that there are more and more coming from year to year, the topic is quite serious.  It also affects the next direction of development - transport. </p><p>  After the Crimean bridge is put into operation by the season of 2018, the flow of people arriving in their own car can decrease significantly, as trains arriving on the peninsula can cope with the volume of passenger traffic.  Well, and accordingly, the fare will decrease.  At least, everyone hopes for it - both potential vacationers and those who live here. </p><h2>  Or maybe live here? </h2><p>  Indeed, perhaps, here to live, wait out the snowy Russian winter?  Yalta itself, its weather in October, water temperature, natural beauties, peace, literally soaring in the air - all evokes thoughts of a calm measured life. </p><p>  Together with the preservation of available resources, the city is developing and growing in the literal sense.  A lot of new buildings - residential, office, industrial - everything is being created at a fast pace.  Particularly well resolved is the construction of residential complexes. </p><p>  Offers from agencies and developers themselves are enough.  It‚Äôs just worth deciding on the price range, and on the basis of this, look for suitable offers in the area. </p>

    <p>  A lot of offers of the European format - that is, you can enter only with personal belongings.  The whole decor - furniture and appliances, even towels and tablecloths - is already in stock. </p><h2>  Create a business in Yalta? </h2><p>  A great opportunity to expand your own business or create a franchise.  The flow of tourists will only grow here.  It is worth supporting the level of service.  Yes, there is a moment of seasonality, but these 5-6 months then perfectly feed the rest of the year.  Until the start of the next active tourist season.  Although, according to reviews on the forums, in October, Yalta does not remain without visitors. </p><p>  Therefore, it is worthwhile to come to a quiet velvet season and look around.  This is a great occasion even for start-ups. </p><h2>  Region fashion </h2>

    <p>  Here, politeness, friendliness, good mood and bright colors in clothes are always in fashion.  In the hot season, only they save from the sweltering summer weather.  But the temperature in October in Yalta disposes to warm clothes in delicate colors, to a cup of coffee in the morning on the terrace, in the evening to aromatic herbal tea or a glass of excellent local Massandra wine. </p><p>  And for those who are not all right with their health, local sanatoriums have a fashion for excellent healing procedures. </p>
