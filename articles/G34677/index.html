  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to set up a satellite dish yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Information technology is currently striking at a rapid pace of development, providing more and more opportunities for modern man.  Despite the gradual development of Internet television, satellite broadcasting remains in first place in terms of popularity and broadcast quality, since it can give a clear picture of a digital image at any time of the day or night.  That is why many people are thinking about how to set up a satellite dish and is it possible to do this on their own.  The answer here will be in the affirmative, since it is quite accessible to every person, subject to a careful study of the technology for setting up satellite equipment. </p><p>  So, first of all, it should be remembered that the most popular satellites that broadcast today 73 Russian-language channels are Sirius, Amos and Hotbird.  The main advantage of installing a dish is its price, because sooner or later you will fully pay for the cost of satellite equipment.  Indeed, most television channels are broadcast without encoding and therefore completely free. </p><p>  How to set up a <span>satellite dish,</span> and what is needed for this?  To highlight this issue, we start with a kit of a standard set of satellite dishes: </p><ol><li>  Mirror (plate) - serves to receive a signal from a satellite, and can have sizes from 60 to 129 cm in diameter. </li><li>  Converter - is a device for transcoding the signal to the frequency with which the following device works - the receiver. </li><li>  DVC - Receiver - directly receives the decrypted signal from the converter and transmits it to your digital device (TV, plasma, and so on).  In addition, DiSEq (disek), a device for connecting several converters into a single unit, as well as cables and brackets, are also included in the standard delivery package.  And, of course, you should not forget about high-quality mounting devices, with the help of which you will need to direct the dish to the satellite in a south-westerly direction. </li></ol><p>  There are many manuals where you can find the answer to the question of how to set up a satellite dish yourself, however, if you analyze many of them, then all the work can be reduced to several stages: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Preparation of equipment for installation.  At this stage, according to the instructions, you assemble the plate itself by attaching brackets and all other technical parts to it.  It is important to pay attention to the fact that you must carefully connect the ‚ÄúF‚Äù cable to the connector located at the bottom of the plate on the receiver.  Opening the lid, we find there a screen in which there will be several connectors, in one of which we install the cable.  After that, the converters are connected to the disek, which, in turn, is attached through a special connector to the receiver. </p><ol><li>  How to set up a satellite dish to receive a good and high-quality signal?  Now we proceed to the most critical part of the entire operation - the satellite dish settings.  So, we adjust the frequency of reception to the Sirius satellite, for which we set the speed of 27500 in the receiver, the frequency of 11766 with polarization ‚ÄúH‚Äù.  The receiver has two signal reception bands - red and yellow. The first shows the connection of the plate and the signal level.  The yellow bar determines the quality of the supplied signal.  Usually, immediately after connection, the last red bar shows a signal somewhere at the level of 35-40%, and the yellow one approaches zero.  After that, it remains to adjust the signal quality by turning the plate to find the most acceptable position for the signal.  You should turn the plate with the receiver adjustment until the signal quality increases to 65-70%, which will guarantee you a high-quality image in any weather.  Thus, we now know how to set up a tricolor satellite dish.  For additional signal amplification, it is necessary to adjust the side convectors with the appropriate frequencies (Amos - frequency 10722, polarization ‚ÄúH‚Äù, Yu speed 27500; for Hotbird frequency 11034, polarization ‚ÄúV‚Äù, speed 27500).  After that, press the SCAN key on the receiver, and the system will automatically find and save all the possible channels for you. </li></ol><p>  Now the question of how to set up a satellite dish is not difficult for us, because, knowing the features of installing the equipment of the entire system, you can make the correct settings yourself. </p><p>  Have a nice view! </p>
