    <h2>  A family </h2><p>  Aldar's father - Bator Zhargalovich - for many years served in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  After retirement, he works in the security service in the kindergarten "Sun", the nurse of which is his wife Biligma Zydygaevna.  In total, the family had four children: the eldest Irina and Bulat, as well as the twins Aldar and Aryuna. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Aldar Tsydenzhapov was born in August 1991 in the village of Aginskoye in the same-named district of the then Buryat Autonomous Okrug (now Trans-Baikal Territory).  He graduated from the local secondary school No. 1. Although initially the young man was going to go to college, he changed his mind and decided to go to serve in the navy.  This choice did not surprise anyone, since his grandfather - Zydygi Garmaevich Vanchikov - was a sailor in his youth.  The military commissariat Aldar did not want to list the crew of sailors, since he had a relatively small weight and height.  However, the young man, as well as Bator Zhargalovich insisted, and the young man‚Äôs dream to serve in the Russian Navy came true. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  After the call </h2><p>  In November 2009, Aldar Tsydenzhapov entered military service and was sent to military unit No. 40074 of the Pacific Fleet, which is deployed in the city of Fokino (Primorsky Territory).  Already in the first months upon arrival, the young sailor began to show a desire to become a contractor in the future and to connect his life with the sea. </p><h2>  Feat </h2><p>  The events, which were then written by all the Russian media, occurred on the morning of September 24 at the base in Fokino.  On that day, the crew of the Bystry destroyer, including Aldar Tsydenzhapov, was on board and was preparing to go to Kamchatka.  Suddenly, a fire broke out in the engine room.  As was subsequently proved, a fire occurred due to a wiring short circuit caused by a break in the fuel pipe. </p><p>  Shortly before the incident, Aldar Tsydenzhapov took up duty as the engineer of the boiler team.  The young man rushed to shut off the fuel leak.  For about 9 seconds the young sailor was at the epicenter of the fire.  After eliminating the leak, Aldar independently got out of the compartment, engulfed in flames.  Sailors Alexander Korovin and Pavel Osetrov also suffered.  The comrades who arrived in time saw that the guy received severe burns, and provided him with emergency medical care.  Then Aldar was taken to the hospital of the Pacific Fleet, located in Vladivostok.  For 4 days, doctors fought for the hero‚Äôs life, but on September 28 the young man died without regaining consciousness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On October 5, the coffin with the body of Aldar, accompanied by officers and sailors, was delivered to his native village of Aginskoye.  The next day, according to the Buryat tradition, the invited lama held a ceremony of rebirth of the soul, and then a funeral ceremony was held. </p>

    <h2>  Action assessment </h2><p>  The operational actions of Aldar and other sailors led to the shutdown of the Fast destroyer power plant.  If they could not do this, she could explode and inflict great damage on the destroyer, as well as the entire crew of about 300 people. </p><p>  According to experienced sailors, Aldar Tsydenzhapov is a hero who consciously risked his life, knowing what consequences his actions might have. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Aldar Tsydenzhapov, whose biography can fit in just a few lines, became an example of devotion to duty for many young sailors and soldiers. </p><p>  On November 16, 2010, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation D. Medvedev, he was awarded the title Hero of Russia.  During the ceremony held in the Kremlin, the Golden Star was awarded to the parents of the young man.  According to a long tradition, a bust was installed in the young man‚Äôs homeland, and one of the streets of Aginsky was named after him. </p><p>  In addition, the Transbaikal poet Boris Makarov dedicated the hero to the poem Aldar, which was presented at the memorial evening by the Chita Tetra troupe. </p><h2>  Corvette Bookmark </h2><p>  In June 2015, a corvette was laid at the shipyard of the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, which will be named after A. Tsydenzhapov.  The ceremony was held on the eve of the <span>Day of the</span> Russian <span>Navy</span> .  The new ship is a multi-purpose patrol ship, which is designed to deal with the surface fleet in the near sea zone, as well as with enemy submarines.  The decision to give the name ‚ÄúAldar‚Äù to the corvette, which, by the way, translated from the hero‚Äôs native language means ‚ÄúGlory‚Äù, is very symbolic, since in this way the young man will continue to serve his homeland. </p><p>  In addition, on the destroyer "Quick" his berth will forever be assigned to him. </p>
