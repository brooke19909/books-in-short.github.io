This country is not for hotel holidays.  Here you need to enjoy beautiful beaches and rich excursions.  For an active tourist, this accommodation option will be just perfect.  Despite some shortcomings (scuffed walls, old plumbing), you will be satisfied with the rest.  Of particular interest are art objects on a well-groomed green area, as well as interesting design elements in the rooms. </p><p>  If you nevertheless scrupulously relate to the living conditions, then pay attention to the fact that the hotel has 2 buildings.  The rooms in the new building are more spacious, and the repairs in them are more recent.  In addition, it is worth paying attention to the presence of a balcony and a view from the window.  If you do not want to contemplate the wall of a neighboring hotel, then book a room with a view of the pool (or do not spare money for a surcharge for relocation).  As for nutrition, limit yourself to breakfast.  Cheaper and tasty food can be found in the many cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. </p>
