This noble and wealthy family had many palaces in different parts of the Russian Empire.  For example, the house on the Moika was in the possession of five generations of the Yusupovs.  This structure fully reflected the financial situation of the family.  Behind a clear, harmonious facade that does not allow us to say about the true size of the palace, the magnificent splendor of its interior is hidden. </p>

    <h2>  About the palace </h2><p>  Yusupov Palace is an invaluable object for the tourism industry.  Tours in St. Petersburg often include a visit to this building.  The most famous city storylines found themselves in it: the luxurious life of Russian aristocratic society and the famous <span>murder of Rasputin.</span>  Unfortunately, the legendary event for many annulled the great history of the palace. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The palace on the Moika passed into the possession of the Yusupovs in 1830, having changed several owners before this.  At the beginning of the XVIII century nearby was the estate of the niece of Peter I, then owned by <span>Count Shuvalov.</span>  <span>Shuvalov</span> built the first baroque palace.  The count‚Äôs son sold this house and founded nearby another building, created in the style of classicism, which became the prototype of the modern Yusupov Palace.  To this day, the triumphal arch of the main entrance and the high fence with columns have been preserved from this building. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During the reign of Catherine II, the palace on the Moika was transferred to the treasury, and in 1795 the queen gave it as a gift to her maid of honor - Alexandra Branitskaya.  After 35 years, the estate was bought by nephew Branitskaya - Prince Boris Nikolayevich Yusupov.  Since the material means of the Yusupov family were limitless, the palace soon became a prototype of fabulous luxury and exquisite beauty. </p><p>  With a huge scope, the Yusupovs began to transform the palace.  The architect Andrei Mikhailov did not change the central facade, but made lateral rhizolites more per floor, erected a three-story building in the east of the estate, combined the outbuildings, where the art gallery and the home theater are located.  A garden was built, <span>garden pavilions</span> and greenhouses were built.  A grand staircase appeared on the river side, leading to the grand chambers.  The interiors were designed by the best decorators of that time. </p><p>  After the death of the first owner, the palace was reconstructed again. </p><p>  The palace underwent another redevelopment by the end of the 19th century.  It was equipped with the necessary achievements of those times - sewage, water supply, steam heating, electric lighting.  The last modifications were made in 1914: the chambers on the 1st floor were updated before the wedding of Prince Felix with the Grand Duchess Irina Alexandrovna. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  After the revolutionary period, an exhibition dedicated to the murder of Rasputin and the Museum of the noble way of life were placed in the Yusupov Palace for a short time.  Then the building was handed over to Leningrad educators.  Thanks to this, the Yusupov Palace on the Moika was able to avoid ruin.  There was a hospital in the palace during the blockade.  In 1960, the Yusupov Palace on the Moika became a recognized historical and cultural monument of federal significance. </p><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  The restored halls of the palace are open for sightseeing programs, and here you can also rent a room for corporate events, balls, weddings and other events.  The theater hosts performances and concerts. </p><p>  Educational activities are also theatrical: actors show scenes from <span>social life.</span>  The most popular is the exposition ‚ÄúThe Killing of Rasputin‚Äù, made in a cramped basement, where everything happened.  Some visitors and guests create the effect of a real presence: wax figures of event participants and photographs enhance the action. </p><h2>  Yusupov Palace: how to get there? </h2><p>  The building is located in the city center.  Yusupov Palace (address) is located on Moika Embankment in Building 94. You can get to this historical monument both on foot, reaching the nearest metro stations, and using land transport. </p>
