    <p>  <strong>Tuapse</strong> </p><p>  This is the most important Black Sea port of Russia and the resort at the same time.  The tourist season here lasts a long time: from the middle of May, the water in the sea warms up to +18 ¬∫, and begins to cool only in mid-October.  Like many southern cities, in the holiday season, Tuapse is filled with vacationers and begins to live a fun and idle life.  There are three beaches in the city: Central (the most visited and well-maintained), Primorsky and Vesna (located on the outskirts of the city). </p><p>  In fact, this city is not officially considered a resort, although many tourists go here on vacation.  Tuapse district is characterized by lower prices for housing, food and entertainment than its neighbors - Sochi and Gelendzhik. </p><p>  <strong>Nebug</strong> </p><p>  Just 16 kilometers from Tuapse is the village of Nebug.  Although the resort is small in size, you won‚Äôt be bored.  Almost all existing types of entertainment were concentrated on this small territory: a water park, an ice palace, a dolphinarium and many others.  Many high-class hotel and health complexes have also been built in Nebug. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Olginka</strong> </p><p>  There is another place that offers both a relaxing and active holiday.  Tuapse district, Olginka is a choice not only of couples, but also of youth.  A couple of years ago, in this modern village, a new embankment was built, where discos, bars and cozy cafes work near the sea.  Many travelers prefer Olginka because of its crystal clear sea and flat terrain. </p><p>  <strong>Novomikhailovsky</strong> </p><p>  Novomikhailovsky, or Novomikhailovka, as many call it, is a large village, which is located 40 km from Tuapse.  The resort is fully consistent with such a concept as a good rest.  Tuapse district, and in particular Novomikhailovsky village, will satisfy the needs of all tourists, regardless of age and status.  For children, the All-Russian Center "Eaglet" was built here, and for adults - many entertainment venues. </p><p>  <strong>Lermontovo</strong> </p><p>  This fast-growing resort promises everyone a lot of pleasant experiences.  Here you can freely ride on all kinds of slides in the water park, take an unhurried horse ride or an extreme ride on an ATV or jeep.  The peculiarity of Lermontovo is that in the coastal region and in the vicinity of the village there is an abundance of automobile campsites, where you can spend an unforgettable and at the same time the most economical vacation.  Tuapse district, Lermontovo is a resort that specializes specifically in tourism, so there are few local people. </p><p>  <strong>Dederkoy</strong> </p><p>  It is located Dederka 7 km south of Tuapse.  This village with many <span>wild beaches,</span> as a rule, is chosen by lovers of a quiet and secluded vacation.  If crowds and dusty cities annoy you, then you are here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Dzhubga</strong> </p><p>  The nearest settlement on the seashore from the side of Krasnodar is Dzhubga.  Autotourists resting from neighboring areas and just lovers of scenic views - they all come to this charming place to spend their summer holidays.  Tuapse district in the north begins with the village of Dzhubga.  The resort infrastructure is developing rapidly every year. </p><p>  <strong>Shepsi</strong> </p><p>  Shepsi is the southernmost <span>resort of the Tuapse</span> district.  In this part of the region you can observe a unique picture: the mountains are getting higher, the Mediterranean climate is changing to subtropical, and deciduous forests are replaced by evergreen vegetation.  Due to the extraordinary beauty and clear sea, Shepsi is considered the best children's and family resort. </p><p>  <strong>Agoy</strong> </p><p>  The calm and comfortable village of Agoy is separated from Tuapse by a high Agoy pass.  This is truly the most picturesque place on the <span>Black Sea coast.</span>  Subtropical vegetation, waterfalls and high mountain peaks - all this just as a magnet attracts thousands of tourists to the resort from year to year. </p>
