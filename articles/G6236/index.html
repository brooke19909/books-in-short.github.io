    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Ski resort "Ak Bulak" is practically empty.  Prices are high, but, according to vacationers, it‚Äôs worth going for a couple of days to relax, admire the beauty of the snow-capped <span>Almaty mountains</span> and ride on their slopes. </p><p>  The ski resort is beautiful in its winter season, skiers share their impressions.  There is everything for skiing: equipment rental, lifts work.  We are satisfied with the large parking, as they come mainly by personal cars.  Food is not praised or scolded.  Food, it is food.  To each his own.  And if you want something in store, it‚Äôs a 10-minute walk. </p><p>  Professionals in alpine skiing are very happy with the ‚Äúblack‚Äú track. ‚ÄùEverything else they do not really care about. </p>
