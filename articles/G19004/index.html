    <h2>  What are chests? </h2><p>  Old-timers say that what Khakassia is truly rich in is a place of power.  Chests are distinguished by the most powerful energy, which can heal and even destroy a person.  It is not surprising that in ancient times special people - priests - had access here.  They were chosen from the shamans and trusted them with the most sacred knowledge.  Moreover, it is known that not every chosen one could cross the valley.  Her spirits might not have let the daredevil drop him into the abyss of madness for the rest of her life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the point of view of science, Chests in Khakassia (we will tell you in detail in one of the sections of the article about how to get to this place) is a mountain range that stretches for four and a half kilometers.  It is located in the valley of the White Iyus River, which at one time was densely populated by ancient peoples. </p><p>  This natural monument stretched across the Shirinsky and Ordzhonikidzevsky districts.  The mountain range is not a continuous chain, but five separate rocks.  Some of them reach a height of two hundred meters.  Each chest is unique in its own way and is constantly studied by representatives of various scientific institutes.  Vitaliy Larichev devoted the most time to this amazing mountain complex.  He has been studying the Chests for about thirty years and eventually came to the conclusion that this education is man-made.  He expressed several versions about the purpose of these structures, which we will tell you about a little later. </p>

    <h2>  Museum-reserve "Chests" </h2><p>  Currently, the mountain range in Khakassia is recognized as a unique cultural monument and is protected by the state.  This place is constantly monitored by representatives of environmental organizations, which carefully monitor the integrity of the mountains themselves and their surroundings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Geologists confidently argue that there is nothing unusual in the shape of a mountain range.  Indeed, for many thousands of years nature could well have created such a beauty, to which there are numerous examples.  However, various groups of scientists find confirmation on the ridge that it was used as a temple complex and observatory.  Indeed, for many centuries, chests have been considered a sacred place among shamans, and legends about these places are passed from mouth to mouth. </p><p>  Larichev himself believes that it was here that the ancestral home of humanity was.  It is mentioned in the most ancient texts of different peoples of the world.  It is described as the mountain on which the great gods lived, who gave birth to the demigods, and then people.  Researchers from different countries try to find this place to no avail.  In his scientific works, Academician Larichev cites many facts testifying in favor of his version.  Be that as it may, the main secret of the Chests has yet to be revealed. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Ordzhonikidze district, where the famous mountain range is located, was once part of the territories of Tagar civilization.  Legends circulated about its power and strength, and the priests of this people had ancient knowledge about the origin and structure of the Universe.  From the first millennium BC to the third century BC, Tagarians occupied the territory of modern Khakassia and even the south of Siberia. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that this people is mentioned in the ancient annals of the Chinese.  There they were called dinlins or Siberian Scythians.  Some scientists believe that they were not the builders of the Chests, but only skillfully used the structures of a more developed and ancient people.  It is impossible to prove or refute this fact, therefore, at the moment, the question of the origin of the mountain range still remains open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  First Chest </h2><p>  Excursions in Khakassia to the Chests are very popular, so almost at any time of the year there are a huge number of people.  If you plan to visit this monument on your own, then know that each rock is numbered and has its own history.  The most noteworthy of all, many tourists consider the First Chest. </p><p>  It can be seen even at the entrance to the ridge and this sight for a long time pops up in the memory of brave adventurers.  At the very top of the chips is a stone cube seventy meters high.  It seems perfectly flat and resembles a roomy chest. </p><p>  In fact, archaeologists claim that this stone is the remnant of a multi-kilometer fortress wall.  In ancient times, it separated the territory of temple complexes from human settlements.  Only the initiates could cross this border for rites and observations of the heavenly bodies. </p><p>  The legend of the hero of Hoho Babai is associated with the First Chest.  According to legend, he became famous for his great deeds and eventually became very rich.  He had countless silver, which was considered a sign of wealth among his people.  But once he decided to transform it into gold, and after that he couldn‚Äôt look at his treasure.  From the constant brilliance of gold, the hero blinded and prayed to the spirits for the return of vision.  They agreed to help Hoho Babai, but demanded to bring their treasure as a gift.  However, having received the ability to see back, he regretted his promise and set out to take the huge chest with gold back.  Spirits were angry with the hero and turned him into a bird of prey.  To this day, he circles over his treasure, but still cannot touch it. </p><p>  Not far from the top is the Shaman's Chair.  This place has incredible acoustics.  If you sit on a stone throne and utter a few words in a whisper, they will become distinguishable for many kilometers around.  Particularly good audibility is at a special stone-enclosed area at the foot of the mountain. </p><p>  The version that the mountain was used as an observatory is confirmed by numerous excavations, star drawings and <span>shaman stone,</span> which was found in Soviet times during the plowing of lands.  Workers accidentally stumbled upon an ancient grave with a huge stone.  Scientists were struck by the fact that it depicted stars from the other hemisphere.  And the most surprising thing is that it is impossible to make out with their naked eyes - they are visible only through a telescope. </p>

    <h2>  Second and Third Chests </h2><p>  These mountains are notable for numerous stone pyramids.  They almost completely cover the mountain plateau, and very little is known about their real purpose.  Scientists draw a parallel between these structures and the Baikal Obo, which are designed to become houses for spirits.  Such pyramids are erected only in special places of power and with the permission of shamans.  It is strictly forbidden to touch stones and rearrange them personally, because according to ancient beliefs each object has its own soul and is connected with other thin invisible threads of fate.  Violation of the established order will entail terrible consequences. </p>

    <h2>  Fourth Chest </h2><p>  This mountain is covered with numerous drawings, many of which have existed for more than two thousand years.  These drawings - petroglyphs - are not just printed on stone.  Each of them carries a meaning, although sometimes it is inaccessible to the understanding of modern man. </p><p>  For example, the image of the Skier is noteworthy.  It is a three-dimensional picture that tells about the adventures of the protagonist in three worlds.  It is interesting that the drawings are very well preserved and it is easy to see them even from a certain distance. </p><p>  The most unique image of the Chests is the White Horse petroglyph.  Scientists have proven that it appeared at least sixteen thousand years ago.  The author created his creation in a special manner.  He knocked out the picture at the place of the natural exit to the surface of the salts, so to this day it has come unchanged.  However, this is not at all the main secret of the White Horse.  According to the artist‚Äôs plan, she runs to the north and is associated with the constellation Leo.  Namely, in it sixteen thousand years ago was the point of the winter solstice.  Surprisingly, ancient astronomers were well aware of this. </p>

    <h2>  Fifth Chest </h2><p>  At the foot of this rock is a group of burials, and the Chest itself seems to be a huge observatory for scientists.  They speculate that there was once a temple of Time.  On one of its walls is an image of a dragon, which appears to be a large sundial.  Until now, all their secrets have not been revealed. </p><p>  In addition, it was on this Chest that historians found the most unusual petroglyphs.  For example, it is not known how ancient astronomers could accurately depict people in spacesuits, if in those days people could not even think about space travel. </p><h2>  Features and anomalies of the mountain range </h2><p>  Chests (Shirinsky district / Republic of Khakassia) are famous for the fact that with each new discovery, researchers are puzzled by new mysteries.  For example, in the reserve there is a rock Dragon.  On its top, a horn is clearly visible, set at an angle of twenty-four degrees and four minutes.  In the days of the spring and autumn solstices, a ray passes exactly through this stone and pierces the so-called <span>Dragon's eye.</span>  It is amazing how accurately the ancient astronomers were able to calculate everything. </p><p>  Scientists also discovered stone gnamon on the Chests.  Surprisingly, at astronomical noon, it does not cast shadows.  Thanks to this, it is possible to determine the angular height of our daylight. </p><p>  The rocks are dotted with numerous gutters and openings clearly handmade.  Scientists have found that most of them served as assistants in observing the stars.  However, today the map of the starry sky has changed and this is no longer possible. </p><p>  Known in the chests and places with poor energy.  Historians claim that sacrifices were once held here and stones absorbed the energy of fear and death.  Strange, but if you hang an object from gold over such a place, it will begin to spin rapidly.  And it stops only when a mirror is brought to it.  Other than mysticism, this phenomenon cannot be called! </p><h2>  How to get to Chests (Khakassia)? </h2><p>  Most independent travelers are afraid to get lost at the entrance to the mountain range.  Their fears have certain reasons, because it is known that not everyone passes through a valley located at the foot of the Chests (Khakassia).  How to get to this place?  Tourists say that everything is extremely simple. </p><p>  On your own car you can drive here from the side of two villages.  The easiest way to get from the village of Iyus, it is closest to the mountain range.  You can also go on a trip from the village of Shira and follow the signs.  Until Iusa, the road is paved, and then you have to move along the dirt road.  In dry weather, this is not difficult, but in the rain the car may well get stuck in the mud. </p><p>  You need to follow the road signs, there are quite a lot of them, so do not be afraid to get lost. </p>

It is located near the Chests and is a famous historical monument. </li><li>  Mount Chalpan.  People come here very often by car; the attraction of Khakassia is located on a small strip of land that divides the lake into two parts.  Moreover, one of them is salty, and the second is fresh. </li></ul><p>  Of course, you can continue this list yourself.  After all, we have indicated far from all the treasures of these places.  However, as tourists say, it is simply impossible to get to know Khakassia in one trip. </p><h2>  A few words instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Some people spend their holidays in overseas resorts, while others prefer to explore the unusual places of our country.  And it is worth saying that every year there are more and more such enthusiastic tourists.  Perhaps one of them will someday be able to uncover the ancient secret of the Chests. </p>
