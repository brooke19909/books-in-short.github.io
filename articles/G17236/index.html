This is a small village, but its location, turbulent history and numerous attractions make it a famous tourist center.  In 1992, the historical center and the castle lying on the opposite bank were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as a single Baroque ensemble.  Why is this town with a population of only thirteen thousand people so interesting?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Road to the city </h2><p>  ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov and <span>the Hlubok√° Castle</span> above the Vltava lie on the same line from Prague to the south, to the Austrian border.  Therefore, both castles can be viewed in one go.  Having reached the city of Ceske Budejovice, you need to turn onto the E49 highway to find this snow-white castle, the former Frauenberg, among the <span>fish farms</span> .  Both of them are peers.  They were built in the middle of the 13th century.  And both were rebuilt several times until they turned from <span>defensive structures</span> into beautiful palaces with gardens. </p><p>  You need to visit deep down over the Vltava and then to feel the difference in the Austrian and truly Bohemian style of building castles.  But if this palace can be examined in an hour or two, then Krumlov is worthy to spend at least a couple of days in it.  Indeed, in addition to the castle, the city has many more interesting places.  Whenever you come to this tourist center, you are sure to get to some festival, concert or exhibition.  The city itself will captivate you with its exquisite romantic atmosphere, and its picturesque nature will leave you with the best memories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle of Czech Krumlov" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/374648.jpg" width="600"></div>

Most of the way this public transport runs along the main highway.  Therefore, its speed is not much inferior to the railway express.  In the case of Cesky Krumlov, it is best to take the bus service.  Firstly, no transfers are necessary.  And secondly, the bus station is located near the city center.  But the train station is located half an hour walk from it.  You will have to use a taxi (it will cost about 5 –Ñ). </p><p>  Direct flights leave the capital's bus stations Florenc (near the metro station of the same name) and On Knizec (near the stop of the Andel subway).  The last point of departure is preferable.  From "On the Book" buses leave in the right direction every two hours.  Unfortunately, there is no direct train "Prague - Czech Krumlov".  Have to change trains in Budejovice.  But this will not be any problem, since the local train is waiting for the train from the capital.  In addition, if you want to explore the Hluboku road above the Vltava, this is a good option for traveling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Krumlov is deep over Vltava" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/377917.jpg?1397924841804" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unique location </h2><p>  Getting into this hilly foothills, the Vltava River begins to loop, paving its way through the rock.  And on two ‚Äúalmost islands‚Äù formed by meanders of the water stream, Czech Crumlov rises.  Aerial photographs very clearly demonstrate how the Vltava snake rings wrap around the city.  This arrangement brings to mind the Ukrainian village of Kamenetz-Podolsky, but there the coast is high, rocky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But in Krumlov such a neighborhood with the river is fraught with floods.  The last of them occurred in June last year, when the streets of the city could only be moved by boat.  And the largest flood in this century happened in 2002.  On the left bank of the river is the Latran district.  Previously, it was a separate settlement (like Buda and Pest in the capital of Hungary), but with the construction of the bridge in 1347, it merged with Krumlov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Krumlov photo" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/374659.jpg?1397924912620" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  Initially, it was a little different.  In 1240, Krumlov Castle was built.  His calling was to guard the trade route from Bohemia to the south.  The seniors of the <span>castle, the feudal</span> family of Vitkovichi from Krumlov, paid tribute to the merchants for the passage through their lands.  Then, from 1253, on the left bank of the Vltava, a posad - Latran was formed.  It became overgrown with houses and the foot of the castle.  Thus the city of Cesky Krumlov was formed. </p><p>  Since 1302, he goes to the related family of Vitkovichi from Rozhmberk.  These gentlemen had money and were very enterprising.  The first heyday of the city is associated with their rule.  They discovered silver mines in the nearby mountains.  Later, through dynastic marriages, the Vitkovici became relatives of the Italian clan Orsini (many popes came out of it).  To honor the noble cousins, the lords of Krumlov began to breed bears.  After all, "Orsini" is translated from Italian and means the brown master of the forest.  It has become a tradition.  Until now, you can see in the aviary in the castle two toed bears.  Unfortunately, little has been preserved from the impregnable stronghold of the Middle Ages.  Unless the cellars and the Cylindrical Tower give us an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe former power of the castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Krumlov Attractions" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/374649.jpg?1397924962758" width="550"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Royal city </h2><p>  Vitkovichi from Rozmberk, who later became known as the Rosenbergs, were not always lucky in financial matters.  The last owner of the castle of this kind, named Willem, who lived at the end of the 16th century, started a global reconstruction of his estate.  He invited architects from Italy, the then fashionable masters of Balthazar Maggi and Antonio Ericera, to give the <span>Gothic castle a</span> renaissance look.  They got down to business and built a summer palace, set up a park. </p><p>  But the grandiose building undermined the solvency of William, and his brother Peter Wok was forced in 1602 to sell the castle to Emperor Rudolph II.  So Czech Krumlov became a royal city.  Rudolph II was not very interested in this place far from Vienna.  He did not really rebuild the city, but settled here his schizophrenic illegitimate son Julius Caesar of Austria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Krumlov and the castle is deep" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/377921.jpg?1397925162837" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Black page in the history of Krumlov </h2><p>  The eldest son of the emperor and Italian aristocrat Katerina Strada inherited from his father a disease of manic madness.  And, alas, the inhabitants of the city became hostages of his fits.  Julius Caesar arrived in Czech Krumlov in 1607.  He liked the daughter of the local barber Market, and he took her to his castle.  But in a fit of aggression, he beat her, cut him with a knife and threw him out of the window.  The girl was lucky to survive, and she began to hide with relatives.  Then the insane bastard of the emperor imprisoned her father and announced that he would execute him if Marketa did not return to him. </p><p>  Residents of the city persuaded the unfortunate girl to sacrifice themselves and come to the maniac.  During the next surge of madness, the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù killed Market and dismembered her body.  After some time, the prince died - as they say, from a fever.  His ashes were buried under a nameless slab in the cemetery of the Franciscan monastery so that angry residents would not desecrate him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Czech Krumlov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/374665.jpg?1397925338830" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Baroque pearl </h2><p>  After the castle was owned by Emperor Ferdinand II, the Austrian family of Eggenbergs, until, finally, he moved to the Schwarzenbergs.  Representatives of this latter kind are firmly based in the city.  They owned the castle until 1945.  Since the city was very destroyed during the Thirty Years War, the Schwarzenbergs started a major overhaul.  Then the baroque fashion dominated.  Therefore, the city and the <span>castle of Czech</span> Krumlov are a single ensemble, made in the same style. </p><p>  Schwarzenberg set up a park with fountains.  They completely rebuilt the castle into a palace.  It is to them that the city owes one of the most unique buildings - the theater.  It was erected in 1766.  The "cunning" mechanisms set in motion the audience hall, which turned around inside the ring stage.  Unfortunately, real performances in this temple of art are given only three times a year, but you can watch the theater itself by buying a ticket for an excursion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech krumlov" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/374649.jpg?1397939152338" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Cesky Krumlov: attractions </h2><p>  Not one castle is famous for this city.  Although the local citadel is the second largest in the Czech Republic, most tourists come here to just stroll through the narrow labyrinths of medieval streets, visit numerous museums, take pictures with the town hall, try a beer in the museum of this foamy drink, and take a canoe for daring the bends of the Vltava.  The nineteenth century only removed the city walls and gates, leaving its baroque appearance untouched.  The bridge, called the Plaschev, has also survived.  This three-story building was built in 1767.  It connects the residential part of the castle, the theater and the garden.  From the churches we recommend you to visit the Minorite Monastery (where, as we remember, the remains of Julius Caesar of Austria lie under an unknown slab), the Gothic St. Vitus Church with frescoes of the 15th century and the Church of God. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  In addition to the torture museum, which is located in the castle, we strongly recommend visiting the installations of the wax room.  There is also an art gallery in the city.  Art Nouveau lovers will like the exposition of the Museum of Modern Art.  The city attracts artists and artists.  It often hosts street performances, concerts, exhibitions.  No less interesting attraction is the building of the town hall itself.  It was erected in 1580. </p><h2>  Tourist infrastructure </h2><p>  As the city is always full of visitors, ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov has no shortage of hotels and hostels.  In summer, camping also works.  Although the historic center and the castle can be bypassed in one day, we still strongly recommend that you stay in Krumlov for a few days.  At least in order to see the castle and the city in the beautiful lights of the backlight. </p><p>  As for nutrition, rest assured: you certainly will not die of hunger, but eat yourself full.  It is not in vain that Hasek made his character the miller-glutton Baloun came from Czech Krumlov.  They like to eat here - hearty, tasty and leisurely.  If you stay in the city for a few days, you can arrange a short trip to South Bohemia.  Then you will see all the places of worship: the castles of Cesky Krumlov, Hluboka nad Vltavou and Loket, the ancient monasteries Zolotaya Korona and Upper Broad. </p>
