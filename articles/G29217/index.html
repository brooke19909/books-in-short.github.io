Sometimes after the first wash comes disappointment in the form of faded paints or sprawling material.  A branded bedding costs a lot of money, and not everyone can afford to buy a high-quality, but expensive set.  There is a solution: you can independently purchase a good fabric and sew sheets, pillowcases and duvet covers at your discretion. </p><p>  How to sew bedding, you will learn from the text of the article.  A detailed description will help to purchase the right amount of fabric and perform proper cutting.  If you have a sewing machine and free time, then you can update the bedding, creating a beautiful and high-quality set that will meet all your needs. </p><h2>  Sizes of bed linen </h2><p>  Sewing a set of bed linen is possible only after proper calculations, so as not to run into the problem of a lack of fabric and extra spending. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nevia.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bedding sizes" class="if uuid-2317389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317389.jpg"></div><p>  The diagram above shows the standard sizes of the kits.  But how to sew bedding on a single bed, we describe in more detail below. </p><ul><li>  The sheet should hang freely from the mattress on both sides.  Therefore, to the width of the mattress of 120 cm add 30 cm on each side.  It turns out 180 cm. The length of a standard mattress is 190 cm. We add 10 cm on each side, it turns out 210 cm. </li><li>  A pillowcase is sewn depending on the size of the pillow and style.  To the standard sizes 70 x 70 add 10 cm to the seams and the fitting of the pillow.  If the pillow is with an odor, then it is necessary to postpone an additional 15-20 cm on the valve. In general, it turns out 80 + 80 + 20 = 180 cm. </li><li>  The duvet cover is calculated as follows: the dimensions of the blanket are taken, the standard ones are 140 x 200. Add 10 cm to the width for free fitting of the blanket and an additional 10 cm to the seams.  The width is double, since the duvet cover has two sides.  From here we get: 140 + 10 + 140 + 10 + 10 = 310 cm. To the length (200 cm) we add 10 cm to the allowances and seams: 200 + 10 + 10 = 220 cm. </li></ul><p>  Putting together all the sizes, you get the length of the required piece of fabric for sewing the whole set.  If you think about how to sew bedding for a double bed or another option, then all sizes are calculated in the same way, based on the standard sizes shown in the photo above. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which fabric is better to choose? </h2><p>  Since bedding touches the human body, it must be natural.  Before you sew bedding with your own hands, you need to think through the fabric.  It may be chintz, but keep in mind that the fabric is thin and after several washes may become unusable.  If you take satin, you will have to lay out more money, but the fabric is durable and will last a long time, will not fade, after washing it will not spread and will not shrink.  Some like calico.  Although the material is harsh, it does not change at all after washing, it will last a long time, and over time the appearance will not change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quiltingtutorials.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we sew linen on our own" class="if uuid-2317340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317340.jpg"></div><p>  Also use flax and percale.  These fabrics are reliable and durable.  The washing is well tolerated, however, clean linen is not sold, other threads are added to the fabric.  Such bedding will please even in the summer heat.  If you are a beginner master, then you are unlikely to be able to sew the linen yourself from silk.  It is quite difficult to work with such a fabric, so it‚Äôs better to start with simple cotton fabrics. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  To work on bedding you need an open space to conveniently spread out the fabric.  When everything is accurately measured and cut off, start with the easiest - tailoring of the sheet.  If the width of the fabric corresponds to the size of the sheet, then the edges can not be hemmed; they are already processed at the factory.  Open sections from the bottom and top must be bent twice so that the edge is securely hidden inward.  It‚Äôs better to manually sweep so that the edge does not come out with a <span>machine line</span> .  This way the bends are processed at two opposite edges of the product. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to sew a sheet with an elastic band? </h2><p>  It is very convenient when the sheet is held on a mattress with an elastic band, then it does not slip at night when the sleeping person is moving in a dream, it better protects the mattress from damage, and it remains clean longer.  In order to sew such a sheet, you need to measure not only the length and width of the mattress, but also its height.  Cutting the fabric looks like the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homedit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="elastic sheet sheet" class="if uuid-2317362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317362.jpg"></div><p>  The central rectangle has the dimensions of a mattress.  Lateral rectangles are bent downwards and stitched together at right angles.  It is necessary to add another 10-15 cm to the depth of the mattress to bend the fabric under the mattress and the design of the elastic band.  After cutting the fabric, the sides are first sewn together, then you need to outline the lower edge by bending the fabric twice.  The width of the bend should be at least 2 cm, so that it was convenient to insert an elastic band.  This sheet is pulled tight on the mattress and always looks neat. </p><h2>  Sewing pillowcases </h2><p>  To sew 2-bedroom bedding with your own hands, you will need two pillowcases.  There are many styles of such products.  This is a standard pillowcase for our country with a smell on the edge, a smell in the middle of the back of the pillowcase, products with Velcro and strings, buttons and a snake, with ears and an envelope, with frills and folds.  After choosing the style that suits you, bedding with your own hands is easy to sew according to the size of the pillow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blackwalnutstitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kinds of different pillowcases" class="if uuid-2317349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317349.jpg"></div><p>  First, the dimensions are transferred to the fabric.  If the pillowcase with the usual smell, then a long rectangle is cut out, in which the double size of the pillow and the smell are combined.  Do not forget to leave extra centimeters on the folds of the fabric and on a loose fit. </p><h2>  The smell in the middle of the pillowcase </h2><p>  If the smelling part is located in the center of the back side, then cutting is done differently.  The pattern will consist of three parts.  The front part corresponds to the size of the pillow plus a few centimeters for the hem of the fabric.  The other two parts are the back, 10 cm is added to each for hem and odor.  If buttons are provided on the pillowcase, then you need to measure the distance between them and on the opposite element, make loops or cut and process holes for them.  Instead of buttons, Velcro or ties can be used, which are sewn on one and the other of the wrapped parts of the pillowcase.  They can be cut from the main fabric or use satin ribbons. </p><h2>  Pillowcase on the snake </h2><p>  How to sew bedding, namely a pillowcase with a zipper, read on.  A long rectangle is being cut out, consisting of two sizes of the length of the pillow, plus an additional few centimeters for the hem of the fabric in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe snake.  First, the edges are processed - they are bent inward, and lightning is sewn on one and the other side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blackwalnutstitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pillowcase on a snake" class="if uuid-2317352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317352.jpg"></div><p>  Then the sides of the pillowcase are sewn together, and the product is turned on the front side.  The snake is used plastic, internal, so that the teeth of lightning are not visible. </p><h2>  Sewing a standard duvet cover </h2><p>  Previously, in our country, duvet covers were made with a diamond-shaped or rounded hole in the middle of the front side.  Now this option of sewing has gone down in history, it has been replaced by a duvet cover, consisting of two identical canvases, which are sewn together on one side and fastened with buttons on the other. </p><p>  To sew bedding with your own hands, see the image above for the size of a 1.5 or 2-bedroom duvet cover.  In addition, it is necessary to add 10 cm to the edges for the hem of the fabric and the loose fit of the blanket.  At the feet of the sleeping duvet cover, buttons are fastened.  10 cm is also left for the strap. They are smelled when fastened. </p><h2>  Little tip </h2><p>  Often, sleeping people are faced with the problem of slipping the blankets, which stray at one end of the duvet cover.  You have to suffer to carefully lay out the blanket in its original position.  To avoid this, the following element was invented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="redesignedbym.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the secret of keeping the blankets in place" class="if uuid-2317381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317381.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see in the photo above, there is a thin strip of fabric on the inside of each corner.  When putting a duvet cover on this tie, the corner of the blanket is attached, which does not allow it to move to the side, but firmly fixes it in one place.  This small additional element will once again please the owner of bed linen while making the bed. </p><h2>  Types of bedding </h2><p>  You already understood how to sew a bedding set, but there are a lot of types of sets.  You can decorate pillowcases and duvet covers.  We list some of the options.  Firstly, bed linen sewn from fabrics of different colors looks beautiful.  For example, the upper front part can be with a pattern, and the lower side is solid, but matched in a harmonious combination. </p><p>  Secondly, you can add decorative details on the front sides of pillowcases and duvet covers, for example: folds, shuttlecocks, lace elements.  Often sew a duvet cover according to the pattern of small pieces of different fabrics.  It turns out an ornament of different geometric shapes. </p><p>  A duvet cover, like pillowcases, can be with ears.  Another name for this style is Oxford style.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that the edges of the pillowcase and duvet cover have 5 cm of stitched fabric.  With this arrangement, the duvet covers odors with a shift of 10-15 cm in the inner part of the back side.  A three-piece part is hidden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fendhome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful decoration of bed linen" class="if uuid-2317400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2317400.jpg"></div><p>  There is a more complex decoration of bedding, namely its front side.  The sheet usually remains untouched, and the design takes place on a duvet cover and pillowcases.  The fabric can be folded in folds forming squares or rhombuses, picked up in stripes or sewed ruffles all over in the form of stripes or another pattern.  When sewing pillowcases, you can also experiment with color combinations as well as with additional details.  For example, pillowcases with shuttlecocks at the edges or having ears of a fabric of a different color look beautiful.  You can add a bright contrast piping to all the seams. </p><p>  The article describes in detail how to sew bedding with your own hands, how to accurately calculate the fabric for sewing, how to make a fabric pattern so that the blanket or pillow fits freely inside.  After reading this material, any novice master who has a sewing machine, even without an overlock, will cope with the task.  So make up your mind, save money and sew reliable and high-quality bedding for your family. </p>
