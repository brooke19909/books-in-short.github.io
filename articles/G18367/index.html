Attractions, entertainment, excursions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The heart of the whole of Tatarstan is the colorful city of Kazan, in which not only the architecture of different centuries is snugly located, but also Muslims and Orthodox Christians coexist.  The origin of the name of the city is shrouded in many of the most mystical stories, one of which tells of the Bulgars' search for a place suitable for life.  The greatest sorcerer advised them to find the territory on which the boiler could boil without fire, and luck was waiting for the travelers there.  Kazan was warmed up only in the lands of Lake Kaban, which is now located in the very center of the glorious city. </p><p>  When planning a vacation in Kazan, tourists should work out the entire travel route well so as not to miss the most interesting places in the city, as well as to imbue the spirit of grandeur of the multifaceted third capital of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Bauman Street </h2><p>  The first step is to decide where to take a walk in Kazan.  Hiking not only fills the body with vital oxygen, but also allows you to fully admire the architecture, landscapes, people and sky.  In the city, the oldest Bauman street has faithfully stretched.  It existed during the time of the <span>Kazan Khanate.</span>  At that time they called it the Nogai and, if possible, built up it.  Therefore, at the present time, walking along the famous street, one can consider both modern stylish buildings and solid houses of the last century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monument to Chaliapin </h2><p>  Where to go for a walk in Kazan?  Thinking about further places, it is mandatory to appear at the monument to the great Fedor Chaliapin, which is installed all on the same Bauman street, in the territory of the chic hotel "Chaliapin Palace".  The bronze figure reveals to the audience the whole gamut of the singer's feelings at the moment of farewell to Russia.  It was installed in August 1998 and until now has been gathering fans and tourists around the marvelous city. </p><h2>  Catherine‚Äôs carriage and monument to the compass </h2><p>  Further down the street you can come across the cast-iron carriage of Catherine II herself, which is installed in memory of the empress's arrival in the distant 1767.  The design of the monument is so realistic and well thought out that for many years it has been stunningly popular with local children and visitors.  After the journey of the wayward empress through the eastern regions of her lands, the city received a sufficient flow of funding, which allowed it to actively build gymnasiums, museums, churches and rich mosques. </p>

    <p>  Wandering along the street, you can stumble upon an unusual monument to the compass, which indicates zero kilometer of Kazan.  The design of the pyramid is made in a colorful Arabic style, which gives the place a hill.  It also shows the exact distance to the world legend of New York, Tokyo, the capital of Russia and the distant North Pole. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kazan Kremlin </h2><p>  Spending your holidays in Kazan in the summer, you can head to the most revered area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, where the magnificent <span>Kazan Kremlin is located, whose</span> date of birth is considered to be the 10th century, although all the motives of the construction indicate more ancient erection times.  Initially, a powerful fortress performed the defensive function of a great city.  At the moment, it is the residence of the mighty republic of Tatarstan.  In sunny weather, the most beautiful buildings are cast with unsurpassed light and grandeur, which is pleasant not only for the tourists of the city, but also for the locals to be amazed, opening up new facets in the already familiar Kremlin. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Kazan in September" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/968211.jpg" width="418"></div></h2><h2>  Tower Syuyumbike </h2><p>  In the ensemble of buildings, you can also get acquainted with the accent <span>tower</span> S√ºyumbike <span>,</span> which looks statistically compared to other buildings due to the height of 60 meters and the eye-catching design. </p><p>  The most unusual legends go about the reasons for the erection of this monument, one of which speaks of the craving of Tsar Ivan the Terrible to marry the beautiful ruler Syuyumbike, but the wayward girl jumped from the last floor of the tower, not wanting such a fate for herself. </p>

    <h2>  Palace for Farmers </h2><p>  In order for the rest in Kazan to be complete, visitors to the city should definitely visit the Palace for Farmers.  The large-scale building in the Baroque and ambiguous Renaissance style is located on Palace Square, in the heart of the Tatar city.  It was built in 2010, but disputes and scandals have not subsided to this day.  The headquarters of the numerous Ministry <span>of Agriculture of the Republic</span> received the monster nickname because of its oversized dimensions: luxurious domes, symmetry of the entire structure, bronze tree with green backlight in the central portal.  Architects, journalists, and ordinary people speak about the style and significance of a building the size of a rather big residential quarter, but its integrity and harmony put the palace on a par with its centuries-old neighbor, the Kazan Kremlin. </p>

It perfectly complements the Kremlin ensemble in the western part.  The most famous mosque was destroyed almost to the foundation by the forces of Ivan the Terrible during the assault on Kazan, the winners of the republican design competition took part in the restoration work.  The finest handmade domes, the Roman exquisite mosaic, the unique stained glass windows - all this attracts tourists and parishioners during the day, and at night the illumination of the entire complex, ideally incorporated into the project, attracts the eyes of all passing people. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to walk in Kazan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/968222.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Boar Lake </h2><p>  Those who wish to plunge into water recreation can also safely go to Kazan.

But the very name of the amazing reservoir is most often associated with the legendary Prince Kaban, whose wounds healed the local waters.  But the main secret of the lake is the disappearance of the Khan's treasure.  The legend tells of hidden gold at the bottom, which daredevils and scientists still cannot find. </p><h2>  "Riviera" </h2><p>  On the picturesque shore of a magnificent lake there is a water park in Kazan under the sensual name "Riviera".

For visitors, the Riviera has prepared about 50 modern technically designed rides, downhill, wave pool, as well as diving workshops. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in kazan" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/968244.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Also, the water park in Kazan offers those who wish to plunge into the exotic of the beautiful Amazon River, whose firmament is covered by either a mysterious starry sky or a beautiful morning light.  Those who want to pamper their body with spa treatments can safely go to the local salon, where the country's leading experts are working hard. </p><h2>  Museum of Tatarstan </h2><p>  When planning a vacation in Kazan in the company of a family, it is worth visiting the National Museum of Tatarstan, which tirelessly protects the archaeological, scientific and research works of the whole republic.  The beautiful building is located on Kremlyovskaya Street, on the site of the former Gostiny Dvor.  At the moment, the fund has 800 thousand valuable products, as well as several scientific and methodological tips.
