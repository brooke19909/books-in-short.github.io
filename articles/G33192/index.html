    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are many beaches in Phuket and each of them has its own differences.  The best of them are located on the west coast of the island.  The ideal option is to travel the entire coast and choose the best place for yourself. </p><p>  Tourism on the island began to develop not so long ago, only fifty years ago.  Over the years, the tropical island is very popular with tourists around the world.  Phuket is not only accessible by plane.  The island is connected to the mainland by two parallel bridges, one of which has long been pedestrian and rather serves as a symbol of the resort. </p><h2>  The main attractions ... </h2><p>  Phuket is a great place for diving.  Along the coast of the island, dozens of diving centers, schools, equipment rental facilities have been built.  In such institutions, trips for professionals are organized and beginners are trained. </p><p>  In the south of the island is a statue of the Big Buddha, whose height is 45 meters.  At its base, they plan to build a temple.  You can get to it from the hotel by taxi or any other rented transport (the cost of a taxi is just over 500 baht).  The road to the statue passes through huge hevea plantations (latex is produced from the juice of the plant).  Big Buddha is located on a mountain whose height is more than 350 meters.  The famous attraction is also an observation deck.  It offers stunning views of the entire island. </p><p>  For those vacationers who are not supporters of diving, but want to see the inhabitants of the sea element, an aquarium works.  Of course, it cannot be called the largest aquarium, but a sufficient number of underwater inhabitants live in it.  The oceanarium is divided into thematic sections, and its main pride is a multi-meter tunnel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel malin patong" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1570063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the favorite tourist destinations is <span>the Sirinat National Park,</span> which occupies about eight thousand hectares.  On its territory there are three landscaped beaches, pristine rainforests and the sea. </p><p>  The park has a water park "Splash of the jungle."  The complex offers extreme slides, attractions, pools.  For holidaymakers organize excursions to the mangroves.  Hiking trails laid in the most beautiful places. </p><p>  As a rule, women do not miss the opportunity to visit one of the local pearl farms, which grow beautiful jewelry in artificial conditions.  One such place is Nakha Farm.  You can get to it by boat, which in itself is an unusual adventure.  And local guides talk in detail about the process of forming pearls.  On the farm with your own eyes you can see all the stages of pearl making.  At the end of the tour, tourists are offered to purchase their favorite jewelry. </p><p>  One of the most impressive places of the whole island is the <span>Phuket Botanical Garden.</span>  It was opened only in 2012.  Currently, its area is about 10 thousand square meters.  Its entire territory is decorated in the national Thai style, and is also decorated with all kinds of exhibits, decor elements, fountains and carvings created by skilled craftsmen.  Guests can see unique palm trees, hundreds of plant varieties, dozens of different cacti, as well as stroll through fragrant gardens with beautiful lotuses on ponds and lilies. </p><h2>  Malin Patong: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of those vacationers who managed to visit it.  This complex, according to guests, can be recommended as an excellent budget hotel.  Malin Patong Hotel has a very favorable location.  Distance to the sea no more than 500 meters.  Bangla Street, the main nightlife, is a twenty-minute walk from the hotel.  It has a large number of shops, <span>cafes, bars, restaurants,</span> and in the evenings the street is even closed for vehicles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel malin patong hotel" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1570074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the complex is located Patong Beach.  Resort hotels are very diverse in terms of pricing, but finding a decent hotel with good rooms and low prices is not so simple.  The hotel offers its guests good rooms with everything you need.  Since the complex is away from the hectic nightlife, it is not as noisy as in other hotels.  But still, sometimes extraneous sounds interfere with the guests.  Not all tourists are satisfied that some apartments overlook the courtyard, or rather, their windows look at the facade of another hotel.  But overall the rooms are nice and spacious, with normal furniture.  There are no ants or insects in the apartment. </p><p>  According to tourists, breakfast at the hotel is very scarce, and therefore it is not necessary to purchase tours in which they are included.  Opposite the hotel is the Mali market, where you can buy food, things, and cheap meals very cheaply.  All vacationers do this - they don’t go to cafes and restaurants, but go to the market, where there is a wide range of delicious dishes.  There are no nutritional problems.  You can also purchase lobsters and other freshest seafood on the market. </p><p>  The hotel is very attentive and nice staff.  Of course, no one speaks Russian, but English can be explained.  Settlement is always fast.  If tourists do not like the room, then the administration makes concessions and willingly changes the apartment.  The rooms are cleaned daily and with high quality.  Linen and towels also change regularly, sometimes even maids make beautiful figures on the beds.  In general, the apartments are kept clean and tidy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malin patong hotel ex mussee patong hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1570076.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a local guide offering interesting trips.  Near the complex there is also a travel agency, in which a Russian girl works, she will advise you that it is worth visiting for beginners. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Malin Patong Hotel is a good three star hotel that can be recommended to tourists.  It is suitable for those who are planning a beach-sea vacation or an entertainment tour.  The complex is conveniently located relative to the coast, but at the same time not far from the cultural center.  Therefore, it is good not only for family vacations, but also for friendly companies. </p>
