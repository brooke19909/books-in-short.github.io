  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inca Pyramids: history, location, creators</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The discovery of the New World gave the world not only corn, sunflower, tobacco, but also introduced unknown civilizations.  Conquistadors met in person with representatives of some of them, and only megalithic monuments remained from some.  Such evidence of a once prosperous civilization is the Inca pyramids. </p><h2>  Discovery story </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travel.aarp.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inca Pyramids" class="if uuid-2537222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2537222.jpg"></div><p>  The most famous and one of the most mysterious Inca pyramidal complexes is Machu Picchu.  It is open to Europeans thanks to the treasure hunters in Cuzco.  According to the legend of the Quechua peoples, once the Inca rulers, wanting to protect their wealth and the mummies of their ancestors from the conquistadors, they hid them in the secret city of Valkabambu.  Hiram Bingham (an American archaeologist, son of missionaries) was looking for him. </p><p>  Finding the last place for the rulers of the Inca civilization in the mountains of Peru was not easy.  In addition, the local population did not want to help, trying to protect the secrets of their people from aliens.  I managed to find Machu Picchu thanks to children's naivety.  The archaeologist met in the mountains a boy with an earthenware vessel, which was clearly out of date at that time.  Bingham simply asked where the boy had taken him, and he pointed the direction with his finger.  That was enough to find a city.  Although he did not live up to the scientist's hopes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the end of the 20th century, the Inca pyramid, together with their city, has come under the protection of UNESCO, and is also on the list of wonders of the world. </p><h2>  Peru </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stravaganzastravaganza.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inca civilization" class="if uuid-2537223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2537223.jpg"></div><p>  The focus of the Incan civilization was located in the western part of South America, in the territory that now covers Ecuador, Peru, Chile, partly Argentina and Colombia.  As you know, many of the achievements of the Inca civilization came to them from the previous civilizations and tribes that they had captured.  It is possible that the pyramids were built by captured tribes, but more on that later.  For example, under the Andes, the valley of the pyramids stretched from the civilization Lambayeke, which was captured by Cima.  Later, they too fell under the influence of the Incas.  Excavations are being carried out here, and scientists have already discovered many untouched buildings.  At the same time, some official sources claim that these are natural rock formations, which is easily refuted by many archaeological finds. </p><p>  In addition to the Inca pyramid lost among the mountain forests in Peru, Machu Picchu, no less interesting is the complex of ancient buildings at the former citadel of the dominant tribe in Pisak.  It is both a city and a sacred place of Inca culture.  It is gratifying that it is located relatively close to Cuzco, the pre-Conquest Inca capital, where every guest of the country must visit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From Cuzco lies the route to the Temple of the Moon, which is located near the city of Trujillo.  It belongs to Mochican culture.  Ceremonies, religious rites and sacrifices were held here.  The latter fact is confirmed by the finds of the remains of the sacrificed soldiers.  The walls of the temple of the moon are covered with fairly well-preserved frescoes made of mineral paints. </p><h2>  Who are the builders? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ravenseniors.wikispaces.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Incas in the mountains" class="if uuid-2537225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2537225.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the Inca pyramids is no less mysterious than the appearance of structures in Giza.  Staying in Peru, everyone will pay attention to the special form of masonry walls of buildings of ancient cities.  It must be clarified that the pyramids were not originally built by the Incas.  Authorship belongs to the peoples preceding them.  They were then destroyed or swallowed up by new civilizations. </p><p>  The remains of the buildings of the Chimu civilization are almost destroyed city walls, houses, but, besides this, you can admire several pyramids here.  The Inca tribes did not have to build them, they just appeared at the ready.  The same applies to two temples: the sun and the moon.  These architectural creations belong primarily to the Mochik civilization, so you can add them to the list of Inca pyramids with a very big stretch.  The Incas took the fruits of their labor to their hands and later only maintained the buildings in good condition. </p><h2>  Aztecs are not Incas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.in-peru.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buildings in Machu Picchu" class="if uuid-2537229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2537229.jpg"></div><p>  Inca designs are included in the list of pyramids of the world.  The list also includes religious buildings located in Mexico, built by the Aztecs.  At the same time, there are many differences in the methods of construction and engineering solutions between Peruvian and Mexican creations.  Some uninitiated mistakenly believe that the Incan pyramids are in Mexico. </p><h2>  Russian alternative study of Machu Picchu pyramids </h2><p>  Machu Picchu still remains a big mystery to official science, therefore, scientists appeared in its ranks who put forward bold theories about who built it, and no less important - when and what technologies were used.  There are no definite answers to these questions.  In Peru, at the state level, there is propaganda that all these cultural monuments are the work of their ancestors.  But Russian historians, together with engineers who visited Machu Picchu, carefully filming the area, came to the conclusion that the Incas could not do this with their technologies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yenbaet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inca Pyramids in Peru" class="if uuid-2537230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2537230.jpg"></div><p>  Between the blocks of the pyramid does not pass a sheet of paper, as they are smoothed.  In addition, the wall blocks have different shapes and sizes.  So far, this technology has been called "plasticine."  The engineers had the impression that the whole stone was cut with a laser beam.  Because the bronze instruments, the manufacture of which the Incas undoubtedly owned, it is impossible to trim basalt.  These pyramids do not belong to the Incas. </p><p>  On the walls of Machu Picchu, traces of the consequences of the global flood were discovered, and this is certainly before the advent of the Inca civilization.  It is striking that Machu Picchu is located deep beneath the building.  Today, the underground complex protects everything from earthquakes and flooding by mountain descendants. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  Machu Picchu - from <span>the Quechua language it</span> sounds like ‚ÄúOld Mountain‚Äù. </li><li>  The city stands at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level. </li><li>  The main material of the walls of Machu Picchu is basalt (volcanic rock). </li></ul>
