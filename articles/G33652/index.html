    <p>  Satellite alarm is a modern device based on two built-in <span>modules: GPS</span> and GSM.  The first is needed in order to determine the location of the car relative to the world coordinate system, since this is a global network consisting of 24 satellites in orbit.  The module is supplemented by special receivers, through which communication with satellites is established.  A good GPS / GSM car alarm recognizes a large number of satellites. </p><h2>  Main components </h2><p>  Satellite alarm consists of basic and additional equipment.  Of the basic components, each security system is equipped with: </p><ul><li>  processor unit; </li><li>  interface support; </li><li>  an antenna; </li><li>  sensors; </li><li>  GPS module. </li></ul><p>  Each alarm has its own design features and is programmed for a specific operation algorithm.  As additional components of a satellite line, a GSM module for car alarms, an immobilizer, a listening device and an <span>alarm button</span> are often used <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why do we need GSM? </h2>

    <p>  The GSM network is an important element of car alarms, because through this module an alarming text message is sent to the car owner‚Äôs mobile phone, which allows him to respond in a timely manner, for example, to an attempted theft.  The alarm must necessarily be equipped with an antenna, the task of which is to establish communication with the satellite.  It is installed so that there are as few obstacles as possible in the transmission of a signal or data packet. </p><h2>  How does the security system work? </h2><p>  GPS / GSM car alarm consists of two electronic units that are mounted inside the car.  The first block is needed to determine the geo-position of the car in relation to satellites, the second - to provide communication with the driver of the car.  The advantage of its use is that <span>satellite systems are</span> connected to the control room control panel, and therefore all important information will go directly to the security company.  True, these services are paid. </p>

    <p>  Modern GSM car alarms are paging, duplicating or carrying out GPS monitoring.  Paging is the cheapest and allows you to determine the location of the vehicle at a distance.  A feature of GPS monitoring is the ability to determine the exact location of the machine and remote control the main auto systems - ignition or engine.  Elite class alarms include duplicate ones, which not only carry out GPS monitoring, but also have a number of additional features.  Modern GSM car alarms are characterized by a number of advantages: </p><ol><li>  Great network coverage. </li><li>  Multifunctionality. </li><li>  The ability to track the movement of the car. </li><li>  Hidden installation. </li></ol><p>  But in the reviews it is noted that satellite security lines have disadvantages, the most important of which is the ability to read the GPS code signal.  In addition, if the car is underground, it is impossible to pick up the sensor signal. </p><h2>  Selection rules </h2>

    <p>  Of course, there are a huge number of modern car alarm models.  But not everyone has the opportunity to purchase products of a particular brand.  Note that the simplest GSM do-it-yourself car alarm system from a telephone can be made. </p><p>  Those who have already made such equipment with their own hands say that this process is simple, the main thing is to choose schemes and descriptions.  As components you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  old mobile phone with buttons; </li><li>  magnet; </li><li>  reed switch; </li><li>  wires </li><li>  switch. </li></ul><p>  The assembly process is quite simple.  First, the subscriber‚Äôs call is set up, that is, the current owner number for one button.  Then the front panel of the phone is removed, since access to the board where the contacts are connected is needed.  At this stage, it is important to solder the wires correctly.  So, if the phone shutdown and hang up functions fall on one button, then one wire is soldered to the button itself, and the second to the key that will be responsible for the call.  If the buttons for disconnecting and turning off the mobile device are different, then the wires are soldered to each of them. </p><p>  After the circuit is completed, a magnet is placed on the door, and then a reed switch is set up.  Do-it- <span>yourself GSM car alarm,</span> as you can see, is created simply.  But the essence of its operation differs from the principle of operation of conventional signaling systems: when you try to open the door, the contacts of the reed switch close and a call comes from the phone to the number that is programmed.  Using an additional switch, the alarm is armed and disarmed.  Such a system will promptly warn the car owner about unauthorized access.  In addition, the systems are distinguished by the low cost of creation, almost complete autonomy, while the phone will be periodically charged. </p><h2>  Pandora DXL 3910 </h2>

    <p>  There are very different reviews about this GSM car alarm, but among the pluses are the affordable price of the device and the simplicity of its settings.  For the middle-class security system, the Pantera Cl-550 can be considered a reliable anti-theft device that, when triggered, emits a siren.  The model is equipped with simple, but quite reliable sensors, so the car will be protected from hacking.  The advantage of the model is the ability to program and configure, which is a rather rare phenomenon for this price category.  Some users note that the level of the security system is not very high. </p><h2>  Jaguar ez-ultra </h2>

    <p>  This is a one-way GPS / GSM car alarm, which at a low price attracts attention with effective anti-jamming and high-speed performance.  The system can be configured to use separate radio channels, especially if additional service functions are required.  Among the advantages of the model, users note the expanded control of autorun and the ability to arm the alarm when the engine is idling.  According to users, the Jaguar Ez-ultra is easy to install and configure, but breaking it is not easy. </p><h2>  Tomahawk 7.1 </h2><p>  This GPS / GSM car alarm attracts attention with the silent arming function, which is far from being available in all premium models.  An indisputable bonus of the system is non-volatile memory, which, even when the power is turned off, will save all data about the state of the device.  A dual dialog code with a modern coding algorithm is the key to high security of the system.  But the model also has a drawback - there are no additional channels so that you can control external devices. </p><h2>  Alligator C-500 </h2><p>  Of the economical, but high-quality car alarms, this can be noted.  It operates at a distance of 2.5 km, has six independent security zones, is equipped with intelligent startup and has the ability to control additional devices.  In addition, the two-way Alligator GSM module for car alarms has received many good reviews.  Installation of the line in the car is simple and convenient, for this you do not even need to go to the service center.  Users say that the missing immobilizer can be replaced with an additional module. </p><p>  So that the security system on the car is effective and reliable, choose a model in which the driver‚Äôs alert rate is higher.  It is for this indicator that GSM-systems are in high demand among those who want to protect their car from theft and unauthorized entry. </p>
