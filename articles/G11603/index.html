    <h2>  Geographical position of Formentera </h2><p>  The Balearic Islands, which are owned by Spain, are located in the Mediterranean Sea.  Formentera, Ibiza, Mallorca and Menorca are islands of volcanic origin located between Europe and Africa.  Formentera is a little less than 100 km from the Spanish coast.  The nearest <span>island, Ibiza, is</span> just 6 km away, and Mallorca is about 80 km away.  The length of the island is 23 km, the area is 83 square meters.  km  The relief of Formentera is predominantly flat, with the exception of small cliffs in the east (La Mola) and in the west (Cap de Barbaria).  The northern part of the territories is occupied by salt marshes, nothing grows here at all, there are several small areas overgrown with forest.  The island‚Äôs soil is not rich in minerals, it is not suitable for agriculture, therefore, the main type of employment is the tourism sector.  The island has four fairly large settlements, the capital is a small town - San Frances.  The population density is 120 people per square.  km </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Located almost in the middle of the sea, Formentera, whose weather is milder than on the mainland, is in the zone of temperate <span>marine climate.</span>  The average annual temperature on the island is plus 21 degrees.  Here the sun shines almost all the time.  Sunny days are approximately 300 a year.  At Formentera, the swimming and beach season lasts from late April to October.  In the summer it is quite hot, the thermometer shows 26-30 degrees of heat.  Spring and autumn are very comfortable, with an average temperature of +20 degrees.  Winter on the island is very mild, the average indicator on thermometers is kept in the region of +15 degrees.  Features of the climate of Formentera are that the water around the island softens the heat in the summer, so there is never a grueling heat, and in winter the sea levels the influence of cold air masses, therefore it is warmer than at the same time on the mainland.  The only drawback of this geographical location is the strong winds that often fly over the island. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  The Mediterranean Sea is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Europe, and Spain is the leader in the number of beaches.  Formentera is the most beachfront place in the country, in fact, there is nothing here except the coast.  The peculiarity of rest on the island is that there is no rich and diverse tourist infrastructure.  On the island there are several dozen hotels and the necessary set of enterprises that provide services to tourists.  <span>Life on the island is</span> comfortable, but lovers of a calm, measured rest rush here first of all.  Noisy parties, water parks and attractions - all this is not about Formentera.  The beauty is that all of the above is in abundance on Ibiza, which is only 6 km away and which is very easy to reach by ferry.  Therefore, there is a unique opportunity to spend a vacation in peace and quiet, but at any time you can immerse yourself in a noisy social life, go shopping or see some sights.  A feature of local recreation is the absence of a ban on nudism, so you can often see completely naked people on the beach, although they usually choose more secluded places.  Since tourists from Ibiza mainly come to the island, during the daytime season it is very crowded here.  Therefore, those who live in the hotels of the island prefer to go to the beach in the morning and in the evening, when a crowd of tourists will subside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Formentera beaches </h2><p>  In general, almost the entire coastline of the island is the beach.  There are about 20 beaches, and they are all excellent.  The beaches (Formentera) are covered with soft white sand, combined with the purest turquoise water - this creates the perfect picture of a "paradise" vacation.  Along the coast of the island special algae grows - Posidonia, which give the water such a beautiful and unusual shade.  Beauty is the main evaluation criterion that applies to the characterization of local coasts.  All the beaches on the island are sandy, usually the entrance to the water is smooth, but there is no big shallow.  Visiting them is free, but you will have to pay for equipment (umbrellas, deck chairs, awnings).  On the banks of Formentera, it is almost impossible to meet rescuers, so you need to worry about your own safety.  In the evenings, the beaches are deserted and here you can easily find a place for romantic seclusion.  Formentera is difficult to choose the best beach, since they are all of a very good standard, but still there are the most famous, comfortable and beautiful.  Since the main attraction of the island is the beaches, it is worth spending time visiting different shores.  The most interesting include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - <em>Caval den Borras.</em>  It is easily accessible from the port by bus, with a beautiful view of the nearby islets. </p><p>  <em>- Lievant.</em>  Salt lakes and picturesque cliffs are located nearby, where you can hold an interesting photo shoot. </p><p>  <em>- Calo de s'Oli.</em>  On the shore there are several natural pools in which there is always very warm water. </p><p>  <em>- Es Pujols.</em>  The cleanest beach, on the shore of which there are several small islands, which are easily accessible by swimming. </p><p>  <em>- Arenals.</em>  The coast, surrounded by pine trees, in the south of the island is considered the best place for snorkeling. </p><p>  <em>- Punta des Borronar.</em>  The beach in the north of the island has a satellite - the islet of Espalmador, to which you can wade. </p><p>  The three most popular beaches include: Playa Ilietes, Cala Saona and Playa de Meijon. </p>

    <h2>  Playa Illetes </h2><p>  Buying tickets to Spain, tourists imagine a snow-white sand spit, incredible purity of the sea and a lot of sun.  All this fully applies to the beach of Playa Ilietes.  It is located on a long strip of sand that goes into the water of the Mediterranean Sea.  To get to this shore, you have to overcome a certain distance from the port, it is best to do this on a rented scooter.  The beach belongs to the territory of the biosphere reserve, so there is simply amazing clean water and coast.  But such beauty attracts a large number of vacationers - this is the most visited beach on the island. </p><h2>  Kala saona </h2><p>  Near the capital of the island is a cozy beach of Kala Saona.  It is located in a small rocky bay, according to Greek legend, it is from here that you can see the top of the sunken Atlantis - Mount Es Vedra volcano.  Purchasing a ticket to Spain, Ibiza or Formentera allows tourists to plunge into the atmosphere of aristocratic relaxation.  This beach meets the highest standards.  Of course, it is very crowded here in the season, but in the evenings, when arriving tourists depart for Ibiza, you can have a great time on the beach watching the sunset. </p><h2>  Playa de Migjorn </h2><p>  Another luxurious beach, which is located near the capital, is Playa de Migjorn.  Formentera Island, one-day tours for which vacationers in Ibiza are in great demand, offers ideal opportunities for a measured pastime.  On the beach, sun loungers and umbrellas are offered for rent, drinks and food are organized, but there are no entertainments like riding on the "bananas" or water attractions.  The beauty of the beach consists in contemplating the beauty of water and sky, and enjoying the sun.  The proximity to the city makes this beach relatively easy to access, so at the height of the day it is extremely crowded. </p>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Tourists almost always need sights, some famous places that Spain is very rich in.  Formentera, unlike other places in the country, cannot offer either outstanding architecture or historically significant monuments.  Its main advantage and attraction is the sea, sun and water.  On the island you should visit the Ses Salines nature reserve, take a walk along the fir groves, see two churches, of the 18th and 19th centuries.  History buffs should visit the 4-thousand-year-old megaliths at Cape Barbaria and the medieval Can Bligh Fortress, La Mola Lighthouse.  Windmills are considered the symbol of Formentera, they can be seen in the towns of La Mola, San Ferrand and San Frances. </p><h2>  Hotel base </h2><p>  Formentera, whose hotels are mainly in the high price category, offers accommodation in 130 hotels of various sizes.  Since there are few hotels, you need to take care of booking the hotel long before the season.  Since May, almost all placements have been bought here.  You do not have to count on a tent, it is prohibited here.  You can choose hotels for the price, although everything is quite expensive or by location.  Closer to the towns there is more choice of hotels, in villages there can be only one or two hotels, so there‚Äôs nothing to choose from.  The best in terms of price and quality can be called Sunway Punta Prima and Hotel Riu La Mola hotels with good service, location and services. <strong> </strong></p>
