DND (Do Not Disturb) - Do Not Disturb</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When mobile phones firmly entered into circulation, the question of how to make the device silent during certain periods of time became relevant.  For the first 10 years, the only way to do this was to vibrate.  However, in newer models, DND mode began to appear.  What it is?  In simple words, this is a new feature that allows you to configure your phone to make calls available at one time and not available at another time you specify.  This is especially true if you are often busy with any responsible work. </p>

    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  You can decrypt this abbreviation as Do Not Disturb, which literally translates from English as ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù.  Today this functionality is available both on iPhones and on Android smartphones.  However, their development and settings are somewhat different. </p><p>  On devices of both platforms, using the Do Not Disturb function, you can turn off calls, warnings and notifications that you receive while your device is locked.  You can also enter some special parameters and allow calls from certain people. </p>

    <p>  Do Not Disturb on Android looks like a simple and straightforward setup.  But when Google abruptly rebuilt this functionality in the Lollipop version, and then continued to develop it in Marshmallow, everything became a bit confusing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where did it come from? </h2><p>  DND translation into Russian is understandable.  How did this service develop?  To trace its history, you need to remember the old versions of Android, before the release of Lollipop.  In KitKat (and earlier), keeping your phone silent was pretty simple: you could just turn the volume all the way down to gain access to vibrating and silent modes.  Then there was no need to think about how long the smartphone would not ring.  Everything was configured with one button.  DND on a new generation phone has a more complex structure. </p><p>  When the Lollipop version was released to the market, Google developers changed the situation.  When you completely turn off the volume, the vibration mode is automatically turned on, that is, there is no ‚Äúsilent‚Äù setting.  But at the same time, a new set of parameters appeared, the control of which is below the volume slider.  They included No, Priority, and All.  These were the new Do Not Disturb settings. </p>

    <p>  By clicking on the ‚ÄúPriority‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù options, you will get a menu with even more options: ‚ÄúIndefinitely‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor a certain time‚Äù.  Depending on which option was selected, the phone either ignored all notifications (calls, messages, calendar events, etc.) in the selected period of time, or allowed users to determine priority notifications.  In fact, this DND function caused a lot of confusion.  This was due to the fact that to determine the "priority" you had to look into the "Settings" menu. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New additions </h2><p>  For this reason, in the Marshmallow distribution, Google developers changed Do Not Disturb again.  The volume button remains the same.  If you completely turn it off, the smartphone goes into "only vibration" mode.  If you press the volume level again, the device switches to Do Not Disturb mode.  However, you can also enable Do Not Disturb from the Quick Settings menu with additional options.  You will have the options ‚ÄúComplete silence‚Äù, ‚ÄúOnly alarms‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnly priority‚Äù, and you get the opportunity to set the time frame for how long you want to stay in DND mode.  What it is?  Everything is explained simply: you set the clock from time to time, at which you do not want to hear the signals of your device. </p>

    <h2>  How to configure this functionality? </h2><p>  Although the basics of Do Not Disturb are very simple, some of the advanced settings are not immediately clear.  If the essence of the option ‚ÄúComplete silence‚Äù is obvious, then ‚ÄúPriority mode‚Äù will not be useful until you enter the necessary parameters.  How does DND work with these settings? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Basically, Android defines notifications in several different ways: alerts, reminders, events, messages, and calls.  If you go to Settings&gt; Sounds&gt; Do Not Disturb, you can switch Priority notification types.  Message options offer even more detailed controls, allowing you to set specific contacts as priority.  This means that they can contact you even if the Do Not Disturb feature is activated. </p><p>  Regulation in this mode of calls is basically the same, with only one addition: skip repeated ones.  This means that if the same person calls you twice within a 15-minute period, the call will be allowed through the DND setting. </p>

    <p>  What is this in practice?  After setting these parameters, you can switch the DND to the ‚ÄúSilent‚Äù mode, in which no notifications will go through the ‚ÄúPriority Mode‚Äù, except for those specified in the previous step. </p><h2>  What is Do Not Disturb in an iPhone? </h2><p>  Do Not Disturb mode is a useful feature that was added to iOS in 2012 as part of the <span>iOS 6</span> update <span>.</span> When activated manually or on an iPhone or iPad, it disables all incoming notifications, calls, and so on.  As in the case of Android, it is necessary so that you do not wake up at night or get distracted during work.  Thus, it is convenient for night time or during busy periods. </p><p>  To explore these settings yourself, open the Settings app.  You will see that Do Not Disturb is a flexible tool that can be used in a variety of ways.  In this case, all parameters are configured without any special effort. </p><p>  You can set the Do Not Disturb mode so that some users can reach you.  By clicking on this option in the settings, you can enable call permissions from the "Favorites" or only for a specific group in your contacts.  In the first case, you yourself make a list of numbers for which you want to make a priority. </p><p>  Finally, Do Not Disturb can be activated at a specific time of the day (most often it is needed at night so that calls and signals do not interfere with sleep).  To configure this option, tap the "Scheduled" slider and select the time at which you need to turn DND on and off. </p><h2>  Turn Do Not Disturb on or off </h2><p>  When the Do Not Disturb feature is enabled, you see the DND icon in <span>the status bar.</span>  There are two ways to enable or disable the function. </p><p>  Go to Settings&gt; Do Not Disturb to enable the option manually or set a schedule. </p><p>  Open the Control Center, then tap the Do Not Disturb icon. </p><p>  If you set the alarm in the Clock application, it will work even if the Do Not Disturb mode is on. </p>

    <h2>  Change settings in iPhone </h2><p>  If you do not want to be disturbed at a specific time, you can set a schedule.  Click Settings&gt; Do Not Disturb and turn on Scheduled.  Then set the time. </p><p>  You can also choose when you want to receive alerts, calls and notifications using the DND mode on your phone: </p><p>  Silence: Select the desired setting to turn off calls and notifications always or only when the device is locked. </p><p>  You can allow calls in one of four options: from everyone, from anyone, your favorites, or from specific contact groups stored on your device or in iCloud. </p><p>  Repeated calls: by default it is set that if someone calls you twice within three minutes, the second call will not be disconnected.  However, this can be turned off. </p><h2>  How to determine the included DND </h2><p>  What is it and how can it be done?  How do I know if your interlocutor is using Do Not Disturb? </p><p>  The signs of the included Do Not Disturb and full-featured blocking are pretty similar, but they act differently.  If someone has blocked you, you can hide your number and the call will go away from you.  In the case of DND, you have to wait until the user disables these settings. </p><p>  If you call a user with the Do Not Disturb settings activated, you will hear one call and then be sent to voicemail.  In this case, the called phone will not ring, and there will be no sound or light signals on it.  Only when viewing the screen will the ‚ÄúMissed call‚Äù notification be displayed, and a text notification with the missed call will be saved.  If iMessage is sent at this time, the message will pass. </p>

    <h2>  How to bypass Do Not Disturb? </h2><p>  By default, the Do Not Disturb function is configured to allow calls if the same number rings again within three or fifteen minutes (in the iPhone and Android, respectively).  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis parameter is to ignore most calls, but allow urgent calls. </p><p>  In other words, if you suspect that your interlocutor is using the Do Not Disturb feature, you should call again immediately.  If this setting is activated by default, you will break through the DND barrier.  But keep in mind, your number may subsequently be marked as unwanted. </p><p>  In addition, the user can be configured with priority for specific users.  Most smartphone owners are less likely to use this feature because it is deactivated by default.  If it is turned on and you are not in a privileged group, you will not be able to get through. </p><p>  If your contact uses Do Not Disturb on a schedule, you can only reach him at another time.  This is likely if you are calling at night or you can assume that your interlocutor is busy with important work, is at any event or meeting.  Call again in the morning or after hours. </p>
