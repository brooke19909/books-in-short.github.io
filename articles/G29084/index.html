    <h2>  History of Kabardino-Balkaria </h2><p>  <span>There is a consensus among historians that the Kabardian subethnos of the Adyghe people was artificially isolated by the Soviet authorities as a separate people based on political considerations.</span> </p><p>  <span>The authorities of the USSR were faced with the task of making national separatism on the outskirts the least numerous and the least aggressive.</span>  <span>For this, the borders of national autonomies were carried out with the expectation that small national entities would not be able to withstand the central government.</span> </p><p>  <span>However, scientists believe that until the beginning of the twentieth century, the Kabardins were only part of the Adyghe ethnic group, whose representatives lived on the eastern outskirts of the Adyghe range.</span>  <span>It is worth noting: it is reliably known that modern Kabardinians have been living in this territory since at least the 15th century, however, some information from historical and literary sources indicates that the ancestors of the people lived on the territory of Kabardino-Balkaria already in the lX century.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Balkarians and the national question </h2><p>  <span>Most scholars agree that the Balkars are the indigenous people of the Caucasus, since it is reliably known that the tribes on the basis of which this ethnos was formed have been living in the territory of present Kabardino-Balkaria since the fifth century of the new era.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>However, some researchers are inclined to go even further in determining the duration of the Balkars in the Caucasus, raising their genus to the Koban archaeological culture.</span> </p><p>  <span>However, modern Balkarians are a Turkic-speaking people, the main ethnic element of which are the Turkic-speaking Bulgarians who roamed the lands where the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria is located in the 5th century AD.</span> </p><p>  <span>A serious test for the Balkars was the Mongol campaigns, as a result of which Alania was defeated, and the Balkars were forced to rise from the plains to the mountains.</span> </p><h2>  Post-war years of the XX century </h2><p>  <span>The region where Kabardino-Balkaria is located was in the zone of occupation of German troops during the Second World War.</span>  <span>Most of the republic, including Nalchik, was under Nazi rule for almost two years.</span> </p><p>  <span>After the liberation of the Caucasus by the Soviet authorities in the region, mass repressions began, to which not only large social groups, but entire nations were subjected.</span> </p><p>  <span>Chechens, Ingush, Crimean Tatars, Meskhetian Turks, Azerbaijanis, Armenians and Balkars were evicted to remote areas of the Soviet Union.</span>  <span>The national autonomies of many deported peoples were liquidated, and the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic was transformed into the Kabardian.</span> </p>
