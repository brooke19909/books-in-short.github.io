Classes with experienced instructors who are fluent in Russian are not boring. </p><p>  Tennis fans will also be satisfied with the hotel court.  There is also a diving school at the hotel complex.

    <p>  The resort in the resort is called <span>Naama Bay.</span>  However, according to reviews, because of the many shops it was inviting this rather noisy place.  Our recommendations are intended for those who are looking for a quiet, relaxing holiday. </p><p>  Staying in Sharma, it is worth visiting the truly worthy Pacha club as an acquaintance with the nightlife of Sharma.  Shopping is best done in Naama hypermarket, the prices are fixed, and you do not need to spend time to bargain with the locals.  Worth a visit is the stylish Hard Rock Cafe Restaurant.  Unobtrusively and mentally served at the Mexican Bar.  Comfortably and not in the crowd you can relax in the British club Monty's. </p><p>  The Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve is the natural gem that Egypt is famous for.  Aurora Oriental Resort (Sharm el Sheikh) can be a good launching pad for visiting it, thanks to the nearby tour desk.  Yolanda Reef, Shark Reef, Tiran Island Corals.  All this is worth seeing, buying a tour. </p><p>  Families who come with children, of course, should visit Fun Town Park, full of attractions.  There are no crowds, many cute cafes, and it‚Äôs fun and pleasant to relax. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Reviews about the hotel Aurora Oriental Resort <span>5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) are</span> overwhelmingly positive.  Those who have not figured out the situation and, initially wanting to hang out, still chose this calm, family-friendly place.  However, there are very few such guests. </p>

    <p>  Families with children come here who prefer coziness and quiet surroundings.  Especially since parents of the mini-club help parents in caring for their children (if they are 4-12 years old).  This gives parents the opportunity to escape: visit a massage, Turkish bath, beauty parlor, spa treatments. </p><p>  The overwhelming majority of hotel guests are grateful to the staff for the excellent service, and the administration for the good condition of the hotel complex infrastructure. </p>
