Although they are considered obsolete and functionally limited devices, however, today among us there are those who prefer to use them.  Moreover, now there is the opportunity to purchase a phone in which the button keyboard is adjacent to the touch screen, which gives it a number of advantages over standard devices.  In this article we will help those who wish to purchase a push-button phone with Vatsap support. </p><h2>  About Vatsap </h2><p>  This is the name of the application that enables people to exchange instant text messages.  Using it, you can also send photos, videos, audio recordings.  The application was made free in 2016.  Today, every seventh inhabitant of the Earth uses it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="isorepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Man with cell phone" class="if uuid-3007600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47600/3007600.jpg"></div><h2>  About Phones </h2><p>  It is easy to understand that the Vatsap application of push-button phones will not work correctly on all devices of this type.  Only the following are suitable from them: </p><ul><li>  running on operating systems "Windows", "Android" or iOS </li><li>  having large amounts of RAM; </li><li>  equipped with a camera that is built into the "body" of the phone; </li><li>  connecting to the internet. </li></ul><p>  Today, push-button phones are being created, on which Vatsap is already installed.

We list some of them. </p><h2>  Elari safephone </h2><p>  This device is equipped with a touch screen (its diagonal is 2.4 inches), despite the fact that it is push-button.  The developers supplied this phone with two cameras - front and rear, as well as a red SOS button.  The device is one of those that support 3G. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.express.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vatsap logo image" class="if uuid-3007626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47600/3007626.jpg"></div><h2>  Sonim XP6 </h2><p>  This device has 8 GB of internal and 1 GB of RAM.
