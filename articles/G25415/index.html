    <p>  The device was developed in the face of a change in the concept of model lines of the Finnish manufacturer.  The company looked to the future with hope, clearly at the same time understanding what tasks it was facing and what it really would need to do in order to at least maintain its old position in the market and to make its way to leading positions as much as possible.  Obviously, the peak of dissatisfaction with the current course of the company took place in 2005.  Then, I remember, the Finnish manufacturer worked on a very important thing - changing the design and appearance of their devices.  This saga ended in some ways sadly: the chief designer (and it was Frank Nuovo) voluntarily (but, of course, without a loud explanation of official reasons) left the post that he had previously held for several years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, I would not want to dramatize once again, but it was after this event that the next dark period came for the Finnish company.  This manifested itself in a sharp and significant drop in sales.  I remember that even then the company began to lag behind Motorola and the South Korean Samsung.  But as expected, the Finnish manufacturer found the strength to return to the right path through more active advancement in terms of studying the appearance of competing devices.  By the way, to resolve this issue, Nokia again used the above-mentioned competitive companies.  And it should be said, very successfully. </p><p>  Thus, the dismissal of Frank Nuovo from the post of chief designer can be regarded in two ways.  On the one hand, the company lost its popularity due to it.  But who knows, would Nokia manage to break into the international arena of mobile devices as effectively as it did now if Frank would remain in his post?  It is possible that he would suggest a different direction and events would develop for the company not so colorful. </p><h2>  Project code name </h2>

    <p>  Thus, the company soon came to the need to launch several separate projects.  Among them, a model, codenamed Lynn, entered the development phase.  And few people know that this pseudonym once received the subject of our review today - the Nokia 6500 Slide phone.  The project was developed and taken over by the manager Christian Rice, and the engineers of the company started the technical aspects of the preparation of the apparatus near the end of summer, in August 2005.  It is interesting that an approximate set of device functionality, as well as the first development results, were provided to the public by the company employees very, very soon, literally next month.  And when the audience‚Äôs first opinion about the new product became known, the work on preparing the hardware and manufacturing materials entered the most active phase.  Well, of course, then dozens of design options were tested at the same time, among which the only one, but really the best, was selected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a result, the final opinion on how the new product will look was formed already closer to the New Year, in December of the same 2005.  The first variations of the device were made of ordinary plastic.  After a couple of months, in February, testing of the device with focus groups was held in several cities (including Moscow).  Note that they also presented the design that had the Nokia 6300 model.  Interestingly, it gave way to a device under the name 6500 according to surveys.  As it turned out, the appearance of this model was more preferable and pleasant. </p><p>  From the very beginning, the <span>Nokia 6500</span> Slide, the specifications of which will be indicated in this article, was made in silver.  However, participants who tested the device as part of focus groups repeatedly spoke out for the use of a different design, since the ‚Äúsilver‚Äù device allegedly did not fit.  Thus, the Finnish manufacturer decided to release the model in black, and after that - a bronze color scheme.  But this only happened in March 2006. </p><p>  At the same time, the hardware, which was developed specifically for the Nokia 6500 Slide (including the battery), formed the basis for the creation of subsequent devices.  It has been applied to, for example, a model such as the Nokia 5310.  Of course, we will not list all the devices, but the fact is still a fact. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The ‚ÄúNokia 6500 Slider‚Äù falls into the category called Connect - Contemporary.  In the same group, by the way, is the Nokia 6300 model.  In fact, this means that the phone is positioned on the international arena of mobile devices with emphasis on its appearance.  Nevertheless, if we recall the slogan under which the Finns presented the Nokia 6300 model (‚ÄúJust Beautiful‚Äù) to the general public and look at the subject of our review today, we will compare the relevant data, then we will notice some difference.  It is, rather, a shift in emphasis from appearance in general to the benefit of the material of manufacture.  There are a couple of points that the Finnish manufacturer tried to highlight when positioning his device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thus, company representatives have repeatedly stated that the phone is made of metal materials.  We can‚Äôt say that this is one hundred percent true statement.  However, the company had all the reasons for such words.  The top of the mobile phone is indeed made of <span>anodized aluminum.</span>  In general, at whatever angle you look, the top of the device is really made of metal.  Also in the statement of the representatives of the Finnish company there is a moment in which they emphasize the polishing of the front panel, unique for each device.  This may well be true, but it is quite difficult to notice such differences with the naked eye, and indeed why is this necessary.  Does this give a reason to feel the device is really unique?  Unlikely.  Marketing move, and more. </p><h2>  Bottom part </h2>

    <p>  This part of the case at first glance seems to be a kind of ‚Äúshoe‚Äù, which is located on top of the telephone circuit board.  I remember that something similar has already been applied to the Nokia 5100 model.  This solution provides additional protection for the phone.  By the way, the shoe is present in subsequent devices of the series.  It is made of medium-thickness plastic.  Nearby is the hardware, which includes antennas.  There is no need to talk about the habituality of such an arrangement, since this is an innovative solution.  However, who said that it has no right to life?  In general, such a move was successfully used by Motorola. </p><p>  Again, we can compare the subject of our today's review with the Nokia 6300 model.  However, if stainless steel was visible there, then here we will not see it.  By the way, the case of that phone looked, maybe less beautiful, but more reliable.  Here, there is no feeling that we are holding something strong enough in our hands, ready at any moment to resist physical stress and damage.  If we turn to Sony Erickson devices, we can recall the occurrence of a similar situation in the case of the W880i model.  Metal is also used there, but it did not cause those sensations that, it would seem, should have arisen.  In general, there he was almost imperceptible. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The material of manufacture is the most ordinary plastic.  There is a key illumination for working and typing text messages in low light conditions, as well as in the complete absence of light.  Actually, in the sun, letters and numbers on the keys are also visible quite well.  The buttons are medium in size.  Ergonomics are at a good level here, and the keys themselves are easily squeezed, practically without resistance.  The responsiveness of the keyboard is beyond praise in general. </p><h2>  Options Nokia 6500 Slide </h2><p>  - Instruction. </p><p>  - Charger. </p><p>  - Battery lithium-polymer type. </p><p>  - Cable type MicroUSB. </p><p>  - A disk with software. </p><p>  - Wired stereo headset. </p><p>  As we can see, the cable for the Nokia 6500 Slide is included in the package, so you won‚Äôt need to purchase it separately.  If you need additional information on the device, then you can always refer to the official website of the company.  There is, by the way, the firmware of the Nokia 6500 Slide.  And we come to the end. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews characterize the device as a beautiful, but not functional device.  The users have no complaints about the dynamics, vibrating alert and communication quality.  There are no questions to the design, there is only one significant drawback: the ‚Äúshoe‚Äù is not very tight to the corresponding part of the device. </p>
