This term has been used in Western literature since the 1960s.  In today's article, we will consider the process of de-Stalinization (how it was conceived and carried out by Khrushchev), as well as its consequences.  And in conclusion, we will discuss a new round of this policy in Ukraine and in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Start of de-Stalinization </h2><p>  The discussion around this issue does not fade until now.  Some people believe that the debunking of Stalin‚Äôs personality should be continued, while others say that such a policy is Khrushchev‚Äôs mistake.  It all started in 1953.  The tyrant leader died, and with it the old system.  A sharp and decisive <span>Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev</span> quickly came to power <span>.</span>  He had no education, but this was entirely offset by an amazing political instinct.  He began with the lowest positions in the party and easily predicted new trends.  In 1956, at the XX Congress of the CPSU, it was decided to debunk the blind worship of Stalin's personality.  According to historian M. Gefter, resistance to the regime existed even before the death of the Leader.  Belief in the clairvoyance of Stalin was undermined by heavy defeats during World War II.  At first, the <span>cult of personality was</span> associated with Beria.  But gradually official formalization of society began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  "Secret report" Khrushchev </h2><p>  <span>The 20th Congress of the CPSU</span> gathered 1,436 delegates.  He was convened eight months before the due date because of the urgent need to revise the course after the <span>death of Stalin.</span>  And ended with the so-called "secret report" of Khrushchev.  The main attention was paid to the information received by the Pospelov commission on repressions.  According to Khrushchev, 70% of candidates for the Central Committee elected at the XVII Congress were shot.  However, Nikita Sergeevich insisted that de-Stalinization was not the destruction of the foundations of a <span>socialist society,</span> but the elimination of the harmful cult of personality.  Industrialization, collectivization and a tough fight against opposition forces were recognized as necessary milestones in the development of the USSR as a strong state.  Stalin and his henchmen were personally accused of repression.  Khrushchev did not recognize that the origins of the problems lie not in the personality of the leader, but in the system itself. </p>

    <h2>  Country implications </h2><p>  Khrushchev's ‚Äúsecret report‚Äù was not published, but was only read out at meetings of party workers with relevant comments.  Stalin was not recognized as an absolute evil.  The period of his reign ‚Äúdid not change the nature‚Äù of true socialism.  Society is still moving on the right path, that is, towards communism.  Negative phenomena were declared overcome thanks to the efforts of the leaders of the CPSU.  Thus, the responsibility of Stalin's adherents was practically removed.  They remained at key posts.  In general, the "secret report" of Khrushchev: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  changed the psychology of the Soviet people; </li><li>  split the world communist movement; </li><li>  became evidence for the West of the weakness of the USSR. </li></ul>

    <h2>  De-Stalinization: Between 1953 and 1964 </h2><p>  In society, they treated the new politics differently.  A sharp contrast began between the USSR and the West.  So, let's start from the very beginning.  In 1953, Stalin died.  Over the next year, his name and image were constantly discussed at speeches by party leaders.  After the ‚Äúsecret report‚Äù, the official policy of de-Stalinization began.  However, in society there was a whole range of different opinions about the former Secretary General.  The discrediting of Stalin‚Äôs personality as a symbol of an entire era gave rise to a whole war of suicides.  Many did not understand why Khrushchev began to express his opinion about the repressions only after the death of the great leader.  At the first stage, de-Stalinization is, first of all, the separation of the management system.  More than 10 thousand enterprises were given into the republican jurisdiction.  Under the 1957 Law, more than one hundred economic regions were created with collegial governing bodies - economic councils.  The positive moment of decentralization was a surge of local initiative.  Negative - reducing technological progress.  The Soviet system lost the opportunity to concentrate funds for development.  Decentralization peaked in 1961. </p>

    <h2>  XXII Congress of the CPSU </h2><p>  Late in the evening of October 31, 1961, Red Square was cordoned off.  It was announced to the people that a parade rehearsal was being held by November 7th.  However, in fact, the decision of the XXII Congress of the Communist Party of the <span>Soviet Union</span> was being implemented <span>.</span>  Namely, it was necessary to take Stalin out of the Mausoleum.  Everyone understood that such an action could lead to unrest.  For many, de-Stalinization is just this event.  Among the discontented there were many front-line soldiers.  Local communities began to voluntarily fell monuments to the great leader.  People joked that Khrushchev frees up a place in the Mausoleum next to Lenin for himself.  In 1961, many cities were renamed. </p>

    <h2>  In Ukraine </h2><p>  De-Stalinization is a policy that has significantly influenced the situation in the Ukrainian SSR.  During this period, the campaign against nationalist sentiments was stopped, the process of Russification slowed down and the role of the Ukrainian factor in all areas increased.  Kirichenko was elected to the post of first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine.  Leading positions began to be occupied by indigenous Ukrainians.  In 1954, the Ukrainian SSR was transferred to Crimea.  This decision was motivated by territorial proximity and economic community.  The problem was the ethnic composition of the population.  Ukrainians made up only 13.7%.  A positive aspect of the de-Stalinization process was the expansion of the rights of the Union republics.  However, in many ways, it introduced even more disagreement into society. </p>
