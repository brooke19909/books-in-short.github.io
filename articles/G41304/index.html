  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phuket in September: weather, prices, travel tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Because of the more frequent, compared to other months, rainy days, Phuket in September is called ‚Äúoff season‚Äù, and therefore the number of tourists who are usually afraid of this concept is significantly reduced.  However, many people come to this Thai province on vacation, because it is at this time that they have a vacation or simply so much cheaper.  What to see this month in Phuket, how to dress and what to be prepared for?  We will talk about this later. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  September is the time of activity of the southwest monsoon, so the likelihood that you will catch clear sunny weather is much higher only if you come here for at least a couple of weeks.  Otherwise, most likely, during your vacation it will be cloudy or the sky will be covered by rain clouds.  In fact, September does not imply a maximum level of precipitation, but there can be very few of them for sure.  Because of this, it is best to take raincoats with you.  Showers usually occur in the mornings or late evenings, but also occur in the daytime.  Do not be afraid of natural disasters too much, the last time a flood occurred in the province in 2011.  As a rule, such disasters in Phuket do not often happen, so you should not worry in vain.  Daytime air temperature reaches about 29-30, and at night - about 23-24 degrees. </p>

    <h2>  Beach holidays in Phuket in September </h2><p>  Constantly lying on the beaches during this period you are unlikely to succeed.  Regardless of the temperature in the sea, which in itself is not pleasant enough, soaking up in the water can sometimes be difficult due to heavy winds.  In some areas, waves can reach heights of up to several meters, so in this case it is better not to risk your life.  Especially the troubled water on the west coast, where mostly surfers gather who want to train to tame the elements.  Beginners in this matter are not allowed, as there are too bad weather conditions for training.  Your skills may be inadequate and you risk putting your life and health at risk.  It‚Äôs best to watch how professionals do it from the shore.  Tourists who want to swim in the sea are recommended to go to the eastern and southeastern beaches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Entertaining activities </h2><p>  Phuket in September is a great time for sightseeing trips.  You can attend historical events during this period at much cheaper prices.  This way you will not be bored due to what Phuket offers in September.  Reviews of tourists suggest that it is best to go to national parks - to visit Khao Lak and Khao Sok, where you can see amazing animals.  In addition, it is also recommended that they be sent to the center where rescued sea turtles live.  Also on the list of attractions are a Buddhist monkey temple, which is located in limestone caves, as well as the old city of Phuket Town, where you can experience the exotic flavor of Thailand.  In addition, you can go rafting on rivers on bamboo rafts, which is popular among extreme lovers.  If you just want to relax and unwind, head to the spa, where services in September cost less. </p>

    <h2>  Traditional holidays </h2><p>  Phuket in September (reviews of tourists confirm this) is known for unusual celebrations during the annual Vegetarian Festival.  This holiday is called quite simply, but there is no question of proper nutrition, but rather of traditional mystical Thai rites.  Using special techniques and prayers, local people can go into a trance.  Then they apply a tattoo on their body, pierce the skin, appeasing the gods.  Especially the faint of heart can not stand such a spectacle (as well as pregnant and young children).  But those who are interested in national traditions at this festival have the opportunity to learn more local rituals. </p>

    <h2>  Prices in Phuket in September </h2><p>  The beginning of autumn in Thailand, and in particular in Phuket, is considered to be an unpopular time for the tourism business.  Therefore, hotels, holiday homes and other establishments are revising their pricing policy during this period in order to attract customers.  On average, a night in a double room will cost 12-20 euros.  The cost of sightseeing trips, souvenirs, services in spas, as well as food in public places is becoming much lower.  There are sales in stores and malls where you can purchase goods at a substantial discount.  This trend is an advantage of a holiday in Phuket in September.  However, do not forget that even a short-term weather forecast here during this period cannot be called reliable.  Therefore, it is necessary to be prepared for rains and showers, at least for a short time.  If such conditions suit you, go on vacation to Phuket. </p>
