The task is not an easy one, as future investors are faced with difficult tasks in the form of finding a suitable platform on which to trade, purchase various securities, currency or metals, as well as trade in raw materials.  The main problem is that, depending on the platform, customers must comply with internal conditions.  In addition to the current international and domestic legislation, in the field of investment, trading on the territory, citizens must comply with the conditions specified in the agreement with the exchange. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.financedais.com" data-author=": admin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foreign exchange trading" class="if uuid-3017227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017227.jpg"></div><p>  As a result of this, in case of erroneous actions or violation of conditions or incorrect calculations, a person may lose part of his savings or completely lose them.  It should also be understood that domestic platforms through which you can invest and invest your funds are practically absent.  They are mainly represented by large banks and some representative offices with British offices. </p><h2>  Conditions for trading and investing </h2><p>  Reviews about Interactive Brokers as a company in which you can invest are presented in large numbers.  This is one of the oldest platforms.  The exchange previously operated only in the United States.  Over the past 10 years, she has entered the international level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The organization offers favorable conditions for private investors and traders.  The exchange makes it possible to buy equity securities and use modern tools for investment, aggregation not independently, but with the help of professional participants who regulate all operations.  However, users must understand that in order to participate in an international project, a number of conditions must be met. </p><p>  One of the main ones is that in order to participate in trading on the stock exchange, the future investor must have at least 10 thousand dollars or 680 thousand rubles of own funds.  In addition, a citizen must have a total taxable income, which can be officially confirmed, in the amount of at least 200 thousand rubles.  These requirements apply only to the financial part. </p><h2>  Company Overview </h2><p>  Feedback on Interactive Brokers can also be found on professional forums of traders.  The company stands out from many in that it places high demands on its future investor.  It monitors its reputation and limits the number of bidders so as not to fall under international regulators who can see dubious operations in a large volume of transactions.  This can lead to serious economic investigations.  If the client wants to become a member of the exchange, he must fully comply with the internal established rules, which are concluded precisely in the order of registration, verification. </p><p>  Opening an account with Interactive Brokers is carried out immediately after the client confirms their identity and issues a new account.  The company has a public form of government and an official rating from international exchange agencies.  All company accounts that are opened by new investors are insured for 250 thousand dollars.  In addition, the organization‚Äôs personal tangible assets are an insured amount of the order of half a million dollars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.benzinga.com" data-author=": Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern regulators" class="if uuid-3017229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017229.jpg"></div><p>  This is a full-fledged broker located in the USA and has representative offices in a number of countries, including Russia.  It is also worth noting that, unlike many other international trading companies, this one provides the opportunity to trade US citizens.  The system is a guarantee of transparent exchange operations schemes. </p><p>  The organization has a Russian representative office, as well as Russian-language support on the official website.

There is Russian-language support and chat, where users can contact with their questions, suggestions and statements. </p><h2>  Trading System Features </h2><p>  Reviews of Interactive Brokers traders and investors highlight many interesting features of the platform.  All trades are carried out only after passing the full registration.  This is necessary in order to officially register new customers as brokers or investors.  Citizens registered in the project can bid themselves.  However, it is better to use the services of specialists.  For this, special brokers who gain access to the investor‚Äôs portfolio, to his instructions, carry out various trading operations to one degree or another.  Without the team of the depositor himself, the trader does not carry out any actions on the account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After opening an account, the client gets access to the support mode.  This is due to the fact that the conditions of the platform are constantly changing, as changes are added to the laws of the countries where the company is represented.  As a result of this, while in different jurisdictions at the same time, the organization is forced to edit its terms.  However, this does not apply to part of deposits and investments.  Basically, this is legal registration of the status of citizens who invest their funds to generate income at a certain percentage, or the tax reporting system, which each country has its own. </p><p>  To optimize the service, developers, engineers and managers are constantly improving the system of the site.  To do this, when visiting the resource, you must first access your personal account.  All processes during registration contain a menu of prompts.  They allow even a beginner in investing to understand all the nuances and get acquainted with additional information in the form of materials and articles that are dedicated not only to this resource, but also to trading in general. </p><h2>  Benefits of Trading with a Company </h2><p>  Reviews about Interactive Brokers can be found not only by investors, but also by professional brokers.  They burn that only the process of registering and receiving an invoice is complicated.  Next, access to modern tools for conducting trading operations appears. </p><p>  The advantages of working with the company are many.  Like any other broker, the organization provides services for investing and making profit at the expense of its own commission.  It is worth noting that it has a low cost.  This allows the client to make big profits.  Additionally, the company has an integrated investment management system.  The system allows users to set the necessary regulators through a version of a mobile application or a site, which allow not only more efficiently earn, but also invest, spend and, more recently, borrow money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forextrade1.com" data-author=": Forex Trade1, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Market analysis" class="if uuid-3017231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017231.jpg"></div><p>  The lending function is new in the trading market.  It allows you to issue loans secured by assets at low rates through the mobile market platform.  Additionally, all participants receive debit cards in MasterCard format, which make it possible to make purchases anywhere in the world.  With their help, clients also receive maximum bonuses and their profit from previously invested funds through the portal.  The card is fully tied to the account of the trader. </p><p>  Today, the platform allows you to invest in stocks, futures, securities markets, options and in various materials with fixed incomes.

This company has been operating for 40 years and has gained vast experience in terms of working with clients and managing their assets.  In addition, various certification, analytical and technological services are offered. </p><h2>  The procedure for registration and paperwork </h2><p>  Joining Interactive Brokers is a multi-step process.  To perform investment and trading operations, you need a standard account.  Other versions of the design make it possible to obtain a special status for the client, which allows not only to earn, but to receive additional income, while managing other people's accounts and accounts from other users.  There are categories of accounts for professionals who can carry out financial services in the company.  Together, this suggests that the organization is developing various systems of interaction between investors and brokers.  The contract at Interactive Brokers is executed in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once.  This is required by an international agreement and legislation in the field of investment services. </p><p>  Registration Procedure: </p><ol><li>  Transition to the official site. </li><li>  Select the appropriate account category. </li><li>  Filling in information about yourself. </li><li>  Filling in the details from the passport. </li><li>  Scanning a registration page and uploading a copy to the company‚Äôs server. </li><li>  Sending a request for registration and moderation. </li></ol><p>  When filling out an application for opening an account and form, it is necessary to fully comply with these recommendations.  You can find them by reading the tips that pop up when you open the office.  This mechanism is a conductor for independent tool management.  The application must specify the form of account management.  Choosing a broker, you will see that the yield will be slightly less.  However, the loss of funds as a result of improper actions is reduced to zero. </p><p>  You can use your family office account.  A married couple can control personal assets from their income and invest them.  The system has several accounts for each family member.  If an exchange trading specialist is registered, he has the opportunity to issue an account or account as a consultant. </p><p>  You will need to indicate the necessary details about yourself as an individual.  To do this, fill out the information that is indicated on the main page of the passport, namely the registration, date of birth, address of permanent registration.  After registration, the account goes to a specialist for verification.  Within several working days, he will contact the applicant and help activate the account in order to get full access to your personal account. </p><h2>  Account opening </h2><p>  You can open an account with Interactive Brokers immediately after confirming your account.  It should be understood that this organization is completely foreign.  Its main assets are located in the United States of America, which means that when concluding an agreement with this company, the user will partially fall under the jurisdiction that operates in the territory of this country. </p><p>  The Interactive Brokers platform has a number of rules for new users.  According to the current legislation, a client opening a margin account must be at least 21 years old.  If a regular cash account is registered, then the age must be from 18 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cxfinancia.com" data-author=": Xenia Neophytou, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bid statistics" class="if uuid-3017232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017232.jpg"></div><p>  Based on this, you should carefully familiarize yourself with the current form of the contract and if certain contradictions are found in the form of the amount of calculations on the received interest or entering personal details, you should immediately contact the specialists at the specified hotline number on the official website. </p><p>  An account in Interactive Brokers can be opened by a user from any country.  For Russian-speaking citizens, when indicating the country where they are located, the list of documents for compulsory reading will be supplemented by domestic regulatory acts that the brokerage company complies with.  Additionally, there are decrees and recommendations in the archive that govern all operations between a citizen and a foreign foreign company.  In your personal account, after activating the account, you must transfer the bank details. </p><p>  There is no restriction on this operation, and the client can specify the data of any bank in which he has open accounts.  Further, the brokerage company sends a request to the specified financial institution to confirm the status of the person and verify the information specified in the personal account. </p><p>  Many users of the system often ask how to fund their Interactive Brokers account.  This becomes possible only after full confirmation of the investor status.  You can deposit funds through transactions from a personal bank account.  All operations are conducted in US dollars. </p><h2>  Financial interaction </h2><p>  After the personal account passes identification, the information on the personal account is confirmed, the investor will receive full access to his account.  Further, he will need to request an invoice from the organization in his office on the official website.  It is required in order to continue to carry out international bank currency transfers, as well as receive certification letters on opening brokerage accounts.  This information will also be necessary when confirming the tax status of a person or declaring further income on the platform. </p><p>  Interactive Brokers depositing funds or withdrawing funds can create some difficulties.  Experts advise not to open special accounts for conducting international currency transactions in banks of the Russian Federation.  Based on current legislation, these transactions can be frozen indefinitely if the regulator of the financial system decides that they are of illegal origin.  As a result of this, there is an opportunity to even lose your money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finmaxfx.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stock exchanges" class="if uuid-3017236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017236.jpg"></div><p>  To solve this problem, experts advise opening a remote transit account, which costs around $ 500, in the Baltic countries or central Europe.  Funding with Interactive Brokers through these financial institutions occurs almost instantly. </p><p>  The legislation in Russia establishes that in the event that an individual receives a transfer of more than 600 thousand rubles a month or a quarter, the bank‚Äôs security service can freeze transactions to verify all existing actions on them. </p><p>  Experts advise when making transactions through offshore banks and banks in central Europe, the Baltic States to have additional funds in these accounts.  The amount must be at least 10 thousand dollars.  This is necessary in order to show the financial assets of the client and exclude the possibility of blocking the operation.  When buying ETFs at Interactive Brokers, it is also necessary to generate a payment order at the bank.  It can be ordered from a representative of a financial institution. </p><h2>  Commission on operations and interest schedules </h2><p>  Commissions at Interactive Brokers are, according to customers, low.  The organization is constantly optimizing its settlement systems.  The offices of the company in carrying out various operations related to bidding and investing, can set certain commissions.  The average commission for purchasing shares through an organization is 1 dollar or 68 rubles.  It should be noted that all operations are carried out only in dollars, so the client must immediately calculate the difference in exchange rate.  This is the minimum effective rate among other brokerage companies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="regulatedbrokers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modern tools" class="if uuid-3017234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017234.jpg"></div><p>  Interactive brokers also talk about high returns when performing a large number of transactions.  The interest rate is floating, and it depends on the type of assets and the amount of funds allocated.  When investing in foreign currency, the average return on transactions with purchase and sale will be from 0.3% to 4%.  A higher yield of up to 28% per transaction will be upon purchase of various types of raw materials, stocks and options. </p><h2>  Tax reporting </h2><p>  Interactive Brokers tax returns must also be completed and submitted on time.  Otherwise, penalties will be applied to the client.  According to domestic law, a citizen must declare his income.  Investments also fall under the income from which a certain percentage is charged for payment to the budget of the Russian Federation.  In addition, the user must deduct taxes by holding accounts with foreign banks, as well as using accounts in the United States.  To simplify the regime, the preparation of the declaration, the calculation of interest in the established form, in the personal account in the "Taxes" section provides all the information about the current and current rules and calculations with government bodies. </p><p>  For Russia, it is necessary to fill out a tax return in the form of 3-personal income tax.  This can be done by connecting your personal electronic format on the official website of the institution.  Information will be provided on each currency regime and settlement systems for income received.  To do this, select the section with the income received in foreign currency, indicate the sources of payments and the countries from which the funds came.  Next, information about the amount received is filled out.          ,        . </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>    Interactive Brokers   ,        ,   .       ,     .            10   .   ,       ,   . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.benzinga.com" data-author=": Todd Shriber, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile platform" class="if uuid-3017233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3017233.jpg"></div><p>           ,       .      ,    ,          . </p>
