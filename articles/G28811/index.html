This device provides gorgeous multi-channel sound in movie mode.  An important plus is the fact that most of these devices do not hit the dirt in the face when working in stereo as an amplifier.  Now on the market there are many different devices of this type.  But the Denon receiver looks ideal in terms of price-quality ratio.  Moreover, it does not matter which model is in front of us.  Even budget devices from this manufacturer are capable of producing high-quality sound that will please both audiophiles and cinema lovers.  We will analyze the best models in more detail.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denon receivers reviews" class="if uuid-2919348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919348.jpg"></div><h2>  About Denon </h2><p>  It is worth noting immediately that the prototype of the modern Denon company appeared in Japan already in 1910.  And the company was created by no means a Japanese (which is absolutely unbelievable), but an American.  Initially, the company was engaged in the release of records with classical music.  In 1939, the Japanese bought the same profitable production and rebranded it.  Since then, the company began to be called Denon.  And she began to produce phonographs, record players and devices for recording them.  The largest radio stations in the world lined up for Denon products.  The first receiver was released in the 90s of the twentieth century.  Since then, the Denon receivers, reviews of which we will analyze a little lower, have become a real bestseller. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="denon.custhelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="denon logo black" class="if uuid-2919341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919341.jpg"></div><p>  It was Denon that released the world's first CD player.  But everyone quickly forgot about it somehow.  The palm went to such giants as Sony, Philips, Pioneer and so on.  Nevertheless, true connoisseurs of quality sound prefer the Denon technique.  The equipment from this manufacturer is able to satisfy even audiophile requests.  However, we were distracted.  Consider the devices from this manufacturer and select the best Denon receiver for home use.  Moreover, his abilities will be taken into account not only in terms of multi-channel sound, but also in stereo mode capabilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver denon" class="if uuid-2919345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919345.jpg"></div><h2>  Denon AVR-X520BT </h2><p>  The youngest model in the line of receivers from Denon.  However, this particular model boasts support for wireless interfaces and decent sound quality in both multi-channel and stereo modes.  The Denon 520 receiver has an output power of 90 watts with a resistance of 6 ohms and 70 watts with a resistance of 8 ohms.  For a budget device, this is good power.  The lower limit of the frequency range is 10 hertz, the upper one is 100,000 hertz.  Also pretty good.  You can easily connect 5.1 speakers to the unit.  Plus there is a special output for an additional subwoofer.  Although with good speakers, a separate low-frequency is not needed at all.  The receiver can work with Dolby Digital, DTS-X, DTS HD Audio and other popular audio formats.  At the same time, the device copes with the reproduction of classical musical compositions in stereo mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Receiver Features </h2><p>  The receiver "Denon AVR-X520T" has a huge number of different connectors for connecting various equipment.

Excellent performance.  You can connect a 7.1 speaker system and another additional subwoofer to the receiver.  This allows you to achieve maximum spatial sound.  The range of frequencies supported by the receiver is from 10 Hz to 100 kHz.  Very good.  You can also connect an additional speaker system from another room wirelessly to the receiver.

They also note the ease of setup of the receiver.  The user only needs to press the remote button a couple of times.  The rest of the device will do it automatically.  The owners of these receivers are also impressed with the wireless capabilities of the devices.

And this is despite the fact that even if there are distortions from the working processor of the receiver, they still can not be heard with the naked ear.  Well, not snobs?  In general, these citizens complain about the lack of stereo sound quality.  While most users do not feel anything.  Do not pay attention to the comments of such snobs.  Denon receivers provide high quality sound in any mode.  And this is an indisputable fact. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, the most popular and interesting Denon receivers were considered above.
