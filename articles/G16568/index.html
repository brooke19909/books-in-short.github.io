    <h2>  Crimea.  "Swallow's Nest": the story of creation </h2><p>  At the mention of castles, we present something grand and majestic.  The <span>legends of knights</span> and beautiful ladies who are waiting for their release are also recalled.  The history of the "Swallow's Nest" in Crimea is interesting and amazing.  Let's plunge together into the beautiful world of this place.  It will be interesting to know when the construction of this castle began?  Who lived here?  Are there any legends associated with this place?  Why is the castle so called?  And other facts related to the history of the "Swallow's Nest" in Crimea are also of interest.  Further we will try to answer in detail all of the above questions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction and the first owners </h2><p>  Curious to know when the Swallow's Nest castle was erected?  Crimean land has always attracted a large number of people.  Rich and <span>noble people</span> sought to buy a plot here at a bargain price.  There was nothing surprising in this.  Indeed, the wonderful mountain air, the endless sea, beautiful nature had a beneficial effect on the human body and well-being.  Here they built estates, built parks. </p><p>  One of the rocks especially attracted attention.  They came here to meet the dawn of the sun.  Once, one general (his name, unfortunately is unknown) came up with the idea to build a summer house here.  He called it the "Castle of Love."  Perhaps in honor of the memory of his beloved or dreams of her.  This remains a mystery.  Every day the general watched the construction of his castle and admired it.  Although it was only one-story and looked more like a summer house.  After the death of the general, the building was sold to Albert Tobin. </p>

    <h2>  Other owners </h2><p>  The next owner of the "Swallow's Nest" was a Moscow merchant - Anna Rakhmanova.  She decided to demolish the wooden buildings and erect a new stone building.  But, she soon sold the house to the German baron von Stengel.  The new owner decided to completely remodel the house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A small castle was built on the Aurora rock, which surprisingly resembled a knight's.  But, only in miniature execution.  The building was simply magnificent, however, the baron did not admire it for long.  The first world war began and he was forced to leave for Germany.  Before leaving, he sold the Swallow‚Äôs Nest to the wealthy merchant Pavel Shelaputin, who opened a restaurant here.  But there was a war, and there were few people who wanted to have fun in such a difficult time.  Therefore, the restaurant did not exist for long and was soon closed. </p><p>  After several earthquakes, the building was declared damaged and closed for a while.  After carrying out restoration work, they began to conduct fascinating excursions. </p>

    <h2>  Title </h2><p>  Everyone who plans to visit the Swallow‚Äôs Nest in Crimea, the history of the name will also be interesting. </p><p>  Many of the questions that tourists have here immediately find their answers.  When you first see the castle, an association arises that it is just as attached to the rock, like a <span>nest of a swallow</span> on the wall of a house.  Moreover, the dimensions of this building are very small.  Which also emphasizes the resemblance to a bird house.  Its width is only ten meters and a length of twenty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But, and that's not all.  Once upon a time, a section of a high cliff, from which the sea was perfectly visible, was chosen by swallows for its housing.  Hence the name of this place. </p>
