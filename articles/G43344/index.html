  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sciences about the world and its development</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost from the first stages of the origin of human life on Earth, a person‚Äôs contact with the outside world took place.  People became interested in the <span>origin of the universe</span> and its development.  Initially, this area was a mystery to them, sometimes scaring or causing delight.  Over time, there were sciences about the world that were engaged in its study and the study of the phenomena that occur in it. </p><p>  The terrain, abysses, mountains and volcanoes terrified people and aroused curiosity.  Every year a person accumulated knowledge about what surrounds him.  Thus, a modern picture of the world developed.  All knowledge about the surrounding reality from year to year was classified and divided into certain categories.  So there was a science about the world. </p><p>  The development of technical means allowed a more thorough study of space, nature and other components of the environment. </p><p>  At each stage, new data appears that change people's perception of what is happening around us.  Therefore, the sciences about the world undergo constant changes and contain information specific to this era.  Many obscure facts cease to be a mystery to humanity. </p><p>  This can be traced on the basis of people's knowledge of the <span>structure of the universe.</span>  Initially, they represented it in the form of an island that was surrounded by water.  The sky was considered a dome with a solid surface on which heavenly bodies are present.  The bowels of the Earth were considered the kingdom of dead people, and the space outside the dome - the abode of the gods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such ideas about the environment today seem ridiculous.  But at that time, people did not have the opportunity to study it more thoroughly.  The knowledge gained later changed the sciences of the world around us.  People began to put forward versions that the Earth has a round shape.  Then these hypotheses were confirmed in practice. </p><p>  Humanity is engaged in a comprehensive study of the world.  Biology considers all living organisms that exist on the planet.  This science is divided into several areas.  Botany studies the plant world in all its diversity.  Zoology studies the animal world.  Anatomy is the science of the structure of man.  In turn, each of these areas is divided into smaller categories. </p><p>  Other sciences study all aspects of the world around us.  Cosmos and the Universe are the most unexplored area.  Technical progress does not yet allow to fully study this issue.  Therefore, science is in constant development. </p><p>  The bowels of the earth are also studied by people.  Here, a person acts as a consumer, and therefore is looking for new opportunities for resource extraction. </p><p>  The oceans also belong to objects that are still not fully understood. </p><p>  <span>Natural phenomena</span> cause no less interest.  Some facts from modern life have differences with existing ideas about the world.  Scientists around the world are studying the <span>abnormal phenomena</span> occurring around.  Thus, a new idea is emerging about what surrounds us. </p><p>  A picture of the world is information about all its components and their properties. </p><p>  In humans, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnature and its functions is formed not only on the basis of technically obtained information.  The <span>sensory organs</span> play an important role here <span>.</span>  It is with their help that we receive initial information that is supplemented or refuted with the help of instruments.  This is the practical side of knowledge about the surrounding reality. </p><p>  The picture of the world will constantly change as you study all the components that are present in it.  Therefore, the science of the world will be updated and supplemented by new information and facts.  Mankind gradually learns that which was previously inaccessible, and makes new discoveries. </p>
