It is inevitable, and you just need to come to terms with the fact that it gets on the lenses.  Of course, many other substances, such as goggle fingerprints, food debris, or something else can end up on all equipment.  Here are some important tips that will tell you how to clean the camera and how to wipe the camera‚Äôs lens. </p><p>  A little dust on the front of the glass can be harmless and even invisible in photographs.  Nevertheless, a large number of particles on both sides will stand out much more.  Of course, it is necessary to clean the glass only in case of emergency.  Below are some tips that will tell you how to wipe the camera‚Äôs lens. </p><h2>  What to use? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lensrentals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wipe the lens" class="if uuid-3185420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185420.jpg"></div><p>  If dust or a stain to be cleaned is noticed, methods should be used in the following order to minimize the risk of exacerbating the problem.  So, how to wipe the camera lens? </p><ul><li>  blower; </li><li>  lens brush; </li><li>  cloth or pre-moistened wipes; </li><li>  cleaning fluid. </li></ul><p>  Consider the intricacies of applying each method individually. </p><h2>  Blower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.adorama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="than wipe" class="if uuid-3185416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185416.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, try to clean the lens using a blower.  Since it is unlikely to exacerbate the problem.  If there is dust on the lens, sometimes a quick puff on the blower will be the only thing that can clean it without damage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A natural instinct may be to simply use your own breath, but you should avoid this, since this action can cause saliva and condensation to get on the lens, no matter how careful the person is. </p><p>  Advice: </p><ol><li>  It is worth using a blower before any other cleaning method. </li><li>  First you need to clean the device itself from potential dust.  This is very easy to do, just take a few puffs away from the lens. </li><li>  And also when working, it is necessary to keep the blower very close to the lens, without touching it, to prevent air particles from entering the glass. </li></ol><p>  Prohibitions: </p><ol><li>  Do not use your mouth, as there is a risk of saliva and condensation getting on the lens. </li><li>  No need to use air compressors - they can pass oil. </li><li>  Do not use freon cylinders - they become a cause of condensation. </li><li>  And also there is no need to save money and buy a small fan.  Inevitably, you will have to return to a larger one that works better and is easier to use. </li></ol><h2>  Lens brush </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.adorama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lens and lens" class="if uuid-3185425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185425.jpg"></div><p>  If the blower does not do its job, use a brush.  The tips of the brushes that are sold in stores today are made of various materials, but camel hair is a popular choice because thin, soft hair helps prevent damage.  It is her most often advised by those who are interested in how to wipe the camera‚Äôs lens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main reason why brushes are more dangerous than a blower is because foreign substances sometimes lie between the bristles, if you act carelessly.  Do not touch the brush with your fingers, this will prevent sebum from entering.  And you also need to make sure that the brush is kept closed or packed - so it stays clean longer.  Fats are difficult to remove from lenses, but they are even more difficult to remove from a contaminated brush. </p><p>  The original brush was popularized by the LensPen brand.  It is equipped with a brush that extends for use and retracts.  The other end is a carbon-impregnated polishing tip designed to clean sweat marks without damaging the lens.  Many competitors of the company now also produce a similar product. </p><p>  Advice: </p><ol><li>  Not sure how to wipe the camera lens at home?  Use a brush with soft, fine bristles to avoid scratches.  Camel hair is a great option, but if you need to urgently remove pollution, you can use any natural brush for makeup or even paints. </li><li>  The lens surface must be cleaned carefully to remove dust particles, but not scratch the glass. </li><li>  After use, close the brush to prevent contamination. </li></ol><p>  Prohibitions: </p><ol><li>  No need to press the bristles to the surface of the lens. </li><li>  Do not touch the bristles with your fingers or anything other than the lens. </li></ol><h2>  Cleaning fluid </h2><p>  The most effective (and dirty) option to remove all excess from the lens is a spray bottle of cleaning fluid.  Like pre-moistened wipes, as a rule, it is made on an alcohol basis, which can clean the lens surface without streaks and evaporate quickly to protect equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Bottles with cleaning fluid are usually sold in volumes of 150, 200 and 250 milliliters and cost from 100 to 400 rubles per bottle.  This product can be used in conjunction with cleaning cloths or microfiber cloth.  Face tissues should be avoided, as they can cause scratches. </p><p>  Some people do not like this method, because glass sometimes becomes ‚Äústriped‚Äù.  In addition, you must use clothes for cleaning, which is not a pity to mess.  Nevertheless, the first problem, as a rule, can be combated by re-applying the cleaning fluid and rubbing the surface again. </p><p>  Advice: </p><ol><li>  Always use dust removal material such as lens wipes. </li><li>  It is also necessary to use only a cleaning fluid made from denatured alcohol. </li></ol><p>  Before wiping the camera lens, you need to consider the prohibitions: </p><ol><li>  Do not spray liquid directly over the surface, as liquid may enter the lens. </li><li>  Do not use detergents or water - this can make the problem worse. </li></ol><h2>  How to clean the camera lens from fingerprints? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thetechrun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wipe the camera lens" class="if uuid-3185417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185417.jpg"></div><p>  Paper towels are a safe and inexpensive option for updating lenses.  Each sheet costs about 5 rubles.  Since a person uses them once and then throws them away, this ensures that the material is clean and can be safely applied. </p><p>  But how to wipe the camera lens from fingerprints?  Microfiber cleaning wipes have been developed for this.  This is a truly effective way to clean stains.  These napkins will cost an average of 1-8 rubles, but there are also more expensive - it all depends on the brand.  Microfiber wipes are more expensive than conventional wipes and are designed to be used for a long time before they are thrown away or washed.  Therefore, this tool will fit even better if the question is how to clean the lens of the camera from prints. </p><p>  One of the main disadvantages is the following: grease or dirt that needs to be cleaned is likely to remain on the lens.  In addition, repeated use creates the risk of something getting on the cloth, and subsequently on the lens, which may leave a scratch on it.  Between use, they should be stored in a plastic bag to prevent further contamination. </p><p>  Advice </p><ol><li>  You need to process the fabric in circles, starting from the center of the lens. </li><li>  Store the cloth in a plastic bag to prevent contamination. </li></ol><p>  Prohibitions: </p><ol><li>  Do not wash them with a fabric softener, as it can leave chemicals on the fabric, which will subsequently ruin the lens. </li><li>  No need to use a T-shirt, tissue paper or paper towels to clean the lenses. </li></ol><h2>  Pre-Wet Wipes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.premiumbeat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wipe at home" class="if uuid-3185421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185421.jpg"></div><p>  Alcohol in wipes helps to destroy and clean stains.  They are usually sold in boxes of 100-200 pieces for 200-300 rubles.  This can be convenient if you keep several napkins in the bag for the camera.  They are disposable, therefore safer and more convenient than the previous version. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lensrentals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wipe the camera" class="if uuid-3185422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185422.jpg"></div><p>  If you use a blower, brush, wipes, or liquid detergent to clean the lenses, this should solve most dust problems.  For any really persistent soiling, contact a professional to prevent damage to expensive equipment. </p><p>  If the problem with dust was not formed on the lens, but on the sensor, it is also worth contacting a local specialist.  No one should ever try to solve this problem at home.  The glass on the lenses is strong enough to be processed independently, but the sensors are incredibly sensitive to scratches and can become dust magnets. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.deqto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wipe the camera" class="if uuid-3185426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3185426.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth remembering that the state of camera lenses is one of the main factors affecting image quality.  Clean lenses help you get crisp, high-quality photos.  In addition, for obvious reasons, they will last longer than dirty glass. </p><p>  We hope that this article answered readers the question of how to wipe the lens of a SLR camera. </p>
