  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Nevsky": reviews, descriptions, layouts, pros and cons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Think about what each of us needs to be happy.  In this case, we are not talking about simple spiritual values.  You must admit that it is difficult to enjoy every day, to look into the future with enthusiasm, without having your own angle.  The housing issue has always been a problem for the inhabitants of our country, but at present it is especially acute for the majority.  The market economy excludes the possibility of obtaining square meters as an incentive for many years of work in favor of the state, respectively, you will have to earn your own apartment for your apartment. </p><p>  If we talk about the real estate market of the capital, there really are a lot of offers, all areas of Moscow and the region are being built up.  Modern residential complexes are well-thought-out layouts, excellent location, but the apartments in them are godlessly expensive.  That is why Muscovites are so demanding and attentive to the choice of the complex, considering all the options without exception.  This time, a rather interesting project came to our attention - LCD "Nevsky".  Reviews about it are ambiguous, contradictory, so making a review becomes even more interesting. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  LCD "Nevsky" (Moscow) is a unique comfort class project in the north-west of the capital.  Connoisseurs of modern architecture will definitely appreciate the concept that the developer took as a basis: the buildings are finished in the best traditions of the marine style.  White walls made of durable and effective porcelain stoneware harmoniously combine with stained glass glazing of slightly curved walls, creating the illusion of a sailboat rushing along the waves.  At one glance at the complex, there is a feeling of the proximity of the sea, the sun: here you really want to stay for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd nevsky reviews" class="if uuid-3056859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056859.jpg"></div><p>  The project provides for the construction of 8 multi-story residential buildings on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã4.5 hectares.  Brick-monolithic technology was chosen for construction, which guarantees strength, reliability and external aesthetics at the same time.  The commissioning of the facility is scheduled for the 4th quarter of 2019, thousands of qualified specialists will work on it. </p><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  Photos of the residential complex "Nevsky" clearly demonstrate the splendor of the project, its exclusivity.  But for the objectivity of the review, I would like to say a few words about those technologies that formed the basis of construction, increasing the level of comfort for each resident.  High-speed low-noise elevators, as well as a single air conditioning system will be installed in each building.  The territory of the complex will be fenced, equipped with a round-the-clock video surveillance system, and entry and entry to it will be carried out using an electronic pass system.  All communications and equipment will work automatically, under the control of the dispatcher. </p><p>  It is planned to use modern materials and technologies in the decoration that provide external aesthetics and durability of the coating at the same time. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  When choosing a new building for yourself and your family, be sure to pay attention to the company that leads the project, because it depends on its reputation that your expectations will be justified.  So, the developer of the residential complex "Nevsky" is the concern "KROST".  This construction company is known to all Muscovites, on its account hundreds of successfully implemented projects.  Attention to detail, the use of advanced technologies and innovations is what is characteristic of complexes from this developer.  The reviews confirm that at the moment it is one of the largest companies in the capital, which you can really trust. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lookuprealty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Nevsky builder" class="if uuid-3056861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056861.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The success of the construction largely depends not only on technology, concept, but also on the chosen place.  What interesting can offer LCD "Nevsky"?  Reviews emphasize how successful the location of the project is: it is being built within walking distance from the Vodny Stadion metro station, just 600 meters from the Leningradskoye Shosse.  You will be pleasantly surprised by the internal, already formed infrastructure of the district, represented by commercial and sports venues, social facilities and even the beach.  Thus, living on the territory of Moscow, everyone will receive the delights of suburban life.  In general, the Voikovsky district is a dream of many, it is literally immersed in the greenery of parks, squares, it is quite quiet and calm here, and if necessary, you can get to any point of the capital as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Nevsky construction progress" class="if uuid-3056870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056870.jpg"></div><p>  North-Western Administrative District was chosen for construction not by accident: at present, it is quite large, even huge areas are empty.  And all because in the Soviet years there was a huge industrial zone with enterprises and factories.  Today, thanks to modern materials, unique technologies, it is possible to make this territory suitable for living.  Yes, and attracts the accessibility of the area, its proximity to the central part of the city and the simultaneous remoteness from it.  If you had the opportunity to live in the Voykovsky district, you are visiting here, you probably have managed to appreciate all its advantages.  And now you can buy your dream apartment here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Reviews of the residential complex "Nevsky" could not but touch on the topic of ecology, which is so relevant for all the capital's new buildings.  Many are frightened by their proximity to industrial enterprises, urban landfills, the concentration of which in the North-West Administrative District is overwhelming, but all measurements and studies carried out did not reveal any deviations from the norm.  Residents of areas adjacent to the construction site indicate the absence of industrial enterprises, respectively, of harmful emissions, extraneous odors.  In addition, the complex is surrounded by parks, squares, the developer has provided for the improvement and landscaping of the surrounding area, so fresh air is guaranteed to every resident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Nevsky photo" class="if uuid-3056876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056876.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  If your family does not have a personal car, you get to all points of the capital by public transport, the question of its availability rises to a rather significant place.  What can boast LCD "Nevsky"?  Reviews of residents and those who personally managed to visit the facility, focus on a good location.  Indeed, to the nearest metro station - just 10 minutes at a calm pace.  In the immediate vicinity of the new building lies one of the main thoroughfares of the capital - Leningradskoye Shosse, which guarantees an abundance of ground transportation routes: minibuses, buses and even trams.  Not all residents of the capital can boast of such a variety of options for moving. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you want to buy an apartment in the area with the existing infrastructure, definitely look at the Nevsky residential complex.  The reviews confirm that within walking distance from the complex are social facilities: kindergartens, schools and even the best universities in the country.  Medical services can be obtained in the district clinic of a rather high level. </p><p>  The developer made every effort to increase the level of comfort for residents, having thought through his own infrastructure of the project.  The first floors of all eight buildings will be reserved for restaurants, shops, bank branches, service organizations.  A rather large shopping and entertainment complex will appear on the territory of the complex, where it will be possible to spend a weekend in the company of friends and relatives. </p><p>  Of course, every potential buyer of an apartment in the Nevsky residential complex is interested in the availability of parking spaces.  So, the construction company was able to foresee this feature: it offered an underground parking for 288 cars, which should fully satisfy the existing need. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zastroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Nevsky layout" class="if uuid-3056881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056881.jpg"></div><p>  Modern <span>residential complexes</span> impress with their scope and attention to detail: finally, during the design, great attention is paid to the layouts.  Agree, some time ago, most of us lived in standard apartments, small-sized and completely uncomfortable.  Today, everyone can buy a dream apartment, where they can use and organize every square meter of space. </p><p>  Planning LCD Nevsky represented a sufficient variety of options.  Here you will find a small cozy studio and a large four-room apartment for a large friendly family.  Especially popular are the so-called European layouts, combining the kitchen and living areas in a single space.  The spacious bathrooms are impressive, as well as the presence of dressing rooms for storing things and household utensils. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zastroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lc nevsky reviews of residents" class="if uuid-3056874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056874.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The progress of the construction of the Nevsky residential complex is a rather urgent topic, because everyone wants to drop into their new apartment on time, without the slightest delay.  So, the developer not only regularly informs his tenants about all stages of work, but also offers the opportunity to personally visit the facility and evaluate the efficiency and quality of the materials used.  If you believe the reviews, the work goes smoothly, in concert, do not cause any complaints and complaints. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rmetr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Nevsky Moscow" class="if uuid-3056862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3056862.jpg"></div><p>  Architecture is a feature of the project, its main distinguishing feature, feature.  The appearance of the cases is really breathtaking, I want to consider every little thing, every element, as the reviews indicate.  You have no doubt: you will not find anything like it in all of Moscow.  Buyers also attributed the picturesque surroundings to the advantages of the project.  From the windows of the apartments of the residential complex "Nevsky" offers stunning views of the Khimki reservoir and the numerous parks of the area.  There is a complete feeling that you live in the middle of the forest, surrounded by lush, fresh greenery. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  At the moment, construction is in full swing, respectively, there is still the opportunity to purchase the long-awaited square meters with significant savings.  The developer cooperates with the largest banks, so that a mortgage can be issued on the most favorable terms.  Moreover, only now you can make an installment purchase, excluding overpayments.  If you are still in doubt, be sure to visit the facility in order to personally evaluate it and make sure of a set of obvious advantages. </p>
