Basically, many come here in order to improve their health in sanatoriums.  Also, lovers of beach and outdoor activities will feel very comfortable here.  The favorite budget place was the village.  Andreevka (Crimea), which is part of the northern Nakhimovsky district of the city of Sevastopol.  This settlement is located on the southwest <span>coast of the Crimean</span> peninsula.  Throughout the coastline there are various holiday homes, pensions, campsites and parking lots. </p><h2>  Briefly about the village </h2><p>  The first thing I would like to tell tourists is where the village is located.  It is located near Sevastopol, only 30 km.  This location is convenient enough for those who come to this place not only from the peninsula, but also from the mainland.  Between the village and the city regular transport links are established.  And this, in turn, allows vacationers to move freely, both on buses and on boats. </p><p>  Andreevka (Crimea) has very good reviews, because it is located in an ecologically clean area.  In the north, the settlement is located between Cape Lukull and Tyubek, and in the south of the village is Cape Margopulo. </p><p>  The infrastructure is developed here, which pleases tourists.  This is a well-maintained beach with water activities, mini-markets, pharmacies, exchange offices, shops, a post office, a large green park with a variety of Crimean trees and shrubs. </p><p>  In the evening, <span>holidays in Andreevka</span> (Crimea) are diversified by incendiary beach discos and cafe-bars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
