    <p>  In the factory delivery kit, the user will find the device itself, a headset (regular, wired), a power supply, a USB cable, as well as 4 spare rear panels.  All are of different colors.  There is, for example, black, with which the phone can be turned into a kind of modification of Highscreen Omega Prime S Black.  There are white as well as red and yellow.  Above, we have already noted the fact that "multi-colored" is one of the main attributes of Highscreen Omega Prime S. An instruction manual is also attached to the factory kit of the device.  As well as the warranty card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design, management </h2><p>  As evidenced by the reviews left on thematic portals by Highscreen Omega Prime S users, the phone has a quite ordinary, but at the same time nice design.  Multi-colored panels look, according to smartphone owners, quite worthy.  Many note the grace of a thin body - 6.9 mm (for comparison: the previous model has a Mini, this figure was 7.8 mm).  Lightness and small dimensions of the device, which determine the comfort of wearing it, are also noted. </p><p>  The color sockets included in the kit are marked as completely immune to fingerprints, while at the same time pleasant to the touch, not slipping out.  The design of the front panel of the smartphone includes an elegant plastic border.  The display of the device is reliably protected by a layer of durable polymer material.  The reviews left by Highscreen Omega Prime S users include extremely positive reviews of the build quality of the smartphone.  There are no backlashes, creaks, gaps. </p>

    <p>  On the front of the device there is an additional camera, next to it are light and movement sensors (proximity), as well as a voice speaker.  Directly below the screen is the "Home" button, it has a round shape.  To the right and to the left of it are the "Return" and "Menu" keys.  On the left side of the case is the volume control key.  On the right side - similar, but only she is responsible for turning on the power.  The microphone is at the bottom of the case.  At the top there is an audio jack, as well as a slot for connecting via microUSB.  At the back is the main camera with flash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you remove the back panel, you can see two slots for SIM-cards.  With simultaneous connection, at least one of them will work in 2G mode.  Near the slots for SIM cards - slot for connecting an additional microSD memory card.  The phone‚Äôs assembly features allow you to insert additional memory modules and change SIM cards without turning off the power of the device. </p><p>  Design, as well as the main components of device management, are generally highly appreciated by experts and users.  Replaceable panels are easy to insert and replace.  No gaps and backlashes upon the installation of new ones are observed. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  As we said above, the diagonal of the display is 4.7 inches, which is quite an average indicator.  But, as evidenced by the reviews left by the owners of Highscreen Omega Prime S, the screen size is quite optimal.  From the point of view of design, the display looks very elegant against the background of the dark color of the front panel, they can be said to merge into a single element.  The screen resolution is high enough for the specified diagonal - 720 by 128 pixels.  The density of dots is also decent - 312 ppi.  With this indicator, pixelation is almost invisible. </p><p>  Smartphone Highscreen Omega Prime S is equipped with a display with a high-tech matrix using IPS technology, its quality is estimated by experts as high.  When viewing the screen at an angle, the image quality hardly changes.  There is support for multi-touch (up to 5 touches), the sensitivity of the sensor is estimated by experts as excellent.  You can manually adjust the brightness of the display backlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery in the smartphone has a capacity of 1750 mAh.  This is slightly more than in the Mini model, technologically preceding the Highscreen Omega Prime S. The characteristics of the device, however, are not quite optimal for the battery capabilities, as some experts note.  In particular, the chipset installed in the device is quite energy-consuming. </p><p>  Tests conducted by experts have shown that when using the phone for 6-7 hours, the battery may run out.  Within this period, you can manage to talk about half an hour, about 120 minutes to use the Internet.  However, the smartphone withstands the test of playing music. </p>

    <p>  If you use the device only in player mode, the battery lasts about 30 hours.  Some experts who compiled a review of the capabilities of the Highscreen Omega Prime S review recorded a figure of 40 hours of battery life when playing music (though with the display turned off).  If you watch only videos at maximum brightness settings, high resolution and loud sound, the battery life will be about 2 hours.  If you run demanding 3D games on your smartphone, then the battery can drain in about 1.5 hours.  Users who left feedback after testing Highscreen Omega Prime S reviews generally achieved similar results in a study of the device‚Äôs battery performance. </p>

    <p>  Some experts believe that insufficient battery life can also be associated with a relatively large display and its corresponding resolution, as well as brightness and high contrast of the screen.  In many similar devices, a higher level of autonomy, experts say, is largely achieved by equipping devices with lower-quality, sometimes technologically obsolete displays.  The Russian brand "Vobis" chose a different path, deciding not to save on screens.  And this, as many IT experts believe, is the right decision. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The smartphone can work in 2G and 3G networks (but with the simultaneous connection of two SIM cards - only in the first mode).  There is support for basic wireless communication standards - Bluetoot, Wi-Fi.  You can use the device as a modem or Wi-FI router. </p>

    <p>  The quality of GSM voice communication, mobile Internet with the appropriate signal level in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mobile operator is excellent.  The work of wireless modules is characterized by experts and users on the positive side - Wi-Fi connection is not interrupted, the connection is established quickly. </p><p>  There is GPS support - the quality of the corresponding module is estimated by experts as excellent.  Many users also expressed pleasant surprise at this fact - usually smartphones are not characterized by sufficiently high-quality support for GPS-communication.  The device quite easily detects several satellites at once and establishes a connection with them. </p><h2>  Memory resources </h2><p>  The Highscreen Omega Prime S is equipped with, as we have already noted, 1 GB of RAM.  Of these, about 500 MB are actually available.  Built-in flash memory - 8 GB, actually available - about 3.9 GB for files and about 2 - for programs.  It is possible to increase the amount of memory due to additional modules in microSD format.  The device recognizes inserted cards without any problems. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Like many other devices of this class, this smartphone is equipped with two cameras - the main and front.  The first has a resolution of 8 megapixels, the second - 2. Taken with Highscreen Omega Prime S photo and video - decent quality.  Some experts and users consider the quality of multimedia content created by the smartphone mediocre.  However, as their opponents note, you need to look not so much at the actual result shown by a particular device as at its class.  And therefore, if we compare, then with analogues.  And in this regard, the smartphone looks quite competitive. </p><p>  Clips from the camera can be recorded at a speed of 25 frames / second.  Video is recorded in a 3GP file, recognized on most other mobile devices, as well as on a computer.  The audio codec records the stream as 96 kbps, a single-channel audio format of 16 kHz is used.  The main camera is equipped with autofocus and flash.  From the point of view of hardware functionality, all declared options work efficiently. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The smartphone chipset, as we have already said, is a Snapdragon type MSM8212.  The processor that the device is equipped with is a high-performance Cortex-A7 with four cores, made using 28 nm technology.  The frequency of the chip is 1.2 GHz.  A video accelerator is of the type Adreno 302. The work in the program interface goes smoothly, does not freeze even during operations involving a high load on the processor and memory. </p><p>  Modern games in general are also loaded without significant inhibitions.  True, as some experts note, the quality of the graphics is not the most ideal - the detail of the picture is not too high.  Experts emphasize the fact that the device is not subject to heat when the processor is heavily loaded.  The device‚Äôs performance tests conducted by experts using applications such as Antutu and the like have shown decent results. </p><p>  However, tests of the video subsystem - such as 3DMark - showed very modest results.  In principle, this correlates with the fact we noted above about the low quality of game graphics.  However, the performance of the chipset is not subject to doubt, experts say.  Snapdragon, as you know, is also used by the world's leading manufacturers of smartphones, including those sold in more expensive segments. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The firmware installed on Highscreen Omega Prime S is Android OS in version 4.2.2.  Branded add-ons in the OS are practically absent.  Before us is Andriod in its purest form.  Among the useful pre-installed programs are a media player and an interface for listening to radio programs. </p>

    <p>  Experts and users note the convenience of using the relevant applications, as well as high sound quality.  There is support for music files in MP3 and FLAC formats.  There is also a pre-installed video player, as well as an application for viewing photos.  The device can play videos of types MP3, 3GP, as well as MKV.  When working with web pages, there are also no freezes and crashes. </p><p>  A full-time browser (probably, like those that can be installed additionally - modern developers of the corresponding programs have long created mobile versions of their products) works fine - both "heavy" pages and videos are loaded, including in the mode of working with a large number of bookmarks. </p>

    <p>  You can download additional programs for the device in the Google Play application store, on a similar resource from Yandex and other aggregators.  Software for Android, as you know, is almost always represented in the widest range of solutions in a wide variety of categories.  New applications are installed on the smartphone quickly enough, they run without significant "braking" and freezes. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We studied the main features of the Highscreen Omega Prime S smartphone. Our review, however, will be incomplete without conclusions.  Among the indisputable advantages of the device, which experts and users note - elegant design, slim body, ease of operation.  Many praise the screen, the high sensitivity of the matrix. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs performance is highly appreciated, even to the detriment of the autonomy of the work, which, of course, is relatively modest.  However, in separate modes, such as, for example, playing music, the battery shows quite decent results. </p><p>  Many users are also impressed by the financial aspect of the acquisition of Highscreen Omega Prime S. The price of the device is quite affordable - about 8 thousand rubles.  Amid many competing solutions, the cost is quite attractive.  Of course, combined with the quality and performance of the device. </p><p>  Naturally, the "diversity" of the smartphone also played a role in shaping a positive opinion about the device.  The fact that the user has at their disposal a whole range of phones - Highscreen Omega Prime S Black, and even White, Yellow or Red, predetermines extremely positive reviews regarding this design approach. </p><p>  The phone, experts say, as well as many users, can be very competitive in its segment, even though the latter includes real giants of the industry of scale - Samsung and Sony.  At the same time, the Russian brand, according to experts, does not at all try to squeeze world brands - the goal of the Vobis company is to create its own narrow niche of devices that combine practicality, a pleasant design and build quality. </p>
