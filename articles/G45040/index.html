  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LED floodlight 12 volts: types, characteristics, application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the segment of lighting equipment today you can find solutions for a variety of tasks.  Energy-saving and durable LED spotlights occupy a special place, combining physical reliability and practicality in maintenance.  Typically, representatives of this group are characterized as powerful devices that require a high voltage for their operation of 220-380 V. But for some tasks, you may also need a 12-volt LED spotlight, which also provides optimal dispersion in the target zone at a low energy consumption. </p><h2>  Device device </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bocawebcam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Spotlight" class="if uuid-2272110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272110.jpg"></div><p>  A distinctive feature of a searchlight as such is the presence of a reflector or group of lenses that form a diffused or narrowly directed light flux.  The light source is a lamp.  In this case, a design with an LED crystal is considered.  The advantages of an LED over <span>halogen lamps</span> include small size, low heat transfer and a high service life. </p><p>  Again, with a sufficiently high power source can spend modest amounts of energy, which makes the use of such devices more justified financially.  Some designs include regulatory elements.  These are <span>LED luminaires</span> with dimmers that allow you to adjust the focus and brightness in accordance with specific radiation requirements.  Also, the case itself can be rotated in a certain direction - the adjustment ranges are determined by the design of the supporting bracket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.auraglow.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED floodlight with motion sensor" class="if uuid-2272112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272112.jpg"></div><p>  Power and voltage are the main operating parameters that determine the power requirements.  In particular, the 12-volt LED floodlight represents the initial group with minimal energy potential.  Such models can be connected to a 220 V network, however, for the safe and efficient operation of the device, a special converter is required.  As for power, its range is quite wide - from 10 to 200 watts.  But it is precisely the 12 V models that rarely have a lighting fixture of more than 50 watts. </p><p>  An important characteristic is the luminous flux.  It depends on the same power and can reach 500 Lux (Lx).  This value is taken into account when calculating the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlight coverage.  According to experts, 1 lx is required per 1 m <sup>2</sup> .  On average, a 30 W LED floodlight is capable of serving one room.  It is recommended to provide working areas or outdoor areas with several spotlights that spread light from different directions. </p><h2>  Protective qualities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunstore.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="30W LED floodlight" class="if uuid-2272107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272107.jpg"></div><p>  Searchlight lighting is traditionally used on the street, so its enclosures are endowed with special insulators.  Also, construction materials are selected based on the requirements for lamp protection and electrical communications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The capabilities of the shell can be judged by the marking, which indicates the security class.  The most common 12-volt LED spotlight with IP44 index.  This means that the design will not allow penetration of solid particles and water spray under the housing.  More reliable models with IP54 class are also protected from dust, and IP65 floodlights are endowed with complex insulators, from all directions protecting from jets of water, dust and dirt. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.solarledlights.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED floodlight street" class="if uuid-2272109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272109.jpg"></div><p>  On the market you can find models of stationary and portable type.  The former are designed for continuous use in one place.  The body has a special support that can be rigidly fixed to different surfaces.  Mounting is carried out once and, as a rule, is not removable.  However, the working part of the design with deflectors and a lamp can be rotated, directing the light flux.  It is important to note that the power supply of LED spotlights in this case is network - as a rule, with an adapter of 12-220 V, that is, at the place of operation of the equipment it is necessary to arrange electrical wiring. </p><p>  Portable or mobile models do not require a fixed installation.  The case is placed on a stable platform, and in case of a change in place does not require dismantling manipulations.  As for the power supply system, both batteries and a socket for generator equipment can be used as a source.  The most practical and convenient to use is a rechargeable LED floodlight, which is small in size.  But it needs to be charged before the working session, not forgetting that the potential of the supply unit is limited in time. </p><h2>  Fields of application </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixelmari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="12 Volt Garden Spotlight" class="if uuid-2272108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272108.jpg"></div><p>  Modern LED-spotlights find their place in the industry and in the domestic sphere, as well as in solving specialized problems.  With their help they illuminate construction sites, garages, storage rooms and work sites. </p><p>  In private households, a 12-volt LED spotlight is also used as a decoration tool.  The same possibilities of directing light allow volumetric illumination of architectural objects, garden plantings and critical functional structures.  Specialized models are used in lighting concert stages, stadiums, highways and airfields. </p><h2>  What to consider in the choice? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nawazsharif.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="12V LED Floodlight" class="if uuid-2272111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272111.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the basic set of operational parameters, attention should be paid to the type of cap and control system.  A special LED socket is used for LEDs, although there are also R7s adapters, which allow integrating halogen lamps if necessary. </p><p>  The control system today allows the use of motion sensors along with basic <span>brightness controls</span> .  If you use a group of small LED spotlights at 10 watts, then it is quite possible to limit yourself to one sensitive element.  For example, ultrasonic or infrared sensors will automatically record the host's approach at a distance of 5-15 m, giving a command to turn on the controlled spotlights. </p><h2>  Lamp connection </h2><p>  At the time of work, the electricity in the connected line must be disconnected.  If the spotlight is installed in a structure made of PVC, metal or wood, then screws or brackets should be screwed into it to fix the cable. </p><p>  Next, the terminal box of the device opens, after which you can proceed with the connection.  As a rule, LED lamps are connected through their own contactors to the phase clamp, neutral and ground - respectively, the circuits are marked as L, N and E. If there is electrical tape on the wiring, you can do without grounding. </p><p>  At the final stage, the terminal bolts are tightened, the box closes and the work of the searchlight under voltage is checked. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.toolstop.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="12V LED floodlight with motion sensor" class="if uuid-2272113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2272113.jpg"></div><p>  Low-power LED floodlights are an unusual category of lighting fixtures.  Features are expressed in many technical and operational properties and parameters, but from the point of view of the average user, the main thing in this sense is the optimal combination of reliability, ergonomics and functionality.  For example, a 30 W LED floodlight can be considered as a universal solution for both home and garden. </p><p>  Also, do not ignore the new lighting control systems.  The searchlight can be integrated into the overall control infrastructure of the house, which will allow you to easily use all the features of the equipment with the regulation of radiation properties and additional options for changing the position of the housing.  To this, it is worth adding schemes of group operation of several devices with control from one remote point. </p>
