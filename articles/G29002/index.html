They have a certain form, weight, dignity (face value).  Typically, coins were made and are made by minting to give them the shape of a regular circle. </p><p>  In Russian history, the word ‚Äúcoin‚Äù came during the reign of Peter I. It was taken from the Polish language.  In turn, the word migrated to Poland from the Latin "moneta", which meant "mint", "warning". </p><h2>  A Brief History of Coins </h2><p>  The ancient Romans associated the word "coin" with the goddess Juno, since the temple of this celestial woman, in the city of Rome, was one of the oldest ancient mints. </p><p>  Ancient Greek legends claim that the mythical heroes were the inventors of the coins.  The ancient inhabitants of Rome assured: the gods Janus and Saturn invented metal banknotes.  Based on the content of the stories about the life of the Olympians, the very first coins depicting a two-faced god and a ship's nose were minted by Janus, devoting them to Saturn, who arrived in Italy from Crete. </p><p>  The very word "coin" in ancient Roman - "adviser", "warning." </p><p>  With this word they called the goddess Juno, the wife of Jupiter.  She is also known for warning the inhabitants of Rome of impending troubles.  Archaeologists have established that it was at the Temple of Juno (the Roman Capitol) that workshops worked, minting and casting coins from metal. </p><h2>  Oldest coin </h2><p>  Currently, the oldest coin is considered to be a stater.  It is made of an alloy containing silver and gold.  There is only one image on it - a roaring lion.  The reverse is smooth.  Such coins are found among the ruins in Palestine.  Their circulation in these parts is not accidental, since it was here that one of the centers of trade of that time was located.  The age of the oldest statier is estimated at approximately 3200 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="samogoo.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The oldest coin is statir" class="if uuid-3190191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190191.jpg"></div><p>  This money was in circulation for a very long time: from the 5th century BC to the 1st century, it is already our era.  They were used in ancient Lydia and Greece, as well as among the Celtic tribes. </p><h2>  The most expensive pre-revolutionary Russian coin </h2><p>  What is the most expensive coin in tsarist Russia?  It is considered silver, worth one ruble, dated 1705.  It has another name - "Polish thaler."  In the difficult period of the beginning of the reign of Peter I, Russia experienced a lack of silver for minting coins, which she really needed for reforms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vilingstore.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polish thaler" class="if uuid-3190474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190474.jpg"></div><p>  At this time, by order of the king, silver coins were put into circulation, the source metal for which (silver) was brought from abroad.  Their design is very similar to the thaler of Poland from 1630.  In 1705, a ruble coin was minted, which had an error in the date. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What are the most expensive tsarist coins of Russia?  It is these silver rubles.  For such a banknote with the wrong date, collectors are ready to pay more than one and a half million rubles. </p><p>  Other "Polish talers", whose date is correct, are estimated at about 400 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  The most expensive coin of the USSR </h2><p>  What is the most expensive coin of the Soviet Union?  The rarest and, naturally, expensive coin is considered fifty cents, dated 1929.  Collectors estimate it at more than 10 million rubles.  This banknote is made of an alloy of copper-nickel, as a test sample. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most expensive coin of the USSR" class="if uuid-3190310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190310.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, there is information about only one coin that has survived to this day.  On its obverse, an image of a peasant sitting at the wheel of a tractor is minted.  On the back is a country road and a series of one-story houses. </p><p>  It is considered the most mysterious and unexplored coin of the times of the USSR.  Data on it is in the archives of the Mint of St. Petersburg.  In 1929, together with her, a 10-kopeck coin was also developed.  There are stamps in the documents.  However, manufactured specimens are absent (as samples). </p><h2>  Modern Russian expensive coins </h2><p>  Coins of modern Russia, which can be classified as rare and expensive, are those that went into circulation in small editions.  These include jubilee money metal signs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The most expensive coin in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  What is the most expensive coin in modern Russia?  It is considered a metal banknote in denominations of 5 rubles, issued in 1999 by the Moscow Mint.  If there is a mark of MMD on it, collectors can lay out more than 250 thousand rubles for it.  To date, there is information on only a few copies of this coin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dengivsetakipahnyt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most expensive coin of modernized Russia" class="if uuid-3190312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190312.jpg"></div><p>  Also, to the question which Russian coins are the most expensive, some numismatists will answer: 50 kopecks, which were issued in 2001.  According to collectors, its value can range from 30,000 to 100,000 rubles.  Made at the Moscow Mint.  The quantity is unknown.  Only a handful of information is confirmed.  To distinguish it from other similar coins, you need to find the letter "m", located under the hoof of a horse on the reverse. </p><p>  The Moscow Mint is also known for the fact that in 2001, for unknown reasons, it put into circulation other banknotes that became real rarities.  They belong to the most expensive Russian coins, they are appreciated.  What are they like?  These are ruble and two ruble metal banknotes.  Their cost from collectors starts at 30,000 rubles.  They are distinguished by the presence of the abbreviation MMD under the hoof of a horse. </p><h2>  Which 10 ruble coin is the most expensive </h2><p>  The issue of coins with a face value of 10 rubles began in the Russian Federation since 1991.  Almost immediately after the collapse of the USSR. </p><p>  The most expensive 10-ruble coins in modern Russia are considered a few.  Among them stand out: </p><ul><li>  10 rubles dedicated to the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.  The coin was issued in 2010.  The cost fluctuates around 16,000 rubles apiece.  It is for this price that numismatists are ready to purchase it, which is in good condition; </li><li>  in 2010 10 rubles ‚ÄúChechen Republic‚Äù were issued.  In markets trading collectible banknotes, the coin is estimated at 8500 rubles; </li><li>  10 rubles dedicated to the Perm region.  It was put into circulation in 2010.  It is estimated in the range of 3500-4000 rubles; </li><li>  in 2013, a jubilee coin of 10 rubles dedicated to the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania came into circulation.  Among collectors, its cost is about 3,000 rubles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bidread.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most expensive 10 rubles of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3190321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190321.jpg"></div><p>  However, to the question which coin is 10 rubles the most expensive, numismatists will answer: the most valuable, rare and expensive is the banknote of the St. Petersburg Mint (SPMD).  It was launched in 2011.  It is known for certain that only 13 pieces were made of such coins.  Their release in St. Petersburg was a mistake; they were planned to be minted at the Moscow Mint.  It is precisely because of this that these 10 rubles have become a real numismatic rarity. </p><p>  The main distinguishing feature is the presence of the symbol SPMB, which is located under the left paw of the eagle.  Collectors are ready to give more than 100 thousand rubles for it. </p><h2>  The most expensive coin in the world </h2><p>  Regarding the most valuable, expensive world coin, there are discrepancies. </p><p>  According to most, this is the silver US dollar.  At the last auction they paid $ 7.85 million for it.  In everyday life, a coin is called "loose hair." </p><div class="photo" data-original="likeme365.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most expensive coin" class="if uuid-3190124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190124.jpg"></div><p>  This is the representative of the first silver US dollars that were minted at the end of the 18th century at the mint in the city of Philadelphia.  From a batch of coins issued in 1794, of which only 2,000 were made, a few have survived.  Most were destroyed (melted down) due to the poor quality of coinage.  To date, there is information about coins from this batch in the amount of about 200 pieces.  One of them in very good condition was sold for the above amount. </p><p>  The silver dollar shows the head of freedom, whose profile was created according to the portrait of the daughter of the president of the US bank.  Her hair was loose, which was supposed to symbolize the wind of freedom.  However, this stroke became the main attraction of the coin, for which it was nicknamed ‚Äúloose hair‚Äù.  On the reverse is a flying eagle holding a bunch of arrows and an olive branch in its paws. </p><p>  According to other experts, numismatists, when asked what is the most expensive coin, one must answer that it is a US $ 20 gold coin.  On the front of it is symbolically depicted freedom, dressed in antique clothes.  In the hands of a torch and an olive branch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dengivsetakipahnyt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Golden Eagle of Saint-Gaudens" class="if uuid-3190449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3190449.jpg"></div><p>  In 1933, more than 445,000 such coins were made. However, President Roosevelt, as part of the reform of the US monetary system, issued a decree destroying the entire party.  But several so-called double eagles of Saint-Gaudens have survived.  At the beginning of the XXI century, one of these coins was bought for more than 7,590,000 US dollars.  It is believed that now its cost is much higher. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  How to find out which coin is expensive and valuable?  After all, real rarities can be in every person‚Äôs wallet, which he may not be aware of.  Ordinary metal banknotes, which daily have to pay for purchases, can cost much more than their face value. </p><p>  Therefore, if someone thinks that the discovered coin is valuable and can be expensive, it is better to turn to the numismatist for help.  Only he can appreciate its real value.  Also, this specialist will tell you in detail about which coins are valued.  In some cases, you can identify the most expensive metal banknotes yourself, using the information in this article. </p>
