    <p>  Nevsky Prospekt is a metro station that opened in 1963 in the summer.  Then the zone to which this point belonged was called the "Technological Institute" and passed into the "Petrograd".  The name of the station is due to the proximity of the central city highway of the same name.  Initially, the Nevsky Prospekt metro was called the ‚ÄúPlekhanov Square‚Äù, as the territory located near the Kazan Cathedral was previously called. </p><p>  To get to the station, you need to go down to the transition, from where there is a path to Mikhailovskaya Street, as well as to the avenue itself.  The metro station Nevsky Prospect (St. Petersburg) was designed by architects Andreev, Shuvalova and Getskin.  It was here that for the first time a similar model of organization of the part reserved for the lobby was used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  When the Nevsky Prospect metro station was being built, I had to get rid of the Perinnye Ryad, as well as the portico of Ruska.  During 1972, the portico was restored, but it acquired a slightly different proportion. </p><p>  It is extremely important that there is an underground connection for such large cities as St. Petersburg (St. Petersburg).  Metro Nevsky Prospect quickly enough compensates for this need.  Since 2014, the Perinny series have been renewed here.  It is worth noting that now they are strikingly different from their past performance. </p>

    <h2>  Old look </h2><p>  When the Nevsky Prospekt metro station was put into operation, it had only one exit through which there was communication between the lobby underground and Mikhailovskaya Street, which is located on the south side. </p><p>  Outwardly, the exit resembled a cascade that included two types of escalators: 3 small ones, where you could ride by going into a camera located across, as well as 3 large ones, which were part of an inclined passage (a similar structure can be found by going to the ‚ÄúProletarskaya‚Äù, however here they stand at an angle).  Nevsky Prospekt (St. Petersburg) - a metro station undergoing repairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Change </h2><p>  During 1998, the inclined course was reconstructed, as a result of which small escalators were dismantled.  They were replaced by a flight of stairs, consisting of three marches. </p><p>  With the onset of summer 2007, I had to get rid of the primary elements that illuminated the lobby, and replace them with standard ones.  Until November 1967, on the territory of the butt in the north, there was a point for transfer to the Gostiny Dvor station, which was part of the Nevsko-Vasileostrovskaya line.  In April 1968, a move appeared under the name Nevsky Prospect-2 on April 30.  This paragraph summarizes two stops.  Also, for some time, the Nevsky Prospekt metro was closed due to repairs on escalators.  Then the point just drove non-stop. </p><h2>  What is located underground </h2><p>  Going down here, you can find a lot of interesting things.  This station is laid at a depth of 63 meters.  The underground hall was built by engineer Maximov and architect Mayofis.  Pylons and arches were decorated with plaster and decoration in the form of aluminum ribs, which were previously polished. </p>

    <p>  The walls on the way were covered with glass tiles, adding a red backing, which in 2006 was replaced with an unnatural stone of a similar color scheme.  The hall floor in the center was decorated with labradorite and beautiful gabbro.  The aprons had an asphalt floor.  In 2007, this part was replaced with granite. </p><p>  In the middle of the room at the point between the two pillars, where the ceiling is particularly high, contains information written in a decree issued on behalf of the Presidium of the USSR Armed Forces.  In accordance with it, the Leningrad Metro was awarded the Order of Lenin.  During 2004, the administration abandoned mercury-based lamps and began to use sodium illuminators. </p><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  Through this point you can move to trains heading along the Nevsky-Vasileostrovskaya branch.  This is a unique point in the city where passenger flows along routes are divided: </p><ul><li><p>  From Nevsky Prospect to Gostiny Dvor.  There is a lift and its turn from the territory of the point.  The northern part has a hall where you can carry out the descent and elevation.  It is removed from the center by several steps.  From there, four small electric stairs direct the passenger to the right, to the Gostiny Dvor point.  Those who wish to rise here, others descend further.  Thanks to this, the direction in which passenger traffic is going is ensured.  From here, on four small escalators, you can go left and exit onto the Griboedov Canal, which is also connected to Gostiny Dvor by two not very wide corridors that go around small lifts and are located in parallel.  So there are as many as two options for avoiding this point. </p></li><li><p>  You can walk from Gostiny Dvor to Nevsky Prospekt.  There is a descent down the stairs, along which you can go to the tunnel for the transition.  Usually people move on top of a platform that is heading north.  Going down the stairs, you can find yourself in the hall in the center.  The direction of movement of passengers is provided by the turnstiles that are located below. </p></li></ul>
