  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the most "long-playing" smartphones - rating, features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Of all the things discussed by users, the most significant and frequent is the battery level and battery capacity.  The short battery life of smartphones is what many have claims.  Although Apple‚Äôs iPhone is usually called a device that needs to be charged after a few hours of active use, it is not the only lagging phone. </p><p>  Some phones are designed for long battery life due to the use of large batteries and mid-range processors.  But other popular High-end models are thin and demand a lot of power, and some users are disappointed in saving these resources. </p><p>  Of course, you can charge the gadget during the day if necessary, or even carry an extra battery with you.  However, this is not always convenient.  The article will present the most ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones that can easily cope even with high loads. </p><h2>  Key notation </h2><p>  Battery capacity is measured in milliampere hours (mAh).  The larger the mAh battery, the higher its technical capacity.  But the phones with the highest number of mAh are not always the phones with the best battery life. </p><p>  This may depend on how efficient the processor is in combination with the software, as well as how efficiently the owner uses his phone.  Expensive devices are often faster and have better screens, but this will mean that the battery life is much lower than that of the middle class segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to pay attention to? </h2><p>  Phones with great looking QHD displays run out of battery faster than phones with lower resolution displays.  Therefore, you need to prioritize - if you need to increase battery life, you have to be content with mid-level gadgets.  Fortunately, this means that the phone will cost much cheaper than the flagships and the latest innovations from popular manufacturers. </p><p>  Many phones today, but not all, have fast charging.  Often, cheaper mid-range smartphones have a long battery life, but do not charge quickly.  Many users say that fast charging reduces battery life. </p><h2>  What do the results show? </h2><p>  Experts often use the Geekbench 4 battery testing feature to get the time in minutes and seconds, but this is not an indication of how long the phone will actually work. </p><p>  In all tests, the screen brightness is set to the same level to ensure an equal metering level (120 cd / m2).  The phone discharges the battery completely and the screen is set up so that it does not fade or rotate.  Thanks to these settings, you can get more accurate test results on different models. </p><p>  Below is a list of ten phones that have recently shown the best battery performance. </p><h2>  1. Huawei Mate 20 Pro </h2><p>  Battery capacity: 4200 mAh. </p><p>  Budget phones with large batteries and low-resolution screens are usually found at the top of test patterns.  However, according to recent checks, a model with a value of more than 25 thousand rubles occupies a leading position.  Huawei Mate 20 Pro is not only one of the leaders of the year, but a gadget that shows excellent results when testing battery consumption. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The manufacturer did a good job on battery life.  The phone has a high-quality bright display, three modern rear-view cameras, as well as reverse wireless charging to recharge the battery level of someone else's phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5google.com" data-author=": Damien Wilde, "><img itemprop="image" alt="High quality" class="if uuid-3140157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/122190/3140157.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about this very ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphone among buyers are only positive.  The phone is much cheaper than many flagships and at the same time not inferior to them in performance. </p><h2>  2. Motorola E5 Plus </h2><p>  Battery capacity - 5000 mAh. </p><p>  This phone has outstanding battery life.  A high result is associated with its relatively low performance and very large battery capacity. </p><p>  It also has a large 6-inch screen and costs only 20 thousand rubles.  The buyer, of course, sacrifices performance, but if he needs a cheap smartphone with the longest battery, then this is it. </p><p>  The model got into the rating of the most ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones thanks not only to expert assessment, but also to a large number of positive comments on the Web from users. </p><h2>  3. Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 </h2><p>  Battery capacity - 5000 mAh. </p><p>  ZenFone Max Pro M1 has a huge battery, rightfully providing excellent battery life.  Although it charges quite slowly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Clean software without ads and annoying notifications minimizes energy consumption, and a large 6-inch display perfectly reproduces colors.  Dual cameras and a robust design make the model an excellent choice if you need an affordable phone that works for two days without charging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgetmatch.com" data-author=": Luigi Leonardo, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reliable device" class="if uuid-3140172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/122190/3140172.jpg"></div><p>  The model got into the list of the most ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones due to the high demand of customers.  The network has dozens of positive reviews about the gadget, which relate to its slow charge. </p><h2>  4. Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra </h2><p>  Battery capacity - 3580 mAh. </p><p>  The XA2 Ultra is a large phone with a built-in battery.  This makes it possible to use the gadget for several days without charging.  However, with high processor load, battery life may be reduced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": Nathan Spendelow 6 Dec 2018, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular design" class="if uuid-3140177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/122190/3140177.jpg"></div><p>  This is due to the efficient processor, Android Oreo and a lower-resolution screen than phones of this class. </p><p>  Thanks to the reviews, this gadget was also included in the rating of the best smartphones.  Customers note high performance and moderate battery drain. </p><h2>  5. Motorola G6 </h2><p>  Battery capacity - 3000 mAh. </p><p>  Motorola G6 is not inferior in many characteristics to the flagships.  Like the other devices in this review, this is a mid-range phone, but what the user loses in the beauty of the gadget's appearance and new technologies when buying, comes back with a plus in the form of long-term battery life. </p><p>  The model has more than once been recognized as the most ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphone on Android, according to buyers.  Many also value the device for its high build quality. </p><h2>  6. Oppo RX17 Pro </h2><p>  The battery capacity is 3700 mAh. </p><p>  The Oppo RX17 Pro has outstanding battery life, combined with the fastest charge among all mobile gadgets. </p><p>  The software requires some getting used to, but the premium design, performance is above average, and triple cameras are versatile. </p><p>  The model is included in the rating of the most ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones based on many positive reviews and customer comments.  With a small prevalence, they want to buy a gadget in many countries. </p><h2>  7. BlackBerry Motion </h2><p>  The battery capacity is 4000 mAh. </p><p>  The BlackBerry phone is not the most powerful, but it has outstanding battery life both in Geekbench and in actual use in everyday life. </p><p>  The high-capacity battery allows you to work for hours, no matter what the user does.  And since this is a BlackBerry, the buyer additionally receives very regular security updates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": Henry Burrell, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reliability and safety" class="if uuid-3140184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/122190/3140184.jpg"></div><p>  One of the leaders in the list of the best smartphones with a good battery is considered the English model of the device.  As the users themselves note in the comments, the model in a state of sleep practically does not consume resources. </p><h2>  8. Sony Xperia XA2 </h2><p>  Battery capacity - 3300 mAh. </p><p>  The smaller version of the XA2 Ultra has a small battery, but it still surpasses most other phones on the market. </p><p>  Convenient compact size, convenient Android Oreo software and great price make this durable phone a good choice. </p><h2>  9. BlackBerry KeyOne </h2><p>  Battery capacity - 3505 mAh. </p><p>  With the same battery life as the Xperia XA2, KeyOne is one of two BlackBerry phones in the review.  A physical keyboard may not be very convenient.  However, due to the small display, power consumption is significantly reduced.  According to reviews, one charge lasts for two days at an average load. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": VID PIERCE, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mechanical keyboard" class="if uuid-3140189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/122190/3140189.jpg"></div><h2>  10. Motorola G6 Play </h2><p>  The battery capacity is 4000 mAh. </p><p>  The list of smartphones with a powerful battery continues to Motorola G6 Play.  This is one of the cheapest phones in the review.  But it cannot be said that this is a poor-quality model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": Amelia Holowaty Krales, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Low price" class="if uuid-3140193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/122190/3140193.jpg"></div><p>  The gadget has a good battery life, which makes it possible to perform everyday tasks without problems.  In addition to this, there is a fingerprint scanner and an 18: 9 screen.  This is a great budget choice. </p>
