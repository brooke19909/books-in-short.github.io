You can decorate the Christmas costume for girls around the edge with a rain in the tone of the color of the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a cloak" class="if uuid-2512188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2512188.jpg"></div><p>  The cloak can be made with or without a collar.  The top of the neck is preferably formed with an elastic band, folding the fabric in half.  It will be interesting to look at a satin ribbon threaded into the neck, which is tied in front on a lush bow. </p><p>  After making the capes, cone-shaped hats and magic wands, the New Year's costume for the girl is ready!

You must purchase a white tulle fabric and a wide elastic band of the same color.  It wraps around the waist and is cut to size, you just need to add a couple of centimeters to the seams.  Then you need to cut the strips of fabric and, folding them in half, stretch the ends into a loop through an elastic band.  Thus, strips are passed around the entire elastic band until the tulle fills the entire space of the future skirt.  The more pieces of fabric used, the more magnificent the pack. </p><p>  The photo of the children's New Year's costume for girls, located above, shows how to decorate a snowman outfit.  Pompons are made from black yarn threads.  These are the buttons of a snowman, they are usually made of coals or stones.  On the stomach and chest of the upper part of the outfit, eyes, a nose-carrot and a smile of the hero are made with application.  You can put a hat on your head, and if the outfit has long sleeves, a striped scarf thrown over your shoulder will look spectacular. </p><h2>  Chanterelle outfit </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself New Year's costume for a girl (photo below in the article) can be done on the same principle as the previous outfit, only for the image of a fox, you need to buy a red and white tulle.  A fluffy skirt is done by putting mixed strips of fabric on a wide elastic band, combining a large number of strips of orange and several white ones.  To complete the image, you need to sew triangular ears and a fur vest.  To do this, you need a small piece of faux fur red color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a fox costume" class="if uuid-2512115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2512115.jpg"></div><p>  The tail is sewn from a rectangular piece of fur.  The edges of the long sides are sewn together on the wrong side, then the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù is turned on the front part and filled with cotton or synthetic winterizer.  The edges are stitched together at an angle.  The upper part of the tail is sewn to the belt of the skirt, and at the end of the hanging part you can attach a piece of white fur, like a fox. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt know how to make a vest for a little girl‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs costume, you can simply attach strips of fur to the turtleneck with a fluffy collar.  The ears are sewn inside out, stitching the edges of the triangle.  Then the product is turned on the front side.  To ears sticking up, you can insert inside the triangles of cardboard or make a wire frame.  At the end, the details of the costume are attached to the hoop. </p><p>  Fur charm will complement the chanterelle outfit.  They can be sewn onto the sleeve of a blouse or stitched with a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù by inserting an elastic band inside. </p><h2>  Squirrel costume </h2><p>  Knowing how to sew a New Year's costume for a girl in the form of a fox, it is easy to make a squirrel outfit.  The styles are very similar to each other.  The difference between the costumes in two details.  Firstly, the tail is mounted on a wire and bends upward.  So that it does not fall to the side, one end of the metal wire is first bent with pliers with a long and thin arc.  It will be a tail.  And then the second end is wrapped in a circle around the waist.  The remains are cut off.  So that the child does not experience inconvenience while wearing the outfit, you need to wrap the entire wire with fur, and fasten the craft on the button on the belt.  So it will be convenient to put on and take off the tail. </p><p>  Secondly, ears of squirrels are slightly different from foxes.  On the tops of the triangles you need to make brushes.  You can use short bunches of golden thin rain. </p><h2>  Tender kitty </h2><p>  It's easy to make a New Year's costume for a girl with your own hands, having black leggings and a tight turtleneck in your child‚Äôs wardrobe.  You will also need black tulle fabric.  Before sewing frills on the legs from below, the tulle is gathered with folds.

The only thing that needs to be taken into account is that a wide elastic band for such a children's New Year's costume for a girl needs to be bought in black. </p><p>  It remains to make black triangular ears on the hoop and draw a mustache and a cat's face on the face of the child with a cosmetic pencil. </p><h2>  Christmas costume </h2><p>  The <span>costume of a Christmas tree</span> can be called <span>a</span> popular outfit for a New Year's party <span>.</span>  To make it, you will need a green dress.  If it is not in the daughter‚Äôs wardrobe, and the sewing machine is present in the house, then you can sew it yourself by taking any even dress of the child as a sample.
