This word is often incomprehensible to the average layman.  This term has gradually entered everyday life and is now much more often used than the familiar word "management".  The development of a market economy has contributed to changes in the style of senior management.  The well-known terms “management”, “director” and “managerial activity” have lost their relevance.  What is the organization’s management? Today it’s not difficult to explain this concept to a slightly trained mid-level clerk. </p><p>  In modern conditions, highly specialized specialists are required who solve organizational issues quickly and efficiently.  The director in a large organization is not always able to bring his decisions directly to the executor and, moreover, to monitor their implementation.  He is busy with more important matters, but the manager manages to do this work quickly and efficiently, often even better than the leader himself. </p><p>  What is management is generally easy to explain.  This is an action aimed at the end result.  It is accomplished thanks to the correct distribution of material and labor resources.  The science of “management” was formed relatively recently (XIX century) and mainly consists in using the practical experience of managers.  Theory as such does not exist, but practical material is present in full. </p><p>  Management - what is it?  The answer to this question lies in the title itself.
