    <h2>  How are purchase bonuses awarded? </h2><p>  Bonuses are credited as part of the club card you have on hand.  If it is not there, then the reward is received after it is received and the buyer is registered in the system.  Moreover, the type of card you receive directly depends on the amount of your purchase.  And then, for every 1000 rubles spent, you can receive from 50 and up to 100 bonuses.  For example, for the winter jacket you purchased within 8,999 rubles, about 400 bonuses will be credited to the blue card, 560 to the gray card and 800 to the yellow card. </p><p>  Not sure how to spend bonuses?  Sportmaster will help you with this.

    <h2>  Where can I spend the accumulated bonuses? </h2><p>  Three days after you make a purchase at Sportmaster, a corresponding reward will come to your bonus account, which will then allow you to pay up to 30% of the price of your next purchase or use the services of the company.  In this case, you can choose goods, according to the action, in all stores of the network.  The only exception is the "Discounts" of the company.  Also, you will not be able to spend bonuses on goods that are already being sold at a discount store. </p><h2>  How can I spend 1000 bonuses in Sportmaster? </h2><p>  We give a simple example.  You have 1000 unused bonuses in your account.  In order to spend them you can choose products from the store‚Äôs goods for any amount.  However, remember that you can pay with bonuses only 30% of its value.  The remaining amount you have to pay in cash. </p><p>  Suppose you choose a men's t-shirt.  Its full price is 3,330 rubles, therefore, you can use 999 bonuses, which is equal to 999 rubles, and pay 2331 rubles.  We will talk about how to spend 3000 bonuses in Sportmaster below. </p>

    <p>  Another example.  You wanted to buy a women's warm vest.  Initially, its price was 3,999 rubles, and later the store made a 30% discount, and its price dropped to 2,799 rubles.  Therefore, when using 30% of bonuses, we will get 839.7 rubles, ready to be debited, and 1959.30 rubles you will need to pay in cash.  According to the results of the purchase, you will have 1000 - 839.7 = 160.40 bonuses that you can use next time.  Or there is an opportunity to spend your balance on the purchase of a variety of sports accessories.  For example, you can buy an organizer for 489 rubles (it will take you 146.7 and 13.7 bonuses will remain) and a cooling blindfold for 19 rubles (its cost, taking into account the discount, will be 5.7 bonuses).  The remaining 8 bonuses can also be spent on the purchase of a second color dressing or left for the purpose of subsequent accumulation of promotional rewards.  Here's how to spend bonuses at Sportmaster. </p><h2>  Where can I spend 3000 earned bonuses? </h2><p>  If you have 3000 bonuses in your account, you can spend them not only on purchases, but also on after-sales service.  For example, your exercise bike purchased earlier from Sportmaster stopped working for you.  By calling a specialist in a chain of sports stores, you can always use your bonuses to pay.  For example, the services of a master cost 800-900 rubles.  Given a 30% discount, they will cost you 240-270 bonuses and, accordingly, 560-630 rubles in cash in the form of an additional payment.  This is one of the options for spending 3000 bonuses in Sportmaster. </p><p>  Also, if you wish, you can go over the range of the company and purchase, for example, a sleeping bag for 699-979 rubles, which, taking into account the discount, will be 209.70 and 293.7 bonuses + 489.3 and 685.3 - cash surcharge.  The rest of the money can be spent on sports shoes, clothes, smaller accessories, etc. Or you can immediately use all 3000 bonuses by looking, for example, an exercise bike for 9,999 rubles, which will amount to 2,999.7 bonuses. </p>

    <h2>  What is the peculiarity of using promotional bonuses? </h2><p>  If you have not yet decided how to spend bonuses in Sportmaster, you should know about some features of this promotion.  So, when using previously accumulated bonuses, you can get a new promotion on the card.  However, remuneration will be accrued only on the amount that you will be forced to pay in cash.  Bonuses are not awarded for the amount using a 30% discount. </p><p>  You can earn and accumulate bonuses, not only making purchases in the Sportmaster chain of stores, but also paying for the services of the company and other types of services.  For example, it‚Äôs realistic to pay with bonuses in case of repair of sports equipment and equipment, during the assembly and unpacking of new goods, as well as when lifting purchased products (meaning bulky goods) to your apartment (the cost depends on the floor).  And again, remuneration is accrued only for a cash surcharge. </p><p>  In addition, it is realistic to earn bonuses when you pick up products.  In this case, you can additionally receive up to 300 bonuses per account.  Users registered in the system can rely on rewards ranging from 500 and up to 2000 bonuses on their birthday, as well as 500 bonuses for registration in the promotional program itself.  This is a brief summary of how to spend bonuses.  ‚ÄúSportmaster‚Äù offers to spend remuneration more actively, because it has its own validity periods and is accrued throughout the entire calendar year.  If you decide to spend the accumulated bonuses in Sportmaster, choose the option that you like the most. </p>
