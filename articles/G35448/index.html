    <p>  It is here, in this small village, is the <span>Kungur ice cave,</span> which is one of the most famous <span>sights of the Urals.</span>  The unique monument is the largest <span>karst cave</span> in Europe.  Its length is about 5.7 kilometers, 1.5 of them are open to visitors. </p><p>  Inside the cave, you can find grottoes, lakes, as well as ‚Äúorgan pipes‚Äù - mines that almost surface.  It is cold enough here, so if you are planning to take the Kungur-Perm route and visit the world famous cave, you should take warm clothes with you. </p><p>  In addition to the cave in Kungur there are many other attractions: there are six temples with a rich history, there are also a large number of buildings of the XIX-XX centuries, which are open to visitors almost daily.  One of the oldest buildings is the former city government building, erected in 1820.  At different times, there was a school, a library and a museum, and now it houses a boarding school. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Perm - the regional capital </h2>

    <p>  Perm is a regional center, which is famous for a large number of monuments and entertainment complexes.  From here you can easily get to any city in Russia.  The city has a train station and airport.  All visitors to the city must visit the monument to the bear - the symbol of the region, as well as the monument ‚ÄúPermyak salty ears‚Äù. </p><p>  The Museum of Modern Art, famous for its original expositions, deserves special attention.  Many lovers of television series will also want to visit the places where the popular project "Real Boys" was shot, which has been broadcast on one of the federal television channels for several years. </p><p>  If you need to get to a city located in the Perm Territory, it is best to use the bus station.  Bus services in the region are well developed: even the most remote settlements can be reached as soon as possible, detailed information on the route of interest can be clarified at the box office ticket offices. </p><h2>  We are going by train </h2>

    <p>  The most convenient tool that you can use to travel the Perm-Kungur route is an electric train.  Local trains run between the two cities quite often, especially in the morning and evening.  The average travel time takes one and a half hours, you can leave on one of four to five electric trains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The distance of the small route "Perm-Kungur", the train that runs in the morning and evening, is 101 kilometers.  The cost of a one-way ticket for an adult is about 150 rubles, for a child - about 40, for privileged categories of citizens - 76 rubles.  If you wish, you can buy a round-trip ticket, then its cost will increase approximately twice. </p><h2>  Or maybe an ordinary train? </h2>

    <p>  If the train doesn‚Äôt suit you for one reason or another, then you can overcome the Perm-Kungur route on a regular passenger train.  The duration of the trip and the total mileage in this case remain the same, but the fare increases significantly and amounts to about 750 rubles per seat in the reserved seat. </p><p>  The fare in the compartment ranges from 1200 to 1700 rubles, you can also buy a place "lux", its price is from 2.5 to 4.5 thousand rubles.  That is why many people use this option only in the most extreme cases. </p><p>  The advantage of such a railway connection is that the train can be used after hours, when the trains do not go.  Every day in this and in the other direction there are 10-12 trains, the schedule of which can be specified at the railway stations, as well as on the official website of Russian Railways. </p><h2>  Or by bus? </h2>

    <p>  The Kungur-Perm bus runs between the two cities daily.  On average, local companies organize 15-20 direct flights and about 15 transit flights.  The average travel time is 1 hour 45 minutes, the first buses from Kungur to Perm leave at five in the morning local time, the last at 21 hours. </p><p>  The fare is about 250 rubles for an adult.  Information on travel documents for children is best clarified at the box office.  If you choose the Kungur-Perm bus, then specify the dates of the flight of interest in advance.  Since some of them run only on weekdays, and some only on weekends. </p><p>  The Kungur-Perm route is especially popular with Kungur residents.  Many of them go to study and work in the regional capital.  That is why it is best to pre-purchase tickets, because they are quickly sold out at both bus stations.  The latter also become a place where private traders are on duty, offering tourists a ride to their destination. </p><h2>  It is possible and by car </h2><p>  You can also go to see the famous cave by car.  The distance between the two cities is 98 kilometers, it can be overcome in about 1.5 hours.  Until recently, all travelers had to spend a lot of time at two crossings near Perm, after the introduction of the detour this problem was solved. </p><p>  High-speed bypass will significantly reduce the time on the road, but the accepted safety rules should be observed.  The Perm-Kungur highway is in relatively good condition if you use the new highway.  The old site, passing through the village of Lobanovo, is in satisfactory condition. </p><p>  In Kungur and Perm, you can also rent a car to drive along the desired route.  The main plus - by car, you can go around both cities and explore all its sights without rushing.  The disadvantage is the high cost of the service, so it will be most advantageous to use it in Kungur. </p><h2>  Other options </h2>

    <p>  If the buses to Perm from Kungur are not suitable for you, and you do not have your own car, then you can try to get to the destination by hitchhiking.  There are several ways, the easiest way is to catch a private trader and pay him an acceptable amount, but this may be too expensive a service. </p><p>  You can also use the services of communities (for example, BlaBlaCar), which offer several travelers to unite to travel on a specific route in one car.  For a trip in a kind of taxi you do not need to pay extra money, but there is a certain fee that is paid by all participants of the trip.  The whole amount goes to gasoline.  However, this method is also not suitable for everyone. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Kungur-Perm route is relatively small, and you can overcome it quite quickly.  The choice of vehicles is quite large.  Everything here will depend on your desire, finances and opportunities.  When traveling by public transport, care must be taken in advance to purchase tickets, and when traveling, observe safety rules. </p><p>  Both in Perm and in Kungur, you can use the services of guides who will gladly show you the city and tell its story.  There will be no problems with accommodation and catering, as hotel complexes and public catering are widely developed in both cities. </p>
