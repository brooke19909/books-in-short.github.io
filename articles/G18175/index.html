There are many who want to relax near the house.  Especially here, fishermen often come who do not have the opportunity to travel outside their community. </p><p>  Each Golovinsky pond is in a fairly good environmental situation, except perhaps in the Upper.  Some vacationers consider these reservoirs polluted, in fact, the water in them is transparent.  The time period in which the ponds begin to ‚Äúbloom‚Äù is due only to its excellent ecological state.  Water is "living." </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  The name "Golovinsky Pond" comes from the village of Golovino, which was owned by the noble family of the same name.  Ponds are located in the north-west of Moscow, in the same area, near the local cemetery.  Golovinsky ponds are a system consisting of three water areas: the Big, the Upper and the Small.  They were built in the XVIII century on the stream of the same name.  The latter originates in the Khimki reservoir, passes through the Verkhny, Maly and Bolshoi ponds, then the channel flows into the tributary of Likhoborka.  The reservoirs are quite full-flowing: a strong current is noticeable in the ponds. </p><h2>  Take a look at the story </h2><p>  Each Golovinsky pond has a very interesting history of formation, given that they are all combined into one system.  Since the 16th century, the village often changed owners, and the most typical landowner estate appeared by the middle of the 19th century.  She immediately became famous for her rare peach trees with delicious fruits.  The last owner of the estate was a religious man and bequeathed his estate to the monastery.  At the end of the century, a school and a hospital were opened with him, and during the war sisters nursed the wounded.  In the early 1930s.  religious institution closed.  That was the story of the formation of the village of the same name, in which there are ponds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Upper Golovinsky Pond </h2><p>  The Upper Pond is the smallest of the ponds.  Its length is about 240 m, in width it stretches for 165 m, and its area is 3.4 hectares. </p><p>  The pond is irregularly oval in shape, with banks overgrown with <span>sharp sedge.</span>  The water is strewn with duckweed and mud, the pedestrian path is natural - in a word, a simple lake unsuitable for swimming, and even among the fishermen there are few lovers who try to catch something in the thickets.  Here, most often there are tourists who like a calm and peaceful vacation on the shore of a reservoir. </p>

    <h2>  Small pond </h2><p>  Small pond has irregular banks.  Its length is 350 m, its width is about 125 m, its area is 3.8 ha.  Connected to the Upper very picturesque stone channel.  A lot of people are fishing on the shores of this pond - the reservoir is simply teeming with fish, fortunately, it is constantly being cleaned up.  No less people come to him to sunbathe, swim, cook kebabs.  Of course, all this is not officially allowed, but those living among stone and concrete are worried about the approval of the authorities like last year‚Äôs snow. </p><p>  Earlier, the oldest fine-woolen factory named after them.  Petra Alekseeva, founded by the merchant Yokish at the beginning of the XIX century.  Five years ago, in 2011, the plant was closed, many old buildings were barbarously demolished, and the construction of a residential complex was started at this place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

An hour of rental will cost five hundred rubles.  A little further from the station is the official free beach.  It has a comfortable sandy beach and a smooth approach.  Nearby is a picnic area and an old estate of the XVIII century - "Mikhailovo". </p><p>  This Golovinsky pond, reviews of which are only positive, is the most popular among other reservoirs.
