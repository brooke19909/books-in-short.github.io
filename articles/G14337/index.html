    <h2>  Technology </h2><p>  The project provides for the construction of 4 futuristic buildings in the form and appearance of buildings of variable number of storeys on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1.56 hectares.  Together they form a single architectural solution, some "ships" directed to the river.  Houses are being built using frame-monolithic technology, which provides them with strength and reliability.
