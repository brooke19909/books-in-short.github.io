But how to come to such a celebration and dance near the Christmas tree without a carnival outfit? </p><p>  Therefore, on the eve of traditional celebrations, parents are puzzled by the search for a beautiful image for their child.  Today, <span>children's Christmas costumes</span> can be found both in specialized stores and in the market.  But the whole problem is that sometimes a conceived image is very difficult to put into practice, since there simply is no corresponding outfit on sale.  Or even if the costume of the desired character comes across, then it does not quite correspond to the desired. </p><p>  Now more and more often princess outfits are sold for girls, and pirates and superheroes are relevant for boys.  What to do if you need a Harlequin costume?  There is only one solution.  You should go to the fabric store and purchase material to sew the Arlekino costume yourself. </p>

    <h2>  Image Details </h2><p>  First of all, before you start creating an outfit, you should determine its main elements.  Children's Harlequin costume for a boy can be created on the basis of pants and a jacket or overalls, and for girls it is better to sew a dress or a skirt with a jacket.  It is worth noting that on the back it will be possible to arrange beautiful tails with buboes, which will make the outfit more interesting.  However, if the child is very small, it will be much more convenient for him to be in overalls than with an elastic band from panties on his stomach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To complete the image on the head, you need to sew a cap or hat with two or more hanging horns, on each of which attach bells or buboes.  Also a great option would be a wig.  The Harlequin New Year's costume will look great with a fun hairstyle from the rain or from artificial curly fibers. </p>

    <p>  Another integral element of the image is a beautiful collar with frills or with a serrated edge.  The details completing the image are patches on a suit of contrasting colors, beautiful <span>cuffs on the sleeves</span> and legs, as well as Czechs with themed design. </p><h2>  Color selection </h2><p>  As a rule, an Arlekino costume is made colorful and perky with the use of red, blue, yellow and green colors.  Black and white options look no less interesting.  However, this is not a reason to use only the colors stated above.  The main thing is to beautifully combine shades with each other so that the outfit comes out cheerful and harmonious. </p><p>  How to distribute colors in the image of Arlekino?  Carnival costumes for the reconstruction of this character are usually made with multi-colored legs and with the opposite arrangement of shades on the sleeves.  For shelves, sweaters use the brightest light color.  Dark shades can be added to the multilayer collar and cuffs, as well as to make buboes for a hat from it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For example, an Arlekino costume can be with a yellow base (back and chest), one leg is blue and the other green, the sleeves are the same, only in a different order.  Red, raspberry or violet can be added to the finish of the collar, made of it buboes for a hat, making a combination of blue with green and yellow. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  In textile stores today there is such a wide range that you can get lost.  And here you should remember the main rule: the fabric should be bright and shiny.  In this case, polyester, which is used to make the lining, as well as satin and crepe satin, is great.  The only thing to note is that the polyester is not too thin or translucent.  These materials are quite simple to process. </p><p>  To process the collar, neck, cuffs, base of the cap, a slanting trim is required.  It is not necessary to take it for each element of the image in a different color.  On the contrary, one color of the processed edge will make the product solid, even if the sleeves, for example, are made of yellow material, and the legs are made of green, a red band is perfect for them.  A wonderful outfit of Harlequin will come out.  Carnival costumes are good in that you can make the simplest processing possible, such as edging with a ribbon, which does not require special skills and knowledge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Uncover the basics of the costume </h2><p>  How to build a base pattern to sew a Harlequin costume with your own hands?  First of all, you should measure the parameters of the child.  To work, you need these values: </p><ul><li>  Waist, hips and chest. </li><li>  Height from shoulder to chest. </li><li>  The width of the back. </li><li>  Shoulder width. </li><li>  Length from shoulder to waist and to hips along the back and front. </li><li>  Length from waist to floor on the side of the leg. </li><li>  The length of the sleeve. </li><li>  Length of the leg inseam. </li><li>  Neck circumference. </li><li>  Head volume. </li></ul><p>  Next, you need to take a newspaper, a piece of wallpaper or a building film and transfer all the measurements by making a drawing. </p><h2>  Constructing a dress and shirt pattern </h2><p>  First of all, you need to make the main grid, which is a rectangle with additional horizontal stripes.  The vertical side of the quadrangle should be equal to the length from the shoulder to the hip line, and the vertical side should be half the volume of the chest.  On the basis of this drawing it will be possible to carve out a dress or shirt for Arlekino. </p><p>  Costumes for children are sewn much easier than clothes for adults, because for the figure of the child does not need to make tucks.  Therefore, the entire construction is reduced to drawing on the drawing of sufficient depth the armhole and neck, as well as the necessary width of the back and front. </p><p>  So, first of all, you should determine in the drawing where the front shelf will be, and where the back is.  Next, draw the neck and determine the width of the shoulder, lowering the edge of the line by 1.5 cm from the upper border of the rectangle. </p><p>  After along the line of the chest, the width of the back is laid on one side, then the area for the armhole is calculated.  For this, ¬Ω measures of the volume of the chest are divided into 4 parts.  The obtained value (+2 cm) is noted in the drawing, starting from the point determining the width of the back.  All remaining distance is the width of the front.  The armhole is made round, lowering from the extreme point of the shoulder line of the back, then through the line of the chest and to the front border of the shoulder. </p>

    <h2>  Sleeve construction </h2><p>  The most difficult step in building a workpiece is making a template for the sleeve.  For him, it will be necessary to fold the patterns of the front and back along the shoulder seams and outline the border of the okat.  Then the top is raised by one and a half centimeters and a circle is drawn up, part of which is an okat.  A line is drawn along the bottom of the resulting figure, which should be equal to the circumference of the top of the arm or the intended width of the sleeve.  The main thing is that after building the sleeve corresponds to the armhole. </p><p>  On this, all the basic constructions of a shirt or dress can be considered completed.  Further, it is only a matter of modeling.  It will create an interesting outfit. </p>

    <h2>  Modeling shirts and dresses </h2><p>  An Arlekino costume for a boy can be with two tails descending to the floor from the back of his shirt, as in a tailcoat.  To do this, in the drawing-blank, you need to finish these elements, and then cut out from the fabric.  Also, the top of the suit can be made flared or shortened with a moon-shaped hem in front. </p><p>  When <span>modeling the sleeve,</span> it can be made with a length of ¬æ or vice versa - with a large overflow.  It can also be flared to the bottom and "planted" on a narrow cuff.  Wide sleeves with stitched elastic bottom look great. </p><p>  To make the costume easy to put on the child and not to spoil the applied makeup or varnished hairstyle, it is better to make it with a zipper.  You can sew it in both front and back.  At the same time, the fastener itself can be made a colorful element of the decor, if you pick up a zipper with rhinestones, original color or spraying. </p><p>  Sewing an original Harlequin costume with your own hands is not so difficult as it might seem.  A little imagination and zeal - and a great outfit is ready. </p><h2>  Building a pattern of panties </h2><p>  To make pants, you will also need a template for cutting.  Build it is not difficult.  Moreover, the product may be without an external side cut.  To do this, measure the girth of the upper leg.  As a rule, this value is more than half the measure of hip circumference.  It is laid on the drawing in the horizontal direction relative to the entire template.  Then, from both edges, down, at a right angle, lower the lines equal to the measurement of the leg's inner seam +5 cm, and then close the bottom of the line into a rectangle. </p>

    <p>  Then, on the horizontal sides, find the middle and draw a perpendicular equal to the size of the outer leg of the leg + 5 cm for processing the bottom and + 5 cm for processing the top of the pants.  From the laid vertical, on both sides, measure ‚Äúhip circumference‚Äù + 2 or 3 cm on a loose fit in half measure.  From the obtained points, lower the middle (front and back) seams of the panties, rounding off the lines when switching to the horizontal of the measurement ‚Äúgirth of the upper leg‚Äù.  Further, from the border of the lateral outer seam to the middle front, you should smoothly skew the border of the part by 2 cm for a proper fit along the waistline.  Everything, the template is ready to work! </p><h2>  Collar and cuff design </h2><p>  The outfit will look much more interesting if you complement it with a beautiful multi-layer flounce collar.  For its manufacture, spiral strips are cut from the fabric.  In the inner <span>section,</span> they are collected on an <span>oblique inlay,</span> and in the outer section they are overlaid or processed with a zigzag.  For greater effect, a stiff fishing line can be sewn into the seam, then the collar will come out standing.  By the same principle, you can make beautiful shuttlecocks for processing the bottom of the sleeves and legs.  For these elements use all the colors involved in sewing the outfit.  And so that each layer is clearly visible, stripes need to be made of different widths.  Arlekino costume for a boy with such frills will look very cheerful and provocative. </p><h2>  The design of the cap and Czech </h2><p>  The cap can also be considered an integral element of the outfit.  The easiest option is to sew from two parts with a base equal to the volume of the head and two beautifully curved horns.  In order for the product to keep its shape well, it can be duplicated with hard tulle or collar fabric, and stuffed horns with syntepon. </p><p>  Children's Christmas costumes should be thought out to the smallest detail.  Therefore, even Czechs must be beaten qualitatively.  For them, you can specially make buboes or bows and sew to elastic. </p>
