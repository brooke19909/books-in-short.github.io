    <p>  <span>The credit card</span> is a plastic rectangle with the emblem of the bank and a magnetic strip, to which the client's credit account is tied.  Worldwide, this <span>banking product</span> is a serious competitor to consumer loans.  Such a card makes it possible to use the funds of the bank in order to pay expenses up to a certain limit.  Its size depends on the level of income and the quality of the credit history. </p><p>  Tinkoff credit card is very popular in Russia, which can be issued only on the Internet.  If we talk about general statistics, over the past eight years more than 130 million cards have been issued, most of which were credit cards.  This is not the limit.  Today, for every resident in the world there are an average of three cards. </p><p>  The most popular payment systems in Russia are Visa and MasterCard.  They allow you to pay for purchases, as well as withdraw cash from ATMs.  As a rule, you can get a Tinkoff Platinum credit card, electron, classic, gold and platina.  Each type differs in terms, tariffs and limits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost all banks allow you to make more of the initial <span>credit line</span> after some time - from 3 months to one year.  If during this time you will be able to make payments by card, the bank will trust you even more and provide a loan for a large amount. </p><h2>  What features does a Tinkoff credit card have? </h2>

    <p>  You can issue a card on the Internet.  In addition, any credit card has several advantages over cash.  The money available on a credit card is not subject to declaration when traveling abroad.  In a foreign country with a card in your pocket, you don‚Äôt have to worry about currency exchange, because international payment systems can make payments in any currency.  Banks independently convert. </p><p>  Credit card allows you to pay almost all purchases and services.  All this makes it possible to make a Tinkoff credit card - make a hotel room, pay for a phone, lunch in a restaurant, plane tickets and so on.  Moreover, cardholders have the opportunity to participate in bonus programs from partners of the bank.  It can be shops, airlines, clubs, as well as many others.  Drawings of various gifts are often held. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having such a card, each client gets the opportunity to manage their accounts around the clock anywhere.  You can also issue an additional card to the account so that a loved one has access to it. </p><p>  The main advantage of any credit card is the grace period, that is, the time during which interest is not calculated.  In this case, if you use the funds carefully and observe discipline, and also manage to repay all the debt during the grace period, then you will not have to pay interest at all. </p><h2>  How and where to get a credit card? </h2>

    <p>  Absolutely everyone can apply for a Tinkoff credit card, but before providing this banking product, the bank checks the borrower.  If you have an account, for example, a salary, then the procedure will be carried out according to a simplified scheme. </p><p>  In order to receive a credit card with a minimum limit, an official income is required.  If it is not enough, then you can provide something as a guarantee.  All other requirements for cardholders are almost identical for all banks. </p><h2>  How can I get a credit card? </h2>

You can do this at a bank branch, via the Internet, receive it at the time of purchase, or in addition to another banking product.  Let's consider each method in more detail. </p><h2>  Receiving at a bank branch </h2><p>  In this case, you need to visit a bank branch, fill out an application and provide the necessary documentation.  But this does not allow the Tinkoff Bank.  You can only get a credit card from this bank online.  The bank considers the application and makes its own decision.

    <p>  If you are a frequent customer in a bank, actively use its services, then maybe they will offer you a credit card.  Another option is to send the card by mail.  By the way, earlier, a credit card issued by Tinkoff Bank came.  It was also possible to issue on the Internet, but also by mail cards were also sent without submitting an application. </p><p>  Such a card can only be issued to a client with an excellent reputation, that is, with an ideal credit history. </p><h2>  The disadvantages of this method </h2><p>  The disadvantage is that no conditions can be put forward for the bank.  This is what characterizes the credit card issued by Tinkoff Bank.  You can issue it only on the terms of the bank.  In addition, you can not count on a large credit limit.  But the client has the opportunity to significantly save his time, since the credit institution will have all your data, so you do not have to collect documents. </p><h2>  Received as part of a promotion or upon purchase </h2>

    <p>  In the battle for each client, banks go to different tricks.  An example is a Tinkoff credit card; you can apply for a participation in any promotion.  For example, it can be offered as a gift for a purchase or just outside.  As a rule, such a card will be inactive, but it will have a small amount on its account.  To activate, you need to contact the bank - call or register on the Internet, after which the card will become available.  Of course, this is only if a positive decision is made to use the card. </p><p>  This method is suitable for those who are just too lazy to receive a card, or those who do not dare to do so. </p><h2>  Receiving a card via the Internet </h2><p>  As we said above, you can get a Tinkoff credit card online.  First you need to go to the site and fill out an application.  Next, you will be contacted by a manager who will clarify all the information and report on the decision of the bank. </p><p>  After approval, the card is delivered by mail or courier, it all depends on the city. </p><h2>  Credit card "Tinkoff": apply online.  Reviews </h2><p>  There are a lot of reviews on the Internet and not all of them are, of course, positive.  Not a single bank has only positive feedback about its work, because no one works without flaws.  It is difficult to say whether it is a good bank or a bad one, since how many customers there are exactly the same opinions, but in general the institution works well and their service is at a high level.  Some clients are not happy with the lack of offices, because there is no one to go in case of unforeseen situations. </p><h2>  Some hidden conditions of Tinkoff cards </h2><p>  1. Features of receipt.  It differs from other banks in the speed of processing applications and a high percentage of approval.  In addition, cards are sent by mail. </p><p>  2. Small limits.  As a rule, the limit provided at the very beginning depends on the data indicated in the questionnaire and does not exceed the average wage.  And in some cases, it may not exceed four thousand at all.  You can increase the limit no earlier than after 6 months. </p><p>  3. Interest for withdrawal.  The grace period is valid only for cashless payments.  If the client takes cash, 3% + 390 rubles will be charged for the withdrawal. </p><p>  4. Real interest rate.  Whatever tariff you have, the rate for non-cash transactions will be no less than 25%, and for cash - 33%.  If payments are not made on time, then 0.12% is charged per day, and 43.8% per year. </p><p>  5. The minimum payment.  According to the bank's tariffs, the minimum payment is 6% of the amount.  This is a very small percentage, and it is not able to cover the main debt, since the bank's interest is huge.  As a result, if the client decided to close the card, then his last payment will be equal to the initial amount, if not more. </p><p>  6. Fines.  Overdue charges 0.2% per day.  In addition, you still need to pay a fine of 600 rubles. </p><p>  7. ATMs.  Some payments through ATMs are just like cash payments, and even with a commission. </p><p>  8. Debt insurance.  As elsewhere, the bank provides insurance, so 0.89% of the amount is paid to the insurer.  By concluding an agreement, you can refuse the service. </p><p>  9. Service.  The annual cost of the card is 590 rubles, moreover, when repaying a loan, the fee is still charged and interest is accrued for late payment. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Whether or not to issue a credit card at Tinkoff Bank is up to you.  To receive, fill out the application on the site, get approval, and that‚Äôs all - you can use it.  Most importantly, do not forget to pay off the debt on time. </p>
