Can working people get a loan?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russian Agricultural Bank is a large Russian bank with a state share in the authorized capital.  It is interesting in that it provides favorable loans to pensioners, farmers and all other categories of the population. </p><h2>  <span>Loan at Rosselkhozbank</span> for retirees: terms of provision </h2><p>  Pensioners can get an interesting loan from a bank, provided they receive a pension through Rosselkhozbank.  On what conditions does the bank provide funds?  The first and most important - the loan is provided for any purpose, there is no specific purpose.  The client receives money in national currency - Russian rubles.  The minimum loan amount is 10,000 rubles.  A loan at the Rosselkhozbank for pensioners - 500,000 rubles.  And all this despite the fact that the bank is not interested in the target orientation of the loan!  The Bank treats each client as loyally as possible, therefore, the loan portfolio of the Russian Agricultural Bank is growing rapidly.  The loan term is maximally beneficial for customers, because a loan at the Russian Agricultural Bank for pensioners can be issued for a period of up to 5 or 7 years.  The disadvantage of this loan offer, financial market experts believe that the bank does not provide a grace period in the initial period of use of funds.  Many banks have such a discount. </p>

    <h2>  What are the bank's requirements for senior borrowers? </h2><p>  The bank is thinking about its own security.  That is why, based on the relatively low average life expectancy of Russians, the maximum age is set when a client can make a deal.  True, this concept is formulated in a slightly different way.  According to credit conditions, at the time of full repayment of the debt to the borrower, it cannot be more than 75 years.  Let's consider different options.  For example, a person is 65 years old.  He still has a gap of 10 years.  Such a client can borrow for a maximum period.  If you want to get a loan of 72 years, he will be able to get a loan for only 3 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition, a person must be a citizen of the Russian Federation and be registered on the territory of the state.  Pensioners provide a certificate of the amount of pension for the last 6 months.  Based on the income data, the credit department of the bank calculates the maximum loan amount that can be issued to each individual person. </p><p>  This is how the basic requirements look for how to get a loan to pensioners.  Preferential loan interest - from 16.5% per year. </p><h2>  Cash loans for working people </h2><p>  Does Rosselkhozbank provide a cash loan?  Of course!  What are the rules?  This is essentially a regular credit card with a revolving credit limit.  The maximum amount of credit that a bank can provide to its client under this service program is 1,000,000 rubles.  You can use the loan without paying interest.  The bank has established a grace period of up to 55 days. </p><p>  How to use this offer with the maximum benefit for yourself?  Suppose a customer wants to make some kind of large purchase.  It is more profitable to spend money from a card at the beginning of the month.  In this case, a person has a grace period that is set before the 25th day of the next month, will be as long as possible.  In the event of a charge from the card on the 29th, 30th, 31st days, the interest-free time will be only up to 26 days.  Unprofitable?  And we are about the same! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions for providing loans to employees </h2><p>  The best credit conditions are provided by Rosselkhozbank.  Credits to individuals, including card loans, are issued in the presence of official employment, work experience (at least one year in the last 5 years), a passport of a Russian citizen.  A credit card is beneficial for any client because the rate on a renewable line of financing is only 22.8% per year.  This is less than 2% per month.  Profitable! </p><h2>  Consumer loan at Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  The Bank provides loans to individuals of a consumer nature both on the security of housing and without any collateral.  In principle, the interest rate is different, but not very much. </p>

    <p>  Let's talk about each of these types of financing separately.  Let's start with the loan security plan.  It is provided in the amount of 100,000 to 10,000,000 rubles.  The loan rate depends on the loan term.  For example, if the term of the loan agreement is up to 36 months, then the client will overpay only 16% per year.  If a person has issued a loan for a longer period, then his overpayment will be about 19% per year.  Benefits at interest rates are provided to clients receiving salaries through branches of the Russian Agricultural Bank.  The discount is quite substantial - 0.5%. </p><p>  If there are guarantors for the payment of arrears, a consumer loan at Rosselkhozbank will receive a salary from the bank at a rate of 14.5%. </p><p>  How is the potential loan amount determined?  The property (house or apartment) is estimated by experts and establish its market value.  The bank may issue funds in the amount of not more than 50% of this price. </p><h2>  Unsecured consumer credit </h2><p>  Salary clients can apply for a loan at this bank even without collateral.  This is Rosselkhozbank!  Loans to individuals will go at a base rate of 15.5% per year.  The maximum loan amount will not exceed 750,000 rubles, and the loan term will be no more than 5 years.  The grace period is also not provided to the client, because the overpayment will be relatively small. </p>

    <p>  An important advantage of the financing program (the same can be said about the loan at the Rosselkhozbank for retirees) is that customers can choose their own loan repayment method (by different or annuity payments).  At the same time, the client himself determines how he and his family will be comfortable paying. </p>
