It is interesting in itself, they say that its waters have a healing effect.  But the most amazing thing is that it is located on its shore.  An ancient temple, beautiful still, despite the fact that it has long been abandoned, but not forgotten.  Rdeisky monastery is a real mystery of the Russian land.  Why is there such a huge temple here, in this impassable wilderness?  In fact, today the entire population of the region does not even number 5000 people, and earlier the city of Kholm and the nearby region were considered quite wealthy and crowded, several tens of thousands of people lived here. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The Rdeisky Monastery was founded in 1880, with funds allocated by the merchant Mamontov.  At that place there was already a wooden church, it was reconstructed and a new monastery was erected.  Part of the buildings was of stone, and part of wood.  The very place in which the monastery of Rdea was founded is awestruck.  This is a real place of power, of which there are many in Russia, there is a junction of <span>tectonic plates.</span>  Rdeiskoye Lake is another mystery.  When viewed from the air, it forms an almost regular figure eight, a sign of infinity.  It is located from north to south, two rings are divided by two capes, and are connected by a strait, approximately 200 meters wide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No wonder it was here that the temple was once laid.  On three sides it is washed by the waters of the lake, and on the fourth it is sheltered from the prying eyes by swamp swamp.  After 1880, construction began around the monastery.  A bell tower, barns, stables, warehouses and a wall are being built.  But the wooden buildings deteriorate, and in 1898 the grandiose construction of a stone monastery began.  For its decoration, tiles from Poland and marble from Italy were ordered.  The crown of the temple was the iconostasis of Venetian marble, a similar beauty which was not even in Moscow.  Icons and stained-glass windows were made by Moscow masters.  The temple was striking in its beauty.  In 1937, the Rdeisky monastery was closed and no longer worked.  After the war, the surrounding villages were almost empty, apparently, therefore, they no longer undertook to restore it </p>

    <h2>  Shrines that used to be here </h2><p>  The first monastery was founded on this site in <span>1666.</span>  Throughout the entire existence of the monastery, spiritual values ‚Äã‚Äãand relics have been accumulated in it, which parishioners came to bow to.  Judging by the old records, the miraculous <span>icon of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary</span> was kept here <span>,</span> as well as the icon of Zosima and Savvatiy Solovetsky.  He attributed healing properties, but both of these icons were lost during the looting of the monastery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The parishioners received special attention to a silver <span>altar</span> gilded <span>cross</span> , chased work, eight-pointed.  Its value grew from the parts of holy relics and other sacred objects enclosed in it, as evidenced by the inscriptions.  The three temple eight-pointed crosses are the legacy of the three churches that existed on this site.  All of them were made of linden wood.  More details about this can be found in the program ‚ÄúRussian Trace‚Äù.  Rdeisky monastery interested directors, and they took a fascinating journey.  They showed not only the whole way to the temple, but also its interior decoration, as well as the beauty of these places. </p>

    <h2>  Rdeisky monastery, how to get </h2><p>  Any guide will tell you the address of the monastery: Novgorod region, Kholmsky district, Rdeisky state nature reserve.  But getting here is not easy.  Once upon a time, monks built wooden roads that even carriages could ride.  Today they have completely gone into the swamp, there remains only a direction that can be seen from the air.  Swamp swamp stretches for many kilometers, it covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone and a half Moscow.  True, there is an option to get through the air, but more often than not, lovers of Russian history prefer walking on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not far from the main road is the village of Vysokaya, now completely empty.  From there, about 16 kilometers along an impassable swamp.  For an unprepared person, this is a bad place, apparently because of this there are legends that the Rdeisky monastery does not allow everyone to approach.  Locals will be happy to tell you how to get to it, but everyone will warn you that it is almost impossible, because this place is sacred. </p>

    <h2>  Traveling by local transport </h2><p>  The nearest highway runs 12 kilometers from the temple.  But this does not stop lovers of antiquity and just believers.  In the off-season, when the swamp is especially difficult to pass, such trips are not recommended.  The rest of the time, wheeled transport is best left in the city and then set off on a tracked all-terrain vehicle or swamp.  An expedition to the temple sometimes leaves from the Hill, so you can go on a trip with them.  Locals will tell you many interesting stories related to this place.  Not everyone knows the swampy surroundings well, but those who grew up here know how to find secret paths and go along the most difficult routes.  If you talk to them, they will tell how during the war the whole area was defeated and mined by the Germans, only the Rdeisky Monastery remained intact.  History has saved it for posterity who ruthlessly plundered and today continue to destroy its former splendor.  They say that in order for the monastery to reveal its miraculous properties to you, you need to come on foot.  Not every first time will overcome this path, which serves as some kind of strength test. </p><h2>  Walking march </h2><p>  There have already been many such trips; examples can be found in the series of programs from the My Planet series.  Rdeisky monastery still excites people's minds.  Why was such a beautiful cathedral built in such a forgotten place of God?  But time passes, and the wonderful creation of human hands is increasingly inferior to the onslaught of nature.  Although the walls only frame the power of these places, it will exist without them. </p>

    <p>  And again, looking through the chronicles, we see confirmation that this monastery does not immediately let people in.  The expeditions went out more than once and circled endlessly through the endless swamp, never reaching the place.  You have to go back to the village and take a long journey on a tracked all-terrain vehicle, if the time of year allows you to do this.  It is already felt at the entrance that the place is not easy, and any person understands this, no matter how skeptic he may be. </p><p>  Here, inside the temple, another mystery lurks.  The altar of any Orthodox church is oriented east.  But even this rule does not work here.  The altar of this monastery is oriented north or northwest.  This cannot be an accident, because chapels and churches have been standing here from time immemorial, one in place of the other.  And each time the altar repeats the location of its predecessor.  Why, no one knows. </p><h2>  Winter road </h2><p>  When frost and ice bind the swamps, the Rdeisky Monastery most easily reveals its secrets.  How to get there in winter, we will tell you now.  Impassable swamps become a convenient route for any type of vehicle.  The direction for movement will be the summer track from the tracked all-terrain vehicle, it is very convenient to drive along it, you will not have to collect all the bumps.  But each such journey harms a unique biological object.  Remember that the swamp after the passage of <span>heavy equipment is</span> restored for many years, and the abundance of tourists simply does not leave him a chance.  Therefore, it is better to take a wonderful walk, now your legs will not fall into the swamp, and you can walk much more fun.  If in the summer these 16 kilometers are almost insurmountable, then in winter they can be walked briskly for three hours.  It is best if you choose a time to travel in late autumn, when the frost has already fettered the swamp well, but there is still little snow, and the trees have retained part of the foliage.  This time of year emphasizes the mystical charm of an abandoned monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Legends associated with this place </h2><p>  They most often prompt people to take this journey.  Local residents warn: you should not visit the Rdeisky Monastery for the sake of curiosity.  Legends tell a lot of stories about the disappearance and miraculous return of repentant people.  Much better here are pilgrims who go for knowledge to feel the history of Russian land and Christianity.  They will be happy to tell you about the miraculous healings that happened to people after visiting these places.  But not only to heal, but also to punish the sacred forces.  According to rumors, all who participated in the ruin of the monastery, even just scribbled a commemorative inscription on the wall, was in disaster. </p><p>  Therefore, local residents are very sensitive to their shrine, and every time they visit the temple, they leave a donation to restore it.  All of them hope that someday they will return the former greatness of the Rdeisky Monastery.  Legends emphasize the miraculous salvation of the temple during the Second World War.  He suffered, was left without a bell tower, but survived, as if some force majeure had taken him under his protection.  But here battles thundered to match the battles of Stalingrad.  From the first days of the war, the Germans fought for every piece of this muddy land.  And let today the Rdeisky Monastery does not appear at its best in front of visitors.  The photo will still remind you of an extraordinary place that lies outside of time and space.  It belongs to higher powers. </p>

    <h2>  Why go here </h2><p>  Indeed, many tourists want to ask this question.  For a thoughtful traveler, visiting a place of such power can serve as an impetus for a profound change, but those who come with the goal of drawing their initials on the wall are hard to understand.  This place is considered a cult, and the honors rendered to him must be appropriate. </p><p>  Monks live here, for whom the Rdeisky Monastery became the beginning of a new life.  The road to the temple for them is the personification of their path to God.  Despite the current state of the temple, they do not give up hope to restore it.  Their efforts created a small iconostasis where you can put a candle.  Recently, services began to be held here. </p><h2>  The current state of the monastery </h2><p>  Today the temple is still beautiful, but when you come closer, you will see how dilapidated it is.  In fact, these are already ruins with fragments of a stone wall.  A monastery cemetery with cast-iron crosses has also been preserved.  Once a white, marble-clad monastery became almost red, brick.  On the inner sides of the wall, elements of the painting are still preserved, but the domes are in a deplorable state.  They have huge holes, the gilding is removed, and trees grow on the roof.  The last murals and the remains of the marble iconostasis are destroyed and taken away by tourists. </p><h2>  Hill stop </h2><p>  Surely, after reading the article, you are determined to visit the Rdeisky Monastery.  The road to the temple can be a way of real healing and transformation for you.  As the locals say, you do not need a map to get to it.  If necessary, the road itself will lead you to the place.  To start the journey light, you can rent a room or a hotel room in the Hill.  On the way back, it will give you the opportunity to change clothes, wash and go home.  The city has lost its significance and today is not of interest to tourists. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists note that the Rdeisky Monastery is one of the few places on Earth that is endowed with such power.  Many talk about their own healings and changes in life.  All the pilgrims agree that this is a holy place, it will remain so even when the current temple crumbles from time to time.  Experienced travelers say that while he lives, it is worth visiting, feeling the local atmosphere and feeling the imperishability of something that is much older and taller than us.
