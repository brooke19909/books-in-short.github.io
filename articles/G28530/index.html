But before you see what Apple will cook for its fans this year, it will be interesting to consider all iPhones, starting with the very first device, released in 2007. </p><p>  And how many of these iconic phones and new innovative features, you know? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonelife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when the first iphone appeared" class="if uuid-3117182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3117182.jpg"></div><h2>  IPHONE (2007) </h2><p>  Not many will remember when the first iPhone appeared.  This happened back in 2007.  It is difficult to overestimate the impact that the iPhone had on the smartphone market: abandoning the keyboard in favor of the touch screen and adding advanced computer capabilities that were not there before, the manufacturer set the standard for this modern device.  ‚ÄúApple is going to reinvent the phone,‚Äù Steve Jobs said then, and he was right.  But in the original iPhone there were no third-party applications, no GPS, no videos. </p><h2>  IPhone 3G (2008) </h2><p>  When the first iPhone appeared, it lacked 3G support - the highest data transfer rate at that time.  It was added in the second generation of devices a year after the release of the first device (along with GPS). </p><p>  The first iPhone was warmly received, but thanks to the 3G model, people really began to see its long-term potential.  The simultaneous launch of the App Store has become a huge part of this turning point in the history of smartphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.t3.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="full review iphone" class="if uuid-3117183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3117183.jpg"></div><h2>  IPhone 3GS (2009) </h2><p>  It began the Apple tradition of adding the ‚ÄúS‚Äù at the end of the model name when a minor iPhone update occurs.  <span>The</span> 2009 <span>iPhone model</span> for the first time brought the ability to record video, the camera itself also received an update.  ‚ÄúS‚Äù stood for speed and reflected improvements in internal components.  In addition, voice control (not yet called Siri) was added. </p><h2>  IPhone 4 (2010) </h2><p>  If the iPhone 3GS was a small step forward, then iPhone 4 was a huge breakthrough - it has a new, more aesthetic and modern look.  According to technical specifications, the manufacturer significantly increased the number of pixels, while maintaining the same 3.5-inch display (the first Retina).  The model was the first iPhone with a front camera, as well as with several levels of multitasking.  Of all the iPhones, 4 is one of the most significant in the history of their development. </p><h2>  IPhone 4S (2011) </h2><p>  Apple is back with the minor S update for the 2011 iPhone 4S.  In this case, do not talk too much about the new specifications and features.  The camera received an upgrade to 8 megapixels.  Perhaps the biggest improvement in software (iOS 5.0) was the emergence of Siri, a digital assistant that today plays a very important role for all iPhones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  IPHONE 5 (2012) </h2><p>  Compared to earlier models, the iPhone 5 has received major updates.  It added an additional series of icons with a very high resolution screen, as well as a Lightning connector.  The smartphone had a lighter aluminum case.  This really was the beginning of the entrance to the modern era of the iPhone.  On the iOS side, users first saw the rather imperfect Apple Maps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.t3.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="latest brand iPhone" class="if uuid-3117184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3117184.jpg"></div><h2>  IPHONE 5C (2013) </h2><p>  In 2013, Apple decided to start producing not just one, but two iPhones every September.  The company provided customers with a variant of the iPhone 5C smartphone, very similar to the 5th model, but with minor external changes and turned out to be cheaper.  Although by some technologies it was completely new. </p><p>  iOS 7, launched at the same time, offered true multitasking for applications and introduced the Control Center for easier access to settings. </p><h2>  IPHONE 5S (2013) </h2><p>  IPhone 5S became the flagship model of 2013 with an updated design and a small feature called Touch ID, first introduced in the line of all iPhones.  Other innovations included the 64-bit A7 processor inside the phone and the architecture change that other manufacturers subsequently followed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  iOS 7 has also undergone visual changes: the model has bright icons and a translucent menu that still exist today. </p><h2>  IPHONE 6 (2014) </h2><p>  The iPhone 6, released by Apple in 2014, is still on sale and has a reputation for being a good phone.  Along with the next design update, the manufacturer increased the display size to 4.7 inches and added more pixels.  It is worth noting the introduction of NFC for Apple Pay and other services, as well as a significant camera update that gives better photo and video results than ever before.  Around the same time, an instruction appeared explaining how to find out the country of manufacture of an iPhone using the unique code present on the device.  At the same time, Apple warns that the original devices are assembled exclusively in China. </p><h2>  IPhone 6 PLUS (2014) </h2><p>  For a long time, Apple did not give in to the temptation to follow the trends of the large-screen smartphone industry, but nevertheless succumbed to market pressure, especially with the iPhone 6 Plus.  With a diagonal of 5.5 inches from corner to corner, this is the largest iPhone in history, approaching the size of an iPad mini.  The phone has certainly come a long way since 2007. </p><h2>  IPHONE 6S (2015) </h2><p>  Apple's iPhone 6S was not a surprise to many.  Each odd year led to the appearance of the ‚ÄúS‚Äù version of the phone, released in the previous season, with several updates, but with the same design. </p><p>  The iPhone 6S is almost identical to the 6th model of 2014 in the sense that you could hardly distinguish the difference between them visually.  The differences are a little extra thickness and weight.  From the hardware updates, the Force Touch option was added, thanks to which a new way to control the phone, and the original version of viewing photos (Live Photos) appeared. </p><h2>  IPhone SE (2016) </h2><p>  This device was a bit of a surprise.  Users expected a smaller iPhone with a lower price, but did not expect it to look like an iPhone 5, only with completely modern interiors.  Compared to other flagships, it was a true value for money, but could not compete with a huge number of Android alternatives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone country manufacturer how to find out" class="if uuid-3117185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3117185.jpg"></div><h2>  IPHONE 7 and 7+ (2016) </h2><p>  Many expected that the iPhone 7 will be one of the best phones of the year, and its strong rivalry with the competitor Galaxy S7 was perceived negatively.  At the same time, some users called the model the best of all iPhones.  A distinctive feature of the phone was the lack of a headphone slot.  Critics said such a radical change is addictive. </p><p>  On the plus side, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus included additional color options (matte and Jet Black), water and dust resistance, and the Apple A10 quad-core chip for maximum processing power. </p><h2>  iPhone 8 and 8 Plus (2017) </h2><p>  These devices have the ability to wirelessly charge, as well as a faster processor, improved camera and display.  According to reviews, there was a small percentage of iPhone 8 users experiencing problems such as freezing screens and lack of response to tapping.  Although they were not noted in 8 Plus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone sizes in centimeters" class="if uuid-3117186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3117186.jpg"></div><h2>  iPhone X (2017) </h2><p>  As a representative of the new generation of phones, Apple did everything possible to improve the iPhone X. Thanks to OLED-screen technology, color and image on the screen, the company brought the device to a new level.  According to reviews, these are the highest quality displays today. </p><p>  Face ID is also a new feature that uses face recognition technology to scan the user's face when unlocking the phone.  This is an interesting alternative to the standard password authentication method, which many are used to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="differences iPhone" class="if uuid-3117187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3117187.jpg"></div><h2>  iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max (2018) </h2><p>  The iPhone XS and XS Max are enhanced and updated versions of the X. The focus is on the Apple A12 Bionic processor.  It is the first 7nm chip available on the market that boasts six cores.  A full review of the iPhone shows that the XS is extremely waterproof and reliably protected from the effects of chlorinated and salt water, tea, wine, beer and various fruit juices. </p><h2>  iPhone XR (2018) </h2><p>  This device is equipped with a 6.1-inch LCD with a "liquid grid" for stunning color images.  It is his Apple that he considers "the most advanced and accurate in color reproduction in the industry."  Unlike XS, XR, it does not have an OLED screen.  Nevertheless, its visual effects are just as amazing.  Today it is the last brand of iPhone. </p><h2>  Final word </h2><p>  We can say that technology has evolved continuously.  The dimensions of iPhones in centimeters have also changed.  The first model had parameters of 115-61-11 millimeters.  Until the fourth generation of devices, their dimensions changed slightly.  The size of the iPhone 5 increased to 123-58-7.6 mm.  A further increase in the size of smartphones began with the 6th generation. </p>
