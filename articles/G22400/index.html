    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, no one is safe from unpleasant surprises in the process of rest.  This statement is also true for TT Hotels Pegasos Resort 5 *.  Reviews speak of the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  poor quality coffee; </li><li>  the territory at night is quite noisy, which makes it difficult to sleep even with the balcony closed; </li><li>  very mediocre cleaning; </li><li>  the set number of towels in the bathroom you will find only upon check-in, after which the maids forget to report them; </li><li>  Reception staff are reluctant to respond to comments about a room problem; </li><li>  the hotel guide too intrusively offers expensive excursions, and reacts inappropriately and rudely to failure; </li><li>  on the beach there are few sunbeds located under a canopy; </li><li>  despite the fact that smoking is prohibited in the territory, this rule is constantly violated, and the hotel staff does not react in any way; </li><li>  poor-quality milk in a restaurant. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt know which hotel to choose for your Turkish vacation, you can safely stay at TT Hotels Pegasos Resort 5 *.  Reviews of the hotel allow you to get a complete picture of the rest, in which the positive aspects significantly outweigh the minor flaws.  From the threshold you are surrounded by attention and care.  They will feed, quickly register and send to rest in the room.  However, if you find problems in your apartment, or you are not comfortable with the view from the window, you should not count on understanding and speedy solution to the problem.  Most likely, employees will pretend that they do not know not only Russian, but also English. </p><p>  Strikingly large can be called the territory of the TT Hotels Pegasos Resort 5 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists talk about a huge number of infrastructure facilities and places for walking.  And all thanks to the fact that the area is common for a complex of three luxury hotels.  The same can be said about the beach.  Despite the fact that each hotel has its own zone, in fact, you can use any of them.  It is also worth noting that the coast is in perfect condition.  Here you will not find garbage and seaweed carried by the waves on the shore.  In addition, the beach staff will assist you in finding a free sunbed, help to lay out a mattress or open an umbrella. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to animation.  Guests are entertained from early morning until late in the evening.  Both standard and most unexpected events are held here.  And special attention is paid to children's entertainment.  Having left your child in a mini-club, you can safely enjoy your vacation.  Kids will be busy all day with something interesting.  Nevertheless, if you are a fan of a quiet and relaxing holiday, then you are definitely not here.  Until late at night, discos and karaoke contests are held, which are heard in the room even with the balcony closed.  And given the huge number of vacationers with children, during the day you can‚Äôt find a quiet corner on the territory. </p><p>  Meals in this hotel deserve special attention.  Despite the fact that the range of dishes is not as wide as many are accustomed to seeing in the "fives", this is offset by the fact that the menu is updated daily.  I am glad that the needs of diabetics, vegetarians, those who are on a diet, as well as the smallest vacationers are taken into account.  Guests have free access to √† la carte restaurants upon prior reservation.  By the way, it is carried out using the touch panel, with which you not only confirm your intention to visit the restaurant, but also make an order in advance from the menu. </p>
