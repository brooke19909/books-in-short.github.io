  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which blender is good for cooking for kids</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many young mothers, especially these days, want to feed their baby puree or home-made juices.  Firstly, it is much cheaper than buying ready-made products in a store, and secondly, you can be sure of the quality of the products used.  To make mashed potatoes, a high-quality blender is best suited, which will combine many useful functions.  But in order to choose it, you need to decide on a few points to find out which blender is good and which is the best.  Help in this small tips given in this article. </p><p>  Which blender is better to choose: submersible, combined or stationary? </p><p>  Pros and cons of various models of popular brands such as Bosch, PHILIPS or Braun </p><p>  First of all, starting the choice of this convenient household appliance, we determine the number of functions that it will perform.  If you need to grind ice, nuts or other solid products, the stationary type is the best option.  Such a blender is mounted on the table and has several removable bowls, but its only drawback is that it does not chop vegetables well.  The pieces are very large.  Simply put, it combines the <span>functions of a food processor,</span> but the cost of such an acquisition will be much cheaper. </p><p>  The combined blender combines all the <span>positive qualities of</span> previous models.  The number of nozzles and the large volume of the bowl significantly expands its capabilities. </p><p>  Which blender is best to grind mixes, mashed potatoes and vegetables?  Of course, submersible.  Its main disadvantages include the need to hold the device in hands during operation.  But he does not take up much space in the kitchen and is ideal for preparing baby food at home. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Determine the power, which blender is the best. </p><p>  Do not forget about <span>the engine power, the</span> higher it is, the more solid products such a blender can grind.  The best option would be from 750 to 1000 watts.  Thanks to what it is possible to grind fruits, and even meat for forcemeat.  And the question is, which blender is good will fall off by itself. </p><ul><li>  Speed. </li></ul><p>  You can choose not only the required power, but also the number of speeds.  And how to understand which blender is good, with five or ten speeds.  If it is necessary to knead the dough, it will be better to choose a device with a large number of speeds so that during operation you can switch them.  Smooth switching will be optimal, which will reduce the amount of load on the product motor and increase the service life. </p><p>  Choose a bowl. </p><p>  What else is important when deciding which blender is good.  Be sure to pay attention to what material the bowl is made of.  The best option would be plastic, which is not only perfectly washed, but its surface is antiseptic and is not exposed to the effects of the crushed products.  Of course, the glass bowl for a blender can be considered the best, but there is always the possibility of breaking it.  The plastic bowl is quite fragile and can burst at any time.  But if you choose which blender is good with a plastic or plastic bowl, it is best to give preference to the first.  Since it can withstand prolonged use and is easy to clean. </p><p>  Any <span>good blender</span> has several nozzles, a body and a bowl of dense hygienic plastic.  Nozzles will chop even the hardest foods, such as nuts or hard vegetables.  The quality of the material from which the blender is made will affect its durability.  The denser the material, the longer the life of the product.  And the problem is, which blender is better to choose will disappear by itself, since it will be possible to buy a model with many functions and for little money.  Have a good shopping! </p>
