Guest houses, Lazarevskoye: prices, photos, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Small resort villages on the Black Sea coast have recently become more and more popular among Russian tourists.  Lazarevskoye also belongs to them.  This village was founded a very long time ago - in 1869.  From Sochi to it is only about 50 km towards Tuapse. </p><h2>  Private Sector Features </h2><p>  Rooms in large hotels in Lazarevsky, like in any other resort village of the Black Sea coast, are expensive.  Therefore, most tourists prefer to rent a house in the private sector. </p><p>  During perestroika, once the rich Black Sea collective farms and state farms went bankrupt, local residents had to look for other sources of income.  It was then in Lazarevsky that the first mini-hotels began to open.  This allowed their owners to somehow <span>make ends meet,</span> since there were not too many tourists at that time. </p><p>  Times have changed, Russians' income has grown, and hundreds of vacationers have reached Lazarevskoye.  Private guesthouses have become much more comfortable.  Now Lazarevsky's mini-hotels offer tourists inexpensive and at the same time quite comfortable rooms. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  What exactly can a guest house cost in a village?  Lazarevskoye is a resort where you can relax without spending too much money.  You can rent a house in a mini-hotel for only 300-1500 rubles.  It all depends on the type of room and the degree of remoteness of the hotel from the sea.  At the height of the holiday season, and this is July and August, prices may rise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is better to book rooms in advance.  Finding housing on arrival in these months can turn into a real problem.  In September and June it is easier to rent a hotel room, but without booking you will most likely have to pay more.  Usually, those who want to relax on the Black Sea coast find housing listings on the Internet.  Find the most suitable guest house.  Lazarevskoye, in which housing prices are quite affordable, is one of the most popular resort villages, and there are plenty of advertisements for renting housing on the network.  After choosing your favorite hotel option, call its owners (about two months in advance) and book a room.  You will come to Lazarevskoye, they will meet you and bring you to your place. </p>

    <p>  You should not especially trust the photos and pictures presented by the owners of the mini-hotels if you see a very chic guest house.  Lazarevskoye is still not Antalya.  Housing in the private sector of the village is quite convenient and in most cases does not cause any complaints among tourists.  However, some owners of mini-hotels still try to embellish the situation and charge a price by displaying photos of expensive European apartments found on the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room Features </h2><p>  Having rented a house in an inexpensive mini-hotel, you are likely to be able to secure a very decent rest.  Lazarevskoye, whose guest houses are quite comfortable, is a pretty quiet and clean village itself.  The houses rented out are usually located on cozy, beautiful streets.
