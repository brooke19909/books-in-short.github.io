Their wide capabilities, innovative design, high technology conquer the hearts of domestic buyers.  As you know, "apple" devices are distinguished by a high level of reliability and a long service life.  However, unforeseen problems can happen, for example, the iPad does not charge.  Of course, such a breakdown makes the owner nervous. </p><p>  By connecting the power adapter to the device and seeing a message on the screen that charging is not happening, you immediately start to panic.  But professionals do not recommend running to a service center.  First you need to find out the reason why such a crash occurs in the system.  To do this, it is advisable to test not only the charger itself, but also the iPad.  Proper diagnosis is a guarantee of stability. </p><p>  Within the framework of this article, the most common reasons when it is not possible to charge an "apple" device will be considered.  We also offer several ways to solve this problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad does not charge" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1892325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  IPad does not charge - what to do? </h2><p>  All gadget owners know which icon is displayed while charging.  There is a battery icon on the main screen.  When a charger is connected to the iPad, lightning appears on it.  If one day this does not happen, then you need to look for a reason. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Studying the reviews of both ordinary users and professional masters, we can conclude that the most common are problems with the adapter, wires or outlet.  Also, do not rule out the banal clogging of the connector.  Sometimes a charging problem can occur due to mechanical damage or moisture penetration into the device.  And finally, the most serious damage cannot be ruled out - the failure of the power controller. </p><p>  So, let's deal with each cause in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad does not charge what to do" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1892326.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <h2>  We are looking for a reason in the wire </h2><p>  If the <span>iPad does not charge,</span> then the first action of the owner should be to check the charger, or rather the cable.  It is necessary to inspect it for damage.  This must be done carefully, since the violation of insulation can be microscopic.  It is also recommended to check the contacts in order to exclude the presence of problem areas. </p><p>  Another important point is the brand of cable.  All ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices recognize only original accessories.  If they do not have MFI certification, the system will automatically lock the iPad. </p><p>  In order to exclude this reason, you need to check the cable by connecting it to another device.  If charging does not take place on it, it is necessary to replace the wire with a new one.  But if a message appears on the iPad screen stating that this accessory is not supported, then most likely the cable is simply a fake.  It is recommended that you pay attention before buying so that the package says: Made for iPod, iPad, iPhone.  This label is used if the product is manufactured by another company that is an official partner of Apple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why does not the ipad charge" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1892328.jpg" width="502"></div>

Sometimes it can be so banal that sometimes it becomes very funny.  The fact is that in their reviews, users often describe situations when they used an inoperative outlet to charge the gadget.  In order to exclude this, it is necessary to connect another device through it, which is in working condition. </p><p>  The situation with the adapter is a little more difficult.  If possible, then you need to try it on a smartphone or another tablet.  You can also disassemble the adapter in order to visually check the status of the contacts. </p><h2>  Controller out of order </h2><p>  One of the serious breakdowns when the iPad stopped charging may be a breakdown of the power controller.  Most often, such a malfunction occurs with those tablets that connect to an uncertified cable. </p><p>  Unfortunately, this repair will cost the owner expensive.  We can say that he will be very lucky if the gadget is still under warranty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad is slowly charging" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1892327.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Tablet damage </h2><p>  There are many different situations when the iPad does not charge.  The reviews that are presented on the Web often describe situations in which the tablet received mechanical damage.  This happens quite often.  Many users have encountered this problem.  In this situation, the solution can be only one - go to the service center. </p><p>  Also, charging problems in the iPad can occur when moisture gets inside the case.  Contacts begin to oxidize, resulting in breakdowns.  In such a situation, you must be on the lookout, as moisture can provoke a malfunction that will completely disable the device.  As in the first case, the owners will have to seek help from qualified craftsmen. </p><h2>  Computer charging </h2><p>  On the Web, users often raise the topic that the iPad is slowly charging from the computer.  This problem does not arise due to breakdown, but in connection with the technical characteristics.  The fact is that for a tablet, unlike a smartphone, much more energy is needed.  When the screen is on, charging will stand still. </p><p>  If the owner is interested in the time period during which the battery restores its resource to 100%, then it is recommended to abandon this method by switching the device to a power outlet.  In another case, you can leave the tablet connected via a USB cable, but do not forget to turn off the screen.  This method of charging the battery will take a very long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad shows that it is charging but not charging" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1892329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  IPad shows that it is charging but not charging </h2><p>  After keeping the gadget connected to the power supply the whole night, users may find in the morning that it has simply not been charged.  In such a situation, the cause must be sought in the battery.  As a rule, you will need to reconnect the gadget to power in order to make sure the charging icon appears or not.  If everything is displayed in standard form, then you need to wait about one hour.  After that, check whether the charge value has changed.  If this does not happen, then you need to go to the service center.  It will carry out diagnostics and determine exactly what the problem is: in the battery or the electronic part of the gadget. </p><h2>  The plug is clogged.  Professional Tips </h2><p>  So, having figured out the reasons why the iPad is not charging, you need to try to fix the breakdown.  The first thing that can help in this matter is cleaning the charger connector.  Professionals advise using a regular toothpick for this.  All actions must be very neat, as damaging the contacts is quite simple.  However, if this did not help, and all the other methods have already been tried, then you will have to go to the service center for expert help. </p>
