How did the procedure evolve?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The evolutionary development of man took place in parallel with the social.  What recorded in culture some very controversial phenomena, deviations of consciousness of large groups of people.  Modern schoolchildren can only read in textbooks what it means to ‚Äúscatter‚Äù.  Although the interpretation of the word in the lessons of history and biology is slightly different, it constantly provokes heated discussions both about the need for the procedure and about the mental health of the participants. </p><h2>  Fundamental meaning </h2><p>  What are you talking about?  If we talk about the terminology of synonyms, then accumulation is castration.  The procedure is so painful that it was one of the first in which anesthesia was started so that the patient did not die due to unbearable pain before it was completed.  The bottom line is to remove the sex glands from the body to level the process of producing the corresponding hormones.  Although there are alternative solutions to the problem of over-breeding: </p><ul><li>  removal of the uterus - for females; </li><li>  tubal ligation - similarly; </li><li>  ligation of spermatic cord in males. </li></ul><p>  It is important to understand that initially the operation was carried out exclusively on animals to cull cattle and / or maintain a clean line.  That was exactly castration.  But then what does it mean ‚Äúscribbled‚Äù?  This word in the narrow sense was used in relation to a special social group with specific moral principles and religious views. </p><div class="photo" data-original="precisioncanada.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blasting tools" class="if uuid-3027609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42817/3027609.jpg"></div><h2>  Spiritual development </h2><p>  In particular, the 18th century for Russia was marked by the appearance of a scepter sect, who, in their desire to achieve enlightenment and spiritual perfection, performed ‚Äúwhitening‚Äù.  It seemed to them that all sinful thoughts were the result of carnal desires, therefore they perceived the postulate of killing the flesh too literally - by removing certain parts of the body that were considered responsible for the rampant lifestyle, fornication. </p><p>  Although sexual activity decreased due to a decrease in the concentration of hormones, adults even with the removal of the sex glands are quite capable of maintaining a psycho-emotional attachment to sex life.  Despite the capture of the founder of the ‚Äúskoptic sect,‚Äù Kondraty Selivanov, his origin and motives for creating the organization remained unclear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="what does it mean" class="if uuid-3027602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42817/3027602.jpg"></div><h2>  21st Century Realities </h2><p>  In secular society, what it means to <em>‚Äúscoff</em> for religious reasons,‚Äù few people know.  Similar procedures in relation to people are considered inhuman and immoral.  Although there are programs to combat pedophilia that offer voluntary chemical castration or drugs to suppress desires.  They pass without surgical intervention in the body, so they have little in common with the classical meaning of the term. </p>
