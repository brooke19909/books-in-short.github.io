    <p>  If you have made the wrong date and time settings, a notification will constantly pop up on the screen.  Therefore, this issue must be resolved immediately. </p><h2>  Auto tuning </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the set date and time settings may be reset.  Therefore, it is best to use automatic ones.  To do this, specify the screen extension and set the refresh rate.  Other settings will be the same as on Android devices. </p><h2>  Main sections </h2><p>  Among the main functions that are in the console, the following can be distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Media  This section contains programs that allow you to watch videos, listen to music and watch photos while connecting the drive.  A special player is already installed in the section - MX Player.  It is the most common and suitable for this console.  After turning off the drive, all files can be played.  If the built-in player does not fit, you can install another. </li><li>  TV.  This section contains programs with which you can view video files online.  One of these utilities is YouTube. </li><li>  Browsers  There are programs for accessing the Internet, thanks to which you can freely access social networks, download videos, music, photos and so on.  What to do if the standard browser is not satisfied?  To do this, go to the Apps section and install a new one.  If necessary, it can be downloaded from the Internet. </li><li>  Games.  As a rule, in this section there are some of the most popular games.  To expand this list, you need to download games through certain applications. </li><li>  Apps  In addition to many browsers, in this section there are other programs that are aimed at simplifying the work.  For example, cards, mail, etc. Also on the menu is "Play Market", where you can download a lot of useful applications and games.  The notification center is located in the lower right corner. </li><li>  Watching TV.  If all the programs and sections are tired, then you can just watch your favorite TV shows on TV.  A lot of channels will be presented to your attention, on which you can watch everything from films to various sporting events. </li></ol><p>  On the main screen, the time and date, the status of the wireless network, the status of the connection of drives are displayed.  On the right side of the screen there is a menu where you can get acquainted with other functions of the operating system.  For example, adjust the volume or turn off unnecessary devices.  After pressing the shutdown button, the prefix does not turn off completely, but goes into standby mode.  You can activate it with the mouse movement. </p><h2>  The disadvantages of the prefix "Smart TV" </h2><p>  In addition to the mass of positive qualities, there are negative points: </p><ul><li>  When viewing video in <span>MKV</span> or AVI <span>format,</span> there are problems with the image, as well as sound, it is written on the screen that the format was not found, although the prefix should play all formats. </li><li>  Games of rather poor quality, they are significantly different from those that are available for computers or consoles such as Sony Playstation. </li><li>  You can watch some films and videos only upon request, that is, to watch them you will need to pay a certain amount. </li><li>  The problem with the browser, since the standard browser is not suitable for social networks, it is inconvenient to watch news and photos, as well as chat with friends.  We can say that the control function is not finalized.  In addition, movies and videos cannot be played.  The main reason is the insufficient amount of internal memory on the Smart TV set-top box. </li></ul><h2>  Smart TV: reviews </h2><p>  Many users are satisfied with the prefix Smart TV.  First of all, it significantly saves people money.  No need to buy a TV with firmware and wireless connection.
