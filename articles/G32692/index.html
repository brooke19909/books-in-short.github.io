Two clusters were allocated for the construction of these structures - Gorny and Coastal, in the Imereti Lowland. </p><p>  Olympic facilities in Sochi were ready for an important event already in mid-2013.  The last was a stadium called Fisht.  Before the main competition, many Olympic facilities in Sochi were tested at international competitions. </p><h2>  Description of the Coastal Cluster </h2><p>  The central object of this site is rightfully the <span>Olympic Park.</span>  This is a huge complex, which includes both Olympic facilities in Sochi and the park area.  The cluster accommodates up to seventy-five thousand people at a time. </p><p>  The list of Olympic venues located in the above territory is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Fisht Stadium. </li><li>  Adler Arena is a speed skating center. </li><li>  Big ice palace. </li><li>  Ice Arena "Puck." </li><li>  "Iceberg" - the palace of winter sports. </li><li>  The Ice Cube is the center of curling. </li></ul><p>  Now let's talk about each object in more detail. </p><h2>  Fisht </h2><p>  The capacity of the facility is forty thousand people.  The ceremonial opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic and <span>Paralympic Games,</span> as well as the awarding of athletes were held at it.  After a grand event, the stadium is used for football matches.  All Olympic facilities in Sochi are distinguished by originality of architectural ideas.  The above stadium is no exception.  In shape, it resembles a rocky cliff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  "Big" - a unique ice palace </h2><p>  This facility has become a venue for hockey matches.  It can accommodate up to twelve thousand spectators at a time.  After the Olympics, concerts and other mass entertainment events are held there.  For the first time, this ice palace opened its doors back in 2012.  International test events were held there.  The building of this object looks futuristic thanks to the huge silver dome. </p>

    <h2>  "Washer" </h2><p>  This small ice arena was also intended for hockey competitions.  Its capacity is seven thousand people.  During the Paralympics, the "Puck" has become a venue for sledge hockey competitions.  Very interesting is the fact that this object can be disassembled and reassembled.  This means that it can be used in any other city in the Russian Federation, and not just in Sochi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ice cube </h2><p>  On the basis of this sports center, Olympic curling competitions were held.  It began to be used in 2012.  The construction of Olympic facilities in Sochi implied the construction of structures unusual in their architectural concept.  The Ice Cube is a prime example of a design fantasy flight.  An unusual building is considered the embodiment of conciseness, lightness and solemnity.  This curling center is also a mobile collapsible type building. </p><h2>  "Iceberg" </h2><p>  This <span>winter</span> sports <span>palace</span> occupies a leading position among other facilities erected for the Olympics in Sochi.  On its basis, competitions were held for medals in figure skating, as well as short track.  Twelve thousand spectators can be accommodated in its stands in order to observe the progress of the competition.  The exterior of the palace, in fact, resembles a huge block of ice.  This explains the name of the object - "Iceberg". </p>
