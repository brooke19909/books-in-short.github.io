  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital television decoder</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  World science does not stand still and every year more and more innovations are introduced into our lives.  The standards of digital image and sound on the Internet are no longer news, but this type of broadcasts reached TVs of the most ordinary residents, for example, our grandparents.  However, older TV models that are not equipped with a special built-in device will not be able to display a new image.  It was for these purposes that a decoder for digital television was invented. </p><p>  The device itself is small in size and connects to the TV itself via a SCART or HDM connector.  If your digital TV decoder is not built-in, then it may be equipped with some useful additional features.  For example, in order not to miss a favorite match, series or program, it is enough to postpone the broadcast and returning, continue from the same place.  This is like pausing while watching a disc.  Also, the USB port will not be superfluous for older models, which will make it possible to view everything that you want directly from a removable media, or, as is commonly said, flash drives. </p><p>  Of course, these are not all the advantages of this device, but its main capabilities are to adjust the digital signal to the capabilities of the receiver (in this case, the TV).  The digital television decoder is correctly called the ‚Äúdigital television receiver‚Äù.  Although, of course, the first name is more understandable to ordinary people. </p><p>  Digital television is received according to several standards: DVB-C (via cable), DVB-T (signal from a ground antenna, for example, installed in an apartment or on a balcony), DVB-S (satellite broadcasting) and DVB-H (for those who like to watch Broadcast via mobile phone).  However, for those who need several types of signals, universal devices have been developed that work according to several standards. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, we have already figured out that the reception of digital television can occur according to different standards and that the image will be clear and bright, and the sound will be polyphonic.  But why do we need a switch to digital television ?!  Indeed, many people have enough analog quality.  This is business.  And one of the most popular sources of income in the modern world is mobile telephone communications.  Now the signal of cellular networks has covered almost the entire surface of the globe and continues to spread.  But the operators are no longer sufficiently allocated lines for them, and new ones can be provided only by the exception or transfer to other standards of something that they use every day.  For this very reason, many countries have already switched exclusively to digital broadcasting and absolutely do not regret it.  Until 2015, Russia and Ukraine must also make the full transition to digital television and radio broadcasting. </p><p>  Now let's talk about the material costs that will have to incur to every person whose TV is not the latest model.  On average, they promise not to overstate the price of a decoder for digital television, and now it will cost around $ 40-50.  For those who cannot purchase such a device, due to their low income, a program has been introduced that annually allocates a fairly impressive amount for the purchase of decoders.  I want to believe that everything will be exactly as promised and absolutely all users of television services will be able to watch their favorite channels.  By the way, until 2015, all channels are required to transfer their signal to digital broadcasting.  But at the moment, even half of the existing domestic television and radio companies have not switched to the new standard.  But this is not a hindrance to the new business - did not have time ?!  Do not work! </p><p>  So strictly, but surely, we are moving to a new level and culture of television broadcast reception.  By the way, soon it will even be possible to order video without leaving the TV, but using only the remote control to it and the decoder. </p><p>  We wish your life to improve with the new quality of television! </p>
