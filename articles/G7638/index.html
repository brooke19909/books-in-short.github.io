    <p>  The only drawback, according to many tourists, is the fact that the rooms in the hotel complex do not have Wi-Fi access.  According to our compatriots, the Cleopatra hotel (Egypt, Hurghada), which we are reviewing, belongs to the five-star category, therefore, its management could pay increased attention to the availability of the Internet throughout the territory.  However, this did not become a serious problem.  It was possible to use the Internet, according to the guests, in the lobby near the reception. </p><h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  As for the location of this hotel complex, the majority of tourists were satisfied with it.

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to tourists, no matter in which building you live, you can reach the sea in a few minutes.  In addition, the path runs through the most beautiful territory, so that this will not cause any problems.  Our compatriots found the beach of the hotel complex very large and well-equipped.  According to them, places and sunbeds with umbrellas are enough for everyone here.  In this case, there is no need to get up early in the morning and run to the beach to take a deck chair.  There is also a bar where you can order alcoholic and soft drinks, coffee, as well as a snack during the day. </p><p>  Hotel Cleopatra (Hurghada) has a sandy beach.  You can enter the water either directly from the shore, or from a pier or pontoon.  However, in the first case, as tourists say, you will have to go a fairly long distance in shallow water until you reach depth.  Near the shore there is a large coral reef.  So be sure to take with you from home or buy a snorkeling mask on the spot.  The reef is inhabited by various colorful fish and other marine inhabitants. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Many tourists, they said, had a great time at one of the pools in the hotel complex.  During the day, a team of animators works here, offering everyone to do water aerobics, gymnastics, play water polo, volleyball or shoot archery.  In the evenings, entertainment and a disco are organized. </p>
