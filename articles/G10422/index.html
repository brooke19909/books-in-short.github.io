    <p>  The power of the equipment is 1200 watts.  The device works due to the brush motor.  You can work at an angle of 90 ¬∞, delving into the material by 65 mm.  If you set the angle equal to 45 ¬∞, then the maximum cut width will be 205 mm.  Among the additional functions, it is necessary to highlight the adjustment of the depth of cut.  The manufacturer supplied the equipment with a 2 m cable. The device weighs 13.5 kg.  It allows horizontal movement.  Left and right the table can be adjusted by 47 ¬∞. </p><p>  Before purchasing a Metabo KGS 216 M cross-cut saw, you should pay attention to the fact that it does not have a soft start.

    <p>  The cross-cut saw Metabo KGS 216 M must be serviced from time to time.  Before starting work, make sure that the protective devices are in good condition.  When sawing, the workpiece must be fixed in the jig.  Elements that cannot be fixed are not worth sawing.  The workpiece should be pressed to the table during sawing, it should not be skewed.  It is important to exclude the possibility of blocking the saw blade, as this can lead to an accident. </p><p>  If it is necessary to make a direct cut, then the transport lock must be removed.  The saw blank must be turned up.  The workpiece should be pressed against the stop and clamped using the tool.  If the element has an impressive width, then the workpiece must be pulled towards the operator.  The saw head must be pressed against the workpiece with some force so that the engine speed is not too low.  The workpiece should be sawed at a time.  The switch is released slowly and the saw head is slowly retracted to the upper position. </p><h2>  Features of changing the saw blade </h2><p>  Miter saw Metabo KGS 216 M, the characteristics of which you can find in the instructions or in the article, may require replacement of the saw blade.  After cutting, the blade may remain hot.  He should be allowed to cool.  Hot saw blade must not be cleaned with flammable liquids.  Even if the saw blade does not rotate, there is a risk of cuts. </p><p>  When tightening and loosening the clamp screw, the guard must be above the saw blade.  The craftsman should wear gloves when changing the blade.  The saw head must be locked in the up position.  You can use the lock button to lock the saw blade.  The safety stop must be loosened and the protective cover moved upward while holding it.  The outer flange is carefully removed, like the saw blade from the shaft.  The retractable clamping casing must be closed again. </p><h2>  Operator recommendations </h2><p>  Miter saw Metabo KGS 216 M, an overview of which is presented in the article, can be used for cutting long workpieces.  In this case, suitable supports must be installed on both sides of the tool.  When it is necessary to cut at an angle, the workpiece should be held to the right of the saw blade. </p><p>  The miter saw Metabo KGS 216 M copes with sawing fine workpieces very well, while using an additional stop, which can be a suitable board, strengthened to the stop of the tool.  If we are talking about cutting a curved board, it should be attached to the stop with the curved part out.  Do not start sawing workpieces installed on the edge.  They should be placed flat. </p><h2>  Possible malfunctions and solutions </h2><p>  You must remember that accidents related to the operation of the equipment described are most often associated with malfunctions, so you must remove the power plug before each troubleshooting.  After completing such work, you need to carry out the installation and make sure that the safety devices are working. </p><p>  If you notice that the trimming function is missing, the transport lock may be locked.  To do this, the safety stop is removed and loosened.  When the machine is faced with the problem of power reduction, the saw blade must be replaced.  It may become dull and have side burns.  Sometimes it happens that the disk is simply not suitable for the material. </p><p>  Consumers who use the Metabo KGS 216 M cross-cut saw sometimes experience intense vibration.  Deformation of the saw blade can lead to this.  It should be replaced.  Incorrect installation of the drive sometimes leads to vibration.  If you encounter a problem with the difficulty of running the turntable, then sawdust can cause this, which simply needs to be removed. </p><h2>  Troubleshooting Tips </h2><p>  Even when using the highest quality power tools, some problems sometimes arise.  If you encounter diverging surfaces in the lateral stop, this may affect sawing accuracy.  The operator therefore gets a different result when filing right or left.  If you have a miter saw Metabo KGS 216 M, a photo of which you can find in the article, then you need to remove the emphasis from it, and then prepare a piece of getinax.  Its surface should be even and smooth. </p><p>  From the material, patterns should be made so that they turn out to be slightly larger than the surfaces to be leveled.  The material is laid on a reference base, for example, on the surface of a countertop.  A layer of epoxy is applied to both surfaces of the stop; getinax must be laid on top.  As soon as the resin dries, you need to trim the excess, this will allow you to get an even plastic coating. </p><h2>  Recommendations for repairing the engine and gearbox </h2><p>  Miter saw Metabo KGS 216 M, reviews of which were presented above and can help you make the right choice, may encounter a problem of engine or gearbox breakdown.  This is indicated by the lack of disk rotation.  Sometimes a burning smell starts to come out of the tool body, the saw does not gain power, and sincere in the engine area. </p><p>  If you notice that the tool has become unstable, then you should conclude that the gearbox or motor is out of order.  The mounting screws of the motor housing must be unscrewed and the disk removed, and then the gearbox removed.  The operator should twist the shaft; it should not rotate.  All elements should be checked for integrity - if unsuitable elements were found, then they should be replaced.  You may need to clean the grease and apply a new one.  The motor housing is disassembled, the rotor and stator are checked for short circuits.  Brushes and collector should be inspected.  If one of the parts was at least 40% worn out, then both must be replaced. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before choosing any power tool, it is important to decide what loads will be placed on the equipment.  If you plan to use the device for domestic purposes, then the unit of the same class is perfect.  Typically, such saws do not have functions for which you have to overpay.  Semi-professional models are great for craftsmen who use the tool every day.  However, such saws are not able to endure such loads as professional devices.  The latter are ready to work every day without a break for several hours. </p>
