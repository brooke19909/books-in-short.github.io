    <h2>  The village of Blagoveshchenskaya </h2><p>  Popular among Russian tourists, the village, which locals call Blagoveshchenka, became part of the municipality - the resort of Anapa.  The village is located on a sand spit between the Kiziltash and <span>Vityazevsky estuaries,</span> one and a half kilometers from the Black Sea coast. </p><p>  This arrangement has created a unique microclimate that contributes to a wonderful vacation on the sea coast with children and the healing of the body.  Estuaries have more <span>gentle shores,</span> unlike the open sea, while over a thousand-year history huge deposits of healing mud have gathered in them.  For this reason, many mud baths have been built on the banks of the estuaries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center road builder Anapa" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1501883.jpg" width="600"></div>

Water in the estuaries warms up much faster than in the sea.  Its temperature in July rises to +27 ° C.  The air warms up to an average of +28 ° C. </p><p>  Blagoveshchenskaya has a beautiful sandy beach, a gentle entrance to the sea, which allows you to relax here with very young children.  This is the only beach in our country formed by natural sand deposits.  It stretched for forty kilometers from Anapa to the village of Veselovka (Amber). </p><h2>  Rest on the basis of "Roadman" </h2><p>  This wonderful place is well known to many Russian tourists.

    <p>  Kids feel comfortable both on the beach and at the base, where there is the opportunity to ride on a swing, play on specially equipped playgrounds, ride bicycles. </p><h2>  What to see and what to do? </h2><p>  The Dorozhnik recreation center does not offer any special entertainment to its guests.  In the afternoon, most vacationers spend time on the beach or leave for Anapa to see the famous resort city.  Travel agencies organize excursions and take tourists to Anapa's memorable places by bus.  Near the beach there is a small water park that will be interesting for children. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Roadman", Anapa: reviews </h2><p>  This recreation center receives a lot of reviews, and for the most part they are positive.  Many come here for several years in a row.  Those travelers who came here for the first time note that at first glance they were fascinated by a well-groomed, beautiful and very green area.  Here, large and small flower beds, flowerbeds, and front gardens are routed everywhere. </p><p>  But the main advantage of the base, no doubt, is the clean beach and sea.  It is never too crowded and noisy here, as in other resorts of the Black Sea coast.  Many kind words are addressed to the staff and administration of this base.  Most vacationers believe that the team here is friendly, highly professional and very friendly. </p><p>  Tourists who book rooms in advance are sometimes surprised that immediately before the trip the administrator calls them back and wonders if the wishes of the order have changed.  It is no less pleasant when, before leaving, employees are interested in whether there are any complaints or suggestions for improving the service. </p><p>  Small flaws do exist.  Some tourists believe that it is necessary to develop infrastructure and think out a system of recreational activities for adults and children.  In addition, the base lacks a pool. </p>
