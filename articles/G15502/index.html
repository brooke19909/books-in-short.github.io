Its name is Pioneer DEH-9450UB.  From the many devices of this company, it is distinguished by the use of a rubber gasket in the encoder.  In addition, the radio received special levers for rewinding.  As a rule, buttons were previously used for such purposes.  The most outstanding advantage of this device is the sound.  Consumers note that the reproduction is as bright, dense and collected as possible.  And this characteristic is relevant even with the fact that excess noise sometimes appears in the higher frequencies. </p><p>  User-friendly interface, excellent quality of the display, which fits three lines - attract additional customers.  Sometimes, when viewed from an angle, the color rendering becomes worse, but not critical.  In terms of functionality, this model does not stand out.  The front part is made organically.  The model is suitable for those who prefer an excellent appearance and high-quality sound. </p><h2>  Instrument Specifications </h2><p>  The Pioneer DEH-9450UB was launched in 2012.  Its average cost is 12 thousand - 13 thousand rubles.  Now it is extremely difficult to find in stores, but still some outlets offer this model.  The display is an LCD matrix.  Built-in equalizer.  Available backlight keys and screen.  The front panel has a removable shape.  If the sound is compressed, then it can always be restored.  In order to connect to gadgets from Apple, you must use a special cable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 9450ub" class="if" height="171" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1633943.jpg" width="600"></div>

She is one of the few officially entered the Russian market.  As a rule, such equipment is either sold illegally or must be purchased directly from the manufacturing country. </p><p>  Appearance is liked by many buyers.  The Pioneer DEH-9450UB radio tape recorder received the most solid and high-quality design.  The front panel ‚Äúdrives off‚Äù on the motor is almost silent.  It is possible to change the backlight of the buttons and screen.  The latter has excellent image quality.  Consumers note that the management of equipment is as easy as possible.  However, there are no radio presets, and the right trough, necessary to regulate songs and stations, has not too good ergonomics.  The key for changing the volume is successfully implemented, with it there is no discomfort when using. </p><p>  After turning on the radio for the first time, she immediately suggests choosing the necessary settings.  Unfortunately, the menu in Russian is not implemented, and the technique does not recognize the letters of this alphabet in song titles.  This is a definite minus, especially for those who do not know English well. </p><p>  The Pioneer DEH-9450UB has an integrated equalizer.  It is five-lane and graphic.  By itself, the radio is promising.  There are three pieces of preamps in it, at the back there are a couple of special slots for USB.  If desired, you can use the standard buttons that are attached to the steering wheel. </p><p>  The sound reproduction of the device is liked by almost all consumers.  We will talk more about him below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  According to consumers and professionals, this Pioneer DEH-9450UB receiver sounds good.  It is noted that it has excellent bass, which stably gives a high volume to reproduced compositions.  The middle range is somewhat overestimated in low sound transmission, so the snare can be heard well and dynamically.  All details of this interval are saturated and complete.  But the high frequencies are disappointing, and all expectations are not met.  Noise is often heard, which spoils the overall impression of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 9450ub review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1633945.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The radio tape recorder received standard dimensions: 17.8 √ó 5 cm. The front panel looks strictly.  It has special control details that are highlighted.  There are no ports and inputs.  You can find them on the back of the Pioneer DEH-9450UB.  Reviews help to understand that they are all located as well as possible and are in harmony with each other.  Their location is ergonomic and easy to get used to.  Moreover, all elements are highlighted.  It is immediately evident that there are no special buttons for rewinding compositions.  For this purpose, certain levers were built. </p><p>  The buttons installed on the Pioneer DEH-9450UB device (a review will help to understand all the nuances of the device) have a hard move.  In order to adjust the volume, you must use the encoder.  It has a rubber gasket. </p><p>  Of course, you need to pay attention to navigation on memory cards.  It is implemented as successfully as possible.  To find a specific track, you need to press the button with a magnifying glass, and using the rewind levers, as well as the Enter key, you can select the desired folder and melody. </p><p>  Equalization is easy to configure in the corresponding menu.  There are 7 presets.  You can choose any.  If desired, it is allowed to independently adjust the location of the curve on the equalizer. </p><p>  The radio works with rewind levers.  They search for active frequencies.  If any of them needs to be saved, it will be enough to click on the Enter button.  An antenna that allows you to find radio stations is located on the back of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 9450ub reviews" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1633946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The screen cannot be called the strongest side of the device, but consumers generally do not complain.  It has one drawback.  The downside is that colors change at an angle.  The contrast level is also slightly reduced.  If the viewing angle is made as sharp as possible, then it will sharply turn red.  The rest are no complaints. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car radio pioneer deh 9450ub" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1633947.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages - according to consumers </h2><p>  Like any other device, the Pioneer DEH-9450UB radio tape recorder (the instruction is included) has its advantages.  Consider them. </p><p>  Consumers note the excellent assembly and materials that are used in this device.  You can change the color of the backlight.  The encoder is well implemented, you can use it with ease.  Appearance is the most successful, it is modest and solid at the same time.  It is possible to turn off the display backlight.  It will light up for a few seconds only when switching the track.  If desired, you can always connect a USB flash drive.  The maximum amount of external media is 32 GB.  The switch, although it has a slight backlash, holds firmly and reliably. </p><p>  In general, all these advantages attracted many buyers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radio pioneer deh 9450ub" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1634808.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  The weaknesses of the radio </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the equalizer has few bands.  With all the options that the manufacturer gave, it would be more appropriate to embed a parametric rather than a graphic timbral block.  In the sun, the radio tape recorder reflects light, which greatly interferes.  The manufacturer did not take care of the buttons for quick access to the radio.  The frame holds weakly, with mechanical impact it can easily break.  When you turn on powerful music, it rattles heavily.  The panel is easily scratched.  Many consumers note that even if you store the device in a case and treat it with the utmost accuracy, the case can still be deformed.  When the random play mode is active, returning to the previous track will not work. </p>
