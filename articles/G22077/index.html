They, of course, are no longer in high demand, but have their own buyers.  Most often, these phones are acquired by the elderly.  Developers, given this, install a keyboard with large buttons and large symbols.  Also on the case there is a special SOS key. </p><p>  Such is the Fly Ezzy Trendy 3 mobile phone. Reviews of this model will be considered in the article.  In addition, the reader will get acquainted with the characteristics and features of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly ezzy trendy 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2225077.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Most buyers are quite picky about the look and feel of the phone.  And this is not surprising.  Unfortunately, Fly Ezzy Trendy 3 Dark reviews by this criterion receive not the best.  The fact is that the case has a standard look - the usual ‚Äúclamshell‚Äù without any original elements.  The material was plastic.  The main surfaces are non-marking, which is an indisputable advantage.  But the level of strength is low - during operation, small scratches form on the case. </p><p>  The dimensions of the phone correspond to the standard values.  A width of 53 mm was enough to accommodate a large button keyboard.  Case height with the lid closed - 100.8 mm.  The thickness, according to users, is unreasonably large - 19.5 m. But the mass of the device can be reckoned with the advantages.  With such dimensions, the phone weighs only 93 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is nothing else on the front panel except the company logo.  The back side is also not full of informative elements.  Here, the developers brought out a rather large speaker hole.  It is located in the upper part of the housing.  Next to it are the camera lens and SOS key.  The latter is easily determined by touch, as indicated in the reviews. </p><p>  Fly Ezzy Trendy 3 is equipped with a volume button, which is located on the right side.  It has an oblong shape, at the ends there are elevations, due to which the element is well felt.  Above the volume control, the flashlight power button is displayed.  The owners say that her move is soft, but clear.  The connector for the charger is located on the bottom - microUSB format.  And on the opposite side there is a flashlight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone fly ezzy trendy 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2225078.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the keyboard </h2><p>  As mentioned above, a large keyboard is an indisputable advantage of a Fly Ezzy Trendy 3 cell phone. Owners leave positive reviews about it.  At the top are two standard call and end buttons.  The latter also performs the function of turning the device on / off if you hold it pressed for several seconds.  In addition to the main purpose, this key is used to delete characters in edit mode, call up the address book, and return to the previous menu item.  There is no joystick in this model.  Instead, there is a double navigation button.  It is designed to access all the functions of the phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The digital block is standard, consists of four horizontal rows and three vertical ones.  The key labels are quite large, so owners with low vision can use the phone without any discomfort.  It is important that the letters are printed in both Russian and English, which, undoubtedly, facilitates the typing of messages. </p><p>  In addition to the standard buttons on the keyboard, there are also keys that are used for quick access to the radio (FM), music gallery and camera.  They are at the very bottom, so you can‚Äôt mix them up or accidentally click. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone fly ezzy trendy 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2225079.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Brief characteristics </h2><p>  In terms of hardware Fly Ezzy Trendy 3 reviews are not getting the most encouraging.  The reason for this is a weak platform with truncated functionality.  However, the user must understand that he does not purchase a smartphone, but a simple phone for making calls.  This model copes with the main purpose.  The developers have provided two slots in which the cards of cellular communication operators are installed.  Thanks to this decision, owners can save on calls. </p><p>  As for the amount of memory, the built-in phone is very small - only 32 MB.  However, this did not upset users, since the device has a slot for external drives such as microSDHC.  Using them, the memory can be increased up to 16 GB. </p><p>  Also in this model, the developers installed a wireless Bluetooth module that allows you to exchange information without using wires.  You can connect to a PC and other devices using a USB cable. </p><p>  The phone has a color display.  The size of its diagonal is 2.4 inches.  The image is displayed with a resolution of 320 √ó 240 pixels.  Also, owners can take photos and record videos using a 0.3 megapixel camera. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Positive feedback Fly Ezzy Trendy 3 receives due to good battery life.  The phone is equipped with a 800 mAh lithium-ion battery.  For such a simple device, this is enough.  The battery provides up to 150 hours of standby time, up to 25 hours of playing music tracks and up to 5 hours of conversation.  Users assure that in the combined mode, you can safely count on 2-3 days of work with an average load. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly ezzy trendy 3 dark reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2225080.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fly Ezzy Trendy 3: reviews </h2><p>  What, according to the owners, is the advantage of this model?  First of all, a simple way to accept an incoming call is by lifting the lid.  Also, many highlighted a keyboard with large buttons and clear notation.  The advantages, of course, include the speaker volume. </p><p>  But the disadvantages were much greater than the advantages.  Users refer to them: </p><ul><li>  rather sensitive SOS button; </li><li>  uncomfortable form of the "rocker" volume, because of which during a conversation you can accidentally reduce or completely turn off the sound; </li><li>  a very complex interface, for example, in order to call a subscriber from a notebook, you will need to perform four consecutive actions, and for the elderly it may turn out to be simply an impossible task; </li><li>  low resolution camera and screen; </li><li>  There is no quick access to the latest calls, so to dial you will need to constantly go into the phone book. </li></ul>
