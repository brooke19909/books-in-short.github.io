The etymology of the word comes from the Latin atrium, which means "sooty", "black."  In the ancient dwellings in the atrium there was a constantly burning hearth, because of the small size of the courtyard it could be sooty, hence, most likely, its name came from.  In the <span>center of the atrium was</span> also a pond for rainwater drainage. </p>

The influence of Etruscan buildings is also felt.  For several centuries, the house of the Romans did not have further development.  Even in the era of prosperity of the empire, the atrium remained an essential part of the house.  This predominant type of housing construction is called atrium-peristile.

    <p>  Atrium is the center of a Roman house, an open rectangular space, a compluvium.  The roof of the atrium, the four parts of which fell to the middle, left an open space in the very center, from which rainwater flowed into the impluvium pond, arranged in the floor.  The roof was usually based on four columns standing at the corners of the impluvium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atrium circuit" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12613/228011.jpg" width="467"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was the atrium that gave the Roman house a distinctive personality.  According to Mark Vitruvius, a Roman architect, his scheme could differ in two ways: a cavedium, or an open-air atrium, the roof of which passed around a circle, and an atrium with a gallery with a continuous overlap. </p><p>  Cavedium was divided into 5 types: </p><ul><li>  Atrium tuscanicum is the most common type, also known as Etruscan.  It is characterized by a concave roof with a rectangular hole in the middle, its slopes descended to the compluvium.  The roof rested on 2 transverse beams located at the edges of the compluvium. </li><li>  Atrium tetrastylum was used in the construction of larger rooms.  This type was distinguished by partitions perpendicular to the walls, forming a series of rooms around the courtyard.  The roof of the building was based on four columns placed at the corners of the compluvium. </li><li>  Atrium corinthium is similar to the previous one, but had a greater compliance and, accordingly, a larger number of columns.  The Corinthian type was an open courtyard with a colonnade supporting the roof, which was turned into a ramp. </li><li>  Atrium displuviatum had a roof with a gap in the middle.  The clearance was usually protected by a special canopy from the rain. </li><li>  Atrium testudinatum - the atrium was completely blocked by arches. </li></ul><p>  The open atrium, created in the form of a basilica, with a covered courtyard, was bordered by two side porticoes.  At the back of the courtyard was a tablinium (wooden gallery) with an open front facade.  Tablinium with inner chambers was connected by a wide span (fauces). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Initially, the atrium courtyard was separated from the street by a door, which was open as usual.  But later they began to lock her with constipation.  Entrance, often <span>double-leaf, doors</span> opened inward.  Opposite them, a hearth was usually located.  Households gathered in this part of the house.  Slaves were spun here, with which the mistress herself often worked. </p><p>  Later, the atrium is already a peculiar face of the house.  It began to be divided into the official (tabularium - cabinet, atrium, triclinium), front and private parts (cubes, peristyle - bedrooms).  The walls of the light courtyard were decorated with frescoes, the floor was laid out with mosaics, and the hearth was replaced by a pool.  Marble columns and statues began to adorn the atrium.  The house became more grandiose. </p><p>  The passion for colossal structures, which the Romans had embroiled in the heyday of the empire, prompted them to arrange atriums for public buildings and in churches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atrium is" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12613/228045.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In modern architecture, the meaning of the term ‚Äúatrium‚Äù is somewhat different.  Atrium is an open space with translucent ceilings inside the building, several stories high.  During the construction of exhibition complexes, hotels, business centers, offices of major companies - this is one of the common elements of architecture. </p>
