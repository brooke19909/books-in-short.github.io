    <h2>  Short description of the service </h2><p>  What is a Sberbank customer code?  How to get it through an ATM and not only? </p><p>  The customer code is a special combination of 5 digits.  It serves as an identifier for a person in the Sberbank system.  Allows replacing mobile banking. </p><p>  Sber‚Äôs client code is a unique identifier password.  Its presence greatly simplifies life.  Especially if you know how to get a secret combination.  Only a bank client should know it.  The code should not be disclosed to third parties or institution employees. </p><h2>  Production methods </h2><p>  A few words about how you can make out the corresponding identifier.  The process takes very little time and is quite simple.  How to find out the customer code of Sberbank?  Through: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  ATM; </li><li>  payment terminal; </li><li>  telephone hotline. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems.

    <h2>  Purpose of use </h2><p>  But why was the Sberbank customer code created?  It is not so difficult to get it through an ATM.  We will talk about this later.  First you will have to understand for what specific purposes an individual secret password is used. </p><p>  The main directions in this area are the following operations: </p><ul><li>  informing about the services and products of Sberbank; </li><li>  receiving data on the status of the card account; </li><li>  detailing recent plastic operations; </li><li>  blocking bank cards; </li><li>  quick contact with the call center of Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  This is actually a very convenient option.  In fact, it completely replaces mobile banking.  But in practice, the client code is not used very often.  This is due to the fact that the mobile bank offers more comfortable working conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the customer code of a sberbank through an ATM" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2129463.jpg"></div>

It will take a little action.  Every modern citizen can cope with the task.  The main thing is to have a bank card from Sberbank. </p><p>  Further, some instructions will help to cope with the task.  They look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into an ATM reader. </li><li>  Dial the PIN code from the plastic.  It should not be confused with the client code. </li><li>  Click on the machine screen. </li><li>  Select "Payments in my area."  This technique will help get into the main menu of the device. </li><li>  Click on "My Account". </li><li>  Click on the inscription "Get the customer code for the call center." </li><li>  Get a check with the corresponding number. </li></ol><p>  Done!

Therefore, now some operations are available not only through ATMs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the customer code at the sberbank ATM" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2129464.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How can I get a personal identifier for a Sber client through a payment terminal? </p><p>  The algorithm of actions will be exactly the same as in the past case.  The navigation menus are the same for payment terminals and Sberbank ATMs.  And so the procedure for obtaining the secret identifier code will not be any different.  This is quite normal. </p><h2>  By phone </h2><p>  And how to get the code without an ATM or payment terminal?  In this case, the use of a call center to translate ideas into reality is suitable.  This is also a fairly simple operation.  It takes only a few minutes of free time. </p><p>  Instructions for obtaining an identifier for Sberbank customers through a call center will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Call 8-800-555-55-50. </li><li>  Go to tone mode. </li><li>  Dial "22". </li><li>  After the voice message ends, click on "0". </li><li>  Wait for an answer. </li><li>  Designate a call center employee to receive a customer ID. </li><li>  Name the plastic number, name, patronymic of its holder, passport information, code word, place of residence of the client. </li><li>  Get the appropriate combination. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  It is also worth paying attention to one feature of submitting a corresponding request by phone.  What is it about? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="customer code sberbank ATM" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2129465.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  By phone </h2><p>  The thing is that when requesting an identifier through a call center, a citizen will be able to receive the appropriate combination in different ways. </p><p>  Namely: </p><ul><li>  automatically; </li><li>  manually. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, the call center operator will switch the client to automatic mode.  After that, the person will be informed of his identifier.  In the second case, you will have to strain up and come up with a combination on your own, and then dial it.  This will be the identifier.  There is nothing difficult or incomprehensible in this.  You don‚Äôt even have to think about how to issue a Sberbank client code with an ATM.  It will be possible to manage only by telephone! </p><h2>  About use </h2><p>  Now we‚Äôll try to understand how to take advantage of the combination, what features are important and which teams will be available to citizens with an identifier? </p><p>  You just need to send simple commands.  Using code comes down to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Call 900 or 8-800-555-55-50. </li><li>  Switch to tone dialing mode. </li><li>  Dial "22". </li><li>  Enter bank plastic number and ID. </li><li>  Press the buttons that are responsible for certain operations.  They will be described below. </li><li>  View the information received. </li></ol><p>  Fast, easy and convenient.  Next, we will talk about how to properly use the code in question.  More precisely, about the teams responsible for sending requests. </p><h2>  Commands and numbers </h2><p>  We found out how to get the Sberbank customer code without and with an ATM.  But this is not the most difficult.  Sometimes citizens simply don‚Äôt know how to send requests using an identifier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a sberbank customer code without an ATM" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2129462.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the penultimate step of the previous instruction, you need to type: </p><ul><li>  1 - balance sheet information; </li><li>  1-2 - the last action on the map; </li><li>  0 - call to the call center; </li><li>  1-3 - obtaining an identifier for Sberbank Online; </li><li>  1-4 - plastic blocking. </li></ul><p>  Everything is extremely simple and clear.  We figured out how to find out the customer code at Sberbank's ATM and use it.  It is very easy to do.  Especially if you do not forget the previously listed commands.  In many offices, you can get a card with "reminders" written on it. </p><p>  Should I get a Sberbank customer ID?  Yes, if you do not want to use mobile banking.  After all, with the help of the combination studied, it will turn out pretty quickly to get information on banking plastic. </p>
