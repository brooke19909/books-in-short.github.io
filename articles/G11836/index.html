    <p>  What does Hellenism mean?  It is worth noting immediately that it is violent, since the formation of this culture occurred as a result of numerous wars.  Hellenism contributed to the unification of the ancient Greek world with the ancient East; earlier they developed in different directions.  As a result, a powerful state emerged with a single socio-economic structure, political structure and culture. </p><p>  As already mentioned, Hellenism is a kind of synthesis of various elements of culture.  It can be viewed from several perspectives.  On the one hand, the emergence of Hellenism was influenced by the development of ancient Greek society, as well as the crisis of the Greek polis.  On the other hand, ancient Eastern societies played a role in its formation, namely their conservative and sedentary social structure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The reasons that influenced the emergence of Hellenism </h2><p>  The need to merge several cultures arose due to the fact that the Greek policy began to gradually slow down historical progress, having exhausted all its possibilities.  That is why a discord began to arise between different classes, a social struggle between the oligarchy and democracy.  The fragmentation caused wars between separate cities.  And so that the history of the state did not stop, it was necessary to rally the warring parties. </p>

    <p>  However, this is not the only reason for the emergence of a new culture.  The era of Hellenism arose in connection with the crisis of ancient Eastern socio-political systems.  In the 4th century BC  the ancient Eastern world, which had already become part of the Persian Empire, was not going through the best period.  Due to the stagnant economy, vast empty land could not be developed.  In addition, the kings of Persia did not give permission to build new cities, did not support trade, and did not put into circulation large reserves of foreign exchange metal lying in their basements.  And if Greece in the IV century BC  Because of the excessive activity of the political system, overpopulation and limited resources, the situation was different in the Persian monarchy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this connection, the task arose of a peculiar unification, synthesis of different systems that are able to complement each other.  In other words, a need arose for a culture such as Hellenism.  This happened after the collapse of the state, built by Alexander the Great. </p><h2>  Merging different elements </h2><p>  What areas of life were covered by the synthesis of components inherent in the Greek and Eastern states?  There are several different points of view.  Some scholars under Hellenism understood the union of several elements inherent in culture and religion.  Domestic historians described this merger from the perspective of the combination and interaction of the economic, class-social, political, and cultural spheres.  According to them, Hellenism is a progressive step that has greatly influenced the fate of ancient Greek and ancient Eastern societies. </p>

    <p>  The synthesis of elements in different regions progressed differently.  In some states it was more intense, in others less.  In some cities, an important role was given to the elements inherent in Greek culture, in others the ancient oriental principles prevailed.  Such differences arose in connection with the specific historical features of societies and cities. </p><h2>  Hellenistic Society Development </h2><p>  The Hellenistic period affected state formations of various sizes, starting with Sicily and Southern Italy and ending with northwestern India (from the southern borders of the <span>Aral Sea</span> to the first rapids of the Nile River).  In other words, classical Greece and the East were part of Hellenistic society.  Only India and China were not included in this territory. </p><p>  There are several regions that were characterized by common features: </p><ol><li>  Egypt and the Middle East. </li><li>  <span>Middle East.</span> </li><li>  Balkan Greece, Western Asia Minor, Macedonia. </li><li>  Great Greece with the Black Sea. </li></ol><p>  The most characteristic elements inherent in Hellenism have fully manifested themselves in Egypt and the Middle East.  In this regard, these regions can be considered an area in which classical Hellenism dominated. </p><p>  Greece, like other regions, possessed mainly differences in socio-economic, political and cultural spheres.  We can say that in ancient Greece there was no synthesis at all.  However, for some reason, it is argued that these territories were included in the system of Hellenistic countries. </p><h2>  The development of culture and science </h2>

    <p>  The culture of Hellenism influenced the disappearance of the gap characteristic of the classical period between technology and science, practice and theory.  This can be seen in the works of Archimedes, who discovered the hydraulic law.  It was he who made a huge contribution to the development of technology by designing a <span>screw pump</span> and combat throwing machines along with defensive weapons. </p><p>  The creation of new cities and progress in areas such as navigation and military technology have contributed to the rise of some sciences.  Of these, we can distinguish mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, geography.  A significant role in this was played by Euclid.  He became the founder of elementary geometry.  Eratosthenes determined the true size of the globe, <span>Aristarchus of Samos</span> proved that our planet rotates on its axis and moves around the sun.  Successful development took place both in natural sciences and in medicine. </p><p>  The rapid development of science and culture entailed the need for information storage.  In this regard, libraries were built in some cities. </p><p>  Speaking about what features of Hellenism can be distinguished, it should be said about the development of a new industry - philology.  Much attention was paid to grammar, criticism, and more.  A huge role was assigned to schools.  Literature became more diverse, but it still continued to yield to classical elements.  The epos and tragedies have become more reasonable, since the erudition and virtuosity of the syllable, as well as sophistication, have come to the fore. </p><h2>  What happened in philosophy? </h2><p>  The philosophy of Hellenism also acquired some differences.  Belief in the gods decreased.  New cults began to appear.  Civil ideals gradually faded into the background, giving way to individualism.  Instead of community, indifference arose, indifference to those issues that were associated with a person's nationality.  It is social status that has become the determining factor in people's lives.  The philosophy of the Hellenistic era was developed thanks to the formation of several schools: Cynics, skeptics, Stoics, Epicureans and peripatetics. </p>

    <p>  Philosophers began to gradually abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãspace.  Greater attention was paid to a person from the position of a certain self-sufficient unit.  Social and civic ideals went by the wayside. </p><h2>  It is necessary to abandon all the benefits of civilization </h2><p>  A huge role in the formation of Hellenism was played by <span>Diogenes of Sinop,</span> who represented the school of cynics.  He did not write books, but simply lived.  The philosopher, by his example, tried to show how important it is to follow the true, in his opinion, ideals.  He reasoned that civilizations and all human inventions do not contribute to happiness, they are harmful.  Wealth, power, glory - all these are just empty words.  He lived in a barrel and walked in rags. </p><h2>  Happiness must be without vanity </h2>

    <p>  The philosophy of Hellenism gained a lot thanks to Epicurus, who was the founder of the school "Garden".  For the study, he chose the problem of human happiness.  Epicurus believed that the highest pleasure can be obtained only in the case of the rejection of aspirations concerning vanity.  According to him, it is necessary to live unnoticed, as far as possible from passions, in serene detachment. </p><h2>  Statements of the Stoics </h2><p>  The philosophy of the Hellenistic era reached its peak.  A huge role in the formation of the social worldview was played by the school of stoicism.  She also dealt with the problem of human happiness.  The following was asserted: due to the fact that different troubles could not be avoided anyway, one had to get used to them.  This was precisely the salvation, according to the Stoics.  It is necessary to properly organize your inner world.  Only in this case, no external problems can not unbalance.  It is necessary to be higher than external stimuli. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
