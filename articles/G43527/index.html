The popularity of these devices, although slowly, is growing day by day.  Transformers are trying to replace both ordinary laptops and tablets, offering the user two-in-one functionality. </p>

    <p>  With the advent of Windows 8, not only the segment began its rapid growth, but also this gave rise to developers for various experiments.  For example, many manufacturers still have not come to a consensus on the form: what will be more convenient, how best to "twist" and whether it is acceptable at all.  Someone likes sliders with a dynamic keyboard and a tiny clickpad, someone cannot live without a ‚Äúbook‚Äù, and for some, give detachable parts. </p>

    <p>  A series with a stretch can be attributed to the budget class: on official Dell resources, the price varies within $ 500.  It depends on the filling, and the most expensive modification with a quad-core processor will cost about $ 650-700. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Dell Inspiron 11 line is an entry-level Windows 8 transformer tablet.  They have two main modes of operation (although the company claims that there are four of them): a presentation screen and a regular laptop.  In the first case, the device is installed as a triangle, turning into a convenient touchscreen for viewing photos, videos or any other information. </p><p>  The keyboard of the gadget does not detach during transformation, so the tablet from it turns out quite weighty: almost one and a half kilograms with a thickness of 20 mm.  Other indicators of the model are simple and clear: a standard display, a screen with a small resolution (1366x768), a 3G modem, and, of course, the 64-bit Windows 8.1. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  ASUS Transformer Book V </h2><p>  A few years ago, the company laid the foundations for the ASUS Book line (transformer tablet).  Windows 8 helped the brand to improve its models and continue to release new ones, in accordance with market trends. </p>

    <p>  One of the most cardinal experiments of the company is the implementation of two operating systems at once.  It is far from a secret that the Windows OS is suitable for desktop devices, while Android was chosen by mobile devices, so even in theory the circuit looks very attractive. </p><p>  Today's transformer tablets on Windows 8 are progressing technically quite quickly: both OSs are located on different devices and switching between operating systems takes place in one click, that is, almost instantly. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Innovative ideas allowed the company to launch Transformer Book V - a hybrid complete with an integrated smartphone, coupled with five modes of transformation of the device.  Modes include a classic laptop, tablet, smartphone, tablet with support for the Android operating system and a similar laptop (KitKat).  And this whole set supports the new transformer tablet on Windows 8 with 3G from ASUS. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In technical terms, the hybrid is well advanced: the Intel Atom four-core processor, LTE capabilities are fully implemented, a modern IPS-screen, a 500 GB hard drive, 8 GB of RAM, and, as mentioned above, switching operating systems from Windows "On" Android "in one click. </p><h2>  Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro </h2><p>  By the name it can be seen that the hybrid continues the development of the previous model, taking into account all the errors and shortcomings that affect almost all transformer tablets on Windows 8. </p>

    <p>  You can start the review with pleasant and very useful little things that seem to be invisible, but without them you won‚Äôt be able to work with complete comfort.  One of the obvious advantages of Yoga is its automatic <span>keypad lock</span> in tablet mode.  An equally important detail of the hybrid is the proper arrangement of buttons to protect against accidental pressing in all modes.  Separately, it is also worth mentioning the location of the Fn function keys, which can be seen not in the usual place for Lenovo in the corner, but between the Ctrl and Win buttons. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of Yoga 2 Pro is its high screen resolution of 3200 by 1800 pixels, which many transformer tablets on <span>Windows 8</span> lack <span>. User reviews</span> are happy to note this innovation, but complain about such a small display - only 13.3 inches, and coupled with PenTile technology, the screen generally loses its appeal. </p><p>  Users, except for a small screen, are unhappy with the autonomy of the hybrid and are ready to close their eyes to the weight of the device - if only it would work longer. </p><p>  The design of the device is quite decent, and in general it looks very attractive, as well as the hardware stuffing of Yoga: the powerful fourth-generation processor from Haswell from Intel may vary depending on the modification from i3 to i7, coupled with 2 or 8 GB of operational memory respectively.  The price of the transformer starts at 40 and ends somewhere at 70 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Sony VAIO Fit A Multi-Flip </h2><p>  Transforming tablets on Windows 8 series VAIO Fit A Multi-Flip "Sony" has released with several screen options: 11, 13, 14 and 15 inches.  The first two models appeared on the computer market in the middle of last year, the rest of the modifications formed this winter. </p>

    <p>  As often happens with the named company, the new line turned out to be both stylish and expensive.  The hybrid case is made of high-quality anodized aluminum, along its horizontal part there is a shallow recess only a couple of millimeters wide.  Although plastic can be found at the bottom of the device, it is so high-quality that the entire device looks like a solid array.  The mechanical control together with the connectors is located on the side faces of the hybrid. </p><p>  The gadget is transformed along the horizontal axis during the screen flip, and for this, the aforementioned recess is needed, which serves as a fulcrum during a turn.  The display itself is held in place by magnets and additional mechanical locking to ensure greater reliability. </p><p>  If you press the screen of the device after the transformation to the keyboard, you get a tablet, but, judging by the feedback from users, it is too big and heavy: the 15-inch version with a weight of two and a half kilograms is not so easy to keep on weight. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Of the advantages of the gadget, it is possible to expand the RAM to 16 GB (the standard version is equipped with 8 GB), as well as the presence of a branded and high-quality metal stylus in the kit, which is powered by AAAA batteries.  The battery life is about a year. </p><p>  Cons, although small, but they are sometimes very annoying.  For example, the volume control due to its ill-conceived location can be used only in the tablet scan.  Independent replacement of the hard drive or adding RAM strips is practically impossible, since getting to these elements without involving a service department is extremely problematic. </p><p>  Otherwise, it can be noted that Sony deservedly asks for such a lot of money for the hybrid - the price / quality ratio is fully observed.  The most inexpensive model of the line is the 11-inch version, it costs about 25,000 rubles, technically more savvy hybrids will cost about 80,000. </p>
