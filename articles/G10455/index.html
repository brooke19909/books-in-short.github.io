  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Make Tricks and Become a Magician</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most likely, you have often been amazed at how great illusionists forced objects to fly, monuments to disappear, and appear again from the dark.  And, probably, there was a childhood memory of a rabbit that a magician takes out of a cylinder hat.  After this, there is often a desire to learn to do something like this.  This article was written for such people, in which several secrets of quite popular, but at the same time simple tricks, are given. </p><p>  Before you figure out how to do tricks, remember a few mandatory rules that help the magician in his performances. </p><p>  1. You can‚Äôt reveal the secret of focus to the audience.  This is the most important rule, otherwise the viewer will simply lose interest in you as a magician.  The viewer can even guess or make assumptions, what is the secret, but you can‚Äôt argue with him, you need to show that this is just an assumption. </p><p>  2. You can‚Äôt show the focus until it is most thoroughly rehearsed and you do it ten times in a row out of ten possible.  Practice well at first on how to do magic tricks.  A good helper for training is a regular mirror.  Show yourself the tricks several times, carefully thinking through the gestures and words that will accompany all your actions. </p><p>  3. Never warn what should happen the next moment.  Then the viewer will just guess where to look and what to follow.  For the same reason, you cannot repeat the focus a second time, even if you are very much asked about it. </p><p>  Therefore, before thinking about how to learn how to do magic tricks, remember that these immutable rules for any professional magician are a code.  Only when they are observed can you achieve the desired effect and remain a true magician for the viewer.  Among the wide variety, the most popular are <span>tricks with cards.</span>  The easiest one is to guess the card that the viewer will choose.  He takes any card, remembers it, shows it to other viewers and returns it to the deck. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you do the trick, you need to select a key card (this card should lie next to the spectator's idea).  The easiest way to do this is to remove the deck, ask the viewer to put his card in and cover it with a pile of cards that have already been watched.  After that, shuffle the deck and let the viewer move it.  Then, unfolding the deck facing you, it is very easy to find a card hidden by the viewer next to the key card.  Knowing how to do tricks, you need to give the whole process a small veil of mystery.  Put the hidden card second from the bottom, hold the entire deck in your hand and show it to the viewer with the last card.  Everyone sees that this is not the card that was made up. </p><p>  Next, lower the deck and hold it upside down in your hand and take out the bottom card, as it were.  However, you imperceptibly move it toward you, and in your hand it is precisely the card that the spectator has been hiding.  You wave it in the air, turn it over and everyone sees that another card suddenly turned into the right one.  Then the effect will increase greatly.  This is only one of the vast sea of ‚Äã‚Äãall kinds of card tricks.  If you seriously want to learn how to do tricks, you will have to make a lot of effort for training.  In addition, the props of a magician, which is now quite simple to buy, will greatly facilitate the task.  There is no need to invent or invent hard-to-do tricks.  It is enough to study all the secrets attached and train them carefully, you can discover the secrets of this profession.  When you have already reached the level that the usual props are not enough for you, nothing will prevent you from improving your growing skills and coming up with new ways to surprise the audience. </p>
