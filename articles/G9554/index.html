There are two methods: direct and simplified calculation.  As part of the first, the total number of work days is determined by dividing the number of hours in a month by the length of the day.  The last indicator depends on the length of the week.  The monthly average cost of living is the quotient of the number of days worked and the number of people employed. </p><p>  When using the simplified calculation scheme, the working time of part-timers is divided by the length of the day.  Then the obtained value is multiplied by the number of days in the month.  The final result is divided by the number of work days in the period. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative methods </h2><p>  How to calculate the average number of employees per year?  Summarize the indicator data for calendar months, and then divide the resulting value by 12. This method provides clear numbers, but requires a laborious process.  In the process of counting, the entire time sheet is analyzed. </p><p>  The average number of employees of the organization for the year was 250 people.  In addition, the company was issued: </p><ul><li>  Two external part-time workers at 0.5 rates, who worked 7 full months. </li><li>  Another part-time worker worked all year part-time. </li><li>  3 people worked part-time for 5 months at 0.5 rates. </li><li>  Under the contracts, 10 people were employed for the period from February to September, 5 people - from April to December;  7 people - from June to November.  All worked for full months. </li></ul><ul><li>  MFD = 250 + (2 x 0.5 x 7 + 1 x 0.5 x 12 + 3 x 0.5 x 6): 12 + (10 x 8 + 5 x 9 + 7 x 6): 12 = 265, 7 or 266 people. </li></ul><p>  Thus, in the organization, in terms of the year, 1.8 people worked.  part-time and 13.9 people  - under contracts. </p><p>  In practice, other calculation methods are used.  If there is data at the beginning and end of the period, then the RMS is calculated as the arithmetic mean. </p><p>  <em>Example</em> </p><p>  Known data on the number of employees: </p><ul><li>  at the beginning of the year - 280 people; </li><li>  on 01.04 - 296; </li><li>  on 01.06 - 288; </li><li>  on 01.10 - 308; </li><li>  as of December 31 - 284 people </li></ul><p>  Define the average target for the year: </p><ul><li>  [280: 2 + 296 + 288 +308 284: 2]: (5 - 1) = 294 people </li></ul><p>  If only the data for January and December are known, then the RMS would be calculated as the arithmetic mean: </p><ul><li>  MFD = (280 + 284): 2 = 282 people. </li></ul><p>  Both results give approximate figures, but are often used in practice. </p><h2>  Average headcount (SCR) </h2><p>  This indicator includes employees who performed temporary and permanent work, who received wages for one or more days.  The following persons who appear at work and are absent are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  in connection with a business trip; </li><li>  due to illness; </li><li>  in connection with the performance of state duties; </li><li>  aimed at continuing education in educational institutions; </li><li>  undergraduate, post-graduate students, for whom salaries are maintained; </li><li>  who were on basic leave for childcare, ‚Äúat their own expense‚Äù; </li><li>  due to strikes, provided that if the employee did not participate in them. </li></ul>

    <p>  Employees who occupy more than one rate or are registered as part-time employees are taken into account as integral units when calculating the average index.  Data is taken from the timesheet.  The indicator for the month is determined by adding data for calendar days.  The value of the coefficient on holidays and weekends is taken equal to the indicator for the previous working day. </p><p>  The average number of employees for the year = (SRM Jan. + SRM Feb. + ... SRR dec.): 12. </p><p>  The monthly indicator is calculated in the same way: the number of employees for each calendar day is divided by the number of days worked.  If the calculated value is fractional, then the report indicates the NER with rounding.  The data for the tax for the previous year are submitted until January 20 of the current.  There is a more convenient calculation method.  First, the number of full-time workers is determined, and then those who work for several hours.  The sum of these two indicators is calculated separately for each month, quarter and year. </p><p>  The following are excluded from the calculation: </p><ul><li>  external part-timers; </li><li>  persons who entered into an agreement on vocational training with the payment of a scholarship; </li><li>  owners of the organization who did not receive a salary; </li><li>  lawyers; </li><li>  employees who are on maternity leave; </li><li>  student employees who were on extra leave without pay; </li><li>  persons who work under contracts; </li><li>  employees sent to work in another country; </li><li>  persons who wrote a letter of resignation and work out the remaining time. </li></ul><h2>  Algorithm </h2><p>  Workers who work part-time are accounted for directly in proportion to the hours worked, but are displayed as integer units in the report.  If the organization employs two employees the same number of days for 4 hours, they are recorded as a whole unit with a full working day.  This situation is rare.  Typically, in large enterprises, the number of hours and days worked does not match.  In such situations, a different formula is used: </p><p>  The average number of persons = the number of people worked / h.  in the period: day length: number of calendar days. </p><p>  The length of the day is calculated based on the working week.  If the schedule provides for 40 hours of work per week, then the day is 8 hours, etc. </p><h2>  Example 5 </h2><p>  <span>The list of</span> employed persons at the enterprise from June 1 to 15 was 100 people, and in the second half of the month - 150 people.  In the period under review, two employees were on maternity leave.  According to the rules, they are excluded from the calculation.  All other workers were hired full time. </p><ul><li>  15 days  x 98 pax  + 148 people  x 15 days  = 3690 people </li><li>  CPR: 3690: 31 = 119.032, or 119 people. </li></ul>
