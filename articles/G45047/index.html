  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How the pyramids were built</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Who knows how the pyramids were built?  To build a pyramid similar to the Egyptian is very problematic today.  This will require the creation of special equipment.  In the ancient world, for this purpose, practically only people were used, their muscular strength.  Construction took away the strength of the population of the whole country.  However, in addition to this, it must be borne in mind that <span>Egyptian culture</span> was so developed that not only power, but also the mind was used to build the pyramids.  It would be impossible to create in another way what we now call a wonder of the world. </p><p>  In ancient Egypt, at different times, several grandiose-sized pyramids were built - stone tombs for the pharaoh-gods who lived on the earth. </p><p>  The question of how the <span>pyramids were built</span> is still controversial.  The largest of them reaches a height of 146 meters.  This is the <span>pyramid of Cheops.</span>  Its construction required about two and a half million monolithic stone blocks, each of which was equal in weight to two and a half tons.  On top of the stone monoliths, the pyramid was faced with polished polished slabs. </p><p>  The age of this pyramid is more than four and a half thousand years.  Herodotus wrote that the work on its construction lasted more than twenty years, during which one hundred thousand people participated in the construction at the same time.  No data on how the Egyptians built the pyramids has been preserved.  Apparently, such records were not kept at all.  However, the mystery of the pyramids excites our contemporaries so much that attempts to solve it do not stop until now.  There are more and more new versions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientists and researchers have developed several hypotheses about how the pyramids were built.  According to the most common version, blocks of stones were lifted to the top of the pyramids by dragging along inclined sand ramps, which were filled up to the desired height during construction. </p><p>  Based on the fact that the embankments were carried out only on one side of the structure, the volume of sand used for the construction should have been 10 million cubic meters.  The road on top of the embankment was strengthened by a plank flooring so that blocks of stone would not cut into the sand.  Each time when it was necessary to pour sand to a new height, the flooring was removed and shifted again.  In addition, after each rain shower, the sand embankment had to be restored due to erosion. </p><p>  Construction required tremendous efforts from people, which led to the rapid depletion of their forces.  Therefore, people working on the pyramids were constantly changing. </p><p>  Another group of researchers considers this hypothesis incorrect.  In their opinion, the answer to how the Egyptian pyramids were built, the answer is still not known exactly.  These researchers believe that the <span>ancient Egyptians</span> with their knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, and other exact sciences knew a more rational way of lifting weights to great heights. </p><p>  Lifting blocks could be carried out simultaneously from all sides.  To do this, wooden frames with struts were installed on each side.  Between the racks of these frames thick logs were installed with bronze rods driven into the ends, which were inserted into the holes of the frame racks.  Bronze semicircular plates were placed under the rods.  Stone blocks were pulled to the log road with levers.  Then it was laid on a wooden sled attached to a rope made of durable fibers.  Workers dragged the sled to the edge of the already laid part of the pyramid. </p><p>  Passing the center of gravity over the edge of the pyramid, the block with the sled turned out to be in a horizontal position.  The rope could be disconnected from the sled and lowered them behind new blocks.  To raise one block, it took about 60 people, who only once a day had to climb to the top of the pyramid.  The hard work of raising the sled with blocks, thus, alternated with the relatively easy labor of lowering the empty sled, which allowed people to remain operational for a longer time.  When building the pyramids, the frames were rearranged without dismantling the completely building structure.  This version of how the pyramids were built seems more logical.  However, this is only a hypothesis.  As everything was in reality, only those who participated in the construction or were its witnesses knew. </p>
