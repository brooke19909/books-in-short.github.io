    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  This hotel is located on Patong Hill, some distance from the city center.  So, the distance to Bangla Road, famous for its nightclubs, restaurants, bars, and also the sex industry, is one and a half kilometers.  About the same distance separates the hotel from the nearest beach.  Due to the fact that you can get bored of walking these distances within a couple of days after arrival, experienced travelers recommend renting a motorbike or using a taxi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The nearest international airport to Seeka Boutique 3 * is located in Phuket.  The distance to it is about 35 kilometers.  So after arrival, your journey to the hotel will take about 30-40 minutes.  If you travel with the assistance of a travel agency, then a transfer will most likely be provided at the airport.  If you went to Thailand on your own, you can get to your hotel from the air harbor by taxi limo, ordinary taxi or bus.  The first option is the most expensive, but, as practice shows, the most attractive for our compatriots. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  Prices for accommodation in the three-star Phuket hotel "Seeka Boutique" are fully consistent with its category, level of service and comfort.  So, a seven-day accommodation for two here will cost you from 11 thousand rubles for a standard room, from 18 thousand rubles for an improved room and from 22 thousand rubles for a deluxe room number.  The indicated price includes breakfast. </p><h2>  Seeka Boutique Resort 3 *: traveler reviews from Russia </h2><p>  In order for your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe three-star Hotel Seeka Boutique to be more complete and reliable, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the impressions of our compatriots who have recently been here.  Looking ahead, we note that most of the tourists liked the hotel.  In their opinion, it is well worth the money spent and is a good place to relax.  But we suggest learning more about everything. </p><p>  As for the hotel rooms, their travelers found it compact and quite comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but all in good working condition.  Please note that the minibar in the room is paid.  By the way, tourists staying here advise those who wish to drink alcohol purchased outside the hotel in their room to bring it in a sealed bag or bag.  This is due to the fact that the hotel administration allows the use on its territory only of alcoholic beverages purchased here.  Violators can even be fined 300 baht.  There is one more rule that it is desirable to observe for all guests of Seeka Boutique 3 *.  It relates to the prohibition on the transfer of food numbers.  Nobody will fine you for this, however, if you leave sweet fruits on the table in the room, then just a couple of hours later you‚Äôll be visited by not very pleasant visitors in the form of red ants.  Therefore, even if you decide to enjoy pineapple or kiwi in your room, then do not be lazy then go down to the hall and throw the remaining fruit into the trash can.  As for cleaning the rooms, it was carried out daily and fairly high quality.  Towels are also updated every day.  The maids changed the bedding twice a week. </p>

    <p>  Reviews about the location of the hotel from our compatriots were mostly identical.  So, most tourists deliberately opted for this hotel due to the fact that it is located far from the city center, so its guests have the opportunity to relax in peace and quiet.  Also note that it will take you about 20 minutes to get to the nearest beach.  In order to save time and effort on walking, most experienced travelers recommend Phuket Seeka Boutique 3 * guests to rent a motorbike for their entire vacation.  This will allow you to visit various local beaches, as well as travel for your pleasure around the island.  You can rent a motorbike and other vehicles at rental points located near the hotel.  However, be careful, as the traffic here is very busy. </p><p>  As for meals at the hotel, according to tourists, only breakfast is offered at the Seeka Boutique.  The food here is simple but tasty and varied.  You won‚Äôt stay hungry.  For lunch and dinner, you can in one of the many restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel.  The dishes here are tasty and relatively inexpensive. </p><p>  Travelers respond positively about the hotel infrastructure.  So, many loved the local pool.  Due to the fact that it is located between the two buildings of the hotel, the rays of the scorching sun hardly get here.  This fact was appreciated by tourists who, in the first days of their vacation, ‚Äúburned‚Äù on the beach and were forced to come to their senses at the hotel.  Also, many of our compatriots greatly praise the massage parlor at Seeka Boutique Resort 3 *.  According to them, real professionals work here.  Moreover, guests assure that you will not find the best value for money for massage services in the vicinity of the hotel. </p><p>  In conclusion, we note that, according to Russian travelers, the Seeka Boutique is a worthy place to stay during a trip to Phuket (Thailand).  Many tourists staying here were satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend this hotel to their friends and acquaintances. </p>
