This question is increasingly being asked by young girls who want to not only learn a new hobby, but also to use its results - to wear exclusive, hand-made things. </p><p>  Knitting is one of the oldest activities of the fair sex.  In the distant times, every girl had to be able to do this, otherwise she would lose much in the eyes of men compared to those girlfriends who showed off knitwear of their own production.  Unfortunately, now we are increasingly buying things made in a factory way.  Of course, they may seem more beautiful and stylish, however, at least a few girlfriends will go in exactly the same sweaters, which for a girl is a blow to her vanity.  The solution here is obvious - to learn how to knit and create masterpieces that others will envy, and most importantly - they will be in a single copy.  Such a hostess will be appreciated by every man. </p><p>  So, how to learn to knit?  The basics of this lesson are pretty simple.  To begin with, it is worth training on simple products in order to work out your skills, and then proceed to more complex things.  In any case, if the product does not work out, then it can be dissolved and started again.  Experience in this matter is of great importance, since only with it comes the ability to make complex drawings, to introduce bold elements into your work. </p><p>  Before you learn how to knit, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the tips that you can read in specialized magazines.  You should not be upset if there are incomprehensible details in journal schemes.  Just some products require some experience in this matter, so at first they may seem complicated.  Do not be afraid to take the first steps - there are many lessons designed for beginners, which details how to learn how to knit. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For starters, you should get acquainted with the rules for using knitting needles and yarn.  For the initial stage, you need to dial simple loops, which are the basis of any product.  Hands should be kept as relaxed as possible, bending at the elbows and pulling a little to yourself.  This position will be the most comfortable and will allow you to do what you love for several hours in a row.  In order to prevent yarn from tangling, a ball of thread or a skein is best lowered into a shallow cardboard box that can be placed next to you.  The end of the thread that will be involved is fixed on the left palm.  The thread is then held on the index finger, and then wraps around the big one.  If you spread your fingers, you get a loop.  Inside this loop we introduce knitting needles, pick up the thread from the <span>index finger</span> and draw it into the loop near the big one.  In the same way, all the loops in the first row are knitted.  When a loop is formed, it is removed from the finger and tightened on the knitting needles.  At the same time, tightening is not worth much, since the second row will need to be drawn through the first.  Therefore, it should be easy to insert a spoke into the first loop.  In the same way as the first row, we finish the last.  Before you learn to knit even simple elements, you need to know how many rows of loops are needed - this information is usually in the knitting pattern.  Rows of loops can be made both front and back - the mechanism of their formation is best seen in video knitting courses.  In order to get a ‚Äúelastic band‚Äù (for example, the neck and sleeves of a sweater), the loops must be alternated.  Usually do two purl and two facial alternately.  To narrow the product, and if necessary to expand, the loops need to be reduced or added.  When reducing, you can capture two loops, and when added, the thread is folded in two, and independent loops are knitted. </p><p>  Knitting is a great female hobby.  It is suitable for diligent natures who like a quiet rest in the evenings.  If you do not know how to learn how to knit, then do not be upset.  On cold winter evenings, you can take several workshops at interest clubs that are present in every city. </p>
