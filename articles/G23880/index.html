Why?  The answer to this question becomes obvious when you just approach the village.  The majestic castle with towers and ramparts did not seem to notice how centuries passed.  Thanks to numerous restorations and respect, this museum can take us to the era of the Cossacks and the Turkish-Polish wars.  But besides the castle in Kamenetz-Podolsky there is something to see.  For example, at the Cathedral Church of Saints Peter and Paul.  The former minaret of the Turkish mosque is now crowned by a gilded figure of the Virgin Mary.  And on the banks of the picturesque river Smotrych with high banks there is a wooden church of the Exaltation of the Cross.  The grand Turkish bridge spread across the canyon.  The tower of <span>Stephen Batory</span> was called to guard the city from a single flat place on the river.  The town hall of Kamenetz-Podolsky is a symbol of urban freedoms.  Not far from the castle on the hill is the Concorde Table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamyanets-Podilsky Hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1288512.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City Hotels </h2><p>  As you can see, in one day it is simply impossible to inspect the entire Kamenetz-Podolsky.  Hotels in this city are always ready for a large influx of tourists.  There are many of them.  After all, Kamenetz-Podolsky, located in the south of the <span>Khmelnitsky region,</span> is a convenient springboard for interesting excursions in the vicinity.  Very close to the city is another fortress - Khotyn.  This citadel is located in another area - Chernivtsi.  Both fortresses were built by French military engineers, but by order of the warring parties.  Kamyanets-Podilsky firmly entered the history of the Polish people.  The defense of the fortress was described in his novel Pan Volodyevsky by Henryk Sienkiewicz.  Therefore, do not be surprised when you often hear Polish speech on the streets of the city.  The city often hosts various festivals, festivals, tournaments of reenactors.  On such days, hotels must be booked in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Kamyanets-Podilskyi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1288509.jpg" width="600"></div>

The river surrounding the city in a ring turns it almost into an island.  Getting to Kamenetz-Podolsky is not difficult.  The most budget option is a direct train from Kiev.  Through the city follows and the composition to Chernivtsi.  Private minibuses depart from the regional center of Khmelnitsky at short intervals.  By bus, Kamyanets-Podilsky is connected with Chernivtsi, Ternopol, Vinnitsa, Ivano-Frankivsk.  The ancient city, of course, has grown over the centuries.  There are many hotels in the old part.  But the prices in them are overpriced simply because the guests live a few steps from all the sights and also in historical buildings.  Therefore, as old-timers say, if you have your own vehicles, it makes sense to look for housing in new quarters.  Some hotels in Kamenetz-Podolsky are located on the steep slopes of the canyon.  Fans of green tourism will like accommodation in the countryside, in the picturesque area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPodolsk Tovtr. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel 7 days Kamyanets-Podilskyi" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1288522.jpg" width="507"></div>

    <h2>  What accommodation to choose </h2><p>  At any time of the year, many tourists from Ukraine and from abroad come to Kamenetz-Podolsky.  <span>Hotels,</span> family-type <span>hotels</span> , hostels, campsites, private villas, apartments, turnkey apartments and just guest rooms - all this real estate never knows the concept of ‚Äúlow season‚Äù.

The private sector offers housing of a very different type - from a modest room with a shared kitchen and a bathroom to luxury apartments with a turnkey renovation.  Private mini-hotels can arrange full board.  But in the city itself there is no shortage of catering points.  Restaurants, cozy cafes and pastry shops, budget canteens, pizzerias and fast food - all this can be easily found on the streets of the Old City, as well as in new quarters.  In venerable hotels, room rates often include breakfast.  But, as a rule, such hotels also have their own restaurant, bar and cafeteria. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel "7 days" (Kamenetz-Podolsky) </h2><p>  Tourists call this hotel the best in the city in terms of quality and price.
