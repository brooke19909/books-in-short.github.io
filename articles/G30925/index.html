Each cell is necessary to perform a specific function.  Similar structural formations are combined into complex systems that ensure the normal existence of man. </p><p>  According to the functions performed, the nervous, respiratory, digestive, immune, sexual, urinary, musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems are secreted.  Their work is interconnected, when one link is turned off, the functioning of another component is disrupted. </p><p>  Human organ systems need constant monitoring.  This function is performed by the nervous system.  It is divided into central and peripheral.  The first through nerve fibers binds all organs, thus controlling their work.  When a specific lesion is affected, a specific signal is sent in the brain.  It sends impulses to other organ systems, after which their activity decreases or intensifies, which manifests itself in increased secretion of hormones.  Also, the brain carries out higher nervous activity - thinking, memory.  It is possible due to the presence of a specific formation - the cortex. </p><p>  The human <span>respiratory</span> system is represented by light and airways, which include the larynx, bronchi, trachea.  It delivers oxygen to tissues through its entry into the blood.  Alveoli are present in the lung structure, which are able to selectively pass the necessary element and take back the products of its processing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Human immune system</span> organs <span>:</span> thymus (thymus gland), lymph nodes, spleen. They participate in the production of specific cells that protect the human body from the causative agents of viral, infectious, protozoal, fungal diseases.  After the ingress of such agents, the cells of the immune defense immediately bind to them, as a result of which specific reactions occur that will manifest themselves with a number of characteristic symptoms: redness, fever, pain, swelling, impaired function corresponding to organ damage. </p><p>  Human organ systems must constantly renew their cellular composition.  Therefore, the intake of nutrients: fats, carbohydrates, proteins.  The latter elements are the basic building material that is needed for all cells.  The digestive system, represented by the esophagus, stomach, intestines, which is divided into thin and thick, performs this function.  It also includes the liver, pancreas.  They produce enzymes necessary for the breakdown of incoming food components.  The system also performs an excretory function.  In addition, pancreatic hormones are necessary to maintain the physiological level of blood glucose. </p><p>  Human organ systems cannot fulfill their function if harmful products accumulate in them, which are formed as a result of their activity.  Therefore, the allocation of all unnecessary substances is an important function.  For this, there is an <span>excretory system,</span> which is represented by the kidneys, the bladder.  Also it can include skin, lungs. </p><p>  The reproductive system has characteristic differences, which makes it possible to separate sexes into female and male.  It is characterized by the presence of specific cells that perform reproductive functions.  In men, these are sperm, in women, eggs. </p><p>  The musculoskeletal system is designed to move the human body in the surrounding space, as well as for the work of all internal organs. </p>
