Only then can you be sure that the great-grandchildren will not throw out unnecessary photos of relatives, but will store them as a <span>family heirloom.</span> </p><h2>  Who needs the services of a professional photographer </h2><p>  People in public professions, famous actors, singers, models, all who need a portfolio are turning to a professional.  Recently, well-known bloggers, information businessmen, whose appearance has become the brand of their professional activity, began to use the services of a photographer. </p><p>  A professional photo shoot in Moscow is expensive, but the quality of the photos will be such that they can decorate the walls of the house without shame.  To get extraordinary images, you need to discuss the shooting locations in advance.  This can be done in the studio with the help of scenery, go out into the countryside, in parks, abandoned places, capture yourself on a bridge, attractions ... </p><p>  Ordinary citizens also come to the photographer who need to capture some kind of joyful event (wedding, anniversary, birthday, professional holiday) or just take a beautiful family photo.  Professional photos can be a great gift for a birthday person, especially if you design them in book or video format. </p><h2>  Analysis of Moscow photo studios </h2><p>  Photo studios are convenient places for photo shoots in Moscow.  Filming takes place in any weather with a different interior, on a variety of topics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="places for photo shoots in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/534722.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The photo studio on Baumanskaya has a convenient work schedule seven days a week, but the atmosphere is tense, as the owner forbids any initiative to move the equipment. </li><li>  The photo studio on Bryansk provides more freedom of action, offers affordable prices compared to the first photo studio, but the schedule is not suitable for everyone (work on weekdays from eleven o‚Äôclock). </li><li>  A photo studio on the Falcon is the best option.  Convenient schedule, freedom of action for the photographer, a variety of equipment, several studios, the availability of aqua filming. </li><li>  Studio "Provence" at the Academic offers two rooms: white and red New Year's interior.  Prices of 15-20 thousand per photo shoot.  A wide range of equipment, but a very busy schedule. </li></ul><p>  Please note that a studio photo session in Moscow is convenient because special interiors on different topics have already been created.  At the same time, the image was created to the smallest detail: from clothes and makeup to cups on the table, blades of grass in the hayloft, dolls on the bed, candle shapes.  At home, such scruples can not be repeated.  Studio shoots are more suitable for clients in bad or cold weather and for family photo shoots with young children.  People are liberated in a closed, but comfortable room, and children are less distracted by external voices and sounds, busy with new toys. </p><h2>  Wedding photo session in Moscow </h2><p>  The newlyweds choose the most diverse places for filming - from historical streets to famous sights.  Muscovites find it easier to choose beautiful places for photo shoots, but visitors must first think through the route.  An expensive financial option, but a time-saving option, is to use the services of a professional Muscovite photographer who will himself propose a shooting plan.  A cheaper option is to find places for photo shoots yourself, arrange a taxi, find a photographer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So what do newlyweds choose?  Modern youth chooses the Crocus City Mall.  The reasons are simple: </p><ul><li>  variety of architecture; </li><li>  rich interior; </li><li>  European chic; </li><li>  exotic vegetation; </li><li>  fountains, imitations of rivers; </li><li>  gorgeous shooting even in winter; </li><li>  large area for guests and honeymooners. </li></ul><p>  You can make a photo shoot in Moscow in the famous main department store (GUM), overlooking the main facade of Red Square.  Young people are attracted by the unusual architecture of the eighteenth century, a huge square, a chic fountain, a combination of <span>pseudo-Russian style</span> with modern design.  Filming on the background of the nightly glowing GUM turns out to be romantic, enchanting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wedding photo session in Moscow places" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/538851.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What else do newlyweds choose </h2><p>  Further with guests you can go to Red Square.  Its territory is so diverse that it allows you to capture young people near the St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral, Kazan Cathedral, the Historical Museum, the Middle Trading Rows, the Moscow Kremlin, the Lenin Mausoleum, the necropolis near the Kremlin wall, the monument to Minin and Pozharsky.  At all times, these Moscow sights are striking in their grandeur, inaccessible beauty, monumentality, grandeur. </p><p>  The Furniture Museum is the next place where the wedding photo shoot in Moscow takes place.  These places are suitable for eccentric couples who prefer to capture themselves against the backdrop of a rich interior.  The great-grandchildren will definitely not throw out a photo where their great-grandfather plays the historic piano, and the great-grandmother in the wedding dress listens to her husband‚Äôs creation. </p><p>  For seven thousand rubles, they will conduct hourly wedding photography in the halls of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  This place is popular with both photographers and directors who make films here. </p><h2>  Do I need a pre-wedding photo shoot </h2><p>  To create a wedding story, the photographer needs several images of the bride and groom.  Of course, standardly young people find amateur photos with decoding inscriptions.  A professional without verbal clarification conveys a love story from a photograph.  A pre-wedding photo session can take place before the wedding or after it in different romantic places.  For this, a couple with a photographer discusses romantic, unusual, extreme or simply beautiful places in Moscow for a photo shoot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap photo shoots in Moscow" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/538860.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Pre-wedding photos just reveal the history of love relationships, secret meetings, romantic dates, memorable events.  Over time, even pleasant memories disappear, and such photos help to remember not just the events of the past, but namely feelings towards each other. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better to book a pre-wedding photo shoot on weekdays, then the photographer‚Äôs services will be cheaper and there will be more time.  Instead, a full day of shooting will take place in four hours.  In addition, the photos will turn out to be more natural, since the newlyweds do not have to rush anywhere, there will not be a crowd around with hooting statements, they will be able to free themselves in front of the photographer. </p><h2>  Cheap photo shoots in Moscow </h2><p>  Moscow parks are an economical place to shoot.  They are so diverse and extraordinary that they can create a unique image.  Want a European style?  Choose parks with sculptures, landscaped landscapes.  Need an exotic look?

Stylish alleys with benches, flowering lawns, a fountain, a gazebo on the background of vegetation, a mirror lake with bridges and willows, the architecture of the monastery are the best places in Moscow for photo shoots. </li><li>  Vorontsov park.  It is famous for its architectural landmark of the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries, a cascade of lakes, an unusual oak grove, flower lawns, a church, alleys. </li><li>  Boring Garden.  The name itself speaks for itself.  On the territory of one park you can find many attractions for shooting: the chic fountain "Bather", the house of Count Orlov, Elizavetinsky Pond, St. Andrew's Pond, Grotesque Bridge, Pushkinskaya Embankment.  From here you can go down to the pier to make a photo shoot on the ship sailing along the Moscow River. </li><li>  Park them.  Mandelstam.  A small recreation area for the surrounding area with bridges, paths, forest area.  There are few people, so the photo shoot will turn out to be fast, high-quality, natural. </li></ul><h2>  Catchy shootings </h2><p>  Where to make the most interesting photos with extraordinary subjects?  For this purpose, unusual places in Moscow for photo shoots are suitable.  For example, metropolitan bridges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of Moscow for a photo shoot" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/534716.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ul><li>  Bagrationovsky bridge.  Modern design, indoor light pavilion allow you to take pictures all year round.  Glass windows open skyscrapers "Moscow City".  This complex is especially beautiful at night, when all floors are lit with different lights.  The viewing platform also provides a huge field of activity for the photographer. </li><li>  The bridge named after B. Khmelnitsky.  Gorgeous shots will be at night, when golden warm light is reflected in the water surface, creating a unique romantic image.  In the afternoon, this bridge boasts an interior, modern design. </li><li>  St. Andrew's Bridge.  This will be a modern photo shoot in Moscow.  An unusual exterior design, a view of the river and the surrounding buildings are just suitable for people with character. </li><li>  Large stone bridge.  It is unique in that it offers a view of the main attractions of the capital: the Kremlin, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, GUM.  At night, all these buildings are illuminated with different illumination, and unusual photographs are obtained with glare on the water. </li></ul><h2>  Where else can I take a picture </h2><p>  Nothing raises adrenaline like Moscow‚Äôs abandoned places for photo shoots.  It has everything: adventure, unusual appearance, extreme.  For example, Skhodnenskaya bowl.  It seems that, as elsewhere, the Moscow fauna, flora (fluffy crowns of trees, shrubs, lawns with lush grass, the sky with unusual clouds) are suitable for any photography.  However, one must be careful, as grassy vegetation hides swamps. </p><p>  Or pay attention to <span>the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo park.</span>  On its territory there is an abandoned manor with columns, a fireplace, stucco moldings, vaulted ceilings, stairs and a similar dilapidated monastery.  This is a great place for filming antiquities. </p><p>  If you are interested in an unusual photo shoot in Moscow, then go to the entrance on Tatarskaya Street.  A professional can easily convey the retro style, which is facilitated by peeling walls, a ragged staircase.  Filming with unfinished buildings can be done from the roof of the Blue Crystal (also called the Zenit business center), in the basements of the Khovrinsky hospital (which horror tells about), in a building with interesting graffiti on the Kaluzhskaya metro station. </p><p>  For outstanding personalities, the Bunker-42 Museum is suitable, where amateur shooting is just allowed.  The military image is easily reproduced in the Museum of Military Equipment.  The main thing is for the photographer to orient and feel the atmosphere of antiquity.  Unusual photographs are taken in the wine cellars.  The winery on Kurskaya is just right for walking around the old cellars and admiring the art gallery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a photo shoot in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/534711.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Street shooting </h2><p>  Moscow streets are great places for photo shoots.  In Moscow, it can be both famous and uninhabited quarters.  The quarter of Kitai Gorod is very popular.  Its narrow streets, stairs, deserted courtyards, high brick walls, gratings, arches will help create photographs in the Venetian style. </p><p>  Courtyards in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãChistye Prudy and the Kuznetsk bridge will attract modern youth.  Buildings with old architecture in combination with modern graffiti create a unique image.  And if you photograph the bottom of the building in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kuznetsky Dvor, you can convey the St. Petersburg style (probably because the Petrovsky passage is opposite). </p><p>  On the embankments, too, good shooting is obtained.  On the Moskva River it‚Äôs always crowded, but on the embankment <span>of the Yauza River</span> you can capture the image of the old city.  Throughout this river, you can find dozens of different bridges and bridges overlooking the capital.  If it is the urban type of photo that interests you, then pay attention to the Rubtsov bridge, from where you can see the bright modern residential high-rise buildings. </p><p>  In general, street shooting is an inexpensive photo shoot in Moscow with your photographer.  If you hire a Moscow professional, you will get an average of seven to ten thousand rubles in three to four hours of work with three different images.  However, the cost and route are negotiated initially. </p><p>  For example, the famous Vorobyovy Gory is interesting for the photographer by the route to the ponds.  Muscovites are no longer interested in the observation deck, but for visitors a picturesque landscape opens for photo shoots.  Poklonnaya Gora has become a traditional place for wedding photo shoots, so the cost of shooting can increase, as the photographer needs to try to convey the desired emotions of the model and exclude the inclusion of extra faces in the frame. </p><h2>  Why photography at all </h2>

    <p>  The reasons for taking pictures are different for everyone, but the most common are four. </p><ul><li>  Portfolio  A professional photo shoot in Moscow is suitable for this purpose.  All moments of filming are discussed with the photographer, the interior, clothes, makeup are selected.  Not only external attributes are important here, but also the transmission of the person‚Äôs inner world.  This task is beyond the power of a professional. </li><li>  Gift.  A good photo is a great gift for any person.  It can be transferred to the canvas and turned into a picture.  According to this photo, they make patterns for embroidery with a cross or beads, and then create original portraits. </li><li>  Memory.  Many people simply take pictures for memory, looking for interesting places in Moscow for photo shoots.  It can be enclosed spaces, natural and architectural sights, streets with unusual buildings, monuments, sculptures, bridges, parks, attractions. </li><li>  Raising self-esteem.  For women, girls, and teenagers, professional photography can enhance self-esteem.  The photographer will tell you the best angles for shooting, the make-up artist will help with makeup and clothing style.  And the model with the help of professionals will feel like a queen! </li></ul><p>  The services of a photographer are suitable for everyone, except superstitious.  There is an opinion among couples in love that a joint photo before the wedding threatens to break the relationship.  You should also not arrange surprises in the form of photography for your halves.  Remember that a person who does not want to act will be tense, therefore, the photographer needs to give more, and this will affect your payment. </p><p>  If all the participants are ready to shoot, then do not rush to contact the first photographer you come across.  First think over your story, look for beautiful places in Moscow for a photo shoot, and then discuss your idea with different masters.  Do not forget to pay attention to the portfolio of the photographer and customer reviews. </p>
