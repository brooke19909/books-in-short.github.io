The line of such devices significantly increased the image of this brand.  For example, the M35 and ME45 models are considered legendary, and at one time had no analogues.  They were so loved by the user that the Siemens M65 phone was wildly popular from day one.  In this model, all technical specifications have been retained.  The case had a high level of protection against dust and dirt.  The device belonged to the class of shockproof.  And, most outstanding, the functionality was at the level of sophisticated gadgets. </p><p>  So, let's look at the most <span>secure</span> Siemens M65 <span>phone</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siemens m65" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1450551.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  The device of the Siemens trademark with the M65 index is a monoblock.  It has a fairly large size: 109x49x19 mm.  In the external performance of the case, new features appeared, the manufacturer tried to give sportiness and a certain aggressiveness.  Keys of the original form, an extreme combination of gray and orange, clear but sharp contours, a metal frame - a vivid confirmation of this. </p><p>  Although many elements look designer, they have quite practical functions.  Their purpose is to protect against moisture and shock.  Siemens M65 is protected by a duralumin frame, which, when dropped, does not allow the screen or casing to break.  Thanks to the gasket installed between the halves of the body, the possibility of water penetration is completely eliminated.  Such an element is used in the battery compartment and under the keyboard.  All connectors located on the sides are covered with plugs.  However, there is a slight flaw on the part of the company - they are completely separable.  As a rule, most people lose their stubs over time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The keyboard of the Siemens M65 model deserves special attention.  Its composition is standard.  At the top of the phone (below the screen) there is a joystick.  It has five positions: right, left, up, down and pressing.  The digital block is standard.  The buttons for accepting and resetting the call are triangular in shape, located just below the soft keys.  In the manufacture of the keyboard, the manufacturer used two types of materials: plastic - for a column with the numbers "0", "8", "5", "2" and control buttons, and rubber - for external speakers.  The joystick has a plastic case, but with a rubber tip, thanks to which it is easy to operate. </p><p>  The shape of the buttons and the relief are excellent.  Pressed easily.  However, there is one drawback.  Due to the large screen, the keyboard turned out to be small and ‚Äúknocked down‚Äù at the bottom of the device.  Therefore, when working with one hand, there is a chance to drop the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siemens m65 battery" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1450570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Siemens M65 will amaze any user with a truly huge screen.  It has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã13 square centimeters.  The display is capable of reproducing more than 65 thousand colors, which is already good for models of this type.  Resolution - 176x132 pixels.  Image quality is above average.  In the M65 phone, the screen is equipped with a reflective backing.  Thanks to her, the display remains bright in the sun, the text is clearly visible.  Many users have noticed that, being on the street, you can not even use the backlight.  Such an innovation will be useful to those who spend a lot of time outdoors, in particular athletes.  There are no equal analogues among the models in this segment.  Therefore, we can safely say that the manufacturer managed to create a real sports model. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSiemens M65‚Äù works for 5-10 days without recharging.  The battery is lithium-ion.  Its capacity is 750 mAh.  As mentioned above, the compartment is protected by special gaskets.  Thanks to them, the battery does not get dirty and does not get wet.  The battery itself has a side mount.  It is quite reliable.  In order to open the compartment, you will need to do several complex manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Turn the key plate on the frame. </li><li>  Pull it out of the connector. </li><li>  Remove the metal frame from the housing. </li><li>  Detach the ring near the camera lens. </li><li>  Remove the back cover. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siemens m65 review" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1450587.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Other characteristics </h2><ul><li>  Camera: 0.3 Mr. </li><li>  Memory: 11 Mb. </li><li>  Ringtone: polyphony, 40 melodies, vibration alert. </li><li>  Messages: EMS, SMS, MMS. </li><li>  Organizer: clock, calculator, alarm clock, stopwatch, etc. </li></ul><p>  Here is such a phone, which many prefer to use now, when smartphones have almost completely conquered the world! </p>
