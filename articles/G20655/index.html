Yuri Dolgoruky - biography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the history of Kievan Rus there are not many rulers who left a significant mark.  Each of the princes left a milestone in the chronology of events, which is now being studied by scientists.  Some of them distinguished themselves by campaigns against neighboring states, someone annexed new lands, someone entered into a historically important alliance with enemies.  Yuri Dolgoruky undoubtedly did not take the last place among them.  This ruler is interesting even for the fact that many historians consider the founder of Moscow.  The prince received the nickname "Dolgoruky" for his constant attempts to conquer Kiev and other cities of Kievan Rus. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of reign </h2><p>  Before considering the years of reign, it is worth familiarizing yourself with his biography.  Date of birth is still a controversial issue.  It is known that the future prince appeared in 1090 and was the youngest <span>son of Vladimir Monomakh.</span>  Yuri Dolgoruky is a bearer of the surname Rurikovich.  And although he was born in Kiev, his childhood passed in Rostov.  For the first time he became the prince of the Rostov-Suzdal principality in 1113 with his brother Mstislav.  However, starting in 1125, the lands passed into the sole subordination of Yuri. </p><p>  Despite the imperious and difficult nature, the policy of Yuri Dolgoruky under his rule brought much benefit to Kievan Rus, although ambitious plans (for the most part) brought death and destruction.  Several years passed after the accession of the ruler to the throne, as he led the campaign against the Volga Bulgars.  Such an order came from Vladimir Monomakh, after the capture of Suzdal by this people.  After the campaign, in 1125, Prince Yuri Dolgoruky transferred the capital of his principality to Suzdal, thereby reducing the political importance of Rostov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  On the throne of the Rostov-Suzdal principality and the first conquest of Kiev </h2><p>  The period from 1120 to 1147 is not particularly remarkable, except for one fact - during this period Moscow was founded.  <span>The domestic policy of</span> Yuri Dolgoruky comes down to the construction of churches.  And of course, interference in the internecine feuds of the princes of Kievan Rus.  Although it is necessary to give it its due - many existing cities, as history testifies, Yuri Dolgoruky turned into centers of trade and crafts.  This approach could not help contributing to their development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri Dolgoruky biography" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/388823.jpg?1399216809895" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Civil strife arose, as a rule, because of the Kiev throne and the order of its succession.  The desire to take the throne in the main city of Russia was not alien to the Rostov-Suzdal ruler.  The Grand Duke not only tried to remove new proteges, but also personally took this place.  In the end, the Kiev throne in 1149 was occupied by Yuri Dolgoruky.  In short, the seniority of inheritance was violated, and many were outraged.  The displaced Izyaslav took advantage of this discontent and entered into an alliance with the Hungarians and Poles. </p><p>  The unpopularity of the new sovereign and the concluded alliance did not allow Dolgoruky to hold on to the board for a long time.  The year 1151 was for Yuri Vladimirovich the date of losing the throne in Kiev and returning to his principality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The foundation of Moscow </h2><p>  It is Prince Yuri Dolgoruky who is considered the founder of Moscow, although disputes between historians still arise on this subject.  The border settlement was located at the point of contact of several principalities at once - Novgorod, Ryazan, Suzdal, Seversky and Smolensky.  The town was located on the Moskva River, which, like other villages on the banks, belonged to the boyar Kuchka.  The reasons why the land owner was executed are unknown, but after that Yuri Dolgoruky took the city and other settlements.  Moscow began to develop - a princely estate was built, a wooden Kremlin, churches and other buildings.  Christianity was also planted among the population of the Gentiles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Yuri Dolgoruky" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/388820.jpg?1399216874536" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Initially, the settlement was called Kukov, later it was renamed to Moscow.  But a large city, which had a significant and political influence on the life of the Rostov-Suzdal principality and Kievan Rus, it became only after the change of three generations of descendants of Yuri the First. </p><h2>  The foundation of Russian cities - Pereyaslavl-Zalessky </h2><p>  The reign of Yuri Dolgoruky was distinguished not only by attempts to capture the Kiev throne, but also by the creation and development of new Russian cities.  So, besides Moscow, cities such as Pereyaslavl-Zalessky and Yuryev-Polsky were founded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The erection was due not to the ambitious plans of the prince.  Frequent attacks of the Volga Bulgars led to the need to strengthen the borders of the principality.  Pereyaslavl-Zalessky was transferred to the lowland - at the <span>mouth of the</span> Trubezh River.  A moat was dug around the perimeter of the south and west sides of the city, which connected with the natural barriers of the approaches to the city.  The fortress for the defense of Pereyaslavl was considered one of the largest, erected by Yuri. </p><h2>  Yuryev-Polsky - a fortress on the border of the Principality </h2><p>  For the same purpose, the city of Yuryev-Polsky was founded.  A round fortress was erected to protect the city.  It was surrounded by 7-meter shafts, which have survived to this day.  There were three breaks in the fortress wall - the gates to Vladimir, Moscow and Pereyaslavl-Zalessky.  A city was built near the mouth of the Gzu River on the banks of Koloksha. </p><h2>  Gorodets on the Volga River </h2><p>  The city was founded by Yuri Dolgoruky in 1152 in the middle reaches of the Volga.  In ancient manuscripts he was also called Radilov.  The city was a military garrison, artisans and peasants.  Residents of the city not only ensured the existence of the city, but also conducted active trade with Kiev, Asian countries, Bulgaria, the Baltic states.  The main purpose of Gorodets was to deter the Volga Bulgars from moving into Russian lands. </p><h2>  The foundation of Dmitrov </h2><p>  The city was founded in 1154 and named after the son of Yuri Dolgoruky, who was born in the same year.  Dmitrov was built in the swampy lowlands of the Yakhroma River.  For protection, the Kremlin was built at the foot of the mountain.  On the one hand, the fortress was protected by impenetrable swamps, on the other - an artificial moat, which in some places reached a width of 30 meters.  The walls were fortified with towers.  It was a remote place, surrounded by swamps and forests, on the very outskirts of the Suzdal principality. </p>

    <h2>  The second reign in Kiev </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the possessions of Yuri were quite extensive, the prince did not give up attempts to obtain the throne of Kiev.  Having conquered Ryazan in 1154, the prince went on a campaign in the southern lands of Kievan Rus.  On the way, he entered into a truce with Rostislav Smolensky and in 1155 he reigned in the capital of Kievan Rus again, occupying it with his ally Svyatoslav Olgovich.  Izyaslav, who ruled Kiev, surrendered the city without a fight and fled to Chernigov.  To strengthen his power, Yuri sent to reign his sons in the cities that were under his influence.  However, the rule was short-lived - in 1157 Yuri Dolgoruky died.  There is a version that he was poisoned by the boyars who did not like the new ruler.  After his death, an uprising broke out, during which the princely court was looted. </p><h2>  Family life of Yuri Dolgoruky </h2><p>  Some historical and artistic sources mention the prince's complex character.  At the same time, they indicate that Yuri was a beloved son and his father, Vladimir Monomakh, indulged him in everything.  However, the time came when Dolgoruky had to submit to the will of the Kiev prince.  In 1108, Yuri Dolgoruky got a wife.  Naturally, the marriage took place for political reasons of his father, however, like all the marriages between the rulers of the states then. </p><p>  The first wife of the future Prince of Rostov-Suzdal was the daughter of the Polovtsian Khan Alena Osipovna.  The wife liked the prince, and he somewhat settled down.  Soon the young couple was sent to the northeast in the Principality of Rostov.  From this marriage Rostislav (reigned in Novgorod), Andrey Bogolyubsky, Ivan, Gleb and Boris were born.  Three daughters were born from the first wife: Elena, Maria and Olga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reign of Yuri Dolgoruky" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/388836.jpg?1399217439595" width="600"></div>

    <p>  He had a second wife, Yuri Dolgoruky.  The biography has very little information about her, nowhere is even mentioned the year of marriage to her.  But from her, Yuri Dolgoruky had six sons - Vasilko, Mstislav, Yaroslav, Svyatoslav, Mikhail and Vsevolod. </p><h2>  Residence of Yuri Dolgoruky </h2><p>  Since the Grand Duke did not feel too confident in Rostov because of the political situation in the state, he moved to Suzdal.  But his residence was not in Suzdal, but in a village called Kideksha.  This was done for similar reasons - Yuri Dolgoruky was afraid of the Suzdal boyars.  The fortified settlement quickly grew where Kamenka flows into the Nerl.  On one side, Kideksha was protected by the high banks of the river; on the other, the fortress was surrounded by a high rampart with an oak picket fence on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of Yuri Dolgoruky" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/388832.jpg?1399217340707" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Since Yuri Dolgoruky was very pious, churches were also built in the village.  However, after the death of Prince Kideksha lost its significance.  His son moved the capital to Vladimir, and the residence in Bogolyubovo.  In 1238, after the invasion of the Tatar-Mongol horde, the village was sacked and desolate. </p><h2>  Monument to the founder of Moscow </h2><p>  Disputes about the emergence of the city do not stop between historians so far.  Nevertheless, the residents themselves believe that it was founded by Yuri Dolgoruky.  Moscow served as a meeting place for the prince and his brother, according to ancient chronicles.  Under Stalin, it was decided to erect a monument to Yuri Dolgoruky.  It is located on Tverskaya Square in Moscow.  In 1946, a competition was announced, it was won by Orlov, who had never before engaged in <span>monumental sculpture.</span> </p><p>  But as it turned out, Comrade Stalin himself became interested in the sculptor.  Apparently, he really liked the sculptor's patriotism - at that time, Soviet pioneers were more important than the delegation from the United States.  It turned out that the product created by Orlov, intended for the house of pioneers, was presented to the representative of America.  Orlov wrote a complaint, after which he was scheduled to meet with the head of the USSR.  After which the sculptor led the work on creating the monument.  In the process of creation, changes were made to the project of the monument - as if according to the remarks of Stalin.  One way or another, but the monument was erected in 1954.  But if Stalin was very pleased, then Nikita Khrushchev for some reason did not like the monument.  The stallion‚Äôs naturalness was especially annoying - at his direction the genitals were removed. </p><h2>  Monuments to Yuri Dolgoruky in other cities </h2><p>  <span>Residents of Kostroma</span> also believe that the prince founded their city and helped its development and prosperity.  The monument was erected on Voskresenskaya Square on the day of the 850th anniversary of the city.  The project was developed by Vladimir Tserkovnikov.  The monument weighs 4 tons and has a height of 4.5 meters. </p><p>  In Pereslavl-Zalessky, a bust of Dolgoruky was installed.  Orlov worked on its creation, as well as on the Moscow monument.  It is located in the Goritsky monastery, where it was transported from Moscow in 1963. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to Yuri Dolgoruky" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/388854.jpg?1399216959255" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The monument to Yuri Dolgoruky in Dmitrov was created by Churchmen.  It is located on the Historical Square, which is surrounded by the remains of the ancient Kremlin near the Assumption Cathedral.  Today it is a museum reserve.  According to legends, the monument was erected exactly at the place where they predicted the birth of a son. </p><h2>  Temples built by Yuri Dolgoruky </h2><p>  All chroniclers noted the great piety of the prince.  Therefore, in addition to fortresses and cities, you can find many temples built by order of Yuri Dolgoruky.  Of the mentioned references, the following can be noted: Transfiguration Cathedral (Pereslavl-Zalessky), Church of Boris and Gleb (Kideksha), St. George Cathedral (Vladimir), Church of the Savior (Suzdal), Nativity Cathedral (Suzdal) . </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  The personality of the prince is very contradictory.  Greed, cruelty, power - the features that fully possessed Yuri Dolgoruky.  A biography describes not only these features.  He was also a visionary politician who understood the importance of well-fortified borders not only with neighboring states, but also between the <span>principalities of Kievan</span> Rus.  Very ambitious and pious was Yuri Dolgoruky.  A biography written by different authors confirms this - several attempts to seize the princely throne in Kiev, the seizure of the cities of Bulgaria, the foundation and strengthening of cities, the construction of temples. </p><p>  Despite everything, the prince nevertheless left a significant mark in the history of Kievan Rus - many cities and churches still exist.  And the fact that the capital and the boyars did not like the rule of the prince is understandable.  Then the rulers were very dependent on the boyars, who, in turn, were objectionable to those who had determination and authority.  But in his native Rostov-Suzdal principality after his death, he was remembered with gratitude.  After all, the defense against the Polovtsy and the Bulgars was organized precisely by Yuri Dolgoruky. </p>
