Thousands of tourists are attracted by the local exotic nature, mild marine climate, sandy beaches, developed infrastructure and great opportunities for entertainment and shopping.  You can swim in the sea and sunbathe on the city beaches in Patong all year round, with the only difference being that high waves at sea or heavy short-term showers can interfere with the rest in the rainy season, from December to February. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches and beach vacations </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the third coastline, just a 10-minute walk from the sea coast.  Most accessible for guests Raha Gold Residence 3 * <span>(Phuket) Patong</span> Beach.  This popular, clean white sand beach is equipped with sun loungers and parasols.  In the daytime, on Patong Beach, you can not only swim and sunbathe, but also find various types of active water activities: attractions, diving, sea fishing and much more.  The beach is always crowded, there are bars, many traders of food, drinks and inexpensive souvenirs.  In the evening, the entire beach area turns into a place for a disco: beach equipment is removed, loud music plays until the morning. </p><p>  In addition to Patong Beach, the city has several more beaches, quite well equipped and relatively clean.  In general, the area occupied by the beaches has a length of more than 3 km.  What impressions about a beach vacation are most often shared by guests of the Raha Gold Residence (Patong) 3 *?  Reviews often note such features: </p><ul><li>  Beautiful scenery, clear sea water and white sand.  Good entry to the sea.  Very picturesque sunsets, especially in the northern part of the city. </li><li>  Variety and flexible prices for water activities. </li><li>  Rental equipment is quite cheap, about 100 rubles.  The staff of the rental centers is very attentive, umbrellas are constantly regulated to create the most comfortable conditions for vacationers. </li><li>  Fun and safe discos. </li></ul><p>  Resentment among tourists most often causes the road from the hotel to the beach: it is littered all the way, complaints about an unpleasant smell and a large number of insects are frequent.  As for the beach itself, among the shortcomings is the importunity of local merchants, a small amount of plankton in sea water, and pollution of the territory during a large influx of vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Equipment and general condition of the rooms: guest opinions </h2><p>  The comfort level in Raha Gold rooms is most often mentioned in reviews by those guests who did not like the hotel.  As a rule, first of all, tourists are discouraged by the layout of rooms without windows.  What, according to former hotel guests, does not correspond to the three-star level?  And what can attract Raha Gold Residence (Patong) 3 * new guests?  Reviews of tourists are quite unanimous: you should not count on a spacious room or "five-star" comfort in an inexpensive hotel, primarily intended for tourists who came to sunbathe all day and have fun at night.  What are the advantages of staying at this hotel tourists call? </p><ul><li>  Nice furniture and comfortable beds in the rooms. </li><li>  Daily cleaning, linen, towels. </li><li>  Large modern flat-screen TV. </li><li>  Fresh repair.  Modest, but rather cozy interior. </li></ul><p>  But comments on the hotel rooms are enough: </p><ul><li>  Lack of sound insulation.  A huge minus, given the proximity of the busiest street of the city with a large number of night discos and the roadway near the hotel. </li><li>  Appliances and equipment in the rooms are not new and often break down.  Disconnecting Wi-Fi or a Russian-language channel, non-working sockets, a kettle, a towel dryer - all these problems are often mentioned by former guests.  It is worth noting that malfunctions are repaired at the request of the guest at the reception. </li><li>  The safe in the room does not provide reliable storage.  It‚Äôs just a drawer, not attached to the wall or floor, with an easily openable lock. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the room has a kettle, dishes for tea drinking in the room may not bring.  Tourists have to buy mugs, spoons and tea itself at the mall. </li><li>  Close bathroom. </li></ul><h2>  Paid services </h2><ul><li>  Transfer (bus or minibus to / from the airport). </li><li>  Breakfast (optionally included in the room price when booking). </li><li>  Extra bed (at 2016 prices: children under 12 years old - 500 baht / day, older than this age - 700 baht / day). </li><li>  Room service. </li><li>  Babysitter (nanny). </li><li>  Massage. </li><li>  Laundry and ironing. </li></ul><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel provides the opportunity to immediately pay for breakfast for the entire stay.  However, tourists who are accustomed to the "buffet", a set of breakfast dishes may seem too modest.  There are few reviews on the quality of food in the restaurants of the hotel complex, but the assessment of the hotel‚Äôs cuisine is positive: the dishes look delicious, the food is of high quality.  The Chinese restaurant on the ground floor has a large number of exotic dishes, although it bothers guests with the sharp smells of food that are spread throughout the building. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment and shopping opportunities </h2><p>  About leisure for guests of Raha Gold Residence 3 * reviews of tourists practically do not mention.  According to official information, animators work in the hotel staff, and there is karaoke on the premises.  In addition, guests can use the services of a hotel massage parlor and spa, visit the nearest water park.  Definitely, the tourists agree on one thing: there are many entertainments in Patong itself.  From the Raha Gold Residence 3 * hotel you can quickly, on foot or by rented transport, visit any part of the resort: visit the Thai boxing stadiums Patong and Bangla, take a cable jump from a height of 50 m to the <span>Bungy Jump,</span> visit the ancient Buddhist temple of Suwan Khiri.  In the vicinity of the city there is a large shooting range with firearms and there is the opportunity to take a ride on an elephant. </p><p>  When it comes to city entertainment, especially Patong's vibrant nightlife, the first thing worth mentioning is Bangla Road, the resort‚Äôs main street, which starts right from the main entrance to Patong Beach.  On a rather short street, only about 500 m, there is a huge number of nightclubs, discos, bars and other entertainment venues, including an erotic one.  In addition, Bangla Road, unlike the rest of the city, has 24-hour shops and cafes.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the Simon cabaret with an evening enchanting trance show. </p><p>  Fans of shopping at reasonable prices can find for themselves a lot of interesting things in the Jungceylon shopping center.  In addition to the large supermarket Big C, an analogue of Russian stores Auchan, the building has cafes, gift shops and inexpensive Asian goods, as well as branded retail outlets of well-known brands, for example, Swarovski, Espada, Nixon, Mango, Pierre Cardin and more.  A unique evening fountain show can be seen daily at Jungceylon. </p>
