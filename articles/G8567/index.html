    <p>  Weaving should begin with the head.  To do this, string two pieces of gum, which should not be twisted by a figure eight.  After that, you need to attach two triangles across.  To make the dog beautiful eyes, you should take the black elastic bands and throw them on the posts.  Then you should start creating ears.  This item must be made of four pairs of brown rubber bands.  In the end you need to knit using black.  After that, they must be transferred to the head.  Next, you need to take up the weaving of the body.  A neck, shoulders, two pairs down in each row.  After that, you can start creating the tail.  At the end, you need to wind the black tip. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The final stage of creating the figure involves the creation of lower and upper paws.  After weaving the tail and legs of the dog, they need to be moved to the right place.  At the top of the head, you need to make a loop and remove the resulting product from the machine.  The cute dog is ready, now you know how to weave animals from rubber bands on the machine. </p><h2>  Weave an owl from gum </h2><p>  To weave such a figure, you need to take the machine from which the row located in the middle is removed.  It is necessary to start stringing gum with the second column.  Those that are in the first row should be folded in two turns and strung by a figure of eight diagonally from the second to the third column. </p>

Then the gum should be twisted by eight and put on until the end of the machine.  It is important that the last four columns are the same as the first.  All subsequent rows are eights.  However, they should not be thrown diagonally, but on parallel columns.

    <p>  The columns that are on the edges are twisted in two turns.  When these actions are carried out, along the machine you need to throw one rubber band.  Next, you need to take the hook and all the elastic bands located in the bottom row, throw off to the central part.  Then again you need to throw the gum around the machine and remove those that are in the bottom row in the same way. </p><p>  Next, you need to resume rolling over the entire machine and again begin to reset them.  According to this principle, 12 rows should be done.  Already from the 3rd column, you need to start throwing elastic bands in a different shade.  In total, you need to make seven columns.  Next, the gum of the main color must be worn on posts throughout the machine. </p><p>  After that, you will have to take on the extension of the gum.  It is carried out as follows: a new rubber band is stretched through those that are on the column.  The gum from the column is removed, after which a new one is thrown on it.  Such actions are carried out on two columns: the first and the last.  Further weaving continues throughout the machine.  Then you need to re-do the extension on the columns where gum of a different color is strung.  Such manipulations are carried out a couple of times.  On the hook you need to make 9 loops of 10 elastic bands, and put on the columns of one row.  Then weaving should continue according to the same pattern. </p><h2>  Rubber band snake on a slingshot </h2><p>  So, we will consider how to weave animals on a slingshot from gum.  If there is no machine at hand, with the help of a slingshot you can weave a beautiful snake.  To create such a figure you will need a hook, 65 rubber bands (54 orange, 6 black, white, 1 red).  Colors for the figure can also be selected based on your preferences.  It will take only 10 minutes to weave a snake on a slingshot.  You need to start weaving from the tail.  You can adjust its length yourself.  The head and tail of the snake are fused. </p>
