This campaign turned out to be the bloodiest for Americans.  Neither before nor after did the United States lose so many people and equipment.  Recall the causes of this conflict, as well as the course of hostilities.  We will announce not only the loss of the United States in Vietnam, but also the loss of the other side, as well as local residents who were victims of this conflict. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in Vietnam" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522718.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons for the war </h2><p>  The war was connected with the division of the world after World War II into two systems: capitalist and socialist.  The war in Korea ended, dividing the once united country into two camps.  It was the turn of Vietnam.  By 1954, it was already divided along the 17th parallel into the Northern (socialist) and Southern (capitalist under the control of France).  The North was actively advancing with the support of the PRC and the USSR, trying to create a single state under its own flag.  The issue of unification was only a matter of time.  The South, of course, did not want to put up with this state of affairs, and the capitalist states, led by the United States, did not intend to give up another springboard under the banner of the socialist camp. </p><h2>  Occasion </h2><p>  American society is painfully reacting to the loss of its soldiers in any wars.  Therefore, before the onset of any conflict, serious information propaganda is conducted.  To start operations, an armed incident is needed that could be used as an excuse to unleash hostilities.  They became an event in Tokyo Bay on August 2, 1964.  The US Navy destroyer Maddox approached the borders of North Vietnam and was attacked.  And on August 5, 1964, the Americans began the bombing.  This event still raises a lot of questions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Why would the destroyer approach the shore of a hostile state?  Before this event, the Americans landed an instructor landing in the South.  The north was already seen as an enemy. </li><li>  The circumstances of the death of the ship were not finally clarified.  There is a version that the Viet Cong could not physically destroy this ship. </li><li>  Quick decision making.  Only three days passed between the destruction of the destroyer and the start of the attack.  Consequently, the military was already aware of how the provocation would end. </li></ol><h2>  Start </h2><p>  All the forces of the North were united in the Viet Cong organization.  Hence the name ‚ÄúViet Cong‚Äù, which was synonymous with the word ‚Äúcommunists‚Äù for Western countries. </p><p>  In 1961, the United States sent its instructors and military to the region.  The first US losses in Vietnam appeared.  However, America did not conduct full-scale hostilities.  Her participation was in training the southerners.  However, the leadership of the United States understood that the forces of the Viet Cong with the support of the social camp were not comparable. </p><p>  In 1963, the North at the Battle of Apbach destroyed almost the entire army of the south.  Partisan-Vietkongites already numbered about 8 thousand people in the territory of the enemy.  By 1964, the United States was moving a large contingent of 25 thousand people here.  Before that, there were only 800 specialists and fighters.  Military conflict was inevitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in Vietnam over years" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522720.jpg" width="350"></div>

President Johnson has announced the start of Operation Flaming Spear.  Its meaning was to inflict airstrikes on the positions of the Viet Cong.  However, this did not have a particular result. </p><p>  Full-scale intervention, Operation Thunderclap.  Conventional airstrikes did not have an effect.  In the thick jungle, finding objects for destruction is very difficult.  Then the United States is developing Operation Thunder.  Its essence is carpet bombing of vast territories with the use of ground forces.  The number of personnel brought up to 180 thousand people.  In the next three years, the group of Americans increased to half a million. </p><p>  <span>Carpet bombing</span> leads to large losses among civilians.  I would like to note that the doctrine of bombing, adopted by England in 1920, was adopted by the United States.  It was actively used in Dresden during the Second World War.  Its purpose is to terrify all populations.  In this case, the killing of civilians is considered part of the overall plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in Vietnam aviation" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522716.jpg" width="558"></div>

    <h2>  Offensive of North Vietnam </h2><p>  I immediately want to dispel the myth that the Viet Cong fought a defensive war, and the Americans waged an offensive.  This is actually not the case.  At first, all the main actions were carried out by partisan detachments precisely on the territory of <span>South Vietnam.</span>  The actual aggressor was the Viet Cong. </p><p>  On Theta Day, January 30, the North launched a large-scale offensive in 1968.  This was unexpected, since under the contract these days no military operations should be conducted.  US losses in Vietnam these days have seriously increased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in Vietnam in people and technology" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522717.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All attacks were successfully repelled, but the city of Hue was lost to the Americans.  Only in March did the offensive finally drown.  After this, the southerners and the Americans go on the counterattack with the goal of returning Hue.  The most bloody battle in the history of the entire war has unfolded. </p><p>  The city was of strategic importance.  It is one of the three major centers of South Vietnam along with Saigon and Da Nang.  The main highway connecting the northern territories with the capital passed through it.  The army north of Hue was cut off from land supplies.  In the XIX century, this city was the capital of a single state.  Therefore, it had a symbolic meaning. </p><p>  The loss of the Americans in the battle of Hue totals about 200 people killed.  Southerners - about 400. However, the loss of the Viet Cong was much more serious - about 5 thousand people.  It is believed that it was this defeat that finally undermined their military potential. </p><h2>  The Battle of Hue - US Military Glory </h2><p>  The victory at Hue is considered one of the memorable battles in US history along with the battles at Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands), World War II, at Chosin (Korea).  The military leadership gained vast experience in conducting military operations in the city.  Previously, the marine corps did not lead them in large settlements.  It is believed that it was here that the Americans developed the tactics of conducting combat in urban conditions, which they then successfully applied during the storming of Falluji in 2004 (Iraq).  3 battalions of the marine corps and 11 battalions of the South Vietnamese forces took part in the battles at Hue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in Vietnam aircraft" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522714.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  US losses in Vietnam: aviation </h2><p>  The help of the USSR and China was invaluable for North Vietnam.  Only from the Union of DRV received 340 million rubles, which at that time was a very substantial amount.  Soviet instructors helped to master complex technique.  Allies and weapons were supplied, including the latest air defense systems.  US technical losses in Vietnam (aircraft, not counting other equipment) - more than 4 thousand units.  The Americans reported that it was about 0.5 per 1000 sorties.  In war conditions, this figure is small.  However, when crossing the border of North Vietnam, losses increased immediately.  Soviet air defense systems guarded the sky with a reliable shield.  Do not forget about the loss of aircraft in <span>South Vietnam.</span>  Before the war, their aircraft in number occupied the fourth place in the world after the USA, USSR and China.  And here the losses are huge - about 10 thousand aircraft. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in vietnam photo" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522719.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  US losses in Vietnam: helicopters </h2><p>  As for helicopters, here the Americans lost more than 5 thousand units.  That is 3 cars a day. </p><p>  Helicopter - the main technique of the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War.  In conditions of impenetrable jungle and impassability, this is the only transport that is also capable of covering up infantry with fire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="US losses in Vietnam helicopters" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1522715.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, a helicopter is an easy target compared to airplanes.  It is not necessary to have air defense to bring him down.  Since 1972, the Vietnamese armed with appeared Soviet MANPADS "Strela".  Any peasant could take possession of them.  It was in 1972 that the United States realized that they could not win this war.

    <h2>  Christmas Bombings and the End of the War </h2><p>  In 1972, the North made another attempt at a major offensive using tank forces.  However, with the help of <span>American aircraft, the</span> southerners repulsed this attack. </p><p>  After that, the USA carried out serious carpet bombing in large cities of the North: Hanoi and Haiphong.  The operation was called "Christmas bombing."  North Vietnam had to sit at the negotiating table, after which the Americans quickly withdrew their troops.  It is difficult to calculate the US losses in Vietnam over the years.  This war is a record for the number of killed American soldiers.  The desertion in the army flourished, all the cities were frightened by the passing military, who handed out flags.  This meant the death of a close relative in battle.  US losses in Vietnam (photos of <span>war correspondents</span> are given in the article) range from 40-60 thousand people.  This is not counting the Puerto Ricans, who were hired by the army to obtain citizenship, as well as wounded and mutilated.  They were not included in this figure, but for society they were also lost. </p><p>  It was then that the famous boxer Muhammad Ali became a Muslim and adopted a new name, as this provided reservation armor.  Many emigrated from the country.  On the other hand, more than 1 million people, including women and children, died in this war. </p>
