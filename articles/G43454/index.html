Tourists should not forget about vigilance, even though Greece is a country with a low crime rate.  Walking through the streets of cities, it is necessary to remember from the fact that the public use of alcoholic beverages is strictly prohibited in the country.  Moreover, when choosing souvenirs for friends and relatives, it is important to exclude from the number of purchases those that may be of some value or antiquity - the discovery of such at the airport will entail a fine in the amount established by local law. </p><p>  Practice shows that visiting beaches in Greece is carried out mainly on a free basis.
