    <p>  A lot of attention is paid to local history.  Organized walks along hiking trails, a variety of informative discussions on the development of the resort city of Sochi, the <span>inhabitants of the Black Sea, the</span> history of the Yunost sanatorium, the flora of the Matsesta, and so on.  This is necessary in order to create in children an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city where they came to be treated.  According to psychologists, this not only broadens the mind, but also contributes to the effectiveness of the healing process, for which the children come to the Yunost sanatorium (Sochi). </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  To obtain permits that are provided from the federal budget, parents need to collect a package of required documents and submit them to the local health department.  If the answer is yes, the application is sent to the sanatorium, and not earlier than six months before arrival.  Here she is examined by specialists, after which, in the absence of contraindications, the child is invited to treatment in order of priority. </p><p>  You can buy a ticket yourself directly in the sanatorium by writing a statement addressed to the head physician and providing all the necessary medical certificates.  The cost of the ticket ranges from 1300 to 1700 rubles per day.  The indicated amount includes accommodation, meals, treatment and some entertainment programs that are provided free of charge by the Yunost sanatorium (Sochi). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Prices for tickets vary depending on the season.  Parents whose children came here for treatment note in their reviews the excellent conditions that the Yunost sanatorium (Sochi) offers its guests.  Great area, a lot of entertainment, a healthy atmosphere, modern equipment.  But the main thing - amazing nature and the sea - all this contributes to recovery. </p><p>  In some reviews, adults express dissatisfaction with the lack of a pool, but the administration resolved this issue, and soon it will appear in a new building. </p>
