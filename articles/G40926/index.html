    <p>  A separate topic for discussion is the speed of order processing by a broker.  According to customers, among numerous brokers, it is Forex4you that responds to orders faster.  There is more than one review in this matter; quite a lot of positive feedback on the speed of working with orders in the company can be found.  After analyzing the words of traders, you can give some numbers.  On cent accounts, any orders of traders are processed within 2 seconds, but no more.  Although there are requotes and delays in processing orders up to 5-10 seconds, they are more likely an exception to the rule.  On classic accounts, processing orders takes no more than 2 seconds.  Trading on professional accounts is conducted without significant delay, with a delay of 0.5 seconds.  It is also important that malfunctions in the terminal of the company are practically not encountered and do not cause losses to the customers of the center. </p><h2>  Opportunities for investors </h2><p>  Like any other broker, the company offers a wide range of services not only for traders, but also for investors.  Those who are interested in Forex (the market is scary, and there is no willingness to trade on their own yet), the project opens up access to smart investment programs.  You can invest in one of the following products: </p><ul><li><p>  PAMM service. </p></li><li><p>  Share4you is a system for copying transactions. </p></li></ul><p>  Both PAMM accounts and Share4you provide a capital gain of 150% and 300%, respectively, of the initial deposit and more.  Information on trade managers is open, and you can independently evaluate the level of knowledge and strategy of the trader.  An open partnership scheme allows you to choose the safest and most effective way to increase capital.  While a person will do what he loves, his capital will increase every minute. </p><h2>  Innovative investor tool Share4you </h2>
