The Sea of ​​Azov is one of the smallest seas on our planet.  Its average depth is 7 meters and the maximum depth is 13 meters.  Most of all, this sea coast is suitable for families with small children.  The shores here are very gentle, sandy beaches, without stones.  The sea descends very smoothly into the depths, and the wide coastal strip is very shallow.  The water here perfectly warms up to 30 degrees.  The beaches are very quiet, there are not very many tourists here.  The largest <span>resort of the Azov</span> coast is the city of Yeysk.  Here is the famous sanatorium, which will be discussed today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azov Sea Resort" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1287059.jpg" width="600"></div>
