    <p>  The hotel always has a guide with whom you can book excursions.  A huge number of people walk on the beach, inviting you to see the sights of the island.  Very close to the complex (10 minutes) is the Djerba Golf Club.  In addition, the hotel has an outdoor pool, a heated indoor pond working during the cool season, a children's pool with attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Midoun is the second largest city on the island of Djerba.  It is located outside the tourist area, which gives tourists the opportunity to fully experience the oriental flavor of Tunisia.  There are noisy markets, mosques, the historical museum of Lal Hadria. </p><p>  Midoun is interesting because it is located only fifteen kilometers from the capital of the island of Houmt Souk.  The population of the city is only 50,000 inhabitants, but most of it lives outside the city.  Midoun is located in the most fertile area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island.  In the old days, when caravans of slaves went to Djerba from the Sahara, a huge slave market appeared in the city.  Part of the slaves was freed and settled here, which is why there are a lot of black Africans in Midoun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seabel rym beach 4 tunisia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1521037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Over the past few decades, a small village has turned into an interesting tourist center, which is quite popular on the island.  The city is especially crowded on market days.  In the mosque area there is a market for vegetables and cattle.  Tourists love to wander around it in search of interesting goods, immersed in the atmosphere of typical life on the island.  The market is surrounded by cozy restaurants and cafes, where you can refresh yourself during the promenade between the malls.  For tourists, the most interesting are trays with souvenirs, of which there are a great many throughout the city.  Going to the market in Midoun, it should be remembered that here you can‚Äôt buy anything without bargaining.  Not a single merchant offers goods at a real price, all prices are too high, so before you make a purchase, you need to bargain thoroughly with the seller. </p><h2>  Interesting places in the city </h2><p>  It should be noted that Midoun in terms of attractions is not as interesting as other resorts of the island.  But still there are several places that you can see.  Every Tuesday in the main square of the city you can see a stunning spectacle called the Barbary wedding.  The rite is interesting in terms of knowledge of local traditions. </p><p>  The main attractions of Midoun include the Fadhlum Mosque, which is located on the road to Houmt Souk.  It can be visited not even by Muslims.  In addition, vacationers are interested in old presses for olive oil.  The tour allows you to learn the basics of obtaining raw materials. </p><h2>  Reviews about Seabel Rym Beach 4 * (Tunisia, Djerba) </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to pay attention to reviews about it.  Should I recommend it to vacationers planning to visit Tunisia?  Hotel Seabel Rym Beach 4 *, according to tourists, is an excellent four-star complex for families.  It is perfect for those tourists who want to be on the sandy coast, away from city problems and bustle.  It is located some distance from the city center.  If you are looking for active entertainment and parties, then this complex is clearly not for you.  There is no entertainment around the hotel; you can make a promenade only along the coast. </p><p>  However, such solitude is more than compensated by the most beautiful warm sea, the finest sand and beautiful nature.  The hotel has its own beach, located right next to the hotel building.  It is fenced and is under round-the-clock protection.  But despite this, annoying merchants walk along the shore anyway, the guards drive away especially zealous.  The beach is cleaned daily; on its territory it is always very clean.  Sunset at sea is incredibly smooth and very long, to get to a shallow depth, you need to walk about ten meters.  Adults may not like this beach very much, but it‚Äôs very convenient for children to swim here.  Sometimes algae are nailed to the coast, there are not so many of them, they do not interfere.  Periodically, the workers of the complex clean them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seabel rym beach 4 jerba tunisia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1521038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Seabel Rym Beach 4 * (Djerba) offers tourists accommodation in standard rooms with panoramic views of the sea shore or pool.  The apartment has a double bed, an extra bed, air conditioning, a terrace with plastic furniture.  But for using the refrigerator and safe, you will have to pay extra.  In general, the decor of the rooms is standard for apartments of this category. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily and efficiently, the maids even leave fresh flowers on the bed and make swans from towels.  Left a tip, of course, have the desired effect.  Towels are also changed every day.  But regarding beach towels, there are some inconveniences: they are issued on deposit, each replacement costs money.  Therefore, it‚Äôs easier to come with your own beach accessories. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition in Seabel Rym Beach 4 *.  Reviews of tourists about him are very good.  Of course, someone lacks variety, but most of the guests are very pleased with the number of dishes and their taste.  Themed evenings are organized several times a week.  For dinner, seafood is served daily (shrimp, mussels, crabs, snails), twice a day guests are pampered with an unlimited amount of ice cream and various fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seabel rym beach 4 tunisia djerba" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1521040.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Every day on the tables you can see meat dishes, poultry, fish, salads, side dishes.  Food is always served in sufficient quantities, no one remains hungry.  All drinks are included in the price of All Inclusive, so they can be taken in unlimited quantities.  Local alcohol and cocktails based on it are also free.  According to tourists, the food is very high quality and good.  But the service of the waiters is a bit slow, they do not always have time to clean the dishes on time.  But at the same time, they smile cute and are glad to see visitors. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel has a large clean adult pool and a children's pool with slides.  Near the ponds there are not very many tourists, because there is a beautiful sea nearby.  The complex also has its own spa, the cost of which is not included in the tour.  Therefore, everyone can visit it for an additional fee. </p><p>  The hotel always has a representative of the tour operator offering trips around the island.  Local guides offer the same excursions on the beach.  However, it‚Äôs easier to go to Houmt Souk or Midoun by public transport, it will cost you much cheaper.  So, for example, an independent trip to a crocodile farm costs half as much as a trip with a guide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel seabel rym beach 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1521039.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  As a rule, experienced vacationers are advised to visit Midoun, Houmt Souk, a crocodile farm, ride children on a pirate ship.  Animators work at the hotel during the day and evening, inviting to sporting events.  The guys try very hard and work great, however, all programs are created on their own, dancers, fire shows, and artists do not come here. </p><p>  The hotel has a very beautiful and fairly green area with numerous palm trees and flowers.  It is nice to walk along it in the evening, enjoying the scenery. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the above, we can conclude that Seabel Rym Beach 4 * can be recommended as a decent budget vacation spot for those tourists who are not looking for noisy parties, but tend to relax on the beach.  Such guests will definitely enjoy the hotel. </p>
