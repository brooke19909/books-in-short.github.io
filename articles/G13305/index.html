  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Syrian Civil War</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The war in Syria lasts more than five years.  It began with an uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in the spring of 2011.  Over time, various military-political groups and international organizations were involved in the conflict.  Analysts believe that the situation in the Near and Middle East and the ability to fight international terrorism depend on the outcome of the war in Syria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ruined city in syria" class="if uuid-2393008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393008.jpg"></div><h2>  Background </h2><p>  In 2006, a drought began in Syria, which lasted about three years, which, of course, affected the economy.  The depletion of water resources, desertification of lands began.  Agricultural enterprises, which provided grain to almost the entire state, crashed in the first year of the drought.  In 2008, Syria purchased grain abroad for the first time in twenty years.  Of course, prices rose, primarily for rice, wheat, feed.  Cattle breeders fell production. </p><p>  Even before the drought began, Bashar al-Assad reduced subsidies to farmers, and this decision was not canceled even in 2008, when active cattle destruction began.  Ordinary citizens were on the verge of poverty.  About 800 thousand people lost their livelihoods in 2009.  And already in the next famine began.  The rural population reached out to the cities.  About 1.5 million people were forced to leave their homes, which led to an excessive increase in the urban population and, according to many researchers, the emergence of internal conflict. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hunger, unemployment, corruption, social inequality - all this with incredible force escalated over five years and led to a civil war in Syria.  Added to this is the dissatisfaction with Assad‚Äôs socio-political system, which took place even before the drought. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fights in syria 2017" class="if uuid-2393043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393043.jpg"></div><h2>  Civil protests </h2><p>  Like any other internal conflict, the war in Syria began with mass action.  They broke out in March 2011 and, along with performances in Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, Tunisia, were called the "Arab Spring".  Around this time, a community appeared on Facebook calling for mass demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad.  Users immediately responded: on March 15, a rally was held in Damascus.  The protesters demanded the restoration of economic, political and personal freedoms, the destruction of corruption.  A few days later, a new uprising broke out, now in Daria.  This rally led to bloodshed. </p><p>  The imminent outbreak of war in Syria was influenced by the tribal factor that arose among young people from Arab tribes.  These are, as a rule, people who are dissatisfied with their position and blame the ruling regime for everything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the first victims appeared, the president partially recognized the correctness of the requirements, apologized to the relatives of the victims.  The state of emergency, which had been in effect for almost fifty years, was canceled.  The government has resigned.  However, the aggression and violence that swept the whole country, of course, this did not stop.  Performances have already taken place in other cities, accompanied by arson, acts of vandalism. </p><p>  After the death toll amounted to several hundred, the government began using snipers and tanks as a means of suppressing unrest. </p><h2>  Desertion </h2><p>  In 2011, the Israeli press reported that Syrian soldiers were fleeing military units, while officers continued to serve President Bashar al-Assad.  The reason for desertion lies in the reluctance to shoot at fellow citizens. </p><p>  In 2011, the Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed.  Opponents of the president made false predictions about the outcome of the war in Syria.  Russia and Iran, however, intervened in the internal conflict, because of which the "domino effect" did not occur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theodysseyonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Syrian civil war" class="if uuid-2393012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393012.jpg"></div><h2>  Surge of terrorism </h2><p>  In 2012, it became known about the creation of the Islamist group Jebhat An-Nusra.  The organizers announced this publicly.  Then several videos appeared showing evidence of suicide attacks.  The purpose of the group is to declare the increasing role of Islam in the war in Syria.  However, soon the authorities managed to capture the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Damascus,</span> in which, according to terrorists, there will come a "day of trial of all Muslims." </p><div class="photo" data-original="aw.my.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="military operations in syria" class="if uuid-2393037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393037.jpg"></div><h2>  USA </h2><p>  In January 2017, the first joint operation of Russia and Turkey for all the years of the war <span>in Syria began.</span>  <span>The fighting</span> took place in the vicinity of the city of El Bab.  Here front-line bombers Su-34 and Su-24M were involved. </p><p>  After Donald Trump took over as president, he announced that his main task was to defeat ISIS.  Accordingly, he expressed a desire and willingness to interact with Russia.  <span>The chemical attack</span> in Idlib is one of the worst events in the war in Syria.  There were no real battles here, but as a result of a massive missile strike, 80 people were killed.  After that, American warships fired more than 50 cruise missiles, which the Russian authorities regarded as aggression against a sovereign state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="america.aljazeera.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fights in syria" class="if uuid-2393030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393030.jpg"></div><h2>  The liberation of Deir ez-Zor </h2><p>  At the end of May 2017, the opposition withdrew from the city of Homs.  In June, Russia and the United States developed an agreement on de-escalation zones.  Then the countries reached an agreement on the establishment of the dividing line, which became the Euphrates River.  In early September, government forces broke through the blockade of the city of Deir ez-Zora.  Soon, the IG stronghold was taken under control.  The city was completely liberated from the "Islamic State" on November 3.  However, opposition forces continued the offensive along the northeast, left bank of the Euphrates. </p><p>  At the end of 2017, a congress of the peoples of Syria was held in Sochi.  A few days before the summit, Bashar Assad visited Russia. </p><h2>  The war in Syria: recent events </h2><p>  The armed conflict, which has not abated for more than five years, is devoted to many television projects.  The real war in Syria is shown in the film ‚ÄúThe Battle of Syria‚Äù.  Filming took place in hot spots for three months.  However, the documentary film was released in 2013.  The situation has changed since then.  What is the latest news about the war in Syria? </p><p>  The armed group, Jebhat al-Nusra, controls the regions located in the south in the province of Idlib.  In January 2018, Syrian troops, with the support of Russia, continued the offensive.  Sinjar was recaptured from militants. </p><p>  At the beginning of 2018, control over the transport base came from the east of Damascus.  Shortly before this, radical opposition units violated the ceasefire and blocked the base.  On January 8, government forces regained control of the strategic facility.  Both sides suffered losses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Syrian civilians" class="if uuid-2393032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393032.jpg"></div><h2>  Conflict features </h2><p>  It is worth a few words to say about the causes of the Syrian war.  The country's population has a rather complex structure.  Tribal changes are taking place that indirectly influence the course of the Civil War.  True, recently the power of leaders has somewhat weakened.  Nevertheless, tribal consciousness today manifests itself among rural residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blackopinion.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Syria after the bombing" class="if uuid-2393024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2393024.jpg"></div><p>  Islamic extremism has little in common with the religious moderation of the tribes.  However, residents of the regions under the control of the IG are forced to submit.  The Islamic state brutally deals with those who dare to resist the clans. </p>
