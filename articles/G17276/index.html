Interestingly, gambling, which was an integral part of the Soviet courts, got its name from the French word.  “Dominoes” called the clergy robes, which were distinguished by contrasting colors.  Outside, they were completely white, and the lining was made of black fabric. </p><p>  Now in the world there are many varieties of this game and it will be useful to find out how many dominoes are in the set, and what is their difference. </p>

    <h2>  The origin of dominoes </h2><p>  Dominoes originally appeared in China, but once in Europe and, in particular, the Italians, the game has changed significantly.  The hot nation has changed not only the rules, but the appearance of the knuckles.  The chips were made of wood, and they did not have empty edges. </p><p>  Some associate the fun with pastimes of Dominican monks who wore black and white robes.  But there is an assumption that the word "domino" comes from the Latin dominans, which means - the main one. </p><p>  The question of how many dominoes in the set cannot be answered unambiguously.  The number of tiles depends on which version of the game to give preference.  Interestingly, the appearance of the chips is associated with a standard dice.  All the knuckles form combinations that can fall out when tossing two dice.  In fact, the game is their flat version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How many bones in a standard set of dominoes </h2><p>  Now on sale you can find variations of the game.  For children, an option with pictures is offered, so the fun is suitable even for the smallest players who do not yet know how to count. </p><p>  The classic domino case consists of 28 knuckles of traditional rectangular shape, divided into two parts and made in a classic black and white style.  Dots from zero to six are shown on each half of the plate.  The word “knuckles” is associated with dice.  They are otherwise called “bones”. </p>

    <p>  When looking at the plates it is clear: each of them is equivalent to a throw of two cubes.  It is noteworthy that the Chinese version assumes the absence of dots without dots.  In online games, there are versions where the chips show a larger number of points, up to eighteen. </p><h2>  Varieties of games with dominoes </h2><p>  Despite the apparent simplicity, the game is quite interesting and has several versions that are common in Russia and Europe: </p><ol><li>  "Goat". </li><li>  "Donkey". </li><li>  "Sea goat." </li><li>  "Houses". </li></ol><p>  People often say that it is necessary to "kill a goat."  This game will be discussed.  How many pieces are in the set, it is useful to know if the chips are lost from too much gambling or when falling into tenacious children's hands.  So, having collected all 28 tiles, the players are dealt seven chips, if there are two participants, or five if four are playing.  The remainder is called the "bazaar". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Initially, it is determined that the first one to go is someone who has a record with two zeros or sixes.  In the absence of such chips are used in ascending or descending order.  For example, two ones or two fives. </p>

    <p>  If the participants do not have duplicate knuckles at all, then the right to move belongs to the one who has the chip with the highest total points. </p><h2>  Game progress </h2><p>  The first plate is placed in the center of the table, and players take turns putting chips to it, using the pattern of repetition.  However, there is a more interesting approach when using the version of the sum of the digits, which should be six.  For example, there is a “domino” with two dots on the outside, so you need to answer with a knuckle with four dots. </p><p>  Knowing how many dominoes are in the set helps build a strategy and develop versions.  Thus, it is possible to calculate the remaining chips and the advantages available to the competitor. </p><p>  The game is completed by the person who was first freed from his chips, and the bazaar is fully claimed.  There are times when no player has the necessary record.  In this case, the party ends with “fish”. </p><h2>  Chinese version </h2><p>  When asked how much dominoes should be in a set, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the game originally originated in China.  Their version provides 32 bones.  Another difference is the lack of empty chips.  This is due to the fact that the dice do not have empty edges. </p>

    <p>  The absence of zero plates compensates for the Chinese version of the set by the presence of several duplicate bones.  In addition, the eastern countries do not recognize the usual plastic version for us.  Their dominoes are often made of wood.  Ancient exhibits were made of animal bones, which, incidentally, allows us to make assumptions about the origin of the word “knuckles”. </p><h2>  Domino and its non-standard application </h2><p>  With the help of chips, you can not only have fun, but also calmly spread out solitaire.  The plates should be laid out in the form of a pyramid and in turn two pieces at a time.  As soon as the sum of the points is 12, they are removed.  Given the standard set of dominoes (how many tiles in it, its owners know), solitaire is easy to add, to be extremely careful. </p><p>  For those who love unusual ventures and destruction, it is worth trying to realize the "domino principle".  Its essence is that when one plate falls, a wave-like movement occurs, which causes the chips to fall in a certain order. </p><p>  Professionals lay out such intricate designs that a very exciting action looms when destroyed. </p>

    <p>  Now there are a lot of different games based on the classic dominoes.  Many make adjustments on their own and get completely new and unusual board games.  If in sets with dots it is important how many dominoes are in the set, then children's options with pictures can also be used when several chips are lost.  In any case, when a drop of imagination and a share of creativity are manifested, one can make a completely new entertainment out of the usual game for many. </p>
