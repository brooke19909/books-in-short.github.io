    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth telling in more detail about the apartments available at the hotel.  Ashlee Plaza Patong Hotel &amp; Spa has nearly 250 rooms of various categories.  The most popular apartments are Superior 2-bed apartments.  Their area is 28 square meters.  m. The room is made in bright colors, in a very beautiful and sophisticated style.  The floor is parquet, there is a lot of wood in the design, which makes the atmosphere even more comfortable.  However, in the photo below, the number of the improved category is clearly visible. </p><p>  Inside there is a large 2-double bed, there is also a plasma TV with satellite channels, two safes (for a laptop and an ordinary one), a powerful air conditioning, as well as many other things necessary for comfort.  It has a private furnished balcony and a bathroom.  There is a shower, toilet, bidet and free cosmetic kits for each guest.  Some nice extras like a hairdryer, a mini fridge for drinks and a bar are also available in the apartments. </p><p>  And two people will have to pay only 20 tonnes for a week of staying in such a room.  In this case, breakfast will be included in the price.  By the way, a hotel often makes discounts.  And sometimes you can save 25-30% of the room rate.  It is worth remembering this.  The probability of getting a discount is high in the autumn or winter, as fewer people go on vacation at this time, and the hotel needs to somehow attract guests. </p>

    <h2>  About booking and accommodation </h2><p>  This is also a pretty important topic.  Check in at The Ashlee Plaza Patong Hotel &amp; Spa 4 * (Thailand, <span>Phuket, Patong)</span> starts at 2 p.m.  Therefore, it is worth considering this when choosing a flight.  Departure lasts until 12.00.  However, if there are available rooms, and the hotel is not crowded, then guests can go forward and arrange them earlier. </p><p>  The hotel can accommodate with children.  If the child is not four years old, then at the places available in the apartment he can sleep for free.  In the event that he is older (or if another guest just arrived with the guests), he will have to pay another 800 TNV per night.  This is at the current rate - about 1,440 rubles.  But for the guest they will put an extra bed in the room.  There are no baby cradles - you need to remember this. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel accepts not only Visa, Master Card and American Express, but also cash. </p>

    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth talking about the reviews that leave about staying at The Ashlee Plaza Patong Hotel &amp; Spa.  Most of them are positive.  And this is not surprising. </p><p>  People who have been here assure that this hotel is the best option for a successful combination of price and quality.  The apartments are modern, comfortable, have everything you need for your vacation.  The food is not bad and the location is good.  An ideal option for a tourist who wants to pay a small amount for a decent vacation. </p><p>  Guests also like a cozy garden in front of the hotel with gazebos and a small pond in which fish swim.  The hotel may not have its own fenced area, but here in this place you can spend an evening.  Having bought, for example, dinner in a tavern or restaurant and tasted it in the gazebo.  Also nearby is a market where every tourist goes for fruits, souvenirs, clothes and gifts. </p><p>  Many people like the rooftop pool.  It offers amazing views of the surroundings.  And the good thing is that the pool is on the roof of each building. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Naturally, the way the hotel treats guests is for many an important nuance.  And in this regard, Ashlee Plaza shows itself worthy.  Cleaning is daily, high-quality - not superficial.  Towels are changed with the same regularity.  Lingerie - once every few days. </p><p>  Every day, when cleaning, the maids bring bags of sugar, tea and coffee.  Regularly replenish and stocks of cosmetic kits (shampoos, gels, liquid soaps, etc.). </p><p>  By the way, for the convenience of guests, a shuttle was organized (free, of course) from the hotel to the beach, Bangla Road and the large Jungceylon shopping center.  A bus runs four times a day.  His schedule must be specified at the reception.  The same bus takes guests back and forth. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  So, firstly, you need to book apartments in the hotel in advance.  Preferably a few months before the planned trip.  Of course, in 1-2 weeks you can reserve a room, but if you take up this business, you can get a very good discount and save.  True, it is better to plan your trip carefully so that you do not have to cancel your reservation.  Because they may charge you for this. </p><p>  If it is fundamentally important for guests what kind of view will open from their windows, it is worth clarifying this nuance during the registration of the room.  Even if it is already indicated in the description of the apartment.  There are two options: rooms with a view of the side street where another hotel rises, or rooms from the balconies of which you can see the garden. </p><p>  Who should go here?  Anyone who wants to pay a modest amount for a decent hotel.  Mostly youth companies or couples in love come here.  Let the hotel you can stay with the children, but almost no one is resting with them here. </p><p>  By the way, the prices are acceptable not only in the hotel, but in all the places that are nearby.  These are cafes, clubs, restaurants and, of course, the market.  Where to bargain - local sellers do it with pleasure. </p><p>  The only nuance that guests note is the dirty beach.  Basically, it is such in the summer, when Thailand has a large influx of tourists.  This is another good reason to travel to Phuket in the fall or even in the winter.  But there is another way.  It takes about 15 minutes to get to Karon Beach from the hotel.  This place is located in the western part of the island.  It‚Äôs cleaner and quieter.  By the way, Karon Beach is often called ‚Äúsinging sand‚Äù.  He creaks under the feet of vacationers due to the fact that he has a lot of quartz.  Pretty interesting nuance. </p><p>  All in all, Ashlee Plaza is a great vacation destination for many reasons.  And they were listed above.  If you want to experience all this on yourself, then you should go here on vacation. </p>
