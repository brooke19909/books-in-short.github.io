    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of medals goes back to medieval Europe.  In those days, they were not just a reward.  Their presence was considered the highest honor.  They were awarded only to knights.  By medals it was possible to determine the rank of a warrior, the type of his activity, to understand who he was serving.  Such signs were worn only by wealthy layers of the population.  Usually they were feudal lords or representatives of the upper classes.  Already in those days, medals were a symbol of distinction, and the people who wore them were role models. <br><br>  In Russia, these signs appeared at about the same time.  A distinctive feature was that they were awarded only to the military.  Medals were minted gold coins that many did not use for their intended purpose.  Often they were sewn on items of clothing, for example, on shirts and hats.  In the 16-17th centuries, medals began to be stamped in a form more familiar to us, with the name of an event or battle, and awarded for certain merits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

For example, for length of service, for services to the Fatherland, etc. The state is engaged in the production of medals, as well as other awards.  These <span>honorary signs are</span> made by the signet method.  The pattern, inscriptions or drawing are applied manually and engraved. </p><p>  Actively began to create medals after the advent of Soviet power.  Participants in the October Revolution received especially many awards.  And during and after World War II, they were handed over to military and ordinary workers who made a significant contribution to the victory over the enemy.  Medals were usually given to ordinary soldiers.  Although often they were awarded orders. </p><p>  The most honorable and valuable is the Order of Victory, made of 170 diamonds.  In the history of the USSR and modern Russia, only 17 people became its owners.  Only the President of Russia establishes and presents the highest awards.  On his behalf, another high-ranking official can do this. </p>
