At the end of the 20th century, this substance was obtained synthetically.  Benzoic acid is part of various herbs, berries and fruits.  In large quantities, this substance is found in the urine of herbivores in the form of bio-compounds with glycocol (hippuric acid). </p><p>  Benzoic acid is also synthesized in the human body partially from proteins and excreted in the urine in the form of hippuric acid.  Benzenecarboxylic acid exhibits antiseptic, fungicidal and local irritating effects.  When it enters the bloodstream, it exhibits an antipyretic effect.  Vapors of this acid irritate the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, so it can partially be secreted by the bronchial mucosa.  Sodium salts of benzenecarboxylic acid can be used as an expectorant.  Outwardly - as an antiparasitic agent. </p><p>  Due to the neutralization of benzenecarboxylic acid with a sodium bicarbonate solution (soda), sodium benzoate is obtained.  Subsequently, the mixture was evaporated to form crystals.  The resulting solutions have a slightly alkaline reaction. </p><p>  Sodium benzonate: properties. </p><p>  Needle crystals or powder, soluble in two parts of water, in 45 parts of cold and 13 parts of boiling ethanol, in nine parts of glycerol. </p><p>  Identification. </p><p>  Sodium ions are identified by the yellow color of the flame when burning the drug.  Benzoate ions are detected by reaction with a solution <span>of iron chloride.</span>  Benzoic acid is isolated from the preparation and its melting point is checked. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sodium benzoate: purity tests. </p><p>  The specified drug is tested for alkalinity and acidity.  According to the standards, the presence of impurities of heavy metals, sulfates, chlorides is allowed. </p><p>  Sodium benzoate: quantification. </p><p>  A sample of the drug must be dissolved in water, then add ether and a few drops of a mixture of indicators (methyl orange and methylene blue) and shake.  The concentration of sodium benzoate in the drug should be at least 99%. </p><p>  Caffeine Sodium Benzonate: Application. </p><p>  The specified tool is prescribed as a CNS stimulant.  Caffeine regulates the processes of excitation in the cerebral cortex, activates positive reflexes, and enhances <span>motor activity.</span>  Such pharmacodynamics increases mental and physical activity and reduces drowsiness and fatigue.  Maximum doses of caffeine can lead to depletion of neurocytes.  The drug weakens the effect of narcotic and <span>sleeping pills,</span> activates reflex spinal excitability, stimulates the vasomotor and respiratory centers.  The use of the drug enhances diuresis and cardiac activity. </p><p>  The mechanism of action of caffeine-sodium benzoate. </p><p>  Caffeine inhibits the activity of phosphodiesterase.  This in turn leads to the deposition of c-AMP (cyclic adenosine monofasfate) inside the cell.  c-AMP activates glycogenolysis, enhances metabolic reactions in tissues and organs, including muscles and the central nervous system.  A key link in the mechanism of the stimulating effect of the drug is the binding (interaction) of caffeine with purine receptors in the brain.  The drug is rapidly absorbed in the digestive canal.  In the process of biochemical reactions, the drug is oxidized and demethylated.  Excreted by the kidneys. </p><p>  Food preservatives are used to extend the shelf life of foods.  Since E211 <span>(sodium benzoate)</span> is bactericidal against bacteria, fungi and yeast, therefore it is used as a preservative.  He is in non-carbonated and carbonated drinks, fruit juices, olives, syrups.  In natural products, it is found in cinnamon, apples, cranberries, raisins, cloves. </p>
