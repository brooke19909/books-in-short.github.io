The hotel is in a very quiet area, so it can be recommended for a relaxing holiday. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the Territory </h2><p>  Pleases tourists with a hotel Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * a very beautiful and flowering area.

    <p>  Tourists who have visited the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel earlier do not recommend paying too much for supposedly superior rooms.  The conditions are almost the same everywhere, the only difference is the availability of free space.  And since they do not come here to stay in rooms, a standard room will be enough for an overnight stay. </p><h2>  Guest Room Reviews </h2><p>  Many vacationers who choose the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel for a vacation do not really like the atmosphere in the rooms and are not happy with the <span>quality of service.</span>  Most of the complaints are caused by the condition of the bathrooms.  Also, very often you have to face a lack of hot water.  Far from uncommon - the lack of toiletries.  The situation does not improve even after contacting the reception: the hotel administration is not in a hurry to solve the problems of its guests. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, although its quality is far from up to standard.  According to tourists, the hands of a cleaner quite often do not reach the kitchen or balcony.  As for insects, they are trying to fight them.  The rooms are constantly processed with mosquito and ant products. </p><p>  Linen is changed daily.  With a sufficient tip, the cleaners construct various figures from towels. </p><p>  A lot of disagreement in the opinions of tourists vacationing at the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh) is caused by the rooms.  Some guests find them quite suitable for living and recommend not to expect too much from a relatively cheap tour.  Others are absolutely not happy with the somewhat outdated and pretty shabby furniture. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  A beach holiday is very important for tourists who have come on vacation in Egypt.  Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * provides its guests with the opportunity to visit two beaches.  The first is urban, it always has a lot of people.  It is not particularly well-groomed, and therefore vacationers prefer the coral beach Palma Beach.  It is equipped with a pontoon, which allows access to deep places.  Here you can also admire the beauty of coral groves and the inhabitants of the Red Sea.  The hotel provides free sun loungers and umbrellas.  <span>Beach towels</span> are also <span>provided.</span> </p>

    <p>  You can get to the sea by bus.  There is no charge for hotel guests.  Buses travel on a strict schedule, so tourists know exactly what time they need to be ready for a trip to the beach.  If desired, you can get to the sea by taxi.  Walking to the beach during the summer months is not recommended due to the heat. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Tourists, booking a tour, can choose for themselves a suitable diet in the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel: </p><ul><li>  "all inclusive"; </li><li>  half board; </li><li>  breakfast. </li></ul><p>  Since it is not very convenient for hotel guests to come to the hotel for lunch, spending time on the road, many prefer to choose half board, which includes breakfast and dinner.  Lunch is available at the beach bars.  Food, even with the all-inclusive system, is served by beach bars only at an additional cost. </p><p>  The main restaurant of the hotel is located in the main building of the hotel complex.  It is designed for 180 people.  The room has air conditioning, so vacationers can eat in fairly comfortable conditions. </p>

    <p>  Many reviews relate to local cuisine.  The menu here is not very diverse, but still everyone will find suitable dishes for themselves.  Fruits are served very little.  Many tourists indicate their complete absence, which happens quite often.  Drinks also do not delight guests.  Moreover, they are often served in plastic dishes, which is unacceptable for a four-star hotel.  As many tourists note, drinks in plastic cups are given out for Russian-speaking tourists, although tourists from European countries are brought in only in glassware.  Such discrimination by the hotel staff does not inspire vacationers to re-visit this place. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  According to many tourists, the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel is suitable for people who want to enjoy their holidays in a relaxed atmosphere.  Various entertainment events are rarely held here, which makes young people bored.  Animation at the hotel is practically absent.  Sometimes you can see how darts or other games are organized, but the <span>work of the animators is</span> limited to this. </p>

Warm words are addressed to a territory that is truly striking in its beauty.  The advantage of staying at the hotel is the low cost of the tour.  But, according to the guests, these positive aspects are limited. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the beach is far from the hotel, vacationers are quite happy with the rest by the sea.  But the quality of service is poor.  Drinks, even for tourists living on the all-inclusive system, are given out only in plastic dishes and one glass in hand.  In addition, the attendants allow themselves a disrespectful attitude towards vacationers. </p><p>  A lot of negative is expressed in the reviews regarding the work of the administrators of the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh).  They are in no hurry to listen to the requests of the guests.  Moreover, when Russian tourists approach managers with complaints, hotel employees pretend that they do not understand what is at stake.  True, to be persistent, the problems will be resolved. </p><p>  Tourists who have chosen the Mexicana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel for vacation should not expect too much.  But if you set yourself up for positive and how to prioritize a beach holiday and stay in one of the most beautiful countries, even with all the shortcomings, a stay at the hotel will leave good memories. </p>
