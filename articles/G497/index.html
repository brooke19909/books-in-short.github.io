It would seem: there is enough space here, but there are more and more inhabitants every year.  A huge number of Muscovites and visitors from other cities of the country rent apartments, which is completely unreasonable, given the fabulous cost of rent.  That is why, sooner or later, having accumulated a certain amount for the down payment, we begin to look at all the possible options.  And it is unlikely that you will pass by the residential complex ‚ÄúHometown. Vorontsov Park‚Äù - a project created for the most comfortable and convenient life of modern residents of the metropolis. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  An excellent project was presented by the RG-Development company, specializing in the construction of residential complexes that meet all modern requirements.  LCD "Hometown. Vorontsov Park" (Profsoyuznaya St., 66) is located in one of the best and most well-equipped areas of Moscow: between the <span>metro</span> stations <span>Kaluzhskaya</span> and Novye Churemushki.  The developer focused on the highest level of comfort and, using the example of his project, decided to prove that even in a busy area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital you can feel easy, comfortable, enjoy peace and quiet after a tiring working day, use all the facilities of the capital's infrastructure.  Many were skeptical of the "young" builder, who so zealously began to buy land and design new residential complexes, but now, after a certain period of time, even in times of crisis, construction at all objects continues in full swing, all stages are completed on time, which is credible . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The excellent location was chosen by the developer for the residential complex "Hometown. <span>Vorontsov Park".</span>  Feedback from equity holders and potential buyers emphasize that this is one of the best projects implemented within the city.  It is located between the metro stations "Kaluzhskaya" and "Novye Churemushki", therefore, even without personal transport, you can get from home to anywhere in the capital. </p><p>  The area is characterized by a developed network of ground transportation: several trolleybus routes and minibuses pass nearby.  Many interest holders appreciated a separate exit to Profsoyuznaya Street, and it was from the exit that the construction of the complex began. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  LCD "Hometown. Vorontsov Park" is located in one of the best areas of the city - "Cheryomushki".  All conditions for a comfortable life are created here.  That is why the complex does not need its own infrastructure.  Shopping and entertainment centers located in walking distance, educational and medical institutions where qualified specialists work, allow you to get all the necessary services near your home. </p>

    <p>  Residents of this rather old district of Moscow certainly do not suffer from a shortage of stores; they can buy food and household goods in supermarkets of various price categories: Dixie, Crossroads, Alphabet of Taste and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The issue of the ecological situation in the area where the residential complex ‚ÄúHometown. Vorontsovsky Park‚Äù is located is no less important than transport accessibility and infrastructure.  At least it is sure to be asked by all those who come to the company's sales office.  Of course, the proximity to the busy roadway with a fairly dense and intense traffic is not only alarming, it is frightening.  But in this case, it is compensated by parks, squares, the abundance of vegetation characteristic of the microdistrict.  Not far from the complex is Troparevsky and Bitsevsky parks, which have already become a favorite place for family vacations and walks.  And Vorontsov Park is the main attraction of the area.  The opportunity to wander through the old park with its magnificent oaks, linden alleys, discover the secrets and mysteries of the old manor - all this delight Muscovites, they are ready to come here from the other end of the city. </p><h2>  Architectural solutions </h2><p>  The object is being built using monolithic technology, in the best traditions of modern construction.  Residential complex "Hometown. Vorontsov Park" has not yet been commissioned, but, as equity holders assure, the work does not stop either day or night, so the project must be completed on time. </p>

    <p>  The complex is represented by four buildings with underground parking for up to 350 cars - a great gift for Muscovites traveling in their own cars.  <span>The architectural concept of the</span> residential complex was developed by the design bureau Tsimailo, Lyashenko &amp; Partners, on whose account dozens of successfully completed projects and victories in major architectural competitions.  Laconic modern facades effectively frames and emphasizes panoramic glazing.  Four skyscrapers are united by a stylobate, forming a closed courtyard - residents of the complex will not have to leave its borders to enjoy peace and tranquility. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The project provides for landscaping and landscaping of the courtyard: flower beds with exotic plants, walking paths, playgrounds and sports grounds for children and adults will appear here. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Of course, all those who consider the LCD "Hometown. Vorontsov Park", apartment layouts are no less exciting than other components.  So, the developer offers to choose 1-2-3-4-room apartments of free planning with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã42 to 114 square meters.  In fact, for this reason, many people choose the LCD "Hometown. Vorontsov Park."  Layouts of apartments of houses of standard Soviet buildings have not attracted anyone for a long time.  If you recall in which apartments the majority of Muscovites spent their childhood, there is clearly nothing to brag about.  That is why those who come to the office, first of all, ask consultants about which kitchen they will get, where they will be able to store things. </p>

    <p>  Reviews about the complex are enthusiastic.  Free plans really become more and more popular, and all because they allow each tenant to take an active and direct part in the zoning of their apartment and the formation of space depending on their preferences and wishes.  Buyers were attracted by the opportunity to equip a spacious kitchen-dining room, where they can get together with friends and relatives.  Interest holders note that a truly interesting and modern project was proposed by the RG-Development company - RC "Hometown. Vorontsov Park" (66 Profsoyuznaya St.).  Layouts with shifted partitions, the ability to independently equip your apartment - this is what buyers attribute to the main and undeniable advantages. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many drew attention to this project, because the complex is being built in the lived-in and developed area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow.  All those who at least once visited the facility fell in love with him and his entourage.  It is really comfortable to live here with young children - there are several kindergartens and schools with in-depth study of certain disciplines nearby.  And if you want to visit the capital's sights, you will be able to do this with the help of underground and ground public transport. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the project caused a lot of questions, disputes and doubts.  Not everyone trusts an unfamiliar developer.  But time passes, and houses are really being built.  Interest holders, who managed to buy an apartment at the stage of laying the foundation, really saved a significant part and now have the full right to monitor the progress of construction, observe all stages of the construction of houses and furnish apartments.  They note that the developer does not save on materials, qualified specialists are involved in the work. </p>
