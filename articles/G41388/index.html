    <h2>  Reviews for Villa Salus 4 </h2><p>  Many of those who stayed at this hotel left their reviews about staying in it, which help a lot when choosing not only a resort, but also a specific hotel. </p><p>  Villa Salus (Montenegro) is rated quite well.  The Russians consider the location of the hotel to be very successful - close to the center, shopping facilities and transport stops.  At the same time, despite the fact that Budva is a very noisy resort, silence and tranquility always reign in the hotel.  It seems that when entering the gate on the territory of Villa Salus, a person enters a different world. </p><p>  Owners and staff unnecessarily never tire of their constant presence.  Nevertheless, they can always be contacted and asked for something.  The hotel rooms are very comfortable, there have never been problems, especially with water, because Villa Salus has its own well, so the pressure is so strong that you can take a hydromassage with a shower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Salus Cat A" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/615387.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  A separate emphasis in many reviews is made on the snow-whiteness of bed linen, which is not often characteristic of hotels. </p><p>  There are several conflicting opinions regarding food: some believe that the type of food offered at Villa Salus is not very convenient, others, especially those who have small children, are very pleased with the kitchen area. </p><p>  In any case, the sea, the sun and the wonderful beach erase all the shortcomings of the hotel, which, if there is one, are not striking. </p>
