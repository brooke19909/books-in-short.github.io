    <h2>  How to get to this hotel and what is nearby </h2><p>  First you need to fly to Turkey, best of all - to the Antalya airport.  There are two options here - to use the hotel transfer (this service is available on most tours) or to get on your own by bus if you are not traveling with a group.  The stop is right outside the hotel.  By the way, on the same bus or on a shuttle bus-dolmush you can get to Alanya.  Prior to this amazing beauty and sights of the city, only a quarter hour drive, and buses run literally every five minutes.  This once again underlines the good location of the Insula Resort.  Original Turkey - if you want to get to know it - is located directly opposite the hotel.  Welcome to Konaklƒ± village: there you can buy everything your heart desires, from decent textiles to fur coats.  In addition, there is a lunapark for children, beautiful squares with fountains, night clubs, cafes.  The village center is only ten minutes walk.  To return to the hotel without getting lost, you should focus on the clock tower.  It is located just opposite the entrance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
