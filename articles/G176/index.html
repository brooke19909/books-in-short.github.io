    <h2>  Required Attributes </h2><p>  It is unlikely that it will be possible to dispense with the design of the hall for the New Year holiday without a Christmas tree.  Even if it is not possible to establish a natural forest beauty, needles must be present without fail.  It can be wall compositions, wreaths on doors or table decorations using spruce or pine branches. </p><p>  Light illumination, garlands under the ceiling, lanterns and balloons - these elements do not have to be used all together, but somehow they should be in the hall.  You can make a beautiful and original New Year's decoration of the hall with your own hands if you approach the process creatively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any room has its pros and cons.  If you identify them in advance and close the shortcomings with an elegant decoration, and arrange a main festive composition in a profitable, convenient and well-lit place, then even from an ordinary room you can make a hall for receiving guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year's decoration in the kindergarten" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/732115.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  New trends </h2><p>  Increasingly, in modern shopping centers, visitors on New Year's Eve do not see a standard spruce decorated in a traditional style.  It is replaced by various interpretations using winter-themed decorations.  Such New Year's decoration of the hall, as a rule, is carried out by graphic designers and is developed according to the canons of a spatial and thematic installation. </p><p>  Compositions can be created by masters from existing indoor facilities with the addition of various household items and natural plants.  The overall impression of the scenery is positive and definitely festive, because they guess New Year's motives.  This effect is achieved by the inclusion of elements of textual and visual information. </p><p>  However, many remain true to tradition.  Natural spruce, as <span>an attribute of the New Year,</span> is still present, although sometimes it can be seen not in the room itself, but on the grounds in front of the building.  In the interior, the Christmas tree can be replaced by a cone-shaped design of balloons or soft toys selected in size and type.  It will be quite appropriate to use a frame ‚ÄúNew Year tree‚Äù made of cardboard or fabric. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year's decoration of the photo hall" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/732120.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Hall design features </h2><p>  Recently it has become a tradition to associate each new year with a certain animal: a lion, a tiger, a rabbit ... These features are already firmly rooted in everyday life and are perceived even by children.  The use of animal figures in the design of the halls, symbolizing the departure of the old year and the arrival of the new, will be quite appropriate.  From the photograph from the holiday, even without notes on the reverse side, it will be possible to understand in which year this happened. </p><p>  New Year's decoration of the hall using fresh flowers in compositions with coniferous branches will add freshness, naturalness and naturalness to the interior.  A Christmas tree made of balloons looks no less impressive than a tree cut down in the forest.  Such an alternative symbol of the New Year holidays can be considered as a desire to preserve wildlife. </p><p>  Thoughtful lighting of the hall is an important point in design work.  For a luxurious room with bright decorations, a lack of light will not make it possible to appreciate all the advantages of the room.  In another case, when the room is modest in size and overly lit, it becomes even smaller visually.  In this case, it is better to use separate point sources of light, aimed at specific scenery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  New Year's decoration in the kindergarten </h2><p>  Not every child can appreciate the introduction of new trends in the design of holiday halls.  If in his imagination the New Year is associated with an elegant Christmas tree, Santa Claus, Snow Maiden and Snowman, he will not be satisfied with the spatial composition of the winter theme, even if it is performed at a high level with lighting, animation and visualization effects. </p><p>  Sooner or later, the child will ask about when Santa Claus will open the bag and begin to give out gifts.  Therefore, do not go far from the traditional <span>scenario of the New Year's matinee.</span>  A round dance around the Christmas tree, a fancy-dress scene of a call of Santa Claus - all this requires suitable scenery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year's decoration of the trading floor" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/732095.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  New Year's decoration of the hall in the kindergarten can be varied with modern garlands, soaring balloons, safe fireworks and other elements of the holiday.  However, handmade decorations, especially those made by the children themselves, must also be present.  Home-made snowflakes, garlands and lanterns made of colored paper are no less important than a brightly bought decoration. </p><h2>  New Year's decoration of the banquet hall </h2><p>  Winter is the time for corporate parties.  Large companies, as a rule, entrust the organization of celebrations with firms specializing in this.  If a cafe, bar or restaurant is chosen as the venue for the celebration, then the receiving party will be engaged in the design of the hall, including the room where the banquet will be arranged.  The customer can order clearance in any price range. </p><p>  Luxurious New Year's decoration of the hall (photo below) is not necessary for a party in the circle of a small team.  But even if the banquet will be held in the dining room of the enterprise or in another hall suitable for this, it can and should be prepared for the event.  The purpose of decoration is to distract from everyday worries and create a <span>festive mood</span> even in a room not intended for celebrations. </p><p>  Drapery of chairs, banquet tables, tablecloths, dishes, serving - all this is important for the celebration and should not be left to chance.  These moments characterize the attitude towards the team.  It is clear that the quality of the design of the hall will depend on the budget allocated for the organization of the event. </p><p>  Most of the funds will be spent on preparing the festive table and on gifts.  But even a modest New Year‚Äôs banquet, organized on its own, should have New Year‚Äôs attributes: a tree or its design, light illumination, balloons, garlands and a surprise at the crucial moment.  Such decorations will help to relax and have a good time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year's decoration of the banquet hall" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/732096.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping room </h2><p>  The showcase is the face of the store.  If the owners of the outlet brightly and elegantly decorate it, then they are obliged to take care of the decorations of the sales area.  Customers who are keen on elegant New Year's advertising have the right to hope for the continuation of the holiday in the store itself. </p><p>  Surprising adult shoppers is quite difficult, but you can make a celebration for their children.  In any case, the New Year decoration of the trading floor should correspond to the concept of the establishment.  If this is a grocery point, it should not have many New Year's toys.  Shopkeepers who offer customers clothing and accessories can dress New Year characters from the scenery in samples of their products. </p><p>  However, do not be zealous, everything should be in moderation.  A reasonable balance of decor should be present everywhere.  A brightly decorated room can distract the attention of buyers, which will cause a loss of interest in products and, as a result, reduce sales revenue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Christmas decoration" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/732113.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Safety and design work </h2><p>  In addition to the beauty and harmony of the <span>Christmas decorations,</span> all the <span>decorations that</span> make up the holiday should be safe.  This primarily refers to activities organized for children.  Corporate parties and adult parties should also be thought out as far as possible in terms of safety. </p><p>  New Year's decoration of the hall is a crucial and very important moment.  At the peak of their fun, adults often behave unpredictably.  Therefore, all structures must be fixed, open fire, fireworks and other special effects are best carried out under the supervision of professionals or reliable and responsible team members, previously fixed for such events. </p><p>  The places for storing fire extinguishing equipment, emergency switchboards, and also exits for evacuation in case of emergency should be checked.  Such places should not be covered by decorations, even if it is necessary according to the script.  Only in this case can we hope that the holiday will succeed. </p>
