On the contrary, there is a chance to go to those countries where all the fun begins in the fall.  For example, in Tunisia.  Very good news is that tourist packages to this country in October are cheaper than in other periods. </p><h2>  Tunisia weather conditions in October </h2>

    <p>  The weather in Tunisia in October is quite favorable in order to receive many tourists here. </p><p>  The climate in these places is subtropical, however, there are times when nature allows people to relax from the scorching sun and enjoy the coolness emanating from sea waves.  This time is considered the height of the velvet season in Tunisia.  This climate, due to its mildness, is suitable for those vacationers who suffer from cardiovascular and pulmonary ailments, and simply for those who can not stand the sharp jumps in air temperature.  In addition to all of the above, this month it is better to prefer a trip to Tunisia to married couples with children, since the risk of complications during climate adaptation at this time is minimal.  <span>The weather in Tunisia in October is</span> not constant, which cannot be said about the summer months, when there is a monotonous increase in temperature and an increase in humidity.  A very high probability of a large amount of precipitation at this time.  It is almost impossible to predict in advance the moment when the solar disk will again appear in all its glory and will delight you with warmth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the autumn holiday </h2><p>  According to statistics, around mid-October, clouds disperse, and sunlight more and more often breaks through to go outside.  However, as soon as the third decade of the month comes, the situation with weather forecasts changes radically, and the clouds become denser.  That is why those tourists who are not too attached to the time, it is better to set a departure date for the second half of October.  According to the workers of the hydrometeocenter, this year it is expected only 9 rainy days from the whole season.  The island of Djerba and the North of Tunisia are considered the wettest areas, and then things are much calmer with humidity.  As for temperature values, everything is arranged a little differently.  Djerb and Mahdia in the first 10 days of the month boast a temperature of about + 28-30 degrees, and in the last - from 25 to 28 degrees.  In the evening, the temperature drops to 24 degrees.  Approaching the North, you can notice that the temperature indicators from time to time become lower and lower.  If we are talking about Sousse, Monastir and Sofax, then there the column of the thermometer grows in the direction of the interval of 24 and 26 degrees.  In the evening, the column rises from 18 to 20 degrees.  As for the capital, here the temperature is 2-3 degrees lower, and in the evening you generally have to wear warm clothes, as it gets colder up to 15-16 degrees.  By the way, at other resorts of the South of the foreign countries during this period, vacationers also need to warm up a little, since October in these areas is a time of winds, which also do not please.  In the afternoon, the weather can also suddenly deteriorate, but not enough to start worrying about it.  What corner of Tunisia will go to?  There are many beautiful resorts here, one of which is Hammamet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Resort Description </h2>
