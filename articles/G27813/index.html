  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manor "Covenant" - a small Versailles in the Novgorod region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, they wanted to include this estate in the art fund of Petrodvorets.  And now a unique work of architectural art, once reminiscent of a miniature of Peterhof and even Versailles, is in a deplorable state.  And only once a year life returns to an abandoned pearl thanks to the efforts of local enthusiasts. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A wonderful place located on the 37th kilometer of the Okulovka-Kresttsy highway (Novgorod region), near the village of Maly Borok, has been known since the reign of Empress Enlightener Catherine II.  In the middle of the XIX century, the estate was managed by an immigrant from Estonia.  At the beginning of the 20th century, one aristocrat bought the estate, which resold it in 1914 to the talented engineer M. A. Tokarsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru-travel.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The property is &quot;Treasured&quot;" class="if uuid-2949727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949727.jpg"></div><p>  The nobleman by blood, who remained in the country after the revolution, dreamed of transforming an estate with a very beautiful name to his taste beyond recognition.  A man who proved himself in several areas at once used the newfangled material at that time - reinforced concrete, which was rarely used in the construction of elegant structures. </p><h2>  Creator, thanks to whom the city was born </h2><p>  Researcher and traveler, architect and writer gained fame in connection with his activities.  It is believed that it was Mikhail Antonovich Tokarsky who created Kondopoga - a city in the south of Karelia.  At the end of the XIX century, he saw in the tiny village the future industrial capital of the republic and decided to use the forest and water resources of the region.  Here there were hydroelectric power stations and a paper mill, as well as a marina, later named after a brilliant engineer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unique architectural ensemble </h2><p>  M. A. Tokarsky, who did a lot for Karelia, was in demand everywhere, but it was in the Novgorod region that he left a significant mark.  The ensemble of the Zavetnoe estate was a cozy house with a water tower, outbuildings, a gazebo, a bathhouse, a laundry, a chapel in the form of a castle, a greenhouse, a dam, a whole system of fountains, a beautiful entrance arch with turrets and gates.  In addition, there was a summer theater, designed for 100 seats, where performances of famous artists from St. Petersburg took place, and a dam with a reservoir on Talts - a fast stream.  Tokarsky‚Äôs extraordinary talent was also manifested in the fact that he equipped the housing with steam heating, an electric generator, water supply, and electricity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Staircase leading to the estate" class="if uuid-2949733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949733.jpg"></div><p>  A concrete staircase led to the house with a spacious platform in the middle of the descent.  And now the construction, covered with thick moss, can be seen with your own eyes. </p><p>  It is curious that the narrow underground passage found was concreted.  No one knows where he leads, and researchers believe that these are just the remains of communications. </p><h2>  <span>Secular life</span> in the outback </h2><p>  The news of the unusual dwelling spread instantly, and immediately the Tokarsky estate, which stood out with its unique beauty, was dubbed the "little Versailles".  In the Novgorod outback, social life began to boil.  The main structure of the local attraction resembled a magnificent palace, and the built-in water tower also served as a belvedere.  Its floor and walls were lined with black tiles, on which it is no longer possible to make out half-erased letters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the green park of the estate, located 15 kilometers from Okulovka, Novgorod Region, once fountains flickered and there were pretty arbors where you could sit down and relax, enjoying the game of water jets shimmering in the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruined fountain" class="if uuid-2949740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949740.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, you can see one former hydraulic structure, which is a truncated pyramid with drainage ditches in the form of flower petals.  Once a complex structure was lined with expensive marble.  And from the second fountain only a round concrete bowl was preserved, which is hidden in the dense grass behind the stairs. </p><h2>  Unique chapel in the form of a castle </h2><p>  Of course, the main pearl of the coveted estate, the description of which is presented in the article, is a wonderful chapel, located near the estate, on a loose hill.  Tokarsky, who loves to travel, loved France very much, and he especially admired the bewitching beauty of medieval castles, in which the past was revived.  Having made many sketches, he already knew in advance what the structure would look like. </p><p>  To admire the amazingly preserved chapel, you will have to overcome a wooden bridge laid across the Talets stream, which flows in the direction from the lake.  Then you need to go along the overgrown nettle path before the mysterious silhouette of the structure appears.  Rising above the forest paths, it immediately evokes the thought that after all, a fairy tale sometimes turns out to be a reality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="berezovikselpos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Concrete chapel" class="if uuid-2949705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949705.jpg"></div><p>  This seems unbelievable, but the author used thin-walled reinforced concrete during the construction of an amazing structure, as well as during the creation of the remaining objects of the Zavetnoye estate.  Up to the smallest details in the interior, the chapel, which does not have a single seam, is completely cast from composite material.  It was made according to the drawings of Tokarsky himself, and cast by two craftsmen from the Vologda province - father and son Nogtev. </p><h2>  Description of the building </h2><p>  Two tall turrets adjoin the chapel with lancet windows, one of which is decorated with loopholes.  And above the entrance you can see the family coat of arms of the Tokarsky family, creating the complete impression that this is not just a chapel, but a miniature knight's castle.  The high structure, within the walls of which the spirit of the time is felt, seems almost a toy. </p><p>  The two floors were separated by a solid insert of bluish glass that perfectly transmits light, and a well-preserved spiral staircase went upstairs.  The floor of the chapel is tiled, and the walls, in which niches are cut down, are supported by elegant columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="benzinych.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chapel Interior" class="if uuid-2949763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949763.jpg"></div><p>  It is easy to climb up the narrow stairs, but it will not work to go out onto the open balcony of one of the towers: part of the metal structure has been dismantled.  You need to walk here very carefully, along the very edge, since the glass floor has not stood the test of time. </p><h2>  The death of an architect </h2><p>  After the revolution, the estate "Covenant" its author donated to the state.  During the years of Soviet power, Tokarsky, focused on invention, received many patents.  He died during the evacuation from the besieged Leningrad, but the exact date of his death is unknown.  Unfortunately, no one knows where the grave of the legendary architect who has done so much in life is located. </p><h2>  The fate of the Tokarsky estate </h2><p>  In the 20s of the last century, the estate, which was studied by members of the Glavnauka society, wanted to be added to the art fund of Petrodvorets.  However, this did not happen, and the main house of the estate in Okulovka, Novgorod Region, was in the ownership of the Novgorod dacha trust.  Then the building in which the soldiers lived during World War II was dismantled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usadbi-today.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance Arch" class="if uuid-2949721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949721.jpg"></div><p>  Today, a true architectural masterpiece, which is a rare example of manor construction made of reinforced concrete, is undeservedly forgotten.  However, the silence prevailing in an unusual place is still broken. </p><h2>  Fascinating tour </h2><p>  About ten years ago, employees of the library and information center of the Okulovsky district organized a fascinating tour for tourists under the name "Manor" Testament "in the mirror of the past."  The success of the costume event exceeded all expectations, and it is no coincidence that it now takes place annually, collecting an increasing number of connoisseurs of beauty.  Once upon a time, St. Petersburg artists performed in a Russian estate, and a huge number of guests gathered to watch vivid performances.  Contemporaries felt that the estate is unthinkable without a theater, and now in the summer, performances based on plays by domestic authors are staged on its stage.  Unprofessional, but enthusiastic actors perform, and each visitor will be able to enjoy their game. </p><p>  Tourists who attended the performance, which is accompanied by the sounds of the Russian romance, are immersed in the spiritual atmosphere of bygone days.  The hosts of the event, dressed up in luxurious costumes, talk about the traditions of homestead life in Russia and the history of the creation of the Tokarsky estate.  A large number of old photographs helps to recreate in imagination its true appearance. </p><h2>  How to get to the estate "Zavetnoe" in Okulovsky district? </h2><p>  Tourists who are interested in our past and who want to find themselves in a fairy tale lost in the Novgorod region are worried about how to get to the Tokarsky estate on their own.  A unique object to be proud of is very easy to find.  It is necessary to leave Veliky Novgorod in the direction of Moscow.  Upon reaching the village of Kresttsy, turn left onto Okulovka.  After 500-600 meters, you need to turn onto the path leading to the forest on the right side and follow the sign to the village of Maly Borok, half a kilometer from which there is an abandoned object. </p><p>  If you miss the turn, then on the way there will be country houses.  That means turning around. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Little Versailles, which must be protected from the destructive influence of time, is intriguing already on the way: travelers see a reinforced concrete arch with a tetrahedral tower.  Unfortunately, the openwork fence with tall pillars, decorated with bizarre ornaments and forged sashes did not survive.  As tourists admit, it immediately creates the feeling of a real fairy tale.  It seems that innermost fantasies have come to life, and someone already represents life in a medieval castle, where knightly tournaments were often held. </p><p>  The abandoned estate, which is now becoming a platform for cultural events, hosts guests every summer.  It hosts both theatrical events and poetry meetings, and among all excursions in the Novgorod region, this one is distinguished by its novelty. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that tourists are particularly interested in the annual performances organized by the Okulovsky district administration and the library and information center.  Guests who have already visited the estate know that they have taken care not only of spiritual food.  After the theatrical events, visitors are treated to homemade pies and fragrant samovar tea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ogbors.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ruins of the second fountain" class="if uuid-2949799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2949799.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the time that creates an unusual atmosphere around the estate gradually destroys it.  Concrete debris lies in the thickets of grass, tourists leave their autographs on the walls, and someone is even looking for a secret passage, destroying the walls and floor of the estate. </p><p>  I would like to believe that soon the estate, created in imitation of Versailles, will come to life, and everyone will be able to admire the architectural masterpiece that has not lost its beauty. </p>
