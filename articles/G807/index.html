  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main attractions of Kaliningrad: photo with names and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kaliningrad is the most European part of Russia.  This is not just a city, but an enclave with a population of almost 500 thousand people, and if together with the region, then all 715 thousand.  It borders the village with Lithuania and Poland, washed by the waters of the Baltic Sea. </p><h2>  How the city became Russian </h2><p>  Until 1946, the city was called Koenigsberg and belonged to the Prussian state.  Soviet troops captured the city on April 6, 1945.  By decision of the Potsdam Conference, the USSR was transferred to temporary possession.  Later Koenigsberg completely passed to Russia. </p><p>  At the time of the end of World War II, no more than 370 thousand Germans remained in the city, who were adapted to life as much as possible in the Soviet Union.  There were even schools where they taught exclusively in German, a newspaper was published. </p><p>  However, in 1947, they decided to deport the German population, only rare specialists remained, but they were also sent to their historical homeland from 1948 to 1949.  The city received its new name in 1946, after the death of Kalinin M.I. </p><p>  In the post-war period, industry was actively developing in Kaliningrad, but little attention was paid to the restoration of destroyed buildings.  Almost all dilapidated historical sights of Kaliningrad until the end of 1960 were completely demolished.  Although among historians and local historians there was a lot of indignation and protests.  For foreigners, the city was completely closed.  And only in 1991 Kaliningrad was again opened for both visiting and international cooperation. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Until the Teutonic Order came to these lands, there was only the Prussian fortress of Tuvangste, but when it was built or what it looked like is unknown.  After the arrival of the Order‚Äôs troops, the fortress was burned and a new one, called Koenigsberg, was buried around September 1255.  Over time, a settlement formed around the fortress, and it was granted the status of a city.  For several centuries, the city had many rulers from different countries, it passed from Germans to Poles.  In 2015, the former Koenigsberg celebrated its 760th anniversary. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the many battles, in the city of Kaliningrad there are a lot of attractions. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  This is a whole organ complex and a multifunctional cultural center.  Located in the heart of the historical part of the city on <span>Kant Island,</span> or Kneiphof.  The first mention of this main attraction of Kaliningrad is in the chronicles for the period from 1297 to 1302.  The official start date for construction is 1333.  And by 1380, all work was completed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikivoyage.org" data-author=": A.Savin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral" class="if uuid-2333634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333634.jpg"></div><p>  The building once had a rich decoration, but after the fighting during the Second World War, nothing remained.  Only a few stone epitaphs have survived. </p><p>  Between 1992 and 2005  the cathedral was completely restored, and now it houses the organ complex, the largest in all of Russia.  Here is the museum of Kant I., and around the sculpture park.  The cathedral is located on the street I. Kant, 1. </p><h2>  Koenigsberg Castle </h2><p>  This palace could become a real attraction of Kaliningrad, but time has decided otherwise.  The date of foundation of the object is considered to be 1255.  The castle was located on the banks of the Pregel River and was originally wooden, later reconstruction was carried out using stone.  The castle was attacked more than once and in the end it suffered the most during the Second World War.  At the end of the war, the Soviet government did not have the money to restore the building, and in 1953 the remains were blown up.  The final destruction of the historical monument was carried out in 1970.  Almost at the same place where the castle was, the House of Soviets was erected, and the remains of the brick of the ancient building were used. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="visualhistory.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koenigsberg Castle" class="if uuid-2333673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333673.jpg"></div><p>  They have been talking about the restoration of the monument for a long time, the first attempts were made in the 90s of the last century.  There were even competitions for the development of the territory.  Excavations began in 2016.  To date, all ties with foreign partners have been interrupted, the excavation remains unprotected, and the foundation is not preserved. </p><h2>  Fort No. 5 "King Frederick William III" </h2><p>  This landmark of the city of Kaliningrad was built back in 1892, but the baptism of fire took place only during the Second World War. </p><p>  It is a hexagonal concrete structure with a wide and deep moat surrounded by green spaces.  Soviet soldiers stormed this fortification for 6 days, and after the capture of 15 soldiers were awarded with decals. </p><p>  Now it is one of the most visited places in the city.  Near it is the Museum of Fortification and Military Equipment.  Located at the entrance to the city, on Bulatov street. </p><h2>  Fort No. 11 Denhoff </h2><p>  This landmark of Kaliningrad with a photo, name and description is found in almost all city guides.  The fort was erected in 4 years, from 1877 to 1881.  He was called to cover the railway tracks in the direction of Insterburg.  It was once called Fort Sellingenfeld.  It is a hexagonal building surrounded by a moat with water.  The central part is additionally protected by an earthen embankment.  During the Second World War, German troops practically did not show resistance, and after 13 hours the fort was taken by Soviet troops. </p><p>  The construction is located on the street Energetikov.  Every weekend there are guided tours (every hour).  Themed sites and competitions are often held on site.  There is the possibility of quests. </p><h2>  Brandenburg Gate </h2><p>  <span>Description of the</span> sights of Kaliningrad will be incomplete without mentioning this object.  This gate is the only of eight that are still used for their intended purpose today.  They are located on the border of the historical part, in the Haberberg district, at the end of Bagration street. </p><p>  They were built in 1657, they have 2 driveways.  The walls of the gate are richly inlaid with decorative elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brandenburg Gate" class="if uuid-2333644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333644.jpg"></div><h2>  The remaining seven </h2><p>  The Brandenburg Gate is not the only one in the city, because the entire former Koenigsberg is surrounded by similar buildings.  There are only eight of them, and previously there were 10. The photo of the sights of Kaliningrad shows that all the gates were erected in different architectural styles.  Available for inspection: </p><ul><li>  Rosgartensky. </li><li>  Friedland. </li><li>  Friedrichsburg. </li><li>  Ausfal. </li><li>  Rail. </li><li>  Zakheim. </li><li>  Royal. </li></ul><h2>  Queen Church of Queen Louise </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nesselbeck.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Queen Louise Memorial Church" class="if uuid-2334674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2334674.jpg"></div><p>  This is another attraction of Kaliningrad, the photo of which you can see above.  It was built in 3 years, from 1899 to 1901, in memory of the Queen of Prussia - Louise.  Once there was a <span>Lutheran church,</span> now the Regional Puppet Theater is working in the building.  During the war, the building was badly damaged, and they even wanted to demolish it, but still managed to save and restore it.  The modern appearance is almost completely consistent with what it was before the war. </p><p>  Located on Victory Avenue, 1. </p><h2>  Church of the Holy Family </h2><p>  Another attraction of Kaliningrad is the Holy Family Church, located on Karla Khmelnitsky Street, 61a.  Previously, it was a Catholic church, and now the Regional Philharmonic Concert Hall operates here. </p><p>  It‚Äôs possible to say that Kirche was ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, it was built only in 1907, in the 80s of the last century it underwent reconstruction, at the same time a concert hall was opened. </p><p>  This is a neo-Gothic building, the project of which provided for the observance of all the best traditions of architecture during the reign of the Prussian Teutons.  The result was a lush and festive red brick building, very reminiscent of a medieval castle. </p><h2>  Amber Museum </h2><p>  The list of Kaliningrad sights (with photos, names and descriptions) cannot be imagined without the Amber Museum.  It was founded in 1969 in the building "Tower of the Don" in Rosgarten Gate.  The decision to open was due to the fact that there is a village of Amber near the city, at that time it was the largest of all explored amber deposits.  According to estimates, it was about 90% of the total world stock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travhost.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amber Museum" class="if uuid-2333651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333651.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time the building was restored, and from 1979 to 1984.  the museum was in full bloom.  Then they forgot about him.  Only in 2003 the building was restored, in the following years it fell several times under various development programs.  Today in the museum you can learn a lot of interesting things about Baltic amber, see one of the largest stones in the world, which weighs 4 kilograms and 280 grams. </p><h2>  Youth Park </h2><p>  This park has one very unusual sight of Kaliningrad.  Probably every tourist who visited this city is familiar with the photo and description of the object called ‚ÄúHouse Upside Down‚Äù.  You can find a kind of attraction on Telman Street. </p><p>  In appearance it is an ordinary cottage, but only standing upside down, resting its roof on the ground.  Inside there is furniture, a bathroom and everything that happens in an ordinary residential building.  Not a single visitor remains indifferent, because it is hard enough to perceive a world turned upside down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lookmytrips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="main sights of Kaliningrad" class="if uuid-2334592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2334592.jpg"></div><h2>  Fish village </h2><p>  This is a whole quarter, fully stylized as ancient Prussia.  Located between the Jubilee and Honey bridges, on the right bank of the Pregol river.  This landmark of Kaliningrad is a shopping and ethnographic complex. </p><p>  Construction began in 2006, at the place where the fish market used to be.  It is best to inspect the complex from the Mayak view tower, where a metal gull is installed, the sides or beak of which must be rubbed ‚Äúfor good luck‚Äù.  The tower offers a magnificent view of the city.  133 steps lead to the very top of the tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tl-group.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fish village" class="if uuid-2333657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333657.jpg"></div><p>  Here, in the complex, there is a shopping center ‚ÄúRiver Station‚Äù, a shopping center ‚ÄúPregolsky Passage‚Äù, a hotel and another view tower called ‚ÄúLomze‚Äù. </p><h2>  K√∂nigsberg Stock Exchange </h2><p>  This architectural monument is located near the Platform bridge, on the right side of the river, on Leninsky Prospekt, 83. </p><p>  Today the building is occupied by the Youth Cultural Center. </p><p>  The surviving exchange was built in 1875.  Not only tenders were held here, but also concerts, holiday events.  In 1944, the building was badly damaged by bombing.  In the post-war years (about 20 years), the exchange stood in ruins, in which the finale of the film "Father of the Soldier" was even shot. </p><p>  In 1960, the building receives the status of an architectural monument, but reconstruction begins only after 7 years.  Upon completion of the work, the object becomes the House of Sailors. </p><p>  The building itself was built in the style of the Italian Neo-Renaissance, which is not typical for Kaliningrad.  The exchange hall was the second largest after the hall of the Konigsberg Palace. </p><h2>  The main square of the city </h2><p>  Today Victory Square is one of the most beautiful sights of Kaliningrad.  It was renamed several times, equipped at the place where the gates of the city fortification had previously been.  Already in 1920, this place became the center of the city. </p><p>  In 1953, a monument to Stalin was erected on the square, which was dismantled after 5 years.  Then they erected a monument to Lenin, which stood before the collapse of the USSR. </p><p>  The old buildings have been preserved on the square: </p><ul><li>  North Station with a railway tunnel (1930). </li><li>  Technical University (1931). </li><li>  City Hall building (1920). </li></ul><p>  To celebrate the 750th anniversary of the city, several fountains and even the Arc de Triomphe were built on the square.  Judging by the available reviews of the sights of Kaliningrad, the arch has a huge resemblance to the Alexander Column in St. Petersburg.  In 2006, the Cathedral of the Savior was built here, which is huge - 73 meters in height.  A little later, near the temple, they built a ‚Äúkissing church‚Äù and dedicated it to Peter and Fevronia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globespots.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square of victory" class="if uuid-2333628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333628.jpg"></div><p>  The area is surrounded by modern buildings and occupies a vast territory - 300 X 150 meters. </p><h2>  Amalienau District </h2><p>  Many travel agencies include in the program of excursions to the sights of Kaliningrad a visit to this area.  It is famous for its unique villas.  Even at the dawn of the 20th century, these houses had absolutely all the amenities, sewage, electricity, gas and water. </p><p>  Almost all houses have many interesting details and decorations; roofs usually have a bizarre shape and half-timbers.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe architect is the construction of a district for wealthy people.  But it was not possible to fully realize the project: the First World War began.  Later, development continued, but not with such splendor and pathos.  At the end of World War II, development was also carried out, but no one adhered to the concept of the architectural plan for the development of the district.  Nevertheless, the surviving buildings are worth a look, some of them have been preserved inlaid and decorated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varandej.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amalienau District" class="if uuid-2333660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2333660.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal orphanage </h2><p>  This building is one of the oldest in the city.  It is located near the <span>Zacheim Gate,</span> at the address: 62 Lithuanian Wall. </p><p>  The shelter was founded by Frederick I in 1701, after 2 years the building was completely ready for children.  During the Second World War, the object was practically not damaged, except for the tower, which gave the building its characteristic features.  The tower was completely destroyed, and it was not restored.  In 2007, the building was inscribed on the cultural heritage list of regional significance.  In 2016, a comprehensive plan for its restoration was approved. </p><h2>  Curonian Spit </h2><p>  <span>We have already described many sights of</span> Kaliningrad.  What to see in the area?  A place frequented by tourists is the Curonian Spit.  This sandy and narrow strip of land, when viewed from a bird's eye view, resembles in shape a saber that separates the bay of the Baltic Sea.  The spit begins in the city of Zelenogradsk, Kaliningrad region, and stretches to the city of Smiltin in Lithuania.  The total length of land is 98 kilometers.  The average width of the spit is 2.5 kilometers (400 to 3.8 km).  There is no analogue to such a natural creation in the world. </p><p>  In this place you can see the sand dunes and riding bogs characteristic of the tundra.  In the autumn, about 15 million birds fly to the spit.  72% of this territory is occupied by forest groves with more than 600 species of vegetation.  There are many animals and reptiles here (about 296 species). </p><p>  Today, several hiking trails are laid here and there are several attractions: </p><ul><li>  in the village of Rybachy an old church; </li><li>  Thomas Mann House Museum; </li><li>  lighthouse on the dune of Urbas; </li><li>  Kopgalis fortress; </li><li>  South pier; </li><li>  Witch mountain; </li><li>  dolphinarium and others. </li></ul><h2>  Winter has come </h2><p>  It would seem, well, what kind of sightseeing in Kaliningrad in the winter?  Cold, damp, dank - Baltic after all.  But such a position is fundamentally wrong.  With the advent of winter, the season of visiting museums begins, and there are plenty of them in the city. </p><p>  <em>Museum of the World Ocean</em> </p><p>  The doors of this establishment are open year-round.  Here is a unique collection of shells of marine mollusks, a lot of artwork on the marine theme, ship models.  You can also see firsthand the research ship Vityaz, which has been on the museum pier since 1994, and many other interesting exhibits.  Address: Peter the Great Embankment, 1. </p><p>  <em>Regional Museum of History and Art</em> </p><p>  This is a huge collection of unique items.  It is here that you can see many archaeological exhibits of the period of the Teutonic Order.  The museum is located on Klinicheskaya street, 21. </p><p>  <em>Bunker von Lyash</em> </p><p>  The entire exposition is built on the history of World War II and is located in the bunker.  It was here that the headquarters of the Germans were located, at the head of which was von Lyash.  The museum is located at: Universitetskaya street, 2. </p><p>  <em>Submarine Museum B-413</em> </p><p>  This submarine has been in combat service for 30 years, in 1990 it was assigned to the Baltic Fleet.  The boat visited the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, in the Atlantic Ocean.  A unique long-range hike was carried out on the submarine: the team sailed without replacing the crew for more than 1 year.  In 1999, it was decommissioned.  Since 2000, stands in Kaliningrad, near the Museum of the World Ocean. </p><p> The ship was converted into a museum.  The interior decoration is fully preserved, only everyone was cleaned of oil and fuel oil, all hatches were lifted up.  The torpedo hole was redone for the entrance for visitors.  In 2013, a total of 2.5 million visitors boarded the submarine.  To date, the object is listed in the cultural heritage of the peoples of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The city of Kaliningrad is an enclave with an interesting and difficult fate.  Russian and German culture and history are closely intertwined here.  The city has a good-natured and welcoming atmosphere, and many historical places and museums are available to tourists. </p>
