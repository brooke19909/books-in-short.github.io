  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The psychology of health.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Stress is the main source of problems in the life of any person.  <span>The psychology of health</span> claims that all illnesses arise from wrong, destructive thoughts.  Moreover, a person may not be aware of this and do not understand how much harm he does to his body every minute. </p><p>  Health psychology claims that all human diseases are caused by improper, unbalanced behavior.  Not only external, but also internal factors influence him and his health.  External are known to everyone, from solar radiation to bad ecology.  But the whole snag is that you yourself can take care of your health only by applying effort to this.  Examples of improper behavior include the inability to dress so as not to freeze and catch a cold, going outside in cool weather after a hot bath, drinking inadequate water, poor nutrition, and so on.  Such diseases, which may be the result of these actions, can be defeated by simple prevention: rubdowns, regular rest, physical education, <span>contrast shower.</span> </p><p>  Health Psychology studies how negative and negative emotions can affect a person‚Äôs <span>state of health</span> .  In addition, chemistry and health are inextricably linked.  After all, all diseases are now being treated with the help of various medications, which it is simply impossible to produce without knowledge from the field of chemistry.  But this is the so-called external influence.  It's time to move on to internal factors that affect health.  These include negative emotions.  It can be pride, anger, slander, resentment, jealousy, fear, sadness, lies, envy and others.  They invariably lead to <span>psychological problems,</span> which in turn develop into health problems. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Health psychology also aims to find ways to get rid of these negative emotions.  A person must learn to feel not only himself, but also other people, to respect them and himself, to understand what pushes them to certain actions.  So you can predict the situation and choose for yourself the most correct and acceptable behavior. </p><p>  Biology and human health are inextricably linked and depend on your worldview more than you would like.  Do not forget that any problematic situation does not just appear in your life.  This is always a lesson from which you must learn to profit.  And angry or sad, you will not achieve anything but possible health problems. </p><p>  Health psychology also talks about which emotions with which organs can cause problems.  Anger is always reflected in the state of the liver, fear in the kidneys, and anxiety in the spleen.  By insulting people, you can get a stomach trouble, and if you grieve, you can get lung problems.  Do not find fault with people too much, it provokes blood diseases.  And by imposing your worldview on others, you can get a tendency to stretch ligaments and joints.  Attachment to material wealth causes a hernia, and by criticizing others you may well earn bronchitis, tonsillitis, pneumonia, or a runny nose.  Contempt for people contributes to skin diseases, and anger leads to arthrosis and arthritis.  The list is very long. </p><p>  The problem is that people often do not understand - their disease is caused by nothing more than internal factors.  They buy expensive medications widely advertised on television.  Often, such treatment is completely ineffective, since the internal cause has not been eliminated.  Therefore, in order to prevent diseases that can be triggered by internal factors, health psychology offers everyone to try to evoke <span>positive emotions</span> and cultivate useful qualities: generosity, joy, fearlessness, sincerity, warmth, love, goodwill and others. </p>
