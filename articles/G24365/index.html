    <h2>  Galle (city), Sri Lanka </h2><p>  This is a fairly large port city.  Its population is more than one hundred thousand people.  In the past, the city was the main water gate of the country.  His story is interesting.  The name of the city is not local, but Portuguese.  The word galle translates to rooster.  It all began in 1505, when the Portuguese merchant ship wrecked.  In the morning after the tragedy, the team realized that it was on uncharted land.  The singing of a rooster spoke of the habitability of this place.  Hence the name of the city.  Its main attraction is the fort, which was built for almost a century and a half. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels galle sri lanka" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1491687.jpg" width="600"></div>

This happened in 1588.  But when the Dutch came here in the 17th century, it was rebuilt, so Fort Galle is considered a Dutch fortress.  1663 is considered the date of its foundation.  For 200 years, the fortress was the main port of the country, a place where ships moored from Europe to Asia moored. </p><h2>  Fort today </h2><p>  The modern fort of Galle (Sri Lanka) is an urban area called the Old Town.  It is also the main tourist area.  Behind the high walls of the fort are shops and hotels, restaurants and cafes, banks and offices, there is even a private market.  Here, a calm and measured life flows as usual.  There is no fuss in this place, which is characteristic of neighboring areas located at a distance of several hundred meters from the fortress. </p><p>  Fort Galle (Sri Lanka) is characterized by a quiet, almost romantic setting, which offers walking along the ancient narrow streets.  This is a whole complex of attractions and memorable places, since in addition to the walls and ancient buildings on the territory of the fort there are museums, a lighthouse, antique shops, jewelry shops, a <span>bell tower, a</span> mosque and a church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galle city sri lanka" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1491685.jpg" width="600"></div>

Everyone, as part of an excursion group or on their own, can stroll through the ruins of this citadel. </p><p>  The Rocky Cape Bastion signaled to naval vessels that the enemy was approaching.  From the fortress Pigeon Island, located nearby, soldiers fired on the ships of the enemy.  At the bastion of Triton was a <span>windmill.</span>  She supplied sea water, provided the household needs of the town.  The bastions of the Moon, Stars and the Sun are successively one after another on the narrow isthmus of the peninsula.  And the bastions of Tsong, Shter and Maan defended the fort from the side.  Only the Zvat bastion has survived to our time. </p><p>  Fort Galle (Sri Lanka) is always open, as it is part of the city.  You can enter the territory through two entrances (old and main gates).  There is no admission fee, and you will have to pay for some sightseeing.  If you have enough time, we recommend that you not only walk along the streets and the center of the fort.  Go around it around the walls, on which several stairs lead. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  We invite you to get acquainted with the interesting places of Fort Galle (Sri Lanka).  And you should begin your acquaintance with the ancient walls, on which anyone can walk: the paths are wide, completely safe.  Walking at sunset is especially popular when the sun goes down over the ocean, painting it and the surrounding area in a variety of colors.  Bright and picturesque views will make a huge impression even on a person who is completely devoid of romance.  To contemplate these beauties, small but very comfortable benches are equipped on some sections of the walls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  New Oriental Hotel </h2><p>  This is not only the oldest hotel in the country, but also the oldest in Asia.  The magnificent building, made in the colonial style, was erected in 1864 as the residence of the governor.  Today, the house of a senior official has become a hotel, which has not practically changed either outside or inside.  The cost of living in it is overpriced.  But this does not stop rich tourists who are willing to pay for accommodation in an ancient mansion located on the territory of the famous monument. </p><h2>  Lighthouse </h2><p>  In the east of Fort Galle (Sri Lanka) is the Utrecht bastion.  In 1848, a lighthouse twenty-four and a half meters high was built on its top.  In those days, he played an important strategic role - he showed the ships the way in a difficult navigational bay. </p><p>  After the fire of 1934, the lighthouse was destroyed.  Five years later, a new one was built in its place.  It is a white rounded tower with a height of more than 26 m and a diameter of 47 m. Its flash at night illuminates the sky every ten seconds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort galle sri lanka" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1491684.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Clock tower </h2><p>  In the part of the bastion, which was built in 1663, this tower was erected forty meters high.  Once she also played the role of a lighthouse for ships calling at the port.  Over time, this need disappeared, and a clock with a Roman dial was installed on the top of the tower.  Unfortunately, they cannot brag of accuracy of the course.  Tourists are not allowed inside the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels galle sri lanka" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1489429.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  National Museum </h2><p>  The museum is located in the oldest building of the fort, which was built in 1656, although exhibition halls were not open to visitors until 1986.  They introduce archaeological finds discovered in southern Sri Lanka.  These are dishes and ritual masks, jewelry and household items.  There are also exhibits from the Dutch era: clay vessels and weapons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galle city sri lanka" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1489423.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Maritime Museum </h2><p>  This museum is the only one in the country dedicated to the ichthyofauna of this region.  Here you can also get acquainted with the difficult life of fishermen.  The museum worked quite successfully until 2004.  This year, a devastating tsunami swept through these places. </p><p>  The cost of restoring the complex was borne by the Dutch government.  In the museum, visitors can see several halls in which they are invited to get acquainted with the life and life of fishing villages.  Of particular note is the exposition of turtles and corals, invertebrates and fish.  The highlight of the exhibition recognized the skeleton of a whale.  Expansion of expositions is planned in the near future. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fort galle sri lanka" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1489428.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical Museum </h2><p>  It is the largest private museum in the country.  It stores things that once belonged to the wealthy jeweler Abdul Ghaffar.  For forty years he collected paintings and original pieces of furniture, unique antiques.  Today, all this is part of the exhibition, which is now available to the general public. </p><h2>  Great temple </h2><p>  Initially, at this place in Fort Galle (Sri Lanka) was an old church, which was erected in 1640.  In 1752 it was reconstructed, and it turned into a two-level Great Temple.  On the first level, Dutch tombstones have laid the floor.  On the second floor there is an existing body, which was installed back in 1760.  Multi-colored stained-glass windows deserve no less attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galle sri lanka" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1495736.jpg" width="600"></div>
