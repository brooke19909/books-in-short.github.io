The chamber atmosphere, stylish interior and surrounding beauty are what you need for a good rest and bright events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old tower scratched phone" class="if uuid-2679634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/2679634.jpg"></div><h2>  From the history of the city and the hotel </h2><p>  Sarapul is a settlement with a rather interesting history.  It was here that in 1870 the first wooden water supply system began to operate, which local merchants built at their own expense.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the city head Bashinin made every effort to build a power station in the city. </p><p>  In 1909, on the orders of Bashinin, the construction of a water pumping station began, the project of which was completed by the famous Russian architect Trubnikov.  It was built in the Art Nouveau style.  But for its intended purpose, the water pump station operated until 1980.  Later it housed a school of sailors.  After 1996, the operation of the building was discontinued, and it gradually came to an emergency state. </p><p>  Thanks to the efforts of the local water utility, the building of the water pump tower was preserved, and its appearance was completely restored.  The new life of the tower began when it was transformed into a prestigious restaurant and hotel complex.  Now it is an important <span>attraction of Sarapul</span> and Udmurtia as a whole. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel "Old Tower" in Sarapul is located on 1.
