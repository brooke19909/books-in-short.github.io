    <p>  Goynuk gained popularity thanks to stunning landscapes.  The village is considered to be one of the most picturesque places on the coast.  The difference between Kemer and the village of Goynuk is not so great.  Not all tour operators subdivide these two resort places.  For vacationers, the only important thing is that they have a different coastline.  In Goynuk, the shores are more rocky, there are gorges and cliffs formed by the mountains approaching the sea.  Holidays in the town are comfortable for families with children and lovers of mountain tourism. </p><p>  Once these lands were occupied by robbers.  Later, in the XI century.  Turkmen robbers seized the land.  They gave the village its current name.  The coast of the village of Goynuk covers mountains from all sides, and its streets are completely planted with orange trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reviews about Club Boran Mare (Kemer) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the complex, it is worth looking at the reviews of tourists.

Every day, staff clean and water the trees and flower beds. </p><p>  The vast number of rooms of the hotel, although not new, is in good condition.  The apartments are not large in size, but at the same time they are very functional.  But family rooms are suitable for a whole company.  Daily maid service by the maids is very high-quality, holidaymakers have no complaints about this issue. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food is another advantage of the hotel.

    <p>  A large selection of food and its quality gives reason to say that the food system is at its best.  Tourists celebrate a large selection of traditional Turkish sweets, fruits and desserts.  The concept of nutrition includes drinks.  They can be taken not only in the restaurant, but also in bars.  In general, food deserves the highest ratings and praise. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  One of the main features of the hotel is its stunning beach.  Since the complex is located in an incredibly beautiful place, nature itself sets up for complete relaxation.  The hotel complex has its own beach with a length of about one hundred meters.  It is equipped with a fresh water shower, sunbeds, awnings, changing rooms and taps for washing feet.  The beach is covered with bulk sand, small pebbles are found only at the water's edge, but it is not sharp at all, therefore it does not cause discomfort when swimming.  For the most gentle tourists who do not like the pebble coast, there is a pier and a pontoon, from which it is very convenient to go down to the sea.  Holidays on the beach can be diversified with water activities and activities conducted by animators. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel complex Club Boran Mare Beach (Kemer) leaves only positive memories in the hearts of tourists.  There are many reasons for this.  The hotel has a very good qualified staff, on which the rest depends on a lot.  All employees, as we have already mentioned, know the Russian language, so there is absolutely no difficulty in communicating, even the animation is conducted in Russian.  Such attention is very pleasing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club boran mare kemer" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1986247.jpg" width="600"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <p>  Daytime activities of animators add variety to the guests' relaxation.  Everyone can take part in yoga and water aerobics classes.  Tourists greatly praise the mini club and its staff.  Talented teachers skillfully involve children of all ages in interesting activities, so the rest of young guests is filled with bright emotions.  Kids are happy to go to the club every day, anticipating new and interesting entertainments.  The staff conducts animation for kids in Russian. </p><p>  In the evenings, a fun mini-disco awaits the kids, and show programs are organized for adults.  All events end at around eleven o‚Äôclock.  Perhaps active youth will want to visit discos or nightclubs, in this case it is worth looking for another hotel, since Club Boran Mare (Turkey) is designed specifically for family vacations.  For tourists with children, it is difficult to find a better place to stay. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Goynuk is a small town, so significant attractions in it are difficult to find.  But in Kemer there are more than enough of them.  The only thing that you can see in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Goynuk is a mountain canyon.  Fans of mountain tourism will certainly appreciate this place.  A deep gorge (350 meters) stretched for fourteen kilometers.  However, its width is only six meters.  Only well-trained tourists can decide to take a walk along the canyon, since they will have to walk a lot, and in some places the path passes through shallow water, so shoes that are not afraid of dampness are needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club boran mare beach kemer" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1986245.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, vacationers can go to Kemer.  The road to it on dolmushi does not take much time.  In the city you can visit the local market, which operates several times a week.  On it you can buy traditional products from suede, leather, ceramics.  It‚Äôs just interesting to walk around the bazaar to feel the real oriental flavor. </p><p>  Not far from Kemer are the ruins of Phaselis and the ruins of ancient Olympos.  These places are also interesting to visit.  In addition, an ethnic park is worth noting, in which the life and way of life of the ancient nomads is recreated.  Here you can see clothes, tools and jewelry of ancient times. </p><p>  But lovers of natural beauty should go to Mount Yanartash, which is always shrouded in smoke.  Flames burst from its bowels.  Modern experts believe that such an amazing phenomenon is associated with the reserves of gases that have accumulated at the surface of the earth.  But there is another explanation for the appearance of flame.  Legend has it that fire spews out a defeated monster, which is walled up in the mountain.  Whether this is true or not is up to you to judge.  But to visit this amazing place is worth it. </p>
