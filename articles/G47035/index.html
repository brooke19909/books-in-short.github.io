This is a blessed place, with man-made comfortable artificial sandy beaches.  This bay has a coral bottom topography, and on hotel beaches entry into the water is equipped with pontoons (it‚Äôs more convenient than walking along the bottom to get to the beginning of the reef). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãgarden resort 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/716832.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And also, going on vacation, holidaymakers should take into account that the Nabq Bay in winter (December to March) is quite windy. </p><p>  There are relatively few tourists here these months.  The cold wind creates certain inconveniences. </p><p>  However, this hotel is traditionally quoted by lovers to relax in Sharm El Sheikh with comfort.  And the vast majority of tourists (as can be seen from their online reviews) rate the rest in Sea Garden as a whole ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù on a five-point scale.  And such reviews on the Internet reflect a decent level of relaxation in the hotel complex. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Perhaps the reason for this is the creative organizational management of the hotel.  This scheme of servicing holidaymakers is rarely found in the hotel business: well-coordinated work of three professional teams at once.  Three neighboring hotel complexes are united into a single network: Sea Garden Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh), Sea Life Resort 4 *, Sea Club Resort 5 *.  Buying a tour to one of these hotels, the lucky tourist immediately gets triple benefits by using the restaurants, bars, swimming pools of three complementary hotel complexes at once. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, in fact, the description of the rest in the hotel complex Sea Garden 5 * has certain specifics.  Basically, one has to mention almost all the infrastructure elements of two neighboring ones when talking about a vacation in it.  As a result, the spa of each of the three hotels receives a greater degree of freedom, receiving better service. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel complex was built in 2010, i.e.  it belongs to the third generation of Egyptian hotels, in the design of which an advanced design was applied, taking into account the previous experience of the country's tourism industry. </p><p>  In particular, this experience has already demonstrated the lesser effectiveness of large hotels.  In a complex with two neighboring Gardens, it seems to be one large hotel.  However, it is more dynamic, controlled, and therefore effective.  Perhaps that is why it is designed in terms of size and number of rooms as a hotel, the average hotel complex Sea Garden Resort 5 * considered by us (Sharm El Sheikh).  Nabq Bay - a fabulous bay of the Red Sea, its microclimate and the richest coral underwater world determine advanced resort opportunities.  The architectural appearance of Sea Garden is a classic for medium-sized hotels.  The hotel complex consists of a one-story main building and two two-story buildings. </p><p>  Of its 180 rooms, 76 are family rooms, with two bedrooms and 104 ordinary ones.  In total, the hotel complex is ready to receive 360 ‚Äã‚Äãguests.  Its territory is 34.9 thousand m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  More about hotel rooms </h2><p>  They adequately meet the requirements of the highest degree of classification of hotel rooms Sea Garden Resort 5 * (Sharm). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Super AI family room (family suite for two adults and children) is equipped with a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom and a balcony.  It is furnished with a seating area, a wardrobe, a double bed or two single beds, two sofa beds, a coffee table, a safe.  All furniture is new.  Managers are not allowed to have furniture in public places or in client rooms with signs of physical and mental wear.  In addition, it is made of natural wood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãgarden resort 5 sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/716831.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each hotel room is equipped with modern appliances necessary for the comfort of hotel guests: a flat LCD TV, a refrigerator, air conditioning, a hairdryer, and a telephone.  Chilled mineral water is constantly present in the refrigerator by the service staff. </p><p>  The highest standards of <span>customer service</span> meets the hotel Sea Garden Resort 5 *.  The reviews of its guests show that the rooms are cleaned daily; linen and bathing accessories are also changed daily.  Guests are provided with both a connection with the reception and international communication. </p><h2>  Infrastructure for vacationers </h2><p>  Speaking of hotel infrastructure, i.e.  about the objects for trade, service and leisure available to hotel guests, we mention objects that belong to the three above-mentioned hotel complexes: Garden, Club and Life (as vacationers themselves call them).  So - strategically and conceptually, with the advantages originally laid down in the logistics of customer service, this hotel chain was designed.  The principle of "three in one" here works in full force. </p><p>  Impressive even to those who saw his photo: a modern outdoor pool on the territory of the Sea Garden with a water mirror area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 790 m <sup>2</sup> .  Its depth level is zoned and varies from 0.96 to 1.7 m. This pool is heated in the winter.  The hotel has advanced business opportunities.  It is used in organizing international symposia and conferences.  There is also a modern conference hall with 400 seats, equipped with video walls, a congress system, video conferencing, projection equipment.  Laundry, hairdresser. </p><p>  Also in the territories of the Sea Garden Resort 5 *, Sea Life Resort 4 *, Sea Club Resort 5 *, according to a single plan, a botanical garden is broken.  Palm trees, topiary, carefully trimmed lawns are combined in the original landscape design.  It is harmoniously planned and brings its charm to leisure travelers. </p><p>  At the neighboring Sea Club Resort 5 * hotel, within the framework of the "three in one" principle, the hotel guests are available - the subject of the description of our article - a shopping center, SPA center, fitness club, disco, Internet cafe, two free ones (in the daytime) tennis courts, sauna, hammam, jacuzzi, games room. </p><p>  In the territories of Sea Life Resort 4 *, Sea Club Resort 5 * there is an amphitheater - the main concert venue for three hotels.  Here in the evenings a show program is organized by animators and guest artists.  Celebrities are not uncommon guests here. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The guest at Sea Garden Hotel is free to use any sun loungers and umbrellas on the more than a kilometer strip of sandy beaches of the three above-mentioned hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãgarden resort 5 sharm" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/716834.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel's own beach has a length of 450 m and a pontoon about 45 m long. However, the principle of ‚Äúthree in one‚Äù also works with respect to the beach. </p><p>  The 700-meter beach of the Sea Life Resort 4 *, Sea Club Resort 5 * hotels is also available to guests of the Sea Garden Resort 5 * hotel (Sharm). </p><p>  Their feedback on the sea and on equipment is emphasized positively.  The beach is equipped with a pontoon of one and a half hundred meters, allowing you to go along it to the water area, attractive for diving.  Sun loungers, umbrellas, <span>beach towels</span> are issued to vacationers, presenting their bracelets-passes to the beach staff. </p><h2>  Infrastructure for children </h2><p>  Families with children come here willingly.  The room initially cot is not installed.  However, at the request of vacationers, it is delivered free of charge and immediately.  Here, their parents get the opportunity to get a few hours of rest a day, distracted from constant monitoring of the actions of their children.  From 10 <sup>00</sup> to 13 <sup>00</sup> and from 15 <sup>00</sup> to 17 <sup>30</sup> qualified Russian-speaking animators deal with them.  For the smallest in the Sea Garden Resort 5 * (Sharm-El-Sheikh) there is a heated and completely safe children's pool, a "paddling pool", as it is humorously called because of the depth of 0.57 m, however, optimal for playing tricks.  A playground is equipped next to it. </p><p>  For the smallest little baby, parents have the opportunity to hire a nanny upon request.  However, they should expect in advance that this service is paid. </p><h2>  Sports infrastructure </h2><p>  Among vacationers there is a fairly large category of guests for whom lifestyle is associated with physical activity.  For them, at the Sea Garden Resort 5 * hotel and in two neighboring chain hotels, a joint powerful infrastructure was created and a staff of trainers and animators was recruited.  Everyone is offered a free pastime organized by the animators: a ‚Äúchampionship‚Äù in beach volleyball, futsal, darts, water polo.  The winners of these hotel competitions at the nightly hotel show are honored, they are presented with small pleasant souvenirs. </p><p>  For the more motivated sports guests of the Sea Garden Resort 5 * (Sharm el Sheikh) who have the appropriate sports experience or who want to get basic skills in diving, professional billiards, surfing, qualified Russian-speaking trainers will come to the rescue. </p><p>  Their services, as you know, are paid.  However, among the trainers you can often find Russian speakers.  These are really professionals.  What they teach is also not amateurish.  Take diving, for example.  The practitioner, depending on the available skills, selects for himself certain courses from the nomenclature offered by the trainers.  Upon completion, they receive a certificate of an established international standard.  This gives him the official right to dive in any country in the world. </p><h2>  Active therapy </h2><p>  At first, a little theory.  As you know, in any sport, while improving the tone of the student, there is another side: super restoration of muscle tone after sports loads.  This phase is very important.  Otherwise, overwork will occur, which is undesirable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãgarden resort 5 sharm super ai family room" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/716829.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To improve health due to the motor activity of guests at the Sea Garden Resort 5 * hotel complex (Sharm el Sheikh), the corresponding features are provided: massage, jacuzzi, Turkish bath, sauna. </p><p>  Note that all of these therapeutic services are paid.  However, if a hotel guest is motivated to improve their health, does that really matter? </p><p>  Moreover, experts recommend that newly arrived tourists who do not have the appropriate contraindications for doctors visit a hammam and then immediately take a massage.  The Turkish bathhouse from the hotel is professional, it perfectly opens pores, improves skin respiration, and has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system.  Massage fixes the effect of the bath on the aforementioned system and improves the condition of the muscular and skeletal systems.  The price of a half hour massage is $ 10. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The main restaurant of the Sea Garden Resort 5 * hotel (Sharm-El-Sheikh) prepares international dishes and presents them to guests as part of themed days.  The skill of the local chef team is amazing.  One day, hotel guests enjoy Italian cuisine, then - Egyptian, then - European, Mediterranean, etc.  The range of dishes includes dozens of items.  With this kind of catering, a hotel guest can theoretically eat without ever repeating a single dish in his diet! </p><p>  Buffet-style meals are organized by the Sea Garden Resort 5 * restaurant.  The reviews indicate the establishment of the following diet: breakfast - from 7 <sup>00</sup> to 10 <sup>00</sup> , lunch from 14 <sup>00</sup> to 17 <sup>30</sup> , dinner from 19 <sup>00</sup> to 22 <sup>00</sup> . </p><p>  The breakfast menu is traditionally quite easy: vegetable dishes, salads, sausages, omelettes, sausages, oatmeal, rice porridge, hard cheese, cheese like suluguni, a variety of pastries, tea, coffee, juices, fruits. </p><p>  The lunch menu is more saturated.  The main dishes are prepared from meat of 4-5 species, fish of the same nomenclature.  Soups, side dishes, drinks, sweets, fruits - all in stock.  Delicious grilled meat and fish. </p><p>  The dinner menu is similar to the lunch menu, but it is even more eventful. </p><p>  However, hotel guests are not limited only to meals in the main restaurant Sea Garden Resort 5 * (Sharm).  Super AI (or Super All Inclusive) - this is more precisely called the option "all inclusive", offered to hotel guests.  This means, in addition to the buffet, the possibility - once - at one‚Äôs discretion, during the tour, to eat for free in a paid restaurant. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, gourmet guests are served by paid restaurants by appointment at the Sea Garden Resort 5 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh).  Customer reviews among them highlight the French cuisine restaurant La Fondue and the fish restaurant Il Pescatore.  Restaurants work from 19 <sup>00</sup> to 23 <sup>00</sup> . </p><h2>  About hotel bars </h2><p>  The food infrastructure of the hotel complex, in addition to restaurants, also includes bars.  People come here not to get enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãgarden resort 5 charm reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/716833.jpg" width="600"></div>  After all, the main mission of the bars is to brighten up the leisure of vacationers.  At any time, the hotel guest can turn to the 24-hour lobby bar of the Lobby Lounge &amp; Bar, where, in addition to drinks in the assortment, they also offer light snacks.  If, for example, a diver who is keen on his dives skips lunch in the main restaurant, then he will be able to have a bite to eat, ‚Äúkill the worm‚Äù here.

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, excursions to Cairo and Jerusalem are most in demand among tourists Sea Garden Resort 5 *.  Photos brought from them occupy a worthy place in photo albums, and they are usually planned in advance.  The price of such an excursion at a local travel agency averages $ 60.

    <p> Those who rested in it, in their bulk, give the hotel complex the highest ratings.  True convenience, as well as a sense of freedom and comfort, are promised to hotel guests by the Super All inclusive system.  And three hotel complexes: Sea Garden Resort 5 *, Sea Life Resort 4 *, Sea Club Resort 5 *, which combined their potential for the best service to their customers, is a real managerial find. </p><p>  Among the "once rested" in Sea Garden there are certainly those who want to go here for the next season.  Basically, this hotel complex is preferred by residents of Western Europe.  Russian-speaking tourists like Sea Life Resort 4 * more, obviously due to the lower price of the tour. </p><p>  All this would not have been possible without proper management.  The hotel staff has a higher hotel education. </p>
