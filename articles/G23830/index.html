The kind and cheerful owners of Hellas (the ancient name of the country) simply adore the guests.  Here you will find real relaxation: a clean warm sea, delicious food and, importantly, affordable prices.  In the article we will talk about the <span>best beaches in Greece.</span> </p><h2>  Quality rest </h2><p>  To begin with, according to the law, all coastal territories here belong to the state, and therefore entrance fees are not charged.  Moreover, almost all beaches have the Blue Flag Award, which means: </p><ul><li>  the presence of comfortable showers; </li><li>  weekly coastal water quality testing; </li><li>  sand cleaning using special equipment; </li><li>  perfect cleanliness; </li><li>  pets are not allowed here; </li><li>  categorical smoking ban; </li><li>  prohibited traffic; </li><li>  constant duty of rescuers and doctors; </li><li>  free entry. </li></ul><p>  The 419 best beaches in Greece received the Blue Flag Award.  Next, let's talk about the most famous. </p><h2>  Elafonisi beach - a fairy tale in reality! </h2><p>  Imagine the <span>azure sea</span> and pink sand!  Do you think this can only be in the drawings of little dreamers?  Go to the beach of Elafonisi, which is located on the island of Crete, 76 km from the resort town of Chania.  The beach belongs to protected areas, and there are no hotels here. </p><p>  So why is the sand here so unusual?  According to a local legend, it is stained with the blood of 850 women and children who were sentenced to death by the Turks in the 19th century.  There is also a scientific explanation: sand contains impurities from fragments of coral and shells.  The sea is shallow, so you can safely swim even during a storm.  Great place for bathing babies!  Elafonisi can rightfully be called one of the best sandy beaches of Greece.  And the photos taken here are just a luxury! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wild Balos </h2><p>  Supporters of relaxation away from civilization sunny Hellas awaits on the beach of Balos.  It is a bay, and getting to it is not so easy.  The main transport here is sightseeing ships that head to Gramvousa Island.  We will discuss it below. </p><p>  On the way to Gramvousa Island, the organizers will give you an hour to get to know Balos Beach.  If you want a long rest, you will have to get by car on the road, but it's worth it.  You can also rent a boat in the port of Kassimos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.villasincrete.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balos Bay" class="if uuid-2390008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2390008.jpg"></div><p>  The coastal zone is strewn with snow-white sand, on which, like beads on the carpet, colored stones are scattered.  Water here has all shades of blue and blue.  This is a consequence of the union of the three seas: </p><ul><li>  Libyan </li><li>  Aegean </li><li>  Ionic. </li></ul><p>  There is no developed infrastructure in Balos Bay.  Only a few cafes serve tourists during the summer season.  But you can watch how turtles calmly walk along the shore, and dolphins swim nearby.  Absolutely pure, unsullied by human hand nature.  No wonder Prince Charles and Princess Diana spent their honeymoon here.  This is another argument in favor of the fact that Balos is one of the best beaches in Greece. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A kilometer from the bay is the island of Gramvousa, or rather two of them.  Travel booklets combined them into one name, as Imeri Gramvous is famous throughout the world.  The second - Agria Gramvousa is unremarkable with nothing but a huge number of birds living on it.  The approach to the island of ships is impossible because of the underwater cliffs. </p><p>  Imeri Gramvousa - the legendary pirate island.  Cretan rebels who plundered the Venetian fortress located here from the Turks robbed the ships.  Thus, after armed skirmishes, they earned a livelihood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Venetian fortress on the island of Gramvousa" class="if uuid-2390509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2390509.jpg"></div><h2>  The best hotels of Greece with a sandy beach </h2><p>  Both on the islands and on the mainland there are many comfortable hotels with their own beaches.  In the center of Greece, young people mostly like to relax.  There are many clubs, excursions, bazaars, shops.  People who are fed up with this seek solitude in the small bungalows on the islands.  It is quiet here, and nature presents unprecedented surprises.  Next, we will focus on the most expensive hotel in Greece with the best beach. </p><p>  Eagles Palace deluxe is a Byzantine-style hotel complex.  The hotel is located on the Athos Peninsula (resort of Halkidiki).  It is considered to be the most comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuoni.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Eagles Palace deluxe" class="if uuid-2390031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2390031.jpg"></div><p>  Also, many beautiful hotels with sandy beaches can be found on the shores of the Aegean.  Tourists are waiting for the islands of Rhodes and Kos. </p><p>  It is not necessary to pay fabulous amounts for a vacation in Greece.  For many residents of sunny Hellas, the hotel business has become a family business.  As a rule, in such institutions it is very cozy.  They are served with signature dishes, the recipes of which are passed down from generation to generation. </p><p>  The color of the country is especially visible here, and you can make sure that the best hotels in Greece with a sandy beach are not necessarily the most expensive.  For example, in the resort of Liapades (Corfu island) is one of these budget, but comfortable family-run establishments.  The hotel is located in the middle of a blooming garden, which is broken by the hands of the owners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thomascook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family hotel in Corfu" class="if uuid-2390074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2390074.jpg"></div><p>  If you are planning a vacation to Greece, try to learn as much information as possible.  There are a lot of hotels and beaches here.  Everyone can choose a place they like and can afford! </p>
