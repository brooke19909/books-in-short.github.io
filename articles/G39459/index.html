Pets are not allowed in Cinnamon Bey. </p><h2>  Entertainment, sports </h2><p>  You should not expect noisy and dizzy parties from the Cinnamon Bey Hotel.  It is crowded here, but guests come to this hotel for their originality and the opportunity to be among the beautiful nature, which in itself is considered a tourist attraction.  Here you can spend a quiet and leisurely vacation enjoying the ocean, visiting interesting excursions and restoring your health.  The local population is very friendly to tourists.  They have a lot to learn from eternally hurrying western people. </p><p>  The hotel can not be called cheap, but, according to reviews of lovers of Sri Lankan holidays, it is the best on the entire coast in its price segment.  There are practically no waves on the beach, which makes it attractive for families with children at any time of the year.  In the sea, right in front of the hotel, there is a long natural reef that acts as a breakwater.  During low tides, the water level in this place drops dramatically, which is very suitable for young children.  But adults will be satisfied with the ocean.  It is enough to go left or right along the coast for 300-500 m, and you can swim not in shallow water. </p><p>  The hotel area is large and well maintained.  Not only tourists like to walk along it, but also harmless small animals, for example, chipmunks and iguanas.  In the sea in front of the hotel you can find sea urchins, so you need to be careful not to injure your legs.  And it‚Äôs better to wear rubber slippers. </p><p>  The hotel staff, as many guests note, is very responsive.  Everywhere is perfectly clean, which is important for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Sports activities at Cinnamon Bey: </p><ul><li>  snorkeling </li><li>  volleyball; </li><li>  table games; </li><li>  darts; </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  pool. </li></ul><p>  Many guests of the Cinnamon Bey Hotel 5 * Deluxe praise the large and magnificent pool, which does not smell of chlorine. </p><p>  A very popular tropical attraction is snorkeling - swimming in the upper layer of water with a breathing tube and a mask.  The necessary equipment allows you to be under water for a long time and watch the beauties of the ocean.  It is issued at the hotel for an additional fee.  This entertainment is available even for children.  They can see pebbles, shells and small underwater inhabitants. </p><p>  On the territory of the Cinnamon Bey Hotel 5 * there is a free gym. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In Beruwela itself, you can visit one of the island‚Äôs oldest mosques, called Kechimalay. </p><p>  You can go to Bentota and go on a tour of the Bentota Ganga River.  There is also a famous turtle reserve.  One of the closest Buddhist attractions is the Kande Viharaya Temple (Kande Viharaya Temple).  The temple was built in 1734 and is considered the most revered place of Sri Lanka.  Thousands of devotees flock here daily to perform rituals.  The most important element of the temple is the giant Buddha statue, considered the tallest (48 m) of all the seated Buddhist statues in the world.  It was installed in 2006.  When visiting the complex, you should take into account that you will have to walk barefoot on its territory, so it is better to go there in the morning.  After lunch, the sand becomes hot.  Clothing should also be appropriate, not beachwear.  Dresses should be below the knees so as not to offend the feelings of believers.  Here you can feed the temple elephants.  The temple complex is 2.5 km from the hotel. </p><p>  6.6 km from the hotel, Bawa Gardens is a beautiful park laid by the outstanding local sculptor and architect Bevis Bava.  Lunuganga Manor is 7.5 km from the hotel.  Now it houses a boutique hotel surrounded by tropical plants, cinnamon plantations and sprawling trees. </p>
