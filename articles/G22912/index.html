    <h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  Anapa is one of the cities of the Krasnodar Territory, located on the Black Sea.  It is located at the junction of the Greater Caucasus and the Taman Peninsula.  Therefore, wooded foothills there are replaced by steppes and flowering valleys of Taman, and all this is interspersed with sea estuaries.  A sandy beach with an arc borders the sea and forms a quiet and beautiful bay.  These natural features of Anapa provide a mild climate - it is never very hot there.  At the same time, this resort is the sunniest place on the coast, and the swimming season here lasts from May to September.  Warm shallow sea, golden soft sand make Anapa an ideal place for families with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in anapa" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/475280.jpg" width="382"></div>

    <h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  This is exactly what attracts Anapa vacationers.  The golden sands of its beaches have long been famous for their softness and healing properties.  This is because the Kuban River flowed into the sea here earlier.  She brought such soft <span>white sand,</span> which is constantly enriched with minerals from sea water.  The uniqueness of the beaches of Anapa also lies in the fact that they stretch for many kilometers along the sea.  More than 40 of them have only sand, and south of the city there are mostly pebble beaches.  These places also have their fans, but it is the sand that attracts most vacationers.  This is what Anapa has become famous for all of Russia.  Its golden sands have unique healing properties.  Enriched with particles of shellfish, <span>seashells</span> and algae, they help with radiculitis, skin diseases and strengthen the immune system.  They have so glorified this resort that one of the most famous guest houses in the city is called Golden Sands.  The amount of sand is also unique - in some places the beach extends from the sea to a width of up to 600 meters.  Huge, sometimes ten-meter dunes are also a tourist attraction, which Anapa is famous for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa Vityazevo Golden Sands" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/475283.jpg" width="600"></div>
