    <h2>  City population </h2><p>  Saransk (whose population honors and respects its roots) is the oldest Russian city in the Middle Volga.  The first mention of the village dates back to 1641.  It was built as a fortified city of the Russian kingdom.  The fortress itself was erected on the bank of the Insar River and served as a stronghold of the Ateman serif line on the southeastern outskirts of the state.  For its construction, the left bank was chosen: it had a higher slope, which is why it was built there.  The fortress was called the Saransk gatehouse.  It is from this word that the toponym of such a settlement as the city of Saransk originated, which began to be used in the future.  The word "sarah" in translation from Finnish means "swamped." </p><p>  The first inhabitants of the settlement were the military: Cossacks, gunners and archers.  Later, people from nearby villages settled here, and the city began to grow.  After 10 years, having entered the Saransk district, it becomes its administrative center.  During the reign of Peter I was part of the Kazan province, and later was listed in Penza. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city stands on the <span>Volga Upland, the</span> average altitude is 125-160 m above sea level, and the maximum varies within 250 m.
