It is located just two kilometers from the continent, directly opposite the Greco-Albanian border.  Today, the island has over 160 2-5 star hotels, as well as guest houses and apartments.  The most popular among Russian tourists are four-star hotels, for example, Delfina 4 *, Nissaki 4 *, Corfu Village 4 * and others.  In them, prices are much lower than in five-star hotels, but the service is almost the same.  In addition, the island of Corfu is so beautiful and interesting in terms of natural and historical attractions that tourists are unlikely to want to spend much time in the walls of hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corfu village 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/467064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Corfu </h2><p>  This picturesque island looks like an emerald among the turquoise surface of the <span>Ionian Sea.</span>  Numerous olive and cypress plantations, various flowering exotic shrubs fill the air with fragrant aromas.  Corfu back in the last century was chosen by many of European writers, poets, artists, theater workers, etc. Therefore, the island is rightfully considered the most bohemian in the whole Mediterranean.  Over the past fifty years, the tourism industry has begun to develop intensively, next to comfortable private villas, snow-white buildings of luxury hotels were built, many of which with elements of traditional Greek architecture, for example, the Corfu Village 4 * hotel, which has the appearance of an amphitheater.  Many taverns, restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. appeared. Luxurious sandy beaches were equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable beach holiday.  For their cleanliness and arrangement, many of them were awarded the Blue Flag of the international environmental organization.  By the way, the island still has beaches that have not yet been touched by a human hand.  They are far from the hotel line and are of great interest to those tourists who dream of romance and privacy.  Often next to them you can see the snow-white sail of a lonely yacht, which lurks here among the rocks and serves as a place of solitude for newlyweds, creative personalities, and sometimes for avid fishermen.  Such yachts can be rented on the island at a very reasonable price.  By the way, all services, as well as the cost of living in Corfu are much cheaper than on other islands of the Ionian Sea.  So, for example, the price for a room at the Corfu Village 4 * hotel per day is about 3 thousand rubles.  If you compare this with the prices for accommodation in hotels of the same category in Crete, it will immediately become clear that Corfu is an ideal budget vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel corfu village 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/467065.jpg" width="600"></div>

All this is worthy of the attention of tourists who admire the beauty of nature. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Corfu Village 4 *: reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  If you want to know more about this or that hotel - read reviews of tourists.  By the way, be careful when searching for information about this hotel, as there is another hotel in Corfu with the same name.  This is the Summertime Village Corfu 4 * hotel, only it is located on the other end of the island.  So, almost all the guests from Russia rate their stay at the Corfu Village hotel at five points.  Of course, in terms of service, it is much inferior to five-star hotels, but it fully corresponds to its category.  Some of the tourists in their reviews complain about problems with the air conditioning, but this is an easily fixed drawback.  Everything else - the attitude of the staff, the convenience of the rooms, the kitchen, the level of service - is worthy of the highest praise. </p>
