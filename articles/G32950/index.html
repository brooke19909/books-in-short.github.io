    <p>  The Polish company Zelmer is widely known in the market of small and medium-sized appliances, and often it competes with sales leaders such as Tefal, Bosch, Thomas.  Especially popular are <span>vacuum cleaners Zelmer.</span>  Customer reviews indicate that the first thing that attracts is the affordable price of these models compared to competing firms. </p><p>  Consider the sales leader - the <span>Zelmer 919.0</span> ST Aquawelt vacuum cleaner.  It is designed for dry and wet cleaning, its distinguishing feature is the presence of an aquafilter.  All garbage is collected not in a regular cloth bag, but in a plastic container with water.  Thanks to this cleaning system, even the smallest dust particles settle in the vacuum cleaner, which is why the Zelmer 919.0 ST Aquawelt is perfect for people with allergies.  But the main function, for which this model is most often taken, is <span>wet cleaning</span> .  Vacuum cleaner owners no longer need to regularly drag heavy carpets into the yard for cleaning and clap them for half an hour.  Wet cleaning can be carried out every week, and not only to clean carpets and rugs, but also upholstered furniture.  Attracts the buyer and the complete set of the Zelmer vacuum cleaner.  Owner reviews indicate that most often people use a dry-cleaning brush with a floor / carpet switch and a turbo brush for collecting animal hair.  In addition, the unit is equipped with an accessory for collecting water, a crevice brush, for parquet and stone floor, for wet cleaning of carpets and furniture.  The price of a Zelmer vacuum cleaner is 50 percent cheaper than similar Thomas models. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to vacuum cleaners, <span>Zelmer meat grinders</span> are also popular <span>.</span>  <span>Customer reviews</span> characterize them as reliable and easy-to-use devices.  There are meat grinders of this company for every taste and pocket.  For example, the simple and budget model Zelmer 586.5 A. The meat grinder is equipped with two grills of different diameters and a nozzle for making <span>home-made sausages.</span>  The average power model is about 500 W, it is capable of twisting 1.2 kg of minced meat per minute. </p><p>  There are also more functional Zelmer meat grinders.  Feedback from sales consultants in stores indicates that the Zelmer Diana 886.84 is very popular.  It is much more powerful than the aforementioned (about 550 W) and, accordingly, has a higher productivity - 1.5 kg per minute.  But its main advantage is the nozzles for processing vegetables: grater and three shredders, one of which has small holes, the other with large ones, and the third cuts with rings.  Such a meat grinder can replace a whole combine. </p><p>  What other technology attracts customers under the Zelmer brand?  Reviews of sellers confirm that many pay attention to the teapots of this company, they can also be picked up for every taste and budget.  For example, Zelmer CK1004, with a capacity of 2.2 kW and a volume of 1.7 liters.  This stylish silver teapot is perfect for a large family.  The main feature of this model is the heating function.  Not everyone likes hot tea or coffee, and sometimes you need to dilute the baby mixture with water of a certain temperature.  In both cases, Zelmer CK1004 will help.  It is enough to set the desired temperature (from 50 to 95 degrees) and the kettle will turn off when it reaches the desired value.  Many are attracted to the Zelmer 17Z018 model.  Of course, this kettle cannot boast of temperature control, but it attracts attention with its unusual design.  On a shiny stainless steel case, a large plastic ‚Äúwindow‚Äù stands out through which boiling water can be seen.  In addition, when you turn on the kettle, the backlight lights up, turning the boiling process into a spectacle that is fascinating with beauty.  In addition to attractive design, this model boasts high power and affordable price. </p><p>  How can you generally evaluate the Zelmer technique?  Owner reviews allow us to characterize it as practical, reliable and affordable.  Despite the fact that some models of meat grinders, vacuum cleaners and other equipment have a rustic design, they meet all the basic needs of customers. </p>
