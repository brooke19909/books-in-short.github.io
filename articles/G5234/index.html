Its concept and composition can be supplemented depending on the type of activity of the subject, so it should be carefully studied.  It is important to note that real losses are damage incurred by a person as a result of damage to or destruction of property, as well as expenses aimed at its restoration.  It is worth familiarizing yourself with the concept under consideration in detail, as well as finding out what to do in cases where a violation of rights is committed against a citizen, resulting in damage. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of loss in economic activity </h2><p>  From the point of view of economic activity, loss is loss that is expressed in cash.  They are also a decrease in material resources that occurs as a result of the fact that expenses exceed revenues.  A business participant who violated obligations or established requirements must obligatorily compensate losses to the entity in respect of which a violation of rights or legitimate interests occurred.  The legislation establishes the following components of losses: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the value of property that has been damaged or lost; </li><li>  expenses incurred by a person due to default by another participant in the activity; </li><li>  loss of profit is also considered a loss if it occurred as a result of default by a party of economic relations; </li><li>  <span>pecuniary damage</span> for non- <span>pecuniary damage.</span> </li></ul><p>  For certain types of economic obligations, legislation may establish limited liability for improper fulfillment or non-fulfillment of obligations stipulated by the agreement.  The claim for damages may be satisfied on a voluntary basis.  However, if this did not happen, the business entity should contact the higher authorities to resolve the conflict in court. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="profit and loss it" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1001689.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <h2>  The concept of loss in civil law </h2><p>  From the point of view of civil law, a loss is <span>real damage</span> that a citizen has received as a result of the actions of another person.  It can also be considered as a lost profit. </p><p>  If we consider the concept in general, a loss is expenses incurred by a person whose rights have been violated or it will have to incur them to restore these rights or damaged property.  The law also determines that it may be the amount of unearned income, which, in the absence of a violation of rights, would belong to a citizen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, the person who committed the offense undertakes to indemnify.  If he has additionally received a benefit, he undertakes to pay it in an equal amount.  It is worth noting that the Civil Code is based on the general principle of the full compensation of losses caused to a citizen.  He has the right to claim compensation for material damage in full, unless otherwise provided by contract or law.  In this case, knowledge of the law is as useful as possible, as a person whose rights are violated will know what to do when such situations arise. </p>
