  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personal account</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A personal account in the broadest sense of the term is an account that is designed to record all payments to creditors and debtors: legal entities and individuals, including credit, financial institutions and public authorities. </p><p>  Personal accounts reflect financial transactions carried out by citizens or legal entities with banks, the tax inspectorate, <span>utilities,</span> and state authorities.  Each account has its own individual number, it must indicate the name of the bank in which it was opened.  One person or organization, if necessary, can open several personal accounts. </p><p>  Each legal entity has such an account with the tax office, which opens immediately after the registration of the company.  On this account, all receipts, accruals and additional charges, fines and refunds (if necessary) are recorded and reflected. </p><p>  Accounts of citizens differ from accounts of organizations.  The personal account of a citizen at his place of residence is a document reflecting the movement of financial resources that are transferred for <span>payment of utilities</span> , the maintenance and management of the house, and the rental of a dwelling in it. </p><p>  The utility bill includes all payments for services.  To get such an account, you must contact the housing and communal services with documents for an apartment with a statement about opening an account.  Each owner has an individual <span>account number.</span>  The new owner of the same apartment receives a new invoice, and the details of the previous one are automatically canceled and become invalid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A personal account can be opened in a bank branch to receive, for example, a loan or a <span>deposit (deposit).</span>  A legal entity may open a separate account for settlements with a specific partner, supplier or client. </p><p>  To open an account in this case, the company (legal entity) in the bank must provide the constituent document, registration certificate, license.  You will also need a sample of signatures of persons establishing an account and receiving funds;  <span>notarized</span> stamps - all in duplicate.  In addition, a tax certificate and confirmation of authority of the recipients of the funds are provided.  An application is made to the personal account of the recipient, a contract is concluded and a commission is paid.  Opening an account requires a working week.  If the bank refuses to open, it must return all documents with a written justification of the reasons for the refusal. </p><p>  The personal account of a citizen is opened in approximately the same way, but this requires less documents.  Upon receipt of a plastic card, the creation of an account occurs later, since it is attached to the account, and not vice versa.  Although the money is first credited by the accounting department to the account, and only then it is displayed on the card.  Therefore, the personal account of the employee is created after receiving a bank card.  It is used to reflect all information about payroll during the calendar year.  It can also be used to track salary deductions. </p><p>  Settlement sheets that contain data on all the constituent elements of the salary, the size and justification of the accruals and deductions, the total payable sum of money are put into the personal account of each employee (on paper) every month.  On the reverse side of the insert sheet is a decoding of the codes adopted by the enterprise coding system, the types of payments and deductions are listed. </p><p>  When opening new accounts, it is necessary to consider for what purposes they are necessary and correctly explain this to the bank employee, so that subsequently there will be no problems with the transfer of funds.  Also, the personal account must always be accurately indicated in order to avoid the wrong direction of funds. </p>
