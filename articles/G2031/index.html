And one of the most alluring, of course, is Greece.  If you are going there with a group of friends or with a loved one, then, of course, you are trying to choose places "more out of place".  But if you are a family man, and you have a child, or maybe not just one, then you need to be very serious about which region and even the city or village to prefer.  Therefore, it is worth considering <span>where in Greece it is better to relax with children.</span>  After all, comfort and safety for your child are one of the main priorities of a successful overseas trip. </p>

Indeed, at this time there is no sweltering heat, especially on the islands.  But at the same time, the water is very warm, and there is no need to be afraid that the child will catch a cold.  Therefore, it remains to solve the last problem: not when, but <span>where in Greece is better to relax with children.</span>  This country may well offer you many options.  It is easy to find sandy beaches with a shallow convenient entry into the water, as well as an endless variety of children's entertainment of a completely European level.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, when thinking about <span>where in Greece it is better to relax</span> with children, first of all, take care of choosing a hotel.  Although almost all hotels in this country are quite suitable for taking children, it is necessary to take into account factors such as ease of entry into the sea, the presence of sand, shallow depth and not too many hedgehogs and other animals that live in the water and can harm the child.  In addition, your hotel should not be very far from the city or large resort villages.  After all, you will not constantly drive cars with kids in hot weather, and in some ‚Äúromantic corner‚Äù they may be bored.  Your place of stay should have a developed tourist and <span>transport infrastructure.</span>  At the same time, see that it is surrounded by greenery for the opportunity to walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Greece" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/191984.jpg" width="595"></div>  When traveling to Greece with a child, experienced tourists usually do not recommend Crete - its turbulent winds and turbulent waves are good for divers and divers.  Although the village of Bali is perhaps the exception.  But Corfu (the Ionian coast), Zakynthos, Thassos, Skiathos or Rhodes are very good for children.  There are zoos and very safe water parks.  As well as interesting excursions, from which an older child will be delighted.  And Corfu is notable not only for its medieval architecture and green landscapes, but also for the fact that many entertainments in this resort are designed specifically for children.  Where is it better to relax in Greece on the mainland?  Perhaps the Peloponnese and Halkidiki can take first place in the ranking of vacationers.

Indeed, underwater currents, winds and the beach infrastructure itself can be different even in neighboring villages.  All this also needs to be taken into account when you are planning a vacation and think about where in Greece it is better to relax with children.  A careful choice of location requires a careful acquaintance with the reviews about this region and even the hotel.  By the way, many hotels offer special menus for kids of two to four years old.  But the best beaches for children are Kamares and Sifnos.  Huge sandy bays, sheltered from all winds, almost never see the waves.  And from the cafes and restaurants located on the shore, you can very well watch how your children play on the beach.
