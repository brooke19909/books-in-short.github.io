According to legend, it was under him that Gautama Buddha was at the time of enlightenment, since then it has been a shrine for the followers of Buddhism.  It is also believed that banyan trees were an early form of a haven for travelers without discrimination between rich and poor, which prompted the creators to choose such a name for a hotel chain.

    <p>  The territory is landscaped.  Facades of buildings and surrounding areas, like rooms, are designed in light colors: white tables, deckchairs made of light wood. </p><p>  Wooden elements are an integral part of the design in connection with the concept of the hotel.  Treebo, as mentioned earlier, translates as ‚ÄúBo tree‚Äù and supports the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomfortable, affordable housing.  Moreover, each category of rooms has a separate name, so the standard is Oak (oak), deluxe is Maple (maple), premium is Mahogany (mahogany). </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sandy <span>beach of Morjim</span> is located 700 meters from the hotel - 5-7 minutes walk through the courtyards or 2 minutes by scooter.  It is also commonly called ‚ÄúIndian Rublevka‚Äù because of the large number of Russian tourists and high prices for food, hotels and souvenirs.  In this regard, there are many restaurants where you can taste purely Russian cuisine, for example, Glavfish, Bora-Bora, "Fir-trees", "Shanti" and "Tchaikovsky".  The prices on the menu are almost Moscow.  There is also a kindergarten for Russians on the beach. </p><p>  On Morjim, water sports are popular among extreme sports, such as windsurfing and kiting. </p><p>  Russian "majors" like to organize social parties to which the best DJs are invited. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  From the <span>hotel Turtle Beach Resort</span> 4 * (Goa) you can go on many exciting excursions. </p><p>  One of the main attractions of Morjim beach is the turtle beach.  You need to visit it from November to February, this is the period of time when <span>olive turtles</span> come here <span>.</span>  Unfortunately, this species is considered endangered, and therefore is under the protection of the government, therefore it is forbidden to approach and cross the protected area, you can only watch from afar, but it's worth it. </p><p>  We also advise you not to spare money and go on an excursion to the Dudhsagar Falls, which will certainly be offered upon arrival at the hotel.  The tour takes a whole day, the program includes: visiting a waterfall, bathing with an elephant and an interesting excursion to a spice plantation, where they will not only tell and show a lot of interesting things, but also provide <span>a buffet,</span> treat local moonshine with fennel made from cashew nuts. </p>
