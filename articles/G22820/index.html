But what is a floor?  In the article we will answer this question in detail.  Consider the most common types of floors.  And also we will answer what is the number of storeys of the building.  Let's start with the main concept. </p><h2>  What is a floor? </h2><p>  The word comes from the French.  √©tage - "level". </p><p>  What is a floor?  We present several definitions of a concept from dictionaries: </p><ul><li>  Part of the space of a structure between two horizontal ceilings of its space.  That is between the ceiling and the floor.  This space, in fact, acts as a room.  The floor is also called the level of the building, not only above, but also below ground level. </li><li>  The part of the building, which includes premises located strictly on the same level. </li><li>  A number of objects that are located horizontally are relative to each other at the same horizontal level. </li><li>  Part of the mine fields that is located between the drifts. </li><li>  Part of the mine field, which is limited by the fall of floor haulage and ventilation drifts (along the strike of the boundaries of this mine field). </li><li>  The longitudinal part of the house, all rooms of which are located on the same level. </li><li>  The main level of construction, which is measured from ground level up or down. </li><li>  The part of the building, which includes all the rooms, the floors of which are located on the same horizontal level. </li><li>  Part of the building in height, limited by floor and floor or floor and floor. </li><li>  The part of the house between the floor marks (floors on the ground) and the top of the floor above this room (that is, the floor of an upper floor). </li><li>  Any tier in various buildings. </li></ul><h2>  Synonyms of the word </h2><p>  Depending on the context, the word "floor" can be replaced by related concepts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Level. </li><li>  Tier. </li><li>  Attik. </li><li>  Mezzanine. </li><li>  The sub-base </li><li>  Zenacul. </li><li>  Imperial. </li><li>  Basement. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.turbosquid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the basement in the house" class="if uuid-3113903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113903.jpg"></div><h2>  Important Features </h2><p>  You now know the exact definitions of what a house floor is.  Its most important geometric characteristic is height.  In this context, this is a strictly vertical distance from the floor level of the floor taken into account to the floor level of the upper floor. </p><p>  As for the typical characteristics of most buildings in the Russian Federation, the standard floor height here is 2.7 m. But not all buildings have the same floor height.  For example, the level at which the lobby of the building is located is somewhat higher in some buildings than other floors. </p><p>  Living areas in both private and multi-apartment buildings are not always located only on above-ground floors.  Somewhere - and in the basement, attic. </p><p>  In addition to multi-story, there are multi-level houses.  Such structures are usually divided into several horizontal parts, displaced relative to each other by about half a floor.  One of the prime examples here is multi-level parking. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  What is the floor, we installed.  Now we will analyze its main types: </p><ul><li>  Aboveground.  This is a floor whose floor mark is not lower than the ground level. </li><li>  Basement.  What is a basement?  Floor with floor mark below ground level.  Moreover, at a height of at least half the height of the room, which is located on such a floor.  We can say that this is a semi-underground floor, most of which is located above the ground. </li><li>  Basement.  A floor with a floor mark below the ground level is more than half the height of the room.  You can also say that this is a semi-underground floor, most of which is located underground. </li><li>  Underground.  A floor whose floor level is lower than ground level. </li><li>  Technical.  Or those.  floor of an apartment building.  What is it?  The floor where any engineering equipment is usually located.  It can also be used for laying communications.  Most often located in the lower part of the building - the so-called technical underground.  But it can be arranged both in the middle and in the upper (another name - technical attic) part of the building. </li><li>  Attic.  Or the attic floor.  The attic, respectively, is located in the attic space, the facade of which can be either fully or partially created by the surfaces of a broken or tilted roof. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="naresta.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the mezzanine floor" class="if uuid-3113914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113914.jpg"></div><h2>  The concept of number of storeys </h2><p>  Basically, buildings are classified by floor level.  This is the number of floors in the building.  When calculating the number of floors, the number of aboveground levels is taken into account.  They also include the technical, attic and ground floor.  The latter - only in the case when the top of its overlap is located above the planning average ground level of at least 2 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is the number of storeys of a building?  The concept should not be confused with the characteristic "number of floors".  Floors measure only the aboveground part of the structure.  The number of floors is the number of all levels of the building.  Including underground, basement, technical, elevated, attic, basement and so on. </p><p>  The term "number of floors" appears in the domestic Town Planning Code.  This is the criterion for the need for a state examination of the design documentation of any building.  Here it is impossible to replace the term "number of storeys". </p><p>  But it should be noted that this clarification is relevant only when determining the need for state examination of the project.  In most cases, the concept of "number of storeys" is used when clarifying the change in any characteristics of the building.  For example, relating to historical buildings, in need of reconstruction, restoration, expressed in the extension of the additional floor. </p><p>  As for the number of storeys, with its help buildings are classified into several types: </p><ul><li>  Low-rise. </li><li>  Mid-rise. </li><li>  Multi-storey.  The highest buildings are skyscrapers, which can include up to hundreds of floors. </li></ul><p>  Such a division is also important for determining the application of certain state sanitary standards to buildings.  So, for high-rise multi-story buildings, it is necessary to install additional systems to ensure the safety of people.  For example, smoke-free stairwells, fire extinguishing systems, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timesofmalta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the ground floor in an apartment building" class="if uuid-3113911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113911.jpg"></div><h2>  Norms </h2><p>  Terms, norms and requirements regarding floors, their construction are enclosed in the following Russian regulations: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  SNiP 31-01.2003.  "Apartment buildings".  Requirements for the height of floors and number of storeys are generally indicated directly or indirectly in the sections "General Provisions", "Requirements for the Premises of Apartments", "Bearing Capacity", "Fire Safety", "Providing Evacuation". </li><li>  SNiP 31-05-2003.  "Public buildings of administrative significance." </li><li>  SNiP 31-06-2009.  "Public facilities and buildings."  Appendix B - here in the second section of the appendix definitions of the floor and its above-mentioned varieties are given.  Appendix D - building floor counting rules.  Appendix D - a list of premises, the arrangement of which is provided for in the basement and basement floors of a public building. </li><li>  Letter of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation of March 20, 2013 No. OG-D23-1426 "On determining the number of floors, the number of floors ...".  Actually, the letter provides definitions of floors, as well as the number of floors and number of storeys. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.lennar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the floor of the house" class="if uuid-3113904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113904.jpg"></div><h2>  Cap </h2><p>  What is a basement?  A plinth is one of the effective ways to increase the usable area of ‚Äã‚Äãa house.  Which is very important not only in the construction of multi-apartment buildings, but also in private houses. </p><p>  <span>Basement</span> - the aboveground part of the foundation.  Its main difference from ground floors is that with some part (larger or smaller) the base is deepened in the ground.  This is somewhat related to it with basement, underground premises.  But in this number, the base rises above the ground more than others.  In addition, it is also more practically applicable.  The basement can accommodate both living rooms and utility rooms. </p><p>  What is the basement in the house?  We give a definition from SNiP.  The floor on which the floor mark is located below the design soil mark to a height of no more than 1/2 of the room. </p><p>  What is the basement in an apartment building?  The level is considered such if the upper part of the floors of its premises is located above the average design soil level by no more than 200 cm. </p><h2>  Cap Benefits </h2><p>  What is the ground floor in a residential building, we have installed.  Imagine its most visible advantages: </p><ul><li>  The possibility of increasing the useful area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building, which is permissible to use for various purposes. </li><li>  Rational placement of residential buildings.  For example, laundries, food storages, utility rooms, utility rooms, etc. are often designed in the basement. </li><li>  According to construction SNiPs on the basement, it is possible to place various equipment.  That is, use it as a technical one.  It is convenient for owners of country houses.  In the basement, for example, it is possible to place gas and heating equipment, rather than erecting a separate hozblok for it, occupying additional space on the site. </li><li>  The basement allows you to build a private house of greater number of storeys.  For example, according to Construction Norms and Regulations in the private sector it is unacceptable to erect residential buildings above 2 floors (including the attic).  Basement levels are not included in this prohibition - if they rise above the ground level by no more than 2 meters. </li><li>  In its area, the basement can be equal to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe house, or be greater than its first level.  In the second case, the overlap of the base is made exploited by the roof.  For example, in the case of suburban buildings on it you can build a terrace. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="stroyka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the number of storeys of a building" class="if uuid-3113894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113894.jpg"></div><h2>  Base Features </h2><p>  Ground floor.  What it is?  Photo clearly demonstrates.  As you can see in the image, there is not much difference between the basement of the basement and the basement.  The construction of a traditional strip foundation or the pouring of a monolithic reinforced slab is relevant here.  The sole of the base will be located below floor level. </p><p>  Ceiling, basement walls are erected from concrete, foundation blocks.  Their characteristics depend on the climatic conditions of the area, soil conditions.  So, if the substrate is dry, use hollow light blocks.  They retain heat well - in case the heating will be carried out in the basement.  But they need decoration and insulation with special insulation material. </p><p>  Basement premises must have ventilation products to ensure air circulation and to prevent the formation of condensate. </p><p>  When erecting basement levels, much attention is paid to structural strength.  Therefore, according to estimates, the construction of the basement sometimes comes out more expensive than several elevated floors. </p><p>  To save on waterproofing in this case is completely not worth it.  Moisture and dampness not only negatively affect the condition of building materials, but also lead to the formation of mold, which is harmful to the health of people living in the house.  To prevent the basement from being constantly affected by precipitation, builders make a blind area around the entire perimeter of the house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pogreb-podval.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is ground floor" class="if uuid-3113898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113898.jpg"></div><h2>  Base purpose </h2><p>  We have already noted that basement levels are universal.  Consider two of the most common applications: </p><ul><li>  Technical buildings.  Most often, a gas boiler room is arranged in the basement, since this is allowed by SNiP.  It can no longer be placed on the basement.  To save space in the basement, a garage is equipped.  But this is not the best option - the exhaust and other chemical odors from the car go up the ventilation shaft and disturb the residents of the house. </li><li>  Living spaces.  In socles (especially in country houses) living rooms are often located.  Someone uses this level for the pool, sports, games room.  But in order to use the floor for such purposes, you need to think carefully about its protection against moisture and temperature extremes.  Insulation work in this case is carried out from the outer part of the foundation.  Attractive options for the basement are baths, hammams, gyms, billiards, work rooms, children's rooms, bedrooms. </li></ul><h2>  Mezzanine level </h2><p>  What is the <span>mezzanine floor?</span>  These are relatively lightweight structures installed in rooms with high ceilings.  The goal is to increase the total usable area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building.  The second name of the mezzanine is the mezzanine, an intermediate floor. </p><p>  From the side, it can look either as a full second floor, or as a built-in internal balcony.  The arrangement of mezzanines must be taken care of either at the stage of construction of the building, or during the redevelopment of the premises. </p><p>  What is the mezzanine floor?  Definition: An additional level in a building with high ceilings.  It is recommended to install mezzanines in rooms with a height of about 5 meters.  For a compact mezzanine, 3 meters is enough.  Depending on the design, the mezzanines can withstand a load in the range of 100-200 kg / m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  The mezzanine floors are relevant in the following buildings: </p><ul><li>  Residential private houses. </li><li>  Lofts </li><li>  Cafe. </li><li>  Office rooms. </li><li>  Shopping centers. </li><li>  Industrial premises. </li></ul><p>  The characteristic features of the mezzanine: </p><ul><li>  The relatively small thickness of the floors. </li><li>  There is no need for insulation. </li><li>  Promotes the most useful use of building areas. </li></ul><p>  The mezzanine floor in a residential building can be used for the following purposes: </p><ul><li>  Rest zone. </li><li>  Sleeping area.  On the lower level it‚Äôs convenient to place a dressing room. </li><li>  Children's area.  On the mezzanine - a berth, on the lower level - a game. </li><li>  Personal account or personal library. </li></ul><p>  The height of the upper level here, as a rule, is greater than the height of the lower.  For a comfortable stay on the mezzanine, a window and a ventilation duct are installed in this space.  The most successful heating system is underfloor heating.  With conventional central heating, it will always be hot, stuffy on the upper level, and colder on the lower level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pulseorplug.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is floor" class="if uuid-3113887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3113887.jpg"></div><p>  Floor is a very common concept.  It can be above ground, basement, technical, mezzanine or basement.  Each of these varieties has its own requirements for SNiPs.  In addition, the number of storeys is one of the most important characteristics of various buildings. </p>
