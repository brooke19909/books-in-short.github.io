During this period, the summer unbearable heat, which is characteristic of this region, begins to slowly subside.  The air remains warm, like the water in the Red Sea, but the feeling of heat and stuffiness disappears.  It is during this period that it is best to come to one of the most famous resorts in the country in order to sunbathe, enjoy the outgoing summer and the warm turquoise sea. </p><h2>  Briefly about degrees </h2><p>  Since the main topic of discussion at our place is <span>Egypt in September, the weather,</span> prices for accommodation and meals, as well as other opportunities for recreation, we will consider in more detail each of these aspects.  On the west coast of the Red Sea, where almost all the major resorts of the country are concentrated, in the afternoon the air heats up to 38 degrees.  At night, the column drops to 24-27, which prevents the earth from completely cooling down.  During this period, you will not need warm clothes, since, in fact, there is no night cool.  In turn, the sea can please tourists with water heated to 28 degrees.  On some days, the Red Sea becomes even warmer, which is important for ordinary vacationers and divers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="September in Egypt" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475474.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  September vouchers: pricing policy </h2><p>  As you can see, the velvet <span>season in Egypt</span> really lives up to its name.  Weather conditions during this period become milder and more gentle than in July and August, but prices for holidays and accommodation rise.  As a rule, September in Egypt is spent by tourists from Europe or divers who rarely spare money for their vacation.  It is also worth noting that this month there are extremely few children due to the fact that the school year begins.  Many hotels are reducing the services of children's rooms and nannies.  Therefore, if you are going to go to Egypt with the kids, arrange in advance with a tour operator that you can provide all the necessary services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt in september weather prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475472.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to do during the holidays? </h2><p>  Perhaps many do not know or simply forgot that September in Egypt is the most suitable time to carry out a motorcycle safari.  This is one of the most popular excursions at this time, the final destination of which is the Bedouin village.  The whole essence of the trip at the beginning of autumn is that there is no big gap between the day and night air temperatures.  As a rule, an excursion group leaves for the desert in the afternoon, so that in the evening you can see a stunning sunset over the wild endless sands.  If you go on such a trip in the winter, you will have to come back, banging your teeth, and in the summer the heat exhausts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt in September Hurghada" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475473.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Drive and Fun in Egypt </h2><p>  If you tolerate the heat well, then you can go to one of the country's most exciting entertainment - the Rally of the Pharaohs.  September in Egypt is considered the beginning of the racing season, which is held in the heart of the country - at the pyramids of Giza.  It is from here that motorsportsmen start to drive off-road ATVs.  Raising a tall column of dust and sand, they set off for the deserted distance of Egypt, overcoming 3000 kilometers.  Of course, lovers of excitement always bet on cars or athletes, and you can, if you wish, take part in this event. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharm El Sheikh in September" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475475.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hurghada - a deserted and hot paradise </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this resort is located on the seashore, in its climate and weather at the beginning of autumn it is exactly the same as the whole of Egypt in September.  Hurghada is an extremely arid region; in the first autumn month, not a drop of rain may fall.  The average daily temperature here is considered to be a mark of 37 degrees above zero, but most often the column rises close to 40 degrees.  As for the night time, the coolness here is extremely rare.  If the thermometer will show 25 - consider that a miracle happened.  On average, the night temperature does not fall below 28. But such weather in the region has its advantages.  Due to the fact that the sun does not get tired to warm Hurghada, the coast of the Red Sea, which adjoins it, is always warm - 27-30 degrees. </p><h2>  Eastern heat of the Sinai Peninsula </h2><p>  Another resort favorite by all tourists - Sharm El Sheikh - is located on the <span>Sinai Peninsula</span> and is washed by the sea from all sides.  But, as you already understood, Egypt is a country of paradoxes, and therefore in this region the amount of precipitation is also minimal.  Sharm el Sheikh in September becomes even hotter than Hurghada, even more arid and sultry.  During the day, the thermometer rolls over 40, at night the column does not drop below 30. Water in the sea is fresh milk, which reaches a temperature of 31 degrees and above.  Here the swimming season is open year round, because many tourists believe that September is not the best time to visit this resort.  However, if you still went to Egypt in early autumn, it is best to go diving here and see the stunning beauty of the underwater world, huge corals and unique fish. </p>
