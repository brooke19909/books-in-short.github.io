Customer reviews indicate that this problem was not spared and this model.  One has only to deviate from the perpendicular, as the picture begins to distort.  Color rendering also leaves much to be desired.  Skin tones, colors of nature often look unnatural.  The result of the review of this model is a simple option for undemanding buyers, suitable for a garden or a summer residence.

    <h2>  Mystery MTV-4330LT2 TV </h2><p>  Mystery MTV-4330LT2 is a 43-inch TV with <span>a screen resolution of 1920x1080</span> pixels, LED backlight and stereo sound, which provide two speakers with a total power of 16 watts.  The viewing angle is 178 degrees, the frame refresh rate is 50 Hz. </p><h2>  Mystery MTV-4330LT2 Reviews </h2><p>  Obviously, the lineup of this company is not limited to compact models for the kitchen.  On the stands of stores, you can easily find widescreen Mystery LCD TVs.  Reviews about them are similar to similar models of smaller diagonals.  Very simple, most often without new-fangled features, such as an Internet connection or 3D image, providing minimal needs - watching movies and TV shows. </p><p>  The HDMI connector allows you to watch movies from a PC using the Mystery MTV-4330LT2 as a monitor, and the USB input allows you to read files from a flash card.  The disadvantages of this model are the same as those of other Mystery TVs.  Reviews indicate that in dynamic scenes, picture quality and color reproduction suffer.  There is not enough viewing angle - when you deviate from the center of the screen, the picture begins to distort.  The sound quality also leaves much to be desired - noise, interference, insufficient volume. </p><h2>  How to set up a Mystery TV? </h2><p>  Very often in the reviews there are complaints about the complexity of tuning the TV to digital channels.  Some buyers, after a series of fruitless attempts, even begin to consider their equipment malfunctioning.  Before you set up your Mystery TV, make sure that the selected model supports the DVB-T / T2 and DVB-C standards, and that digital signals are transmitted in your area. </p><p>  The first time you turn it on, the setup goes in several stages: </p><ol><li>  When the "Setup Wizard" appears, you need to select the menu language. </li><li>  The type of antenna is set: DVB-C (cable) or DVB-T / T2 (terrestrial). </li><li>  After selecting the type of antenna, the channel search will begin.  After a while, the number of programs found will be displayed on the screen. </li><li>  At the next stage, choose the type of connection to the Internet.  If communication will be via an HDMI cable, select ‚ÄúWired‚Äù, if via Wi-Fi - ‚ÄúWireless‚Äù. </li><li>  Subsequent configuration is carried out taking into account the information of the provider and data from the router. </li><li>  When the setup phase is completed, the TV will be ready to go. </li></ol><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The assessment of experts from the opinions of customers is not particularly different about Mystery MTV televisions.  Reviews indicate that this is a technique with a minimum set of functions and capabilities, fully consistent with its price category.  It is impossible to say unequivocally that TVs of this brand are returned to retail outlets more often than others.  However, they do not differ in exceptional reliability.  The strengths of Mystery TVs include their low price and a variety of models (not only in terms of specifications, but also in design and color of cases).  The weak ones are image quality, including color reproduction and picture clarity, as well as sound quality. </p>
