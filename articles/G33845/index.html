    <h2>  Method 1. Brownie for luck and wealth </h2><p>  If the hostess wants to figure out how to make a <span>home-</span> made do-it- <span>yourselfer,</span> then you need to clarify that the toys can be completely different.  Now we‚Äôll tell you how to make this small creature quite simply and quickly from inexpensive materials.  By the way, in this embodiment, even a sewing machine is not needed.  So, you need to stock up on burlap (this will be the basis of grandfather), thread on burlap (to create handles), tow for hair, synthetic winterizer (for stuffing), as well as all sorts of little things: eyes, nose, cereals, dummies of berries, vegetables and fruits for decoration . </p><h2>  Getting started: preparing the basics </h2><p>  So, where to start, if you need to understand how to make a <span>home-</span> made do-it- <span>yourself?</span>  First of all, you need to make a bag of burlap, which will be the body of a home guard.  Size can be chosen at your discretion, depending on desire.  You need to take a piece of material twice as long as necessary (it is also important to remember that you need allowances for seams), fold it in half and stitch it on the sides from the inside, and leave the top open for filling.  Also, first you need to weave handles from burlap threads to the home.  This is easy to do: weaving can even be in the form of an ordinary pigtail.  It is important not to forget to fix such a braid around the edges so that it does not roll and does not burst.  The product is threaded into the bag in the middle (just pushing its threads on the sides, it is quite easy to do it in the burlap), holes are made on both sides next to the seam.  These will be the pens of the grandfather guard.  Next, the product is stuffed with padding polyester and a basting seam is sewn along the top.  The foundation is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Make hair </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself little house" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/375095.jpg?1397560803380" width="340"></div></h2><p>  We go further, figuring out how to make a house-block with your own hands.  Now you need to prepare grandfather's hair (as well as a mustache).  It is necessary to take a tow of the desired length (by hair level) and calculate the width.  For this, it is only necessary to measure the diameter of the finished base, because the hair will be attached around the crown.  If the tow is ready, it must be stitched so that the hair does not fall apart.  This can be done both manually and on a sewing machine.  To do this, under the hair, where the line will go, attach a narrow braid and sew with a wide step.  It remains only to highlight the bangs of the brownie, cutting it a little.  The product is sewn around the crown on the base.  To make a mustache, you just need to take a tow of the desired length and bandage it in the center with a thin thread.  Mustache is ready! </p><h2>  Brownie legs </h2><p>  We understand further how to make a do-it-yourself house.  Now you need to create the legs of the guard.  To do this, stock up on small bast shoes (they can be tied on their own or bought).  Next, you need to make two bags according to the size of the shoe (on the basis of the principle), which are also stuffed with synthetic winterizer and sewn on top.  That's all, the legs are ready. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself kuzya do-it-yourself" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/375092.jpg?1397560860169" width="340"></div></h2><h2>  Assembly parts </h2><p>  Now you need to collect all the details in a heap and make a brownie.  To do this, you need to glue the nose and eyes on the base, sew on a mustache, put on a hat (make it easy from the same burlap in the form of a cap).  You can also create three or four small bags that are filled with cereals (brownie for wealth).  It is easy to make them, as well as the base, however, you do not need to tie or sew on top, they will be open and fit behind the brownie.  You also need to sew bast shoes to the base.  Now you can decorate your grandfather at your discretion with vegetables and fruits.  The product is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Thread Brownie </h2><p>  You can create a simple little house from threads with your own hands.  To do this, you need multi-colored yarn and nothing more.  The toy will be quite simple and straightforward.  To do this, you need to take the threads of the required length (two times longer than the desired product), bend them in half - this will be the basis of the doll.  First of all, the head is created: you need to tie the finished base with a thread, stepping back a little from above, then the body stands out according to the same principle.  To make legs, you need to divide the remaining base in half and tie each individual leg with thread on the bottom.  Hands are created from yarn separately: you need to take the length immediately into two hands (given that they will pass in the middle of the body) and tie it around the edges with threads.  Ready-made pens are threaded into the base in the chest area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe doll, this will be quite simple.  Now, to make the toy look like a brownie, you can attach a mustache or a beard from the threads, as well as insert a bag into your hands.  Mustache and beard are made according to the same principle: the thread is simply tied in the center, the product is inserted into the face to the desired height, skipping just one thread in advance.  Making a sack is just as easy, you need to bend the threads in half and tie them on top, leaving a small tail.  And that‚Äôs all - a home made of threads, created with your own hands, is ready! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY toy house" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/375097.jpg?1397560841968" width="227"></div></h2><h2>  Brownie Kuzya </h2><p>  You can also create a Kuzya domino (toy) with your own hands.  That's just for this you need some skill, as well as the presence of a sewing machine at home.  First you need to cut out all the details for the doll and fabric.  You will need: five parts in the form of a petal (for the head), one round part for the nose, for pens you need four parts with a bent thumb, and you also need four longer parts for the legs.  The body is cut out in the form of a wide bottle with a low neck (two parts).  When all the pieces are cut out, they will need to be sewn in pairs from the wrong side, then twisted.  The head is sewn from five parts, which are attached to each other in turn.  The nose is just stuffed with a synthetic winterizer and sewn in a circle, creating such a potato.  Other doll body parts are also filled with syntepon.  This is almost a ready-made little house (toy).  With their own hands, that is, not using a sewing machine, the parts are sewn to each other with a neat seam.  You can sew on the head or leave it for now, because you will have to work on it a bit.  You can make a doll's face in different ways: draw, paste ready-made eyes, a mouth and a nose, which can be bought at any needlework store.  The main thing is that the housekeeper looks kind, this is a positive character. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself house-keeper" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/375093.jpg?1397560819615" width="495"></div></h2><p>  What else should a Kuzya housekeeper have?  Do it yourself need to sew clothes.  This can be a blouse and pants, as well as a simple dressing gown - at your discretion.  However, the cartoon hero wore a long shirt and pants.  To do this, take the fabric (from Kuzi from the cartoon of the shirt it was red) and sew something like a baby's undershirt, without detachable sleeves, with just two parts and a hem on the neck.  Pants are also easy to make for a doll: cut out two parts, sew them and attach an elastic band on the top so that the product does not fall off the doll.  That‚Äôs all you need to do if you want Kuzya‚Äôs house to be created.  To make such a toy with your own hands is not difficult at all, all readers of the article could be convinced of this. </p>
