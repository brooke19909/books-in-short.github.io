  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the MTS Promised Payment? How to activate the service?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It happens that the money on the phone is already over, and you need to stretch a couple of days before your salary.  Fortunately, MTS is sympathetic to such situations and offers its customers the “Promised Payment” service.  Now you can intercept money on the phone to paycheck directly from your operator. </p><h2>  How much can I borrow? </h2><p>  You set the amount of the “promised payment” yourself, but there are certain limits for this too.  They depend on your monthly communication costs.  If per month they are less than 300 rubles, then the amount up to 200 rubles will be available to you.  Spend up to 500 rub.  - You can ask for a loan of up to 400 rubles.  And in order to get the maximum “promised payment” - 800 rubles, you need to spend at least 501 rubles per month on communication.  But the promised payment is 50 rubles.  It will always be available to you, if only the balance of your phone is positive. </p><h2>  How much will I pay for this service? </h2><p>  A fee is assumed for using the service, it will be debited from the account along with the returned “promised payment”.  Its size depends on the amount by which you replenish the account.  The following information will help you understand the amount of money that you can borrow, and the commission that you will have to pay to use the service: </p><ul><li>  "Promised payment" up to 30 rubles.  provided free of charge. </li><li>  For 31-99 rubles.  "Promised payment" will be charged 7 rubles. </li><li>  For 100-199 - a fee of 10 rubles is provided. </li><li>  For 200-499 - 25 rubles. </li><li>  More than 500 - 50 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  How and when to return money for a “promised payment”? </h2><p>  In order to avoid blocking, you will have to return an amount in excess of the “promised payment” to the account within 3 days, along with a fee for using the service. </p><p>  Suppose you took a “promised payment” of 250 rubles.  Then you need to return: 250 (“promised payment”) +25 (fee for using the service) = 275 rubles.  That is, if before connecting the service you had -10 rubles in your account, then after replenishment by 275 rubles, you will have -10 rubles on your balance sheet. </p><h2>  Why is the service not connecting? </h2><ul><li>  You have already gone into minus by more than 30 rubles. </li><li>  Your tariff plan is “Your country” or “Basic 092013”, or “Guest”, or “MTS iPad”, on which the “Promised payment” is not valid. </li><li>  You use the service “Credit” or “On full trust”. </li><li>  The Promised Payment has already been connected. </li></ul><p>  There are no other reasons for not providing the service, and there cannot be, if you still cannot borrow money, then look for the reason from the above options. </p><h2>  How to get the “MTS Promised Payment”? </h2><p>  To <noindex>  <span>take the promised payment on MTS</span> </noindex>  You need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  From the phone: dial * 111 * 123 # and press the call button. </li><li>  From the phone: call 1113. </li><li>  From a computer: through the Internet assistant, go to the "Payment" section and select "Promised payment", then follow the instructions. </li></ul><h2>  How to disable the "Promised payment" service? </h2><p>  MTS Promised Payment is a one-time service, you do not need to disable it.  It is in active status only when you have a valid “promised payment”.  They returned the payment - the service ended.  Therefore, you can not worry about the fact that additional funds will be charged from you to maintain this service. </p></div></article>
