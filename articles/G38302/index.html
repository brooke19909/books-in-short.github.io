  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tuebingen (Germany): attractions, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  T√ºbingen (Germany) is an ancient city where today one third of the population is made up of students from the local Eberhard-Karl University.  In the cultural center and one of the most picturesque areas in the south of Germany there are a large number of ancient buildings, churches, palaces and castles.  Some hotels in T√ºbingen (Germany) are located in historic buildings.  For walks, picturesque alleys are perfectly suited, here you can drink real German beer with sausages, and in October participate in rubber duck races. </p><h2>  Bebenhausen Abbey </h2><p>  Four kilometers from T√ºbingen (Germany) is the Bebenhausen Palace.  The abbey of the Order of the Cistericians was founded in this place at the end of the twelfth century on the initiative of the palatine of the T√ºbingen Rudolph.  During the Reformation, Ulrich W√ºrttemberg dissolved the monastery, and a humanitarian Protestant school was opened in the empty building.  In 1889, the monks from Schoenau settled here, who supplied meat, fish and wine to neighboring cities.  They tripled the inner garden where medicinal plants were grown. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kloster-bebenhausen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abbey in Tubigen" class="if uuid-2544149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544149.jpg"></div><h2>  Gelderlin Tower </h2><p>  This is one of the main attractions of T√ºbingen (Germany).  The tower is located on the peninsula, at the confluence of the rivers Neckar and Ammer.  A long-lived nineteenth-century German poet and poet Johann Christian Friedrich Gelderlin, who was recognized as a madman, lived and worked here.  In the thirtieth year of his life, a dementia falls upon a poet (already dreamy, melanchonic, too sensitive).  He spent the rest of his life (over forty years) in T√ºbingen, settling in a tower.  It was here that Johann Gelderlin wrote most of his poems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hoentubigen Castle </h2><p>  In the central part of the city of T√ºbingen (Germany) is a castle, which is also known as Schlossberg, or Mountain Castle.  According to preserved historical sources, it was built at the end of the eleventh century, served as a military fortress, from which only a corner tower has survived to this day.  In the middle of the fourteenth century, the castle was sold to the mugraphs of the W√ºrttemberg dynasty, which greatly expanded the territory.  The huge gate, built in the first decade of the seventeenth century, and now adorns the family coat of arms of the W√ºrttemberg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="footage.framepool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoentubigen Castle" class="if uuid-2544155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544155.jpg"></div><p>  After the building was reconstructed, and in the middle of the eighteenth century, part of the castle passed into the ownership of the University of T√ºbingen.  At the beginning of the next century, the university already owned the entire territory.  At that time, there was a library of 60 thousand volumes, a chemical laboratory and an astronomical observatory.  Today, the castle houses several faculties, a museum and a giant wine barrel, in the cellar of which lives a huge colony of bats. </p><h2>  Wilhelmstrasse street </h2><p>  The old street begins in the old part of the city, it houses the Botanical Garden, the new hall of the local university and the library, an old building with figures carved from the mammoth tusk (some exhibits of this mini-museum are more than 27 thousand years old).  It is definitely worth a visit to the University.  Karl Euernard, which was founded in the fifteenth century.  The planetarium is always open for curious visitors, the Church of St. George is of interest, around which there are statues of noble persons and princes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wilhelmstrasse street" class="if uuid-2544157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544157.jpg"></div><h2>  Old Market Square </h2><p>  At the Market Square (T√ºbingen, Germany) many excursion programs begin.  There are half-timbered houses around, and the main decoration is the Neptune Fountain.

On the facade of the Town Hall, an astronomical clock has been preserved.  Nearby is Kornhaus - one of the architectural masterpieces of T√ºbingen.  Once upon a time, the building was used as a granary, and now a historical museum is open there. </p><h2>  Hohenzollern Castle </h2><p>  This is truly a fabulous place.  The fortress is located high in the mountains, so it seems that the tops of the towers abut the sky.  The first mention of the castle dates back to the middle of the thirteenth century, but scholars suggest that it was built even earlier - around the eleventh century.  The ‚Äúcastle in the clouds‚Äù remained the same as it was before.  The fortress always belonged to <span>the Hohenzollern dynasty.</span>  The palace was practically not used as a residence, only in the middle of the last century it became the home of the last Prussian prince when German troops occupied his estate in Brandenburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hohenzollern Castle" class="if uuid-2544158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544158.jpg"></div><h2>  Neckarbrucke Bridge </h2><p>  The Neckarbr√ºcke Bridge is a favorite place for walking among guests and residents of the city of T√ºbingen (Germany).
