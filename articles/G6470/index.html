Among them is Sberbank, which allows you to send money not only within the country, but also abroad.  The Bank offers its customers several rates, from which you can choose the most suitable.  In order to know all the nuances of the service, it is necessary to study the features of transfers through Sberbank of funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank transfer via phone" class="if uuid-3205971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3205971.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of translations </h2><p>  The bank offers two types of transfers: </p><ol><li>  From deposit to deposit.  The recipient may use all or part of the funds. </li><li>  Without a bank account.  The bank simply sends the money to the recipient. </li></ol><p>  If transfers through Sberbank are made using a fixed-term deposit, then it must first be closed.  If the time for returning the deposit has not yet arrived, then there is a possibility of loss of interest.  Through Sberbank, transfers can be made in various ways. </p><p>  The simplest of these is a personal appeal to a bank branch, but since Internet technologies are developing rapidly, the proposed method is becoming less and less popular.  Even if the bank‚Äôs customers turn to the operators for this reason, they are asked to make a transfer using the terminal.  Nevertheless, the client always has the opportunity to make a money transfer through Sberbank by contacting the cashier.  To do this, you must provide a card number and passport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.riamoneytransfer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank transfer via SMS" class="if uuid-3205966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3205966.jpg"></div><h2>  Currency and amount </h2><p>  Regular transfers through Sberbank are carried out in Russian currency, the amount may be unlimited.  The maximum departure time is 2 days.  The cost of such a service is 1.75% if the funds are transferred to another city.  The bank also offers the ability to transfer money from its own accounts.  In this case, the commission will be 1.5%, and the currency may be different - euros, dollars, rubles. </p><p>  There is also a quick translation of Hummingbird from Sberbank.  In this case, the recipient will be able to withdraw money in 10 minutes.  The maximum in this case can be transferred up to 500 thousand rubles, and only in rubles.  Informing via SMS is free of charge.  It will take 1.5% to pay for such a transfer. </p><h2>  ATM use </h2><p>  It is convenient to make money transfers via Sberbank card using the terminals.  Funds are transferred to the card, which allows you to perform an operation from any ATM.  In this case, it is not necessary to search for a special payment terminal, since you can deposit cash using a conventional banking device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="corporate.intergate-immigration.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfers via Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3205965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3205965.jpg"></div><p>  Almost all ATMs of this financial institution have a transfer function through Sberbank.  Only the recipient's card number is required.  After entering the security code, the following actions should be performed: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Go to the section of transfers and payments. </li><li>  Select a transfer function. </li><li>  In the window that appears, enter the card number of the person to whose address the funds will be transferred. </li></ol><p>  After entering the data, they must be double-checked so that the money goes as intended.  Then confirm your actions with the appropriate button.  ATMs issue a check after each operation, it is recommended to keep it until the moment the money arrives.  This usually happens almost instantly. </p><h2>  Using Internet Banking </h2><p>  Despite the fact that using terminals and ATMs to transfer money is a very convenient way, there is another, more comfortable method.  This is the use of online banking, such a transfer via phone is possible.  Sberbank allows you to transfer money between cards.  To connect the service, if this was not done before, you can use an ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer to a Sberbank card via phone" class="if uuid-3205975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3205975.jpg"></div><p>  To use the service, only the recipient‚Äôs plastic number is required.  To begin with, you will need to log in to your account using your username and password.  Then the actions should be performed in the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  Go to the section of transfers and payments. </li><li>  Choose a team to transfer money to a client of Sberbank. </li><li>  Among the possible options, find the option of transferring to a card. </li><li>  Enter the recipient's card number in the appropriate column and confirm their actions by pressing the appropriate button. </li><li>  Then a form will open in which you can double-check the entered information and confirm it. </li><li>  An SMS will be sent to the phone containing a one-time password.  It will need to be entered in the appropriate window to confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  After that, the operation can be considered completed.  Each client has the ability to save the template.  It will make it possible to further reduce the time required to complete a similar transfer to the same recipient.  We will find out below whether a transfer from Sberbank is possible via SMS. </p><h2>  Using a mobile bank </h2><p>  If a client has Sberbank Online internet banking service activated, then it means that there is also a mobile banking service.  It allows you to transfer to Sberbank cards via phone.  But, it is worth noting that the recipient must also have this service activated.  To complete a transfer from Sberbank via SMS, actions must be performed in the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  Create an SMS message that will contain the command "TRANSFER", and then the recipient's phone number and the amount of funds to be sent, separated by spaces. </li><li>  Send the created command to service number 900. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bashinform.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money transfer through sberbank" class="if uuid-3205972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3205972.jpg"></div><h2>  Making transfers to accounts of other banks </h2><p>  In this case, the procedure for performing the operation is somewhat different, a little more complicated.  Sending money from a card issued by one bank to a card issued by another bank is considered an interbank transfer.  Money can be sent using the Internet banking service, which is convenient and simple for conducting financial transactions. </p><p>  To make a transfer through Sberbank, you will need not the plastic number, but the details of the account opened with another bank.  It is important to carefully enter all data and verify it.  As a rule, money transfer takes 3 days. </p><p>  Another bank account can also be replenished using intermediaries - electronic wallets: WebMoney, Yandex.Money or Qiwi.  First you have to replenish your own account using an ATM or Internet banking service.  Funds arrive quickly - in just 5-10 minutes.  After that, it will be necessary to transfer money to any system from the personal account of the payment system. </p><h2>  Transferring Out of Country </h2><p>  If you want to send money to an individual who is abroad, then you can also use the services of Sberbank.  Funds will be credited to the account, card or issued in cash.  The bank offers its customers the opportunity to make an urgent transfer of Hummingbirds.  In this case, you will need to open an account.  The service extends to Kazakhstan and Belarus.  In Sberbank, funds can not only be sent, but also received.  Each of the parties to the transaction - both the recipient and the sender - will pay 1% of the transfer amount.  It will be possible to receive the transfer in an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer to card" class="if uuid-3205978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3205978.jpg"></div><h2>  Moneygram </h2><p>  To transfer finances to another country, a banking institution provides a service such as MoneyGram transfer.  In this case, opening an account will also be required.  You can send funds to 190 countries, and their receipt is possible after 10 minutes.  There is a cancellation service until the transfer is requested by the recipient.  You can send dollars, receive dollars and euros. </p><p>  In addition, there is an international cash transfer.  Execution in this case will take 2 days, and you will have to pay 5% for the service. </p><p>  Thus, Sberbank offers its customers many options for sending money.  Each of them is convenient in its own way, all that is needed is just to choose the most comfortable one. </p>
