    <p>  The administration is fluent in Russian.  If you do not book in advance, you will have to be content with what you provide.  The best apartments are located on the upper floors, but they are almost always busy.  At the reception they offer to settle in the rooms on the ground floor.  But not everything is so scary.  Some vacationers do not even want to change anything and remain in those rooms where they were originally settled. </p><p>  At the reception you can change money.  But the course is constantly changing.  Some administrators are not very honest.  They may not give change and refuse to issue a check because of this.  The latter is needed if you decide to exchange money back for dollars upon departure.  But it‚Äôs also not easy to do, so it‚Äôs better to spend it all.  Moreover, in Tunisia there is something to buy. </p><p>  The Internet normally catches only at the reception.  But when there are a lot of people, entering it is simply impossible. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  Some of the standard rooms located on the ground floor have scenic views of the garden and pool.  But there are only a few.  The windows of the rest overlook the fence and hotel grounds.  The rooms are equipped with beds, old TVs, bedside tables, a desk, a mirror, a bathroom and a balcony.  Minor disadvantages are problems with lighting and a small bathroom. </p><p>  Towels are changed often, but they are almost all washed, and sometimes with holes.  The newest ones were for legs.  The furniture in the room is also old, but nevertheless it does not affect the comfort. </p><p>  Food cannot be left in the room, as flocks of ants immediately rush onto it.  Especially a lot of large insects on the balcony.  Among the disadvantages of living on the ground floor, it can be noted that at night it is very noisy, since the music by the pool sounds almost all night. </p><p>  Superior rooms are a bit newer.  The windows overlook the fence and garden.  Cars often drive behind the fence, which makes the room noisy.  For small tips, the staff performs daily cleaning efficiently and changes bed linen every two days.  Some maids even decorate the room with flowers.  Of the toiletries provide soap, shower gel. </p><p>  Valuable items in the room is better not to leave.  Maids are different.  There have been cases of theft. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel restaurant is very spacious.  Despite the huge number of guests, there are always free tables.  Three meals a day on the all-inclusive system.  Breakfast consists of sweet pastries (rolls, croissants, muffins), jam, a variety of dishes from eggs, cheese and sausages, vegetables, a variety of cereals, breakfast cereals with milk, fruits and hot drinks.  Every day, dishes are repeated.  For lunch and dinner, meat and fish dishes, all kinds of side dishes and casseroles, stewed vegetables, soups, spaghetti with sauce, pizza, salads, all kinds of cakes, puddings and cookies, assorted fruits are offered.  Of the drinks, mainly Coca-Cola products. </p><p>  In general, it is worth noting that they are very well fed at the Smartline Miramar Petit Palais 3 * hotel. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  The beach area is a five minute walk.  The road is not very picturesque, sometimes odors are heard.  But walking with a child is very convenient.  The beach is equipped with sun loungers, umbrellas.  Everyone can use it for free.  In season, you need to take places on the beach in advance, there are a lot of people.  But sunbeds and mattresses are enough for everyone.  The beach is sandy.  The coastline is constantly changing.  It all depends on the tides.  Sometimes it brings seaweed to the shore.  The beach is rarely cleaned, but you can go swimming in the neighboring 4-5 star hotels.  There the beach area is cleaned every day. </p><p>  There is a restaurant on the shore.  Also on the beach constantly carry fruit.  Various water activities are offered. </p><p>  In the sea you can often see various inhabitants.  These are mainly jellyfish in a wide variety of colors and small crabs.  Camels sometimes walk along the beach.  They can be ironed and photographed. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>
