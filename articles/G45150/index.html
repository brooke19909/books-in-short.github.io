    <h2>  Device niches </h2><p>  The MX4 device a year ago, of course, was the flagship solution of this manufacturer.  Now it is a typical representative of the middle price range.  Yes, its hardware and software components have not lost their relevance, but more productive devices of the latest generation have appeared on the market, which are more expensive, and much better in performance.  Therefore, the MX4 is a mid-range phone with the attributes of a premium device.  The smartphone <span>Meizu M2 Note is</span> also oriented to the same niche <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> indicate this.  Its cost is lower, but the hardware components are clearly weaker than last year's flagship.  But the diagonal of the display is slightly larger. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The delivery package for devices of this manufacturer is identical, regardless of the niche of the gadget.  Meizu smartphone cannot stand out with something unusual in this regard.  Reviews indicate the presence of such components and accessories: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  A smartphone with an integrated battery. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Interface cord. </li><li>  Stereo headset economy class. </li><li>  Operation manual with warranty card. </li><li>  A clip for removing the SIM card slot. </li></ul>

    <p>  This list is clearly not enough cover and protective film.  They will have to be purchased by the new owner for an additional fee.  Identical package for the M2 Note.  The list lacks the same accessories as in the MX4.  In addition, this list is missing an external drive.  Again, all this will have to be bought separately and, of course, for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Smartphone Meizu MX4 in appearance is very similar to the latest generation iPhone: rounded shapes, slim body and only one button for control.  The second representative of this review - M2 Note can boast exactly the same thing.  Most of the front panel of each of these devices is occupied by the screen.  The MX4 has a diagonal of 5.36 inches, and the M2 Note - 5.5.  Under the display there is only one button for control, and above it there is a speaker, sensors and a front camera.  The arrangement of controls on the side faces of these devices is slightly different.  On the MX4, the lock button is located on its upper edge, and the swing for adjusting the volume is on the left side.  In turn, on the M2 Note, all these buttons are grouped on its left side, which allows you to control this device only with the fingers of one hand.  The 3.5 mm port for each of these models is displayed the same way - on the upper edge.  But the micro-USB is located at the bottom of the gadget.  From an ergonomic point of view, the M2 Note looks a little better, in which the mechanical controls are advantageously grouped on one of its sides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Computational Capabilities </h2><p>  The Meizu Mx4 smartphone uses the MediaTech MT6595 chip as a computing platform.  It consists of 4 cores of the Cortex A17 architecture, which can accelerate to 2.2 GHz in the highest load mode, and 4 Cortex A7 computing modules, which can operate at a frequency of 1.7 GHz for maximum calculations.  It should also be noted that these two computing clusters operate alternately.  When solving the most demanding tasks, A17 kernels are in operation, if the load level decreases to medium or low, the device automatically switches to the A7 core module immediately.  If in the process of working to solve the problem there are enough fewer modules than 4, then idle computing resources are disabled.  This is true both for modules based on the "A17" architecture, and for the "A7".  All this in total allows you to combine both energy efficiency and a high level of productivity.  As a result, the MX4 can easily solve almost all tasks today. </p>

    <p>  The only exception in this case is software, which requires support for 64-bit computing.  Alas, this computing platform for solving such problems is not intended.  A more recent CPU is used in the M2 Note.  More specifically, this is MT6753.  It includes 8 computing cores that can be simultaneously in operation.  They are based on a more progressive architecture, codenamed "Cortex A53."  The clock frequency of each of them in the highest load mode rises to 1.3 GHz.  There is also support for 64-bit computing.  From a performance standpoint, the MX4 looks better, but if support for the latest software is needed, then the M2 Note will be preferable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display and graphics adapter </h2><p>  The review of Meizu smartphones of these two models from the point of view of graphic accelerators indicates that in this regard they have almost the same level of performance.  The Mx4 is equipped with the PowerVR G6200MP4 video accelerator, which can produce 64 Gflops.  But the Mali-T720MP3, installed in the M2 Note, boasts 60 Gflops.  The MX4 has a 5.36-inch display diagonal with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1152, and the M2 Note has a 5.5 with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080.  The pixel density is slightly higher for the first device, and the diagonal for the second.  Whatever it was, but from the position of the graphics adapter and the screen, these devices are almost equal to each other. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Smartphone Meizu MX4 is equipped with a very high-quality main camera.  She has a sensitive element of Sony production at 20.7 megapixels.  It also implements technologies such as autofocus, digital zoom, image stabilization, face recognition and touch focus.  For taking pictures with a lack of lighting, this camera is equipped with a second LED backlight.  The quality of the photo is excellent.  This camera can record video in 2160 r format with an update of 30 frames per second.  The front camera has a 2 megapixel touch element.  This is quite enough for video calls and for the average level of "selfie".  The more modest main camera in the M2 Note: it has a sensor of only 13 megapixels.  There is autofocus technology and a single LED backlight.  The front camera sensor is already 5 megapixels.  Accordingly, the "selfie" in this case is already an order of magnitude better.  Well, there are no problems with making video calls.  But still, from the position of obtaining high-quality photos and videos, MX4 looks preferable among these two gadgets.  His main camera is much better. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Smartphone Meizu model MX4 boasts the presence of 2 GB of RAM.  The same is in the M2 Note.  In the first model, the capacity of the integrated drive can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  But in M2 Note, the capacity of the built-in information storage can be 16 GB or 32 GB.  That is, a version with 64 GB does not exist.  But even 16 GB for comfortable work today is enough.  One of the key shortcomings of the MX4 is the lack of a slot for installing a flash card.  But the owners of M2 Note will have to make a choice: either we install a SIM card of the second mobile operator, or an external drive, the maximum memory capacity of which can be 128 GB.  From the perspective of the possibility of information recovery, it is optimal to use cloud services.  For example, on the same Yandex-drive you can store photos, videos, phone numbers, books, music and other information that is most important to you.  If for some reason the smartphone stops working or is stolen from you, then the most valuable data will not be lost.  Otherwise, the memory subsystem of the MX4 and M2 Note is approximately the same. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  A review of the Meizu M2 Note smartphone indicates that it does not understand the case.  Accordingly, his battery is not removable.  On the one hand, this significantly improves the build quality of the case.  But, on the other hand, the repair of Meizu smartphones of this model is complicated several times.  The capacity of the complete battery in the M2 Note is 3100 mAh.  We add to this a 5.5-inch screen diagonal with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 and an 8-core processor that cannot boast of a high level of energy efficiency, and we get 1 day of battery life with an average level of load on the device.  In turn, the battery capacity of the MX4 is the same 3100 mAh.  At the same time, the diagonal of the screen is slightly smaller (5.36 inches), but with a higher resolution - 1920x1152, and a more energy-efficient central processor.  All this allows in a similar mode to stretch for 1.5-2 days.  Therefore, from the standpoint of autonomy, it is MX4 that looks preferable. </p><h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  Almost the same set of interfaces equipped with these smartphones Meizu.  Reviews often focus on this.  And the list of data exchange methods they have is as follows: </p><ul><li>  The main way to obtain information from the global web is Wai-Fi.  The list of supported standards for this wireless method of transmitting information on these gadgets is almost identical.  The only difference is that the MX4 boasts support for the newer and faster version of the Wi-Fi - ‚Äúac‚Äù.  But M2 Note does not support such networks. </li><li>  Both the first device and the second are equipped with a 4th generation Bluetooth transmitter. </li><li>  Both devices support LTE, GSM and 3G mobile networks. </li><li>  M2 Note in terms of navigation can only work with GPS.  But in MX4, in addition to GPS, GLONASS support is also implemented. </li><li>  But the list of wired interfaces on the MX4 and M2 Note is identical: micro-USB and, of course, a 3.5 mm audio jack. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Software component </h2><p>  Fairly outdated, as by today's standards, the version with serial number 4.4 of the Android operating system is installed on the MX4.  On top of it is installed a proprietary shell of this manufacturer - Flyme OS version 4.0.  Its interface has a lot in common with the latest modifications of iOS.  As noted earlier, instead of the usual control system of 3 buttons on this gadget there is only one.  Therefore, most operations are performed using gestures.  Shortcuts for all installed applications are placed on the desktop (there is no separate menu for this).  If necessary, you can group programs similar in purpose to a separate folder. </p>

    <p>  In terms of system software, the <span>Meizu M2 smartphone</span> looks much more interesting <span>.</span>  <span>The reviews</span> indicate the presence of the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version is already 5.0, and Flyme OS in this case will already be with the index 4.5.  As a result, in the latter case, you can install any application, including 64-bit.  The processor and system software allow this.  But with the most demanding toys in this case, there may be problems.  For example, in a toy called NOVA3, in some cases, the number of frames displayed per second decreases, and this extremely negatively affects the gameplay process itself. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The Meizu M2 smartphone with the Note prefix in the basic configuration (that is, with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory) is estimated at $ 170.  Its more advanced version with the same 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB ‚Äúon board‚Äù is estimated at $ 230.  There is no significant difference between them, and the amount of memory, if necessary, can be significantly increased (by a maximum of 128 GB) using a memory card (you will have to sacrifice a second SIM card).  The ‚Äúcheapest‚Äù version of the MX4 - in a gray case and with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage - is estimated at $ 265.  If you need this device with the same parameters and in a white case, you will have to increase this amount by another $ 20.  Well, a gold case will cost even more with the same device parameters - 300 dollars.  A more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù version of the MX4 with a larger 32GB integrated drive and a gray case costs $ 335.  $ 340 will cost the same, but in a white case.  A gold case with similar characteristics will cost $ 370.  The 64 GB version of the MX4 was released in a limited edition.  Finding it for sale is now no longer possible.  From the position of price, the M2 Note looks more affordable, but at the same time, its hardware resources are more modest. </p><h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  The owners of the Meizu MX4 smartphone have some complaints.  A review of reviews of it indicates possible problems with overheating and with reliability.  Such components as the main control button and the micro-USB port periodically fail.  All these issues are resolved only with the help of a service center.  If the device was purchased under an official guarantee, then there should be no problems with repair.  In this regard, the <span>Meizu M2 Note</span> smartphone looks much better <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> indicate his lack of previously mentioned shortcomings.  But the advantages of these devices are really many: </p><ul><li>  High build quality. </li><li>  Highly productive CPU. </li><li>  Well-organized memory subsystem. </li><li>  Large and bright screen. </li><li>  High quality photos and videos obtained with the main cameras. </li></ul>

    <h2>  And what do we end up with? </h2><p>  The Meizu MX4 smartphone, although released much earlier and costs more, looks preferable in terms of purchase.  This is facilitated by a number of factors: a more productive hardware filling, improved energy efficiency and the degree of autonomy of the device, a significantly improved main camera.  In turn, M2 Note can oppose a larger display size, lower cost and almost the latest version of the operating system with support for 64-bit computing and the ability to install the latest software.  If any of these three pluses on M2 Note is critical for you, then it is better to choose it.  And so, indeed, in terms of parameters, capabilities and characteristics in all other cases, the Meizu MX4 smartphone will be much better.  Reviews only confirm this.  Of course, this smartphone costs much more, but you have to pay extra for all the quality.  And this is exactly the case when it is better to pay extra and get a better gadget. </p>
