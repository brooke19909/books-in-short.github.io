Causes and troubleshooting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Often owners of smartphones and phones are faced with such an unpleasant problem when the speaker on the phone wheezes.  There may be several reasons why this can happen - from the fall of the device to the hardware breakdown.  In today's article, we will analyze in detail all the most common problems that cause wheezing, and also share troubleshooting methods.  It will be interesting! </p><h2>  Dust </h2><p>  The first <span>reason why the speaker</span> on your phone wheezes is due to dust, small debris and dirt.  Many people incorrectly believe that in places such as a speaker, a charging connector, a headphone jack, etc., dust and debris are simply unable to get into.  This is absolutely not the case, since dust, as well as dirt, can include very small particles that can even penetrate into small and hard-to-reach places, such as a speaker. </p><p>  Over time, dust begins to collect, it becomes more and more, and ultimately it interferes with the normal operation of the speaker.  The volume decreases, hissing, wheezing, crackles and much more appear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the speaker wheezes on the phone due to dust" class="if uuid-2626579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2626579.jpg"></div><p>  What to do in this situation?  Definitely worth the cleanup.  There are two ways to do this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first is to take a can of compressed air or a vacuum cleaner with a blow function, and carefully blow out the location of the speaker on the phone.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that if the dust inside had time to compress a little, then it‚Äôs quite possible that it will not work out.  In this case, it is worth resorting to the second method. </p><p>  It involves cleaning with a thin object.  A straightened paper clip, needle, toothpick, etc. are perfect. You need to take an object and carefully clean the speaker hole.  In the end, you can additionally blow the speaker with air, it will be even more effective. </p><h2>  Phone crashes </h2><p>  The second <span>reason why the speaker</span> on the phone wheezes is because the device is falling.  In general, any fall for the phone, one way or another, has negative consequences, but in this case we are talking about dynamics.  The fact is that when it falls, there is a high risk that the contact of the speaker cable may move away from the impact or the speaker itself may come off.  As a result, when listening to, for example, music, <span>extraneous noises,</span> crackles, etc. will be clearly audible. This, in fact, is why the speaker wheezes on the phone. </p><p>  What to do in this situation and how to fix the problem?  There are again 2 options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.repairngo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the speaker wheezes on the phone due to a fall" class="if uuid-2626578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2626578.jpg"></div><p>  The first is to disassemble the phone yourself, check the contact on the speaker cable, or fasten it if it comes off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second option is to take the phone to a service center, where the master will already take it and perform all the necessary manipulations. </p><p>  What is better to choose is up to you. </p><h2>  Listening to music </h2><p>  Another very common reason why the speaker on your phone wheezes is listening to music at maximum volume.  Yes, it would seem that it could be harmless to listen to music, but it wasn‚Äôt there.  As everyone knows, for the best quality and correct sound, you need at least two speakers, so that not only stereo mode, but also the volume is distributed evenly (correctly). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the speaker wheezes on the phone due to the prosulation of music at high volume" class="if uuid-2626581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2626581.jpg"></div><p>  Modern realities are such that in phones most often there is 1 speaker playing in mono mode, which means that the load on it is doubled.  Those who like to listen to music at maximum volume.  must remember that prolonged listening negatively affects the dynamics, in particular, the membrane suffers.  As a result of this, extraneous noise, crackles, clicks, rattling, wheezing and much more can appear. </p><p>  In this case, it simply does not work out to fix the problem, because you have to replace the speaker, and this can cost a lot of money. </p><h2>  Speaker damage </h2><p>  The next reason the speaker wheezes on the phone is mechanical damage.  What does it mean?  The phone fell unsuccessfully, moisture got inside the speaker, some thin object accidentally got into the holes, which damaged the membrane, and so on.  Anything can happen, so do not be surprised.  Another thing is important here - for any mechanical damage to the speaker, malfunctions arise, and its operation is disrupted.  As a result, you can hear wheezing, noise, hissing, crackling and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the speaker wheezes on the phone due to mechanical damage" class="if uuid-2626582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2626582.jpg"></div><p>  As in the previous case, there is only one way to fix the problem - by completely replacing the speaker with a new one. </p><h2>  Speaker breakdown </h2><p>  Well, the last <span>reason why the speaker wheezes</span> on the phone is a breakdown.  There are some similarities with the previous paragraph, but with only one caveat - the breakdown is not the fault of the user.  The reason may be the poor quality of the produced speaker, the wear of the cable, the burnout of any of the contacts, the malfunction of the trace elements that are responsible for the speaker, and much more.  It is important to understand that failure does not always lead to a complete shutdown of the element, no, it can still cause noise, wheezing, hissing, and malfunctioning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the speaker wheezes on the phone due to a breakdown" class="if uuid-2626580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2626580.jpg"></div><p>  Actually, the solution to the problem is also one, and, alas, the second option is not given - a complete replacement of the failed speaker with a new one. </p>
