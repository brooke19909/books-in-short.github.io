Such women have hats in the literal sense for all occasions and for every outfit, whether it be a beach <span>straw hat</span> or a shocking "to go out" and many, many others. </p><p>  This article will discuss how to make a <span>hat with your own hands.</span>  Indeed, in addition to the fact that the hat can radically change the <span>image, it</span> is also an excellent protective tool against direct sunlight, rich in ultraviolet light, which is simply irreplaceable in the summer, especially when you are going on vacation to the sea.  Choosing a hat, it is likely that you will give preference to the made by yourself.  Moreover, this does not take too much time, and the result is all gasp!  Truly, it‚Äôs worth it, and it‚Äôs guaranteed that your hat will be truly exclusive, which is a very important factor.  How to make a hat to surpass itself in this business? </p><p>  Consider one of the methods of making a summer headdress that will give your image a special charm, in addition, it will become an amazing addition to the style.  So, we turn to the description of the manufacture of a summer hat from strips of fabric, elastic tape, braid, etc., which allows you to form beautiful waves near the fields and, at the same time, perfectly holds the shape of the head. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a hat?</strong>  <strong>Instruction manual</strong> </p><ol><li>  Choose a dense <span>cotton fabric in</span> bright colors with a width of at least one and a half meters.  Of course, you can buy a ready-made slanting trim, but still it is much more preferable to cut it yourself. </li><li>  A square of fabric is folded along the oblique and the resulting triangle is cut into strips 6 cm wide. Next, the edges of the strips cut at an angle, combining the corners, are sewn together. </li><li>  You can also simplify the stitching of the strips by aligning the edges (cutting oblique corners), and then stitching, as usual, combining already smooth edges.  However, softer stripes are nevertheless obtained when they are sewn together at an angle.  After stitching from the wrong side, the bends are ironed and the strips are ironed in half in width.  Moreover, before making a hat, or rather its first forty centimeters, it is necessary to slightly stretch and round it with an iron, thus giving it a rounded shape. </li><li>  Then the ironed edges are processed with a zigzag or overcast using a special machine - overlock.  And proceed to the direct sewing of a hat.  At the same time, the oblique inlay is sewn in a spiral, increasing the circle in turns in a spiral until it reaches a diameter of 17-18 cm. </li><li>  Spiral bands overlap each other.  How to make a hat so that the flat circle does not bend?  In the course of an <span>oblique inlay</span> make small tucks.  After reaching the desired size in a circle, it begins to narrow downwards, stitching the stripes in a spiral, without making any more tucks. </li><li>  The strips are sewn to a width of about 10 cm, from time to time trying on the resulting workpiece.  Having finished sewing the pipe, the sewing begins to expand, so that the fields are obtained, making small tucks throughout the entire sewn tape, thus expanding the strip.  It is worth noting that the edges will be more wavy if you do the tucks as often as possible.  Hem the end of the tape so that it is not noticeable. </li><li>  Making a hat with your own hands, it turns out, is quite simple, it is enough to determine the material.  In conclusion, the finished hat is decorated with flowers, ribbons and other accessories that can make your creation a real masterpiece, your pride. </li></ol><p>  It is the hat that will make your image complete, giving it mystery and an elusive charm, your sense of self will increase, you will be, as they say, fully armed. </p>
