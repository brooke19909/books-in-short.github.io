In the entire history of the Caucasus, there were a lot of people who wanted to subjugate it.  However, no one succeeded.  This is explained primarily by the fact that the conquerors each time encountered fearless locals who were ready to fight for their lands to the last drop of blood.  It was with this purpose ‚Äî to protect their homes from invaders ‚Äî that the famous Svan towers, a peculiar symbol of Svaneti, were built. </p><h2>  Svaneti - region of Georgia </h2><p>  Svaneti is an unusual and peculiar region in the north-west of Georgia.  Everything here is unusual and special.  Starting with a language that can no longer be found in any part of Georgia, and ending with an unusual landscape and architecture.  A distinctive feature of this area is the Svan towers.  Photos of these unusual buildings, of course, cannot fully convey the atmosphere of those distant times when they were built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hesed.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svaneti on the map of Georgia" class="if uuid-2957171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2957171.jpg"></div><h2>  Svans - who are they? </h2><p>  Svans are a subgroup of Georgians who speak their unwritten language.  The history of this people goes back to the time of the reign of Queen Tamara, and the first mention of them can be found in the works of ancient authors.  The culture of the Svans - Christian faith and writing - is close to Georgian and is its integral part.  The Svans are one of the few nations that practiced blood feud.  Legends about their cruelty, revenge and savagery still go on.  To this day, the inhabitants of Svaneti have preserved their unusual language, traditions, and even clan system.  This is explained by the fact that Svaneti is located in relative isolation and it is not so easy to get there.  The Svans themselves rarely came down from the mountains and preferred to live apart.  However, the most remarkable and famous symbol of these parts are the famous Svan towers.  Georgia today attracts tourists with these unusual buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history of the towers </h2><p>  The history of these towers is rooted in the distant and turbulent Middle Ages.  They were built in the town of Mestia, which is the administrative center of Svaneti.  The typical landscape of the city is formed by small villages located on the mountain slopes, with gorges, alpine valleys and peaks covered with snow all year round.  Such a landscape did not allow the city to be protected with a fence wall due to the fragmentation of residential buildings.  Therefore, each house was equipped with a similar structure, which served as a refuge for the family in case of an attack by the enemy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.georgianholidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svan towers. Georgia" class="if uuid-2956690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/2956690.jpg"></div><h2>  Svan towers: why were they built? </h2><p>  In addition, the towers were equipped with signal lights designed to alert the remaining residents of the city about the attack.  In the event of imminent danger, a fire was lit on the main tower.  As soon as this flame was seen on the nearest tower, a fire also caught fire there.  This process was repeated again and again until all the gorges were ready for battle.  These towers usually had three to five floors.  The wall thickness decreased closer to the top.  Nowhere in the world is there an analogue to these unique defenses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.advantour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svan towers, photo" class="if uuid-2956691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/2956691.jpg"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  Towers were attached on one side to an ordinary residential building.  Each tower had at least three floors, between which wooden floors were laid.  There were no windows or loopholes on the ground floor.  It is assumed that it was here that during the enemy attack, not only the whole family took refuge, but also livestock.  In the center, a center was built for heating the room.  Above it is a stone slab designed to protect wooden floors from burning.  The second floor served as the entrance directly to the tower.  Cattle feed, weapons and tools were also stored here.  It was possible to get to the remaining floors with the help of wooden stairs through narrow hatches.  All other floors were equipped with loopholes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="georgiaabout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svan towers - destination" class="if uuid-2956695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/2956695.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ol><li>  The Svan towers, the purpose of which we examined, are named so, naturally, in honor of Svaneti.  In general, a long time ago this region of Georgia was called the "country of a thousand towers."  In the Middle Ages there really were a lot of these structures.  Of course, over time, some of them were destroyed. </li><li>  The ‚Äúyoungest‚Äù tower is about 200 years old, and most of them were built between the 8th and 13th centuries. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the purpose of all the towers was almost the same, they were distinguished by two types - guard and tribal.  The first were built on the outskirts and served to alert residents of the impending danger.  The second adjoined residential buildings and were intended for shelter. </li><li>  Each family (clan) had to have its own tower.  The height of the structure and its strength directly depended on how many men are in the family, what is the prosperity.  In other words, the clan tower could be used to judge the welfare of an entire clan or clan. </li><li>  Watchtowers were superior in height to the family towers by several meters. </li><li>  Getting inside these buildings at that time was not so simple.  This could be done only through a specially constructed tunnel that led to the tower directly from the apartment building - Machuba. </li><li>  Built Svan towers of stone.  Despite the lack of architectural education among the ancient Svans, these structures were extremely strong, seismic and avalanche-resistant.  At the end of the 80s, earthquakes in Georgia were quite common, but most of the buildings have survived to this day and they will probably last for more than a dozen years. </li><li>  In peacetime, the Svan towers of Mestia were used as original ‚Äúrefrigerators‚Äù - cellars for storing food. </li><li>  It is believed that the small windows on each of the floors of the tower at that turbulent time served as loopholes.  However, in reality they are so narrow that they could hardly serve precisely for these purposes.  Most likely, their main purpose is lighting and ventilation. </li><li>  There are two towns in Svaneti where the Svan towers are most preserved: Mestia and Ushguli.  Buildings in these cities are almost identical and differ only in color.  This is due to the fact that different materials were used in the construction. </li><li>  Svan towers still retain their original appearance.  This is due to the fact that medieval buildings are the property of UNESCO.  In this regard, any actions related not only to restoration, but even to repair, are prohibited.  To do this, you must obtain special permission.  In this regard, many towers are on the verge of destruction. </li><li>  In modern Georgia, you can find buildings that most accurately copy historical monuments.  Enterprising Georgians arrange hotels there and offer numerous tourists to plunge into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svan towers of Mestia" class="if uuid-2956696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/2956696.jpg"></div><h2>  Svaneti today </h2><p>  Currently, the Svan towers are one of the main attractions of Georgia.  Tourists come here to plunge into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages and enjoy the surroundings.  Many of the towers are abandoned, and if you wish and a certain amount of courage, you can even climb inside and wander around the floors.  Of course, in Svaneti today there are many buildings built in a modern style, but all of them did not violate the overall color, so those who go on a trip to Georgia will surely enjoy this unusual combination of antiquity and modernity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siroccoverland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svan towers - why were they built?" class="if uuid-2956698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/2956698.jpg"></div><h2>  What else to see in Svaneti </h2><p>  In addition to the famous towers, in Svaneti there are other attractions: </p><ul><li>  Corundi Lakes. </li><li>  Chalaadi Glacier. </li><li>  Hatsvali Mountain, where the ski resort is located. </li><li>  The Ushba and Schkheld Mountains, which are rightfully considered one of the most difficult to climb in all of Europe. </li><li>  Church of Christ, in which ancient icons are preserved. </li><li>  Museum of History and Ethnography. </li><li>  Transfiguration Church of the 19th century. </li></ul>
