One of the attractive points is cashback.  It is in all products of the bank, but each has its own characteristics.  Because of this, the attitude towards him is ambiguous, which is well reflected in the reviews of the Tinkoff card with a cashback.  To understand why opinions are different, it is necessary to compare what a financial institution offers and what a user of a banking product actually receives. </p><h2>  What is cashback </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tinkoffweb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff black" class="if uuid-2977712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977712.jpg"></div><p>  The word came from the UK, and in English cash back means cash back.  The term is used in various fields of activity as a form of promotion to attract customers. </p><p>  All banks issue cashback cards, Tinkoff is no exception.  Bonuses in his products can be obtained for purchases and services that are used by almost all people.  In reviews of cards with cashback from Tinkoff, some noticed that the bank, in principle, does not have ‚Äúplastic‚Äù without bonuses.  And this is true, the main thing is to choose the right one. </p><h2>  Tinkoff Black Card </h2><p>  The Black Card is one of the first products of the bank.  Its conditions are suitable for most customers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  What do customers primarily say in their reviews?  Cash back 10 percent on the Tinkoff Black debit card.  True, such bonuses are awarded with a balance of up to 300 thousand rubles, under other conditions - 6%. </li><li>  Free cash withdrawal from 3000 rubles. </li><li>  Free recharge through Tinkoff ATMs and bank partners. </li><li>  Commission for transfers to third-party banks (up to 20,000) is not charged. </li><li>  Maintenance is free with a <span>minimum balance of</span> more than 30 thousand rubles for the billing period or 50 thousand in the account.  In other options, the service is 99 rubles per month. </li></ul><h2>  Cash back by Black </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zen.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cashback on the map" class="if uuid-2977717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977717.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, Tinkoff Bank Black <span>debit card with cashback</span> is a leader among all products of a financial institution.  This is due to a simple, convenient, and most importantly - attractive bonus system: </p><ul><li>  For any purchases, including online, 1% cashback. </li><li>  An increased cashback of 5% is charged for purchases in stores from a special category.  She is selected independently every 3 months.  In addition to stores, you can choose the categories of "Transport", "Restaurants", "Fines". </li><li>  For purchases through partners of the bank, up to 30% is returned. </li></ul><p>  It should be borne in mind that cashback is credited for an amount multiple of 100. This means that, for example, when buying 199 rubles, 1 point is awarded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reviews on the Tinkoff Black card with cashback </h2><p>  Commercial bank products are widely discussed online.  A financial institution is positioned as a mobile bank, so where, no matter how on the World Wide Web, find out an opinion about it. </p><p>  The most talked about product is a Tinkoff Black card with a cashback.  Terms and reviews will be presented later.  The main advantage is that everything is done remotely in the same chat rooms and forums.  Card holders note the simplicity of the terms of registration, use, receipt of cashback. </p><p>  Some note that the initial monthly fee was 99 rubles for servicing the card and 59 for notification of transactions.  Amounts, although small, but no one wants to part with their own money.  Tinkoff returns bonuses for any purchases, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a regular store, restaurant or online trading platform.  One point is equal to one ruble, so cashback fully covers the service charge. </p><p>  There are also dissatisfied with the bonus program.  Increased cashback can be obtained only to boutiques, some retail chains and other places that are not in small cities, not to mention villages and villages.  There are few bonuses per month.  In addition, in small towns, about 80% of the payment is paid in cash, and without loss you can withdraw from 3 thousand rubles.  The amount is not always spent right away, and it turns out that there are no costs or bonuses. </p><h2>  Tinkoff Platinum </h2><p>  Card "Platinum" is only in one version - credit.  She has a small credit limit, only 300 thousand rubles, so it is suitable for those who quickly need a small amount.  Lending and service conditions are more than favorable: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The grace period (interest-free) is 120 days if the loan is transferred from another bank, in other cases - 55 days. </li><li>  Interest on the loan - 12-29.9%. </li><li>  Card service - 590 rubles per year. </li></ul><p>  You can get a card by filling out an online application on the bank's website.  The solution can be found almost immediately after the application.  The card will be delivered by the courier service of the financial organization. </p><p>  If a client wants to transfer a loan from another bank, a number of conditions must be met.  They apply to all Tinkoff credit cards: </p><ul><li>  In the bank from which the loan is transferred, it is necessary to take a printout of the remaining amount of debt. </li><li>  Pay all penalties for transferring a loan. </li></ul><p>  After approval and receipt of the card, it must be activated by multi-channel telephone or via Internet banking. </p><h2>  Feedback from users about the Platinum card </h2><div class="photo" data-original="auction.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff platinum" class="if uuid-2977727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977727.jpg"></div><p>  Cards "Platinum" and "Black" - the first products of the bank.  Conditions, of course, have changed on them more than once, depending on the economic situation.  There are a lot of reviews about the Tinkoff Platinum card with cashback. </p><p>  Remuneration for purchases through bank partners from 3 to 30%.  Some in the reviews write that they took a loan and made the necessary purchases in stores with increased cashback.  In terms of interest on the loan was very low. </p><p>  There are also many reviews of those who borrowed money for travel.  Cashback allowed me to eat in foreign restaurants very cheaply. </p><h2>  Tinkoff All Airlines Debit Card </h2><p>  Almost simultaneously with Black, the bank introduced the All Airlines product.  The main feature of All Airlines debit and credit cards is that cashback is credited in miles and can be spent on buying airline tickets.  Moreover, there is no binding to any particular airline.  Cards are issued in two categories and have different service conditions. </p><p>  All Airlines World: </p><ul><li>  Income of 6% per annum on the balance upon purchases of at least 20 thousand rubles. </li><li>  With an account balance of more than 100 thousand rubles.  card service is free.  In other options - 299 rubles per month. </li><li>  Maximum monthly reward 6 thousand miles. </li><li>  Free insurance for 50 thousand dollars. </li></ul><p>  All Airlines Black Edition: </p><ul><li>  Income of 6% per annum is accrued without any additional conditions. </li><li>  Maintenance 1890 rubles a year.  It is written off once, as soon as a sufficient amount is received on the card or account. </li><li>  A monthly fee of not more than 30 thousand miles. </li><li>  Convert miles to rubles - 1 to 1. </li><li>  The maximum insurance amount is 100 thousand dollars.  Insurance is issued free of charge. </li><li>  The presence of a personal manager in the bank. </li><li>  2 free visits to lounges per month under the Lounge Key loyalty program. </li></ul><p>  You can issue a card via the Internet or by phone.  2 days after considering the application, the courier will deliver it to your home. </p><h2>  Tinkoff All Airlines cashback debit card reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tinkoff.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff map" class="if uuid-2977757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977757.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the big bonuses and ease of use, some people have a negative attitude towards the product of the bank.  Almost always, dissatisfaction is associated with the carelessness of people when familiarizing themselves with the conditions under which you can use the card.  The bank is transparent and open in working with clients.  In order to avoid unpleasant moments, you can always contact an employee and clarify information. </p><p>  In the reviews of the card with the cashback of Tinkoff Bank, there is great dissatisfaction with the fact that if there are more than 100 thousand on the card, and not on the account, you still need to pay for the service. </p><p>  Many do not like the reward system.  Firstly, 6000 is very small, especially in the season when the cost of tickets increases by one and a half, or even twice.  Secondly, compensation is calculated in increments of 3 thousand miles, that is, the amount to pay for a plane ticket should be a multiple of 3,000. In practice, card users are faced with approximately such situations: if a ticket costs 7 thousand rubles, then its compensation be 9,000 miles.  If the ticket price is within 5500, you will have to give 6000 miles.  Users complain that they are forced to buy more expensive tickets, so at least it would not be offensive. </p><p>  The cards also have a huge plus - free insurance.  True, it does not apply to all states, but insurance may not help in these countries (Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and others).  Its validity period is one year, and it is extended on really favorable terms. </p><p>  Users mark a one-time reward of 1,000 miles on their first purchase as a plus. </p><h2>  Tinkoff AliExpress Credit Card </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tnkff-otzyvy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aliexpress card" class="if uuid-2977778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977778.jpg"></div><p>  It is probably difficult to find a person who at least once did not buy something in the AliExpress online hypermarket.  A large selection of products, ease of maintenance and customer protection contribute to an increase in the number of the latter. </p><p>  Given the potential of the hypermarket, the bank issued a Tinkoff Ali Express card, debit and credit.  Credit card terms have made it more popular among all similar bank products.  In forums and chats, the product is discussed more often in a positive way.  Judging by the reviews, a credit card with a Tinkoff Ali Express cashback is considered one of the bank‚Äôs best offers. </p><p>  Many people believe that 700 thousand credit rubles is exactly the amount that is quite capable of being repaid with an average Russian salary.  The loan interest is from 15 to 29.9%, among the population such a rate is considered normal. </p><p>  Cashback from purchases on Ali is 5%, this is a lot, especially when you consider that shopaholics spend in the Internet hypermarket not small amounts.  Moreover, bonuses are awarded for any purchases, even on goods with a discount. </p><h2>  Drive from Tinkoff </h2><p>  At the beginning of 2018, the bank issued new (debit and credit) Tinkoff Drive cards.  They are conditionally called cards for motorists.  This is due to the fact that when paying fines, paying them at gas stations, roads and various automobile services, bonuses are awarded. </p><p>  According to reviews, it is better to buy a debit card with a Tinkoff Drive cashback.  The conditions under which a credit card is given are not entirely attractive: </p><ul><li>  On credit, you can take no more than 700 thousand rubles. </li><li>  High interest rate - from 23.9 to 39.9% per annum. </li><li>  Commission fee for each cash withdrawal operation up to 100 thousand rubles - 390 rubles, over 100 thousand rubles - 2% + 390 rubles. </li><li>  Monthly payment of at least 8% of the loan amount. </li><li>  Card service 990 rubles per year. </li></ul><p>  Tinkoff Drive Debit Card: </p><ul><li>  When you open an account or if you have a loan at Tinkoff for an amount of at least 150 thousand rubles, the service is free.  In other cases - 190 rubles per month. </li><li>  Transfers to third-party banks to the card up to 20,000 per month for free.  Over this amount - 1.5%, but not less than 30 rubles. </li><li>  Internal transfers are free. </li><li>  Transfers to third-party banks by details - free of charge. </li><li>  Card replenishment up to 300 thousand rubles - for free. </li></ul><h2>  Opinion of Tinkoff Drive card holders </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the bank‚Äôs product is new, many motorists have used it.  And most of the opinions about him are unflattering.  Judging by the reviews, the terms of the card with the Tinkoff Drive cashback are not quite what they seem at first glance.  Bonuses are awarded points according to the following scheme: </p><ul><li>  When paying by card at a gas station, 10% of the purchase amount is returned. </li><li>  For auto services - 5%. </li><li>  Penalties of the traffic police - 5%. </li><li>  The rest are any purchases - for every 100 rubles spent, 1 point is awarded. </li></ul><p>  Everything looks very tempting, especially for those who constantly pay for the above.  According to the reviews, ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù pop up after the card holder tries to use the bonuses: </p><ul><li>  No matter how much was spent at the gas station, you can spend no more than 1000 points per month.  It turns out that spending more than 10 thousand is simply unprofitable. </li><li>  Points for transactions at gas stations are not converted 2 to 3. In other words, if you accumulate 2000 points, then the purchase of gasoline can be compensated for 1333 rubles. </li><li>  The full price for Gasoline and Auto Services must be reimbursed no later than 90 days from the date of purchase.  But you can only compensate after 2000 points are accumulated. </li></ul><p>  But many people write that if you do not focus on the intricacies of the bonus system, then using the card is convenient and profitable. </p><h2>  Bonuses for shopaholics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="recard.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lamoda card" class="if uuid-2977774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977774.jpg"></div><p>  Many people think in reviews: a debit card with a Tinkoff cashback (any of which) forces you to constantly make purchases.  And they are right.  But for people to get more bonuses, the bank offers a number of products, cashback for which is accrued for the purchase of goods in a particular store: </p><ul><li>  "Alphabet of taste".  Accrues 5 bonuses for each ruble when buying in the network "Alphabet of taste".  100 bonuses is equivalent to 1 ruble. </li><li>  eBay.  For purchases in the same store and for any online purchases of cashback - 3%. </li><li>  Lamoda.  Credit card with 5% bonuses on goods in Lamoda online stores. </li></ul><p>  These and other cards can be issued via the Internet.  The courier will bring her in 2 days. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><div class="photo" data-original="life4trip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff All Airlines" class="if uuid-2977737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2977737.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of cards with Tinkoff cashback can be found both positive and negative.  Earning points that are converted into money, or compensation for the purchase - it is always nice.  But the fee for using the product does not cause much enthusiasm.  The bank offers a large selection of cashback cards, and many can choose the option they need.  And in order to avoid disappointment, it is necessary to take a closer look at the conditions and clearly calculate the feasibility of using a particular bank product. </p>
