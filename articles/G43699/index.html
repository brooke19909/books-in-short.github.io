  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Afula city (Israel): description, attractions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Afula (Israel) is located in the north of the country, in the region called Galilee.  It is developing rapidly, the construction of seven new quarters has begun here, the population is constantly growing due to the regular influx of returnees.  As in all of Israel, the area has historical and biblical significance.  What is interesting about Afula? </p><h2>  Bible places </h2><p>  The area where the city of Afula is located is called Galilee.  The name comes from the Hebrew word "gal", which translates as a wave.  If you look at the area from a bird's eye view, it will become noticeable that low mountains alternate with valleys, which, in general, looks like sea waves frozen in stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="disqus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be brought from israel" class="if uuid-3238097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3238097.jpg"></div><p>  At the epicenter of these waves, the Jezreel Valley extends.  Her second name is Megiddo.  In the center of the valley stands Mount Megiddo.  According to the Bible, the epic battle of Good and Evil mentioned in the Apocalypse will take place here.  From this valley after the end of the world the Kingdom of God will come to the world.  In the vicinity of the city is another biblical shrine - Mount Tabor, on which the Transfiguration of the Lord took place. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city of Afula (Israel) was founded in 1925.  The founder of the settlement is Yehoshua Khankin, a native of Russia.  Arriving at the place, he actively bought land in the valley at a very reasonable price.  The terrain was not suitable for living and farming due to constant swampiness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="afula city" class="if uuid-3238090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3238090.jpg"></div><p>  The repatriates who arrived made a lot of efforts to improve the situation and were soon able to get a crop from their crops.  In 1972, the settlement received the status of a city, which attracted a larger flow of people counting on permanent residence.  Since the independence of Israel, the population has increased dramatically.  In the 90s of the last century, the main flow of immigrants consisted of emigrants from the countries of the former USSR.  Today, more than 30% of all residents are former citizens of various CIS countries. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today, the city of Afula (Israel) consists of three areas: Afula-Ilit (Upper Afula) and Giv'at a-More, spread out on Mount More, and a third, Lower Afula, 40 meters below sea level, is being built up rapidly.  Mount Moret consists of volcanic basalt rock, on its slopes there is a pine forest where you can pick mushrooms. </p><p>  In 2016, a passenger railway link between Haifa and Beit Shean was opened with a stop in Afula.  The branch began to be built in 2011, it was laid along approximately the same route as the once-famous road that ran along the Jezreel Valley in the early twentieth century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="101israel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Israel from St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-3238095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3238095.jpg"></div><p>  The city is constantly building new infrastructure and industrial complexes.  One of the best educational institutions is Emek Jezreel College, which has a nursing school, which annually graduates specialists with excellent training and high qualifications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Industry </h2><p>  The city of Afula (Israel) is considered the center of the country's sugar industry, one of the largest modern refineries in the country operates here.  There is also a textile factory specializing in the production of nylon fabrics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="matael.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shopping in afula israel" class="if uuid-3239449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3239449.jpg"></div><p>  Afula is surrounded by kibbutzim, where the main agricultural crop is sunflowers, so the production of seeds and sunflower oil has been established here.  In addition to domestic companies, branches of several well-known world brands work in the industrial zone of the city. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Afula (Israel) cannot boast an abundance of historical and archaeological sites.  Many values ‚Äã‚Äãwere lost during the development.  The architecture of the city is rather modest, but there are some interesting buildings in the surrounding kibbutzim.  Near the city are three national parks - Beit Shearim, Zapori and Megiddo. </p><p>  In addition, tourists will be interested to get acquainted with such attractions: </p><ul><li>  The old water tower, it was built in the 30s of the twentieth century. </li><li>  Palm alley in the city center with a small garden "Japanese Garden". </li><li>  The building and platform of the old railway station.  Railway communication took place in these places long before the appearance of the city of Afula (Israel).  The canvas connected Haifa and Damascus. </li><li>  Monument to the soldier. </li><li>  The ancient mound of Tel Afula.  It is located almost in the center of the city.  The southern part of the mound is best preserved.  Excavations were carried out in 1948, the result was the discovery of the cultural layer of the Bronze Age.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water tower, archaeologists have discovered tombs belonging to different periods of the Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as to the Roman period. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old railway station in afula" class="if uuid-3238108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3238108.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the city of Afula (Israel) are the Church of the Annunciation, the temple of Gabriel, the well of Mary, the reserve "Harod Spring", the Hankin Museum. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Afula is unlikely to attract tourists in the near future.  This city has yet to become a cultural and industrial center.  In this country there are many other places where tourists go daily in search of new experiences and relaxation.  Thematic tours to Israel from St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia will introduce tourists to the land where the world's leading religions are firmly intertwined, and the land remembers the ancestors of mankind and awaits the fulfillment of Bible prophecies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beautyscenery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tourist israel" class="if uuid-3238113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3238113.jpg"></div><p>  Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Nazareth and other cities will give tourists a lot of impressions and new knowledge.  Any person will find in this country that he will be close to.  Those who want to visit the holy places will need more than one day to touch and bow to all the preserved monuments.  People who want to spend time in the bliss of a comfortable stay in Israel will find paradise on earth.  Those who need treatment will receive the best qualified help. </p><h2>  Tips &amp; Testimonials </h2><p>  What can you bring from Israel to your loved ones?  This question is important for every tourist.  Experienced travelers are advised not to choose commonplace things, such as trinkets or magnets, but to pay attention to things that bear the imprint of culture.  Jewelery has been developed in the country, which is greatly facilitated by the Tel Aviv Diamond Exchange.  If purchasing diamond products is not part of your plans, pay attention to expertly crafted jewelry and silver jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mvholyland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="souvenirs from israel" class="if uuid-3238119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/3238119.jpg"></div><p>  A huge selection of ceramics is offered in the markets and in the specialized departments of the shopping center - painted plates, dishes, decorative panels are made in traditional technique and are pleasing to the eye, but are relatively small.  Also, many will like masterfully made copies of archaeological treasures, which will certainly become art objects of any living room. </p><p>  In general, tourists recommend paying attention to the following acquisitions: </p><ul><li>  Red thread - it is tied on seven knots, making wishes.  It is believed that as soon as the nodules are untied, the wishes will come true. </li><li>  Dead Sea cosmetics. </li><li>  Religious attributes. </li><li>  Jewelry from Eilat stone. </li><li>  Antiques. </li><li>  Dates, honey, hummus and more. </li></ul><p>  Going for souvenirs, it is worth remembering that shops in Israel are open from Sunday to Friday, Saturday is a day off.  Experienced tourists are also advised not to throw away checks.  Religious paraphernalia of any denomination is best acquired in Jerusalem or Bethlehem. </p><p>  Reviews written about Israel tell about a small but amazing country.  There is no man who has been to the Promised Land, who would be disappointed in the journey.  Many say that you can hear Russian speech in the streets of Israeli cities in any part of the country, so our compatriots do not need a translator or knowledge of other foreign languages. </p><p>  Tourists complain only of two circumstances - high cost and too hot summer.  In this connection, it is recommended to avoid traveling from June to September, as well as to take a decent amount of money with you and be sure to read the local forums where goods and services are discussed, many of which are in Russian. </p>
