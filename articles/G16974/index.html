This once again confirms the proximity of these highly developed primates to humans. </li><li>  Thailand is one of the ten most fun states on the planet.  Here is the largest number of holidays and weekends.  This is probably why Russian tourists love the country so much. </li></ul><p>  Thailand, a country of holidays and festivals, gives a royal holiday to its guests! </p>
