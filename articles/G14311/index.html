Modern shipbuilding technologies, it would seem, should eliminate the errors of past years and make shipping the safest mode of passenger transportation.  This was not the case, despite the fully computerized ship control system, excellent training of personnel, and the accident of ships at sea is not uncommon today.  Some end happily, they manage to evacuate the team and passengers, others cause hundreds of deaths.  The most mysterious <span>ship</span> wrecks are offered to your attention <span>.</span> </p><h2>  "Titanic" </h2><p>  Accidents of ships at sea always cause a wide <span>public outcry,</span> but if, after investigating a disaster, its causes are surrounded by questions, not answers, researchers are trying to unravel them. </p><p>  On the first and only flight of the Pacific liner "Titanic" and today there are many legends.  April 10, 1912 the ship was launched in the English port of Southampton.  The ship went to America, on board were 2224 people.  On April 15, the ship, breaking into two halves, sank in the cold waters of the Atlantic, killing 1,496 people.  The collapse of the most unsinkable ship in the world was the collision with an iceberg.  The mystique of this catastrophe is a lot of classified files after the investigation. </p>

    <p>  Many rescued eyewitnesses claimed that a huge <span>luminous ball</span> blinked near the ship <span>,</span> which confirms the theory of a ship colliding with a UFO.  After several decades, with enviable regularity, ships passing near the square of the disaster received an SOS signal from the already sunken Titanic.  Several people who claimed to be passengers from a sinking liner were found in the area decades later.  The most famous - Vinnie Coates was picked up in 1990 by an Icelandic ship.  Further, her fate is unknown, she was placed in psychiatric hospitals for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Baychimo - ghost ship </h2><p>  Accidents of ships at sea occur due to malfunctions in the ship's system, due to the unpredictability of nature or through the fault of the crew.  Sometimes the reasons for the failure of the ship remain unknown.  A completely ordinary story happened with the SS ship Baychimo.  He was trapped in the ice of the Arctic.  Most of the crew was evacuated by plane. </p>

    <p>  The captain and several crew members decided to wait out the weather on the ship.  A blizzard swept the ship, he disappeared from sight.  When the weather was over, there was no trace of the ship and crew.  The mystery is that many ships have observed Baychimo drifting in the Arctic. </p><h2>  "Estonia" </h2><p>  The most mysterious catastrophe of one of the ships of the Baltic Fleet occurred on the night of September 27-28, 1994.  In 1 hour 50 minutes the ship plunged to a depth of 70 meters, killing 852 people.  Accidents of ships at sea on the European continent are a rarity, this shocked everyone.  Investigation of the disaster was delayed for a long time.  And after receiving the first information, the three Baltic states - Estonia, Sweden and Finland concluded an agreement on non-disclosure of the causes of the disaster.  The official version - the ship in malfunctioning left the port, got into a storm and sank.  The unofficial version is the explosion that occurred on the ship.  The cause of the explosion is the secret transportation of weapons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  "Admiral Nakhimov" </h2><p>  In the history of the Soviet Union and Russia, many tragic stories are associated with the name of <span>Admiral Nakhimov</span> .  At least 6 ships named after this man sank, and here is the mystic.  On August 31, 1986, an accident at sea occurred near the port of Novorossiysk.  Faced the ship "Admiral Nakhimov" and the grain carrier "Peter Vasev."  It took only seven minutes for the water to completely flood the ship.  Onboard were 1242 people, killing 423 people. </p><h2>  "Urang Medan" </h2><p>  The Dutch ship "Urang Medan" in 1947 sent an SOS signal from <span>the Strait</span> of <span>Malacca,</span> which separates the Malacca Peninsula from the island of Sumatra.  After some time, radio stations in England and Holland received information that the entire team was dead.  It was impossible to decrypt the last message from the ship, and only at the end it was clearly written: "I am dying."  Ship accidents at sea in this area were extremely rare. </p>

    <p>  To help the ship, the Silver Star ship arrived.  The vessel showed no signs of life.  Then a special group landed on the deck - and indeed, the entire crew was dead.  When the captain of the ship arriving to the rescue decided to tow the ship to the shore to find out the causes of the disaster, thick smoke fell from the hold and the ship exploded.  Experts investigating this incident came across a wall of secrecy.  All data on the ‚ÄúUrang Medan‚Äù were destroyed.  The only evidence was the ship magazine of the ship Silver Star. </p>
