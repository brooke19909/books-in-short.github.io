Each company has its pros and cons, some attractive and useful, profitable offers.  To whom does the population of the Russian Federation trust more?  Which operator is recommended to use for certain needs?  Understanding all this is not so difficult if you pay attention to the feedback of real subscribers.  Operators always praise their products.  But the real picture often does not coincide with the promises.  So which companies in Russia are recommended to pay attention to first of all?  Who offers the most profitable and high-quality services? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile networks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402487.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Why use? </h2><p>  The first step is to decide for what purpose it is planned to use the mobile device and its network.  Each operator is good in one area or another.  And this factor will have to be taken into account.  After all, there are no ideal companies. </p><p>  In general, <span>mobile networks</span> are used for the following needs: </p><ul><li>  work <span>on the Internet (Internet surfing)</span> ; </li><li>  telephone calls; </li><li>  upload / view photos; </li><li>  uploading videos; </li><li>  video call; </li><li>  exchange of data and messages on the Internet; </li><li>  SMS communication. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that mobile operators are actively promoting television services, as well as home Internet.  Because of this, it has become more difficult to determine the service company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  List of operators </h2><p>  And among whom can I choose?  What mobile networks are most common in Russia?  In different cities, a variety of firms.  But in Russia there is a generally accepted list of mobile network operators.  They are available in almost every city. </p><p>  Today, choose a company to provide mobile services from the following list: </p><ul><li>  Yota </li><li>  "Tele 2"; </li><li>  MTS; </li><li>  Beeline; </li><li>  "Megaphone". </li></ul><p>  It is these operators that are most common in Russia.  Therefore, they should pay special attention.  What are the pros and cons of each firm?  What can they offer their customers? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile networks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402488.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Influence factors </h2><p>  Mobile operators are usually ranked by several indicators.  They can have a serious impact on the decision of the subscriber.  Once a citizen has decided to use a mobile network, an assessment should be made of all existing companies offering this service. </p><p>  But what points should you pay attention to first of all?  Among the main factors that influence the decision of a potential subscriber, there are: </p><ul><li>  cost of services; </li><li>  connection quality; </li><li>  signal strength in the village; </li><li>  tariff plans; </li><li>  the quality of the Internet; </li><li>  customer reviews. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, according to these indicators, networks are usually evaluated.  What can each operator offer?  In what cases and what tariffs will be considered the most favorable? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Yota </h2><p>  Yota is a relatively new company.  It is only gaining ground in Russia.  That is why there are not so many reviews about it.  It offers good home internet with a separate antenna amplifier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile network" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402493.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The cost of services for this operator is high.  That's what potential customers say.  It is noted that citizens have frequent network failures, Internet speed is falling.  Therefore, focus on ‚ÄúIota‚Äù should not be.  Anyway, at the moment.  It is recommended only to extremely patient subscribers who are ready to wait until the operator becomes large and widespread, as well as acquire a stable connection. </p><h2>  "Megaphone" </h2><p>  The next option offered to residents is Megaphone.  This company has long existed in Russia, it is considered one of the largest.  The mobile networks of this company receive a variety of customer reviews.  Many indicate that Megafon is not distinguished by the quality of communication.  The network does not work very well: the Internet is slow, various failures often occur, with a heavy load it is problematic to get in touch with relatives.  Nevertheless, customer opinions also indicate that MegaFon has all the services that are cheap compared to its competitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Mobile device networks from this company do not work very stably, but all communication is budgetary.  You do not need to pay a lot to view messages on the Internet or make a call.  Subscribers recommend Megafon to those who prefer not to use the mobile network too actively. </p><p>  What offers and rates most often interest users?  Nowadays, package services are very popular.  The following tariffs are distinguished among them: </p><ul><li>  XS - 100 free minutes of conversation and SMS are provided, 1 GB of Internet traffic, as well as free calls throughout Russia to Megafon; </li><li>  S - all indicators indicated above are increasing: the Internet has a limit of 4 GB, SMS of 300 units and ‚Äúfree‚Äù calls in the amount of 300 minutes; </li><li>  M - 1,200 messages and minutes for conversations, 15 GB of Internet traffic; </li><li>  L - limits increase to 1,500 minutes and messages, but less Internet traffic - 15 GB; </li><li>  VIP - offers 3,000 SMS and minutes of conversation, 15 GB of information on the Internet. </li></ul><p>  All of the above rates apply even when traveling in Russia.  An exception is only the very first sentence.  According to reviews, home Internet does not work too well for Megafon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile network operators" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402491.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "Tele 2" </h2><p>  Tele2 is a company that is actively developing.  It is not yet available in all cities, which upsets many customers.  But where there is "Tele2", subscribers are satisfied with the use of this operator. </p><p>  Perfect for the Internet: social networks (mobile or computer version is not so important) open quickly, data is downloaded as soon as possible, images are displayed without errors.  Subscribers indicate that it is Tele2 that is suitable for using the Internet on a mobile device. </p><p>  In general, communication is good.  So far, many from Tele2 are repelled by the fact that this operator is not distributed throughout Russia.  But this is far from the most important factor.  Company prices are not too high.  Clients note in their reviews that it is possible to find very advantageous offers from this company.  Not the most expensive, but not too cheap mobile network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone network" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402490.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  At the moment, it is recommended to pay attention to the following proposals: </p><ul><li>  Black - 500 MB of Internet, free calls within the region on Tele2 (the service is present on all packages), 200 minutes of free calls with this operator throughout Russia. </li><li>  ‚ÄúVery Black‚Äù - 300 minutes, the same amount of free SMS, 4 GB of Internet traffic. </li><li>  The Blackest - 6 GB of Internet, 500 minutes of calls, 500 messages. </li><li>  Super Black - 800 SMS, 800 minutes, 8 GB of traffic. </li><li>  "Unlimited Black" - 200 messages in Russia, 200 minutes of dialogue on numbers of the home region and Russia, Internet traffic is unlimited. </li></ul><h2>  Beeline </h2><p>  The following mobile networks are Beeline services.  This operator is one of the largest of its kind.  It is in great demand among customers.  The reviews indicate that quite often, for the home Internet, as well as for working on the World Wide Web through mobile devices, citizens prefer this option. </p><p>  True, Beeline sometimes crashes.  The connection itself works stably, only with a heavy load there are malfunctions.  Customer dissatisfaction is caused by price tags for services.  In Russia, Beeline is considered the most expensive operator to which mobile phones connect.  Social networks, videos and photos are downloaded quickly, but you will have to pay for all this.  Moreover, this principle applies to mobile services and home Internet. </p><p>  What offers interest subscribers most of all?  Now the line "Everything!" Has gained popularity.  Thanks to her, you can get: </p><ul><li>  "ALL for 300": 100 SMS messages, 400 minutes of instant conversations, 10 GB of traffic. </li><li>  "All for 500": with a prepayment, all of these indicators increase respectively to 300 pieces per month, 800, 18 GB, with a postpay - 600 minutes and messages, unlimited Internet. </li><li>  "All for 800": prepayment offers 22 GB of Internet traffic, 1,200 minutes of conversations, 500 messages, postpay - unlimited network, 1,500 SMS and minutes. </li></ul><h2>  MTS </h2><p>  The last operator today that has mobile networks is MTS.  This is also a large organization.  Many indicate that MTS is the main competitor to Beeline.  In terms of communication quality, it does a little bit better, but, nevertheless, it works stably anyway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social networks mobile version" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402489.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But the cost of services pleases.  Both the home Internet and the package options and tariffs.  Most beneficial to use if many are connected to the "MTS" in the immediate environment.  It is also suitable for home Internet: there are practically no failures, the network is poorly caught only in forest zones or places remote from civilization. </p><p>  What suggestions might interest you?  Of course, batch options.  They are actively offered by this network.  <span>There</span> are almost no <span>mobile phones</span> that do not allow you to use the Internet.  Therefore, subscribers prefer tariffs, which immediately offer both a mobile network and the Internet.  The following plans are in demand at MTS: </p><ul><li>  Smart: 4 GB Internet, 500 SMS within Russia, as many free minutes for talking around the country, unlimited communication with MTS. </li><li>  "Smart Unlimited": 200 minutes, 200 messages, unlimited Internet, free calls to "MTS" in Russia. </li><li>  Smart + - 6 GB of Internet traffic, for 900 minutes and SMS, free communication with "MTS" in the country. </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what are the most common mobile network operators in Russia.  Which option to choose?  This should be decided by everyone independently.  You should pay attention to what company your loved ones and those with whom communication is constantly maintained use.  You can see that almost all companies have free calls within the network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile social networks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1402492.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If this factor is not taken into account, then it is recommended to look first at MTS, Beeline and Tele2.  Then to the Megaphone.  But Yota is still not in sufficient demand in many regions of the country. </p>
