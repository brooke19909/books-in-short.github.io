    <h2>  Why is it important? </h2><p>  <span>You should start with a description of the state in which we live.</span>  <span>This is the largest country by area, consisting of subjects of the federation.</span>  <span>And they, in turn, have their own government that develops solutions, including those related to the upbringing of the younger generation.</span>  <span>That is, the content of the history textbook actually depends on the officials dealing with this problem in the corresponding ministry.</span>  <span>It turns out that the children of a huge and strong country receive different information about where it came from.</span>  <span>And not only that the information in them varies depending on the worldview of the official, but the ideas also do not harmonize with each other, are in antiphase.</span>  <span>And this ultimately leads to the disunity of citizens brought up on conflicting concepts.</span>  <span>That is, it is, as the historian Yevgeny Spitsyn convinces, about the integrity of the state.</span>  <span>This person spends a lot of time and effort to counter such threatening trends.</span>  <span>It is important for him what his Motherland will be like in ten or a hundred years.</span>  <span>And an understanding is laid of where to go and how to develop for children sitting at school desks.</span>  <span>When they grow up, it will be too late to change their worldview, but rather impossible.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Evgeny Spitsyn (historian): biography </h2><p>  <span>The Russian outback is said to be rich in talents.</span>  <span>But the capital, too, sometimes gives society bright and smart people.</span>  <span>Spitsyn Evgeny Yurievich is a native Muscovite.</span>  <span>He was born in 1966, at school was fond of, like many boys of that time, stories about military events.</span>  <span>This was reflected in the choice of profession.</span>  <span>In 1991, he graduated with honors from <span>Moscow State Pedagogical</span> University.</span>  <span>Immediately went to school to teach children.</span>  <span>Spitsyn Evgeny Yurievich gave teaching activities for more than twenty-five years.</span>  <span>As he himself says, he worked in two schools, one of which he headed for some time.</span>  <span>Administrative activities did not captivate him.</span>  <span>This person considered his subject more interesting - history.</span>  <span>And he was forced to write a textbook by the situation in the education system, which he himself called catastrophic.</span> </p><h2>  The essence of the problem </h2><p>  <span>University education differs from that provided by specialized universities by its deep systematic nature.</span>  <span>If it is simpler, young people master the base, allowing to collect, structure and analyze large volumes of information.</span>  <span>Practitioner Yevgeny Spitsyn, as we know, has perfectly studied the courses offered, as evidenced by his honors diploma.</span>  <span>While teaching, this person constantly analyzed the quality of the system, which underwent changes in those days.</span>  <span>His conclusions are disappointing.</span>  <span>A catastrophe, he considers the introduction of the exam, as well as the transition to the "Bologna system".</span>  <span>These two circumstances create a fierce contradiction, destroying the <span>continuity in education.</span></span>  <span>At the exam, students are required to demonstrate their ability to understand historiography.</span>  <span>But the "Bologna system" leads to the fact that students do not study, therefore, do not understand this material.</span>  <span>Arriving at work, <span>young teachers are</span> not able to instill in students such skills because of their lack of them.</span>  <span>It turns out a vicious circle.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Evgeny Spitsyn: history textbook </h2><p>  <span>It took more than fifteen years to create a work that optimally describes the path of Russia.</span>  <span>The four volumes harmoniously combine historical facts, names, as well as an analysis of the works of famous scientists.</span>  <span>Evgeny Spitsyn created his books for the younger generation.</span>  <span>That is, I was sure that they would begin to teach history at school.</span>  <span>But this requires an appropriate government decision, but it is not yet.</span>  <span>The first collection was released in August 2015.</span>  <span>It was acquired mainly by ordinary teachers who have principles similar to the author regarding the teaching of the subject.</span>  <span>The reader‚Äôs reviews note that this four-volume is the most convenient tool and help, allowing the teacher to structure the material and present it to children at an affordable level.</span>  <span>So the historian Yevgeny Spitsyn received recognition among colleagues.</span>  <span>His work was not in vain.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Social work </h2><p>  <span>Evgeny Yuryevich did not stop at publishing a textbook.</span>  <span>He considers it his duty to convey to the general public the correct attitude to the complex issues of Russian history.</span>  <span>In 2016, he began a series of programs on this topic on the Day TV channel.</span>  <span>His programs are popular with citizens of the Russian Federation and the entire Russian-speaking world.</span>  <span>As the historian himself notes, the goal is to popularize knowledge, draw people's attention to the problems of presenting past events and the consequences of material distortion.</span>  <span>A citizen, brought up on the wrong worldview, becomes a traitor to the motherland.</span>  <span>Therefore, the country needs a single textbook.</span>  <span>He is, only not officially recognized.</span>  <span>The author himself refers to this circumstance philosophically.</span>  <span>The Ministry of Education probably has its own opinion on a single history textbook, and Yevgeny Yuryevich suggests in public broadcasts to judge who is right.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>The activity of the historian Yevgeny Spitsyn is far from over.</span>  <span>This talented person and citizen with an active lifestyle takes everything so that the society develops the right attitude to the study of history, its comprehension.</span>  <span>But this is necessary so that people are proud of their country, and not be ashamed of its past under the pressure of dubious propaganda.</span>  <span>The great country and its peoples overcame many obstacles.</span>  <span>There were downs and ups.</span>  <span>But was there anything shameful in history?</span>  <span>Many years have been looking for the answer to this question.</span>  <span>And the opinions of experts differ, which becomes the basis for further doubts and throwings in society.</span>  <span>Is it so to build a Great Power?</span>  <span>There is no way to do without comprehending history and understanding the essence of events.</span>  <span>The goal is noble, do you think?</span> </p>
