We are not talking here about inaccessible beauties, but only about those where anyone can get without special problems.  A truly unique corner of our planet is the Curonian Spit, which separates the freshwater <span>Curonian Lagoon</span> and the salty <span>Baltic Sea in a</span> narrow strip <span>.</span>  In 1987, it was in these places that the very first National Park of the same name was formed in Russia.  We’ll talk about him today, but let's start with the story. </p><h2>  History of the Curonian Spit </h2><p>  This landscape object was created by nature about five thousand years ago thanks to the sand driven by the waves of the Baltic Sea and the wind.  And about three hundred years ago, the Curonian Spit was transformed by the hands of man, moreover, specifically.  It is for this reason that the peninsula (as a common Lithuanian-Russian international site) was included as a cultural landscape, and not a natural site, in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p>

Before the colonization of Prussia by the Germans, there lived the Curonian tribe - ancient tribes, that’s the name they came from.  In the tenth century, the Vikings lived in these places, which was confirmed by excavations in 2008, although the first traces were discovered back in 1893.

Photos of local beauties and landscapes will help us to give an answer to this question.  Only here in one day you can see completely different, sometimes completely opposite landscapes: sandy deserts and meadows covered with lichen and moss, dry pine forests and damp alders, stunted mountain pine and tall pine trees, southern taiga and broad-leaved forest, flat fields and sandy mountains , lowland and upland swamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Curonian Spit photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/574500.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sandy beaches in these places stretch for tens of kilometers like lake and flood shores, several scientific stations and fishing villages.  On the spit, human activity and natural, natural processes are very closely intertwined, which have significantly transformed local reliefs over the past thousand years.  The same continues today, due to which the natural system of the braid is very vulnerable and fragile. </p><h2>  Description of the Curonian Spit </h2><p>  What is the Curonian Spit geographically?  The map clarifies this quite intelligibly.  The sandy peninsula has a total length of 98 km, including the Russian part - 48 km.  Width varies from four kilometers to four hundred meters.  The area of ​​the park is 7890 hectares.  Rybachy, Lesnoye and Morskoye are three villages located on this territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Similar objects can be found, but with such a length, size, dunes, rich fauna and flora, the beauty of landscapes, analogues of the Curonian Spit are not only in Europe but throughout the world.

    <h2>  Climate and local infrastructure </h2><p>  The weather here changes very often, and the seasons have the following characteristics: winter is mild, summer is moderately warm, autumn is warm, spring is cool.  What else can the Curonian Spit boast of?  A photo of the area invites us to look at the magnificent beach by the bay, near the village of Morskoye.  Due to the shallow depth of the bay, up to a maximum of four meters, the water temperature in summer reaches 26 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaliningrad Spit Curonian" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/574523.jpg" width="600"></div>  A bird migration path runs along the spit, connecting Karelia, Finland and the Baltic states with Africa and southern Europe.  In autumn and spring there is a very high density of migration flow.  All this creates very favorable conditions for their ringing.  Therefore, back in 1901, Professor Tinemann organized one of the first ornithological stations in the world in these places.  Not so long ago, since 1957, it is a biostation of the Institute of Zoology of the Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation.

But, of course, these places are not pilgrimage, so buses do not go every five minutes.  But the bus Kaliningrad- “Spit Curonian” runs regularly both from Klaipeda and from Svetlogorsk.  They run approximately once per hour.  By the way, tourists who come here do not have to stock up on food for the future, in every village there is a grocery store.  And you need to remember the need for a visa when visiting Lithuania. </p>

You can freely visit here only the zone of villages and the territory reserved for <span>educational tourism.</span> All other places need constant protection and care, as they are very vulnerable, entrance and entry paid on them. </p><p>  You also need to know about the six hiking trails available in the Curonian Spit Park.  The route map is placed on information boards.  They are called: “Müller's Height”, “Fringilla”, “Efa Height”, “Dancing Forest”, “Royal Forest”, “Swan Lake”.  There is a conservation area, which is located between 46 and 49 kilometers of the spit, where people are forbidden to be. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Curonian Spit excursions" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/574505.jpg" width="600"></div>  Also on its territory it is impossible:

Why is it so striking our attention?  All its pine trees are twisted into a ring, branched or bizarrely curved.  In addition, there are no other trees on this stretch of forest.  According to environmentalists, this forest is the most fragile place in this area and tourists only harm it, cause irreparable damage.  They touch the trees, climb on them, trample the soil.  Therefore, a special ecological path was laid along the forest territory and vacationers are asked not to leave it, to move only on the flooring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Curonian Spit National Park" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/574510.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <p>  The behavior of pines taking such amazing forms is very surprising.  After all, usually they grow perfectly even.  The causes of the phenomenon have not been established.  Experts spread their arms and admit a wide variety of versions - from the intervention of aliens to exposure to electromagnetic fields. </p><h2>  Dangers awaiting tourists on the Curonian Spit </h2><p>  The entire Curonian Spit was examined, tours to famous places were conducted.  What to do next?  You can swim and relax on the sea beaches located at the villages of Morskoye, Rybachy, Lesnoye, at the Museum of the National Park, at the tourist base "Dunes", not far from the car parks of the routes Vysota Efa and Korolevskiy Bor.  But, traveling through the forest, passing along the routes, you must always remember the dangers that await at almost every step.  In these places, ixodid ticks are common, which are carriers of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. </p>

Upon returning home, carefully inspect the body and clothing.  In July-August, marching silkworm, a caterpillar, causes a rather strong allergic reaction with its hairs in some forest places.
