It is suitable for both ordinary relaxation and for relaxing with family and children.  It differs from other beach resorts in that noisy night parties are held here, which are attended by a dubious public for the sake of receiving the same dubious pleasures.  In the past, the city was a fishing village, which over time turned into a resort intended for the highest nobility.  Despite the influence of the Thai dynasty, Hua Hin in Thailand, most of which are positive reviews, has not turned into a too urbanized small town. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.5683747" data-lng="99.95768880000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/4/0/2/13402.png"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The city is located in the west of Thailand, namely on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand.  From Bangkok to Hua Hin 190 km. </p><p>  If you translate the name of the city from the national language, it sounds like "Stone Head".  He got this name due to the fact that stones stick out above the coast of the town, which on the side look like stone sculptures of heads. </p><p>  The number of inhabitants in the municipal district is 85 thousand.  In Hua Hin, about 50 thousand people live.  If we talk about the traditional population of the city, then it consists of fishermen.  Tourists are given the opportunity to observe their life and daily work.  This can be done from the fishing pier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists come here to visit the beautiful beaches of the city, which are located along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand for as much as 5 km.  There are many upscale hotels that are made in an elegant English style.  They combine perfectly with the picturesque picture of the resort and have made holidays in Thailand and Hua Hin more attractive and comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.klook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Man swims in the sea" class="if uuid-3027149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3027149.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The city is located near the capital of Thailand, to get to Hua Hin, you need to spend 2 hours on a trip.  The easiest way to get to the city is to fly to Suvarnabhumi Airport.  Then everything depends on the time of arrival and on your financial capabilities. </p><p>  To buy a plane ticket to Thailand at the best price, it is recommended to use special search engines that collect information from all airlines. </p><p>  The most convenient way to help you get to the city from Bangkok is by taxi.  You can order it in advance or just in the parking lot at the airport.  You can also catch him at the exit in the arrivals area. </p><p>  For those who are looking for a budget option, public transport is suitable.  It runs from the airport, as well as from the state stations of the capital or from <span>Khaosan Road.</span>  There is a train that runs from Hualampong Railway Station several times a day.  Buses from Pattaya and Chiang Mai go to the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Top Hotels </h2><p>  There are more than enough hotels in Hua Hin in Thailand.

The beach is visited by many tourists, but despite this, you can always find a place to sit here to sunbathe on the white sand or to put a sun lounger.  Beach vendors walk along the shore, offering tourists an interesting menu, so you can always save on lunch in a restaurant. </p><p>  There are other beaches beyond the city limits, but they take longer to reach, so they are not as popular as the city ones.  Tourists fell in love with the beach, which is located at the foot of Khao Tao.  From this place you can see a tall statue of Buddha. </p><p>  If we talk about the myths and reality of Hua hin in Thailand, then he may disappoint some tourists with the fact that the sea is shallow, and after a storm many jellyfish are thrown ashore. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homeiswhereyourbagis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea coast and vacationers" class="if uuid-3027165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3027165.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Hua Hin in Thailand, a photo of which will be presented below, stands out among other resorts for its climate. </p><p>  If we talk about the average annual daytime temperatures, they range from 29 to 30 degrees Celsius.

According to this indicator, the city is one of the best.  However, you should still consider the rainy season so that Hua Hin Island in Thailand does not disappoint you, since the sky will still be cloudy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.duohop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clean resort beach" class="if uuid-3027180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3027180.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  According to reviews of Hua Hin <span>in Thailand,</span> there is <span>entertainment</span> for every taste.

It was erected by order of Rama VII.  Here you can buy fish, meat, as well as fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  Popular among tourists is the night market, which sells all kinds of products, marine reptiles, spices.

And at the fishing pier, fresh seafood is sold. </p><h2>  Cuisine and restaurants </h2><p>  In the city it is not at all difficult to find a restaurant with a suitable cuisine for you.  Hua Hin has a large number of different establishments where you can eat well for little money.  Some of them offer visitors nightly buffets with international or national cuisine, as well as with performances that perform classical Thai dances. </p><p>  Naresdamri Street is famous for its fish restaurants, which offer stunning sea views.  Prices here will be higher than in other areas of Hua Hin. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  After examining the reviews of Hua Hin in Thailand, we can draw conclusions regarding the disadvantages and advantages of the resort. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings are beaches, which, by the standards of the country, are not the best.  Also prices are above average. </p><p>  Of the advantages - a cool climate in comparison with other resorts, the proximity of the city and the capital, a large number of attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuoni.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The amazing nature of Hua hin" class="if uuid-3027160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3027160.jpg"></div><h2>  Stay tips </h2><p>  For the trip to go well, you need to know that: </p><ol><li>  Tourists should respect the Buddhist shrines, because there will be serious punishments for their desecration. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the locals are very hospitable, you can not discuss the royal family with them - this is a taboo. </li><li>  It is forbidden to visit temples and shrines in shoes, bright and open clothes.  This is considered a very gross violation. </li><li>  If you decide to visit the local cinema, then before the start of the session the royal anthem will surely sound, which must be listened to while standing. </li><li>  Leave tips in cafes and restaurants, approximately 10-15% of the total bill. </li><li>  In most cases, local shops are open for 12 hours.  Somewhere from 8:00 in the morning until 18:00 in the evening.  But there are day and night markets, where it is very profitable to buy products. </li><li>  People involved in sports are advised to pay attention to local clothing and accessories.  They are of good quality and affordable prices. </li><li>  If you plan to bring home an ivory souvenir or a Buddha figurine, then you will not succeed, since such goods cannot be exported from Thailand.  It is also forbidden to export antiques. </li><li>  Always check if photography is allowed. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.dronestagr.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biggest buddha statue" class="if uuid-3027168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3027168.jpg"></div><h2>  Hua hin reviews in Thailand </h2><p>  In most cases, resort reviews are positive.  Tourists note good weather conditions, many interesting places and a good beach.  Many people like the flavor of this country and its markets, which sell many interesting products.  Celebrate the calm and quiet atmosphere of the city, which is not found in other Thai resorts. </p><p>  But there are those whom the resort has disappointed.  Most often they complain about jellyfish and the unattractive view of the city.  It all depends on your desires and preferences, therefore, carefully study the information about the city before planning a trip there, so that later you do not have to regret it. </p><p>  Many recommend first renting a hotel for a couple of days, and then renting an apartment.  Searching better on the spot and on your own, so living will be much cheaper. </p><p>  Hua Hin in Thailand, whose photos were presented in this article, is an interesting resort that will suit everyone.  Here is a good beach, cuisine, many attractions and entertainment for every taste.  Also, local residents are very good towards tourists, so communication problems should not arise. </p>
