    <h2>  Standard version </h2><p>  The standard modification of the Phantom 3 quadrocopter is delivered in the original cardboard packaging.  Scope of delivery includes: </p><ul data-id="d8c885b45c259"><li>  Quadcopter DJI Phantom 3. </li><li>  Intelligent <span>Li-Pol battery</span> . </li><li>  Standard charge at 57 W. </li><li>  The control panel with a communication range of 500 meters. </li><li>  Set of 4 spare propellers. </li><li>  Instructions for use, a cover for transporting the blades, an envelope and stickers on the body. </li><li>  Cable for connecting to a computer. </li></ul><p>  Judging by the <span>reviews</span> left on the <span>Phantom 3 Standard</span> quadrocopter <span>,</span> its equipment is no different from other versions - Advanced and Professional.  The only difference is that the Pro version includes a high-capacity charger. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The appearance of the quadrocopter </h2><p>  The case of the third Phantom, like other versions, is made of high-impact plastic, resistant to shock.  The quadcopter is completely white, the only exception is the inscriptions and stickers.  Some details are made of metal, which is noted in the reviews on Phantom 3 by users - for example, the Phantom inscription located on the case and the suspension of the camera module.  Compared with previous models, the standard version of the drone is slightly less in weight, which has a positive effect on its flight characteristics.  The design of the quadrocopter has not changed and in many ways resembles, judging by the reviews, the DJI Phantom 3 Advanced and Professional versions.  The developers only replaced metal parts with plastic and improved the arrangement of elements inside the case. </p><p>  Standard differs from Pro and Advanced modifications only in the color of the stickers located on the case.  Owners of quadrocopters indicate in the reviews on DJI Phantom 3 Professional gold nameplates, with Advanced - silver and red with Standard.  The rest of the design is absolutely identical for all three models. </p>

    <h2>  Ghost power </h2><p>  The standard version of Phantom 3 uses a 4480 mAh battery as its battery.  Despite the fact that the weight of the quadrocopter has decreased significantly, users in the reviews on Phantom 3 noted that the flight time did not increase, making up the previous 23 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The battery weighs just 365 grams.  The manufacturer assures that the quadrocopter‚Äôs battery is intelligent, but reviews on Phantom 3 Professional, Standard and Advanced suggest that it takes more than an hour to fully charge.  On the official DJI website, you can purchase a more powerful <span>100 W</span> charger <span>,</span> which will significantly reduce battery charging time.  Owners of the Phantom 3 Advanced quadrocopter in reviews say that it is advisable to cool the battery in a natural way before charging, since the developer was not able to eliminate the problem of its overheating during operation.  The best option is to purchase an additional battery, which will cost the user $ 149, and an improved charger - $ 85. </p><h2>  Quadrocopter Camera Features </h2><p>  The main reason for the release of Standard was that many users simply could not purchase other versions of the drone because of their high cost.  The developers quickly solved the problem by releasing a simplified version of the quadrocopter, which, however, got a better camera than in the Phantom 3 Advanced - in the reviews, the owners of the drones separately mentioned this innovation. </p><p>  The robotic camera mount is made of metal and has three axes.  The camera itself is a twelve-megapixel quadrocopter, made by Sony.  The model retained its previous characteristics: a viewing angle of 94 degrees, the ability to save photos in a resolution of 4000x3000 pixels in RAW and JPG formats, auto-exposure bracketing.  Quadrocopter functionality allows you to record time-lapse video and video in UltraHD resolution.  The updated camera in the Standard version is a cross between the Advanced and Pro versions: in the reviews on Phantom 3 it is noted that in the Professional model the video is recorded in 4K, and in Advanced - in FullHD. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  All videos and photos can be recorded on micro-SD and SDHX memory cards.  When you connect a smartphone or tablet to the quadrocopter‚Äôs control panel and have a Wi-Fi signal, the video can be broadcast in HD resolution on the gadget. </p><h2>  The difference between Professional, Advanced and Standard </h2><p>  The owners of all three versions of Phantom 3 quadrocopters in the reviews noted the following differences between the modifications: </p><ul data-id="67adc8db84d8b"><li>  Recorded video resolution: 4K for Professional, 2.7K for Standard and FullHD for Advanced. </li><li>  The quadcopter's pro model comes with a 100 W high-power charger, while Standard and Advanced kits include a regular 57 W charger. </li><li>  The control panel of the Standard model is simpler and more convenient to use; </li><li>  Compared to the Professional and Advanced versions, the range and altitude of the Standard version are reduced by four times. </li><li>  The Standard model does not support the Overflow function and the GLONASS positioning system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Additional features and drone control </h2><p>  The range of communication with the quadrocopter was significantly reduced in the Standard version: if earlier it was two kilometers, now it is five hundred meters.  At the same time, the function of automatic return home Return Home remained unchanged.  Other functions available in other versions of the quadrocopter have also been preserved: soft landing, Follow Me autopilot and the Beginner mode.  The communication range in the Beginner mode is 30 meters, which is enough for training and gaining quadrocopter control skills.  The maximum flight altitude is also reduced and is 120 meters, which is why in this mode it is impossible to shoot panoramic video and photos. </p><p>  The ergonomics of the control panel remained unchanged, but the number of buttons on it decreased.  The manufacturer left only the most necessary keys - two sticks and three-position switches for modes and camera.  The movement of the quadrocopter around the axis and vertically is controlled by the left stick, the horizontal movement by the right stick.  On the back of the remote control there is a metal bracket that makes it easy to carry, and on top is a mount for a smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Mobile software </h2><p>  Quadrocopter developer Phantom is launching a special DJI Go app for iOS and Android.  To configure and control the drone, you must install the software on your smartphone or tablet and connect the gadget to the Wi-Fi network created by the quadrocopter control panel.  For normal flights, a smartphone with an installed application is not required, but without them it is impossible to control the camera and track the readings of the built-in sensors.  For this reason, flights without a smartphone and DJI Go program, it is advisable to perform only short distances in the mode for novice pilots. </p><p>  The image from the quadrocopter camera is displayed on the smartphone screen, and the video recording and photo creation keys are located on the side.  A map of the terrain over which the flyby is carried out is displayed in the lower left corner of the screen.  The current location of the quadrocopter is displayed if there is a GPS signal.  At the top of the screen are the flight mode icons, GPS signal strength, battery level and radio signal quality.  Airspeed and altitude are displayed at the bottom of the screen. </p><p>  The DJI Go program contains a large number of settings, which you should not adjust without the availability of appropriate skills, since many of them can cause pilot errors. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The cost of the quadcopter Phantom 3 Standard on the official website of the manufacturer is $ 499.  The consumer for such a price gets a high-class and reliable quadrocopter with a great camera and good autonomy.  Despite the fact that such a price seems too high for many, DJI drones fully justify the money spent on them. </p>
