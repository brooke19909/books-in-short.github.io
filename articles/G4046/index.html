In addition, the list of visa-free countries for Russians is not so great. </p><p>  If you exclude the familiar to all of Egypt and distant exotic countries with a long flight, you should pay attention to resort hotels in the UAE.  A visa to this country is issued easily and quickly (within a week), and pricing policy has changed significantly in recent years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="al seef hotel 3" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29995/713139.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  If you do not consider the pathos of expensive hotels like Atlantis, located on the artificially built island of Palma, you can choose quite acceptable options for quality relaxation at a very affordable price. </p><p>  So, you decided to go to the UAE.  Tours, prices for which are more affordable (from 20,100 rubles for two for seven days and nights), offer accommodation in hotels located away from the beach, where you can get on the hotel's shuttle bus or on your own. </p><p>  Please note that in <span>Dubai, hotels</span> on the first line are quite expensive.  That is why a significant part of tourists choose to relax in the emirate called Sharjah, located just twenty minutes from Dubai. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sharjah Features </h2><p>  Of the seven emirates that are members of the UAE, the oldest and therefore conservative is Sharjah.  City streets and public beaches do not allow women in very revealing clothing, and men in shorts. </p><p>  This does not mean that you should close with a burqa, but you still need to cover your shoulders, d√©collet√© and knees.  Sunbathing without the upper part of a bathing suit is prohibited even on private hotel beaches.  The press mentions cases where European tourists were arrested for appearing on the street in defiant clothes. </p><p>  The emirates are an Islamic country and require compliance with <span>Sharia law</span> from both local residents and guests.  The use of alcohol in public places is absolutely unacceptable.  Even with the all-inclusive system in hotels, alcoholic beverages are taboo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharjah city" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29995/713374.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, in the UAE, and even more so in Sharjah, it is very difficult to buy alcohol.  Thanks to this, vacation for families with small children becomes even more comfortable. </p><p>  If you want a really calm and measured rest without noisy drunk parties in the neighborhood, Sharjah, which is only well reviewed by tourists, is perfect for you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The only place to have a drink in Sharjah is the Wanderers Club, opened in 1977 for adherents of rugby and diving.  There is a British bar with <span>classic English</span> food and traditional spirits.  Visiting the club is allowed only to its members and their guests. </p><h2>  Weather in Sharjah </h2><p>  One of the main reasons for choosing a vacation in the UAE is the weather.  Sharjah is most convenient for visiting from October to April, when the air temperature does not rise above thirty-five degrees.  The rest of the year, the weather in all emirates is very hot and hard to tolerate by our tourists.  The water temperature is comfortable all year and is + 19-24 degrees. </p><h2>  Description of the Emirate of Sharjah </h2><p>  Sharjah is the most unusual emirate in the UAE, located in several geographical areas, with deserts, mountains and endless sandy beaches of the Persian and Oman gulfs, green parks and beautiful gardens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="uae tours prices" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29995/713371.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists are attracted by the rich history and cultural traditions, many museums and monuments, cozy restaurants and colorful <span>oriental bazaars.</span>  Prices in Sharjah are much lower than in other Emirates (15-20%).

UAE is a country where there is something to see.  Thanks to the close proximity of Sharjah and Dubai, Al Sif residents can visit famous Dubai attractions. </p><p>  In the morning, having breakfast in the hotel restaurant, you can soak up the beach, and after lunch or in the evening go to the mecca of the country's entertainment.  There, experts advise visiting the green promenade Marina, look at Palm Jumeirah, Atlantis, Wave and Sail, as well as visit the observation deck of the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa. </p><p>  In order to see everything interesting, you will not have enough for a month, therefore, settling for this in expensive hotels in Dubai, according to lovers of holidays in the Emirates, is irrational.
