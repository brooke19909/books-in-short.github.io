The calculation of the insurance premium is made according to the insurance rate.  Legislatively, the <span>insurance rate is</span> defined as the rate of the insurance premium from the <span>insurance object</span> or unit of the sum insured. </p><p>  The insurance premium must be sufficient to: </p><ul><li>  coverage of expected claims throughout the insurance period; </li><li>  creation of insurance reserves; </li><li>  cover the costs of the <span>insurance company</span> in the conduct of business; </li><li>  providing a certain amount of profit. </li></ul><p>  That part of it, at the expense of which the insurance fund is formed, that is, intended exclusively for insurance payments, is called the net premium, while the part aimed at covering the expenses of the insurer during the insurance is called the load.  The net premium, therefore, is the cost of insurance, excluding the costs of it held by the insurer.  In fact, an insurance premium is a combination of net premium and load, it is also called gross premium. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Types of Insurance Premium</strong> </p><p>  The various technical aspects of the <span>premium are</span> characterized by different concepts. </p><p>  By appointment, it is divided into: </p><ul><li>  risk premium designed to cover risk; </li></ul><ul><li>  the funded contribution, which is present in life insurance contracts and covers the payments of the insured when the insurance expires; </li></ul><ul><li>  net premium, which covers insurance payments for a specific period of time for a certain type of insurance; </li></ul><ul><li>  a sufficient contribution equal to the sum of the load and net premium, which are included in the costs of the insurer; </li></ul><ul><li>  <span>the</span> insurer's <span>tariff rate</span> , which consists of a sufficient contribution, as well as premiums necessary to cover costs associated with various preventive measures, propaganda and advertising, and more. </li></ul><p>  By the nature of the <span>risks, the insurance</span> premium is classified as in-kind, which covers the risk for a specific period of time, and a fixed one that does not change with time, that is, constant. </p><p>  Insurance premiums are subdivided according to the form of payment into: </p><ul><li>  one-time, which are fully paid in advance by the insured; </li></ul><ul><li>  the current installment is a certain part of the one-time premium, as it is part of the obligations undertaken by the insured with respect to the insurer; </li></ul><ul><li>  installment premium - a one-time premium is divided into an annual one, which takes into account the economic capabilities of the insured, and it, in turn, can be divided into monthly, quarterly, semi-annual (equal parts). </li></ul><p>  It is customary to divide insurance premiums by time of payment, by their reflection in the balance sheet of the insurance company and by value. </p>
