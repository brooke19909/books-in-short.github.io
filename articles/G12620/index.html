Only one device was ready for launch on the smartphone market.  It was Xperia S. One might wonder: ‚ÄúWhat was wrong with the rest of the devices?‚Äù.  Everything is very simple: they were incomplete, not optimized in order to produce them in series. </p><h2>  Background of creation </h2><p>  The company could hardly offer anything to mobile operators and the smartphone market.  The only move that could keep Sony afloat is to make a large circulation of models that have the same hardware platform.  It was supposed to reduce the cost of devices so that their purchase was beneficial to users, but at the same time brought the maximum possible profit to the company‚Äôs pocket. </p><p>  This concept spawned the Sony Xperia Miro.  We will analyze the reviews about the device in this article and try to find out what strengths and weaknesses the smartphone has.  In addition, we will figure out which user it is designed for. </p><p>  It is easy to notice similar design elements in the Xperia S and Sony Xperia Miro ST23I.  User reviews also confirm this fact.  But one cannot be limited to design alone, therefore, we will quickly go through the design elements, and then we will talk about the filling of the device and its speed, technical characteristics. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  It has been noted more than once that the company clearly needs new, more creative designers.  Either they have absolutely no imagination, or they have serious problems with free time.  Why is this thesis true?  If you look, for example, on the U and Solo models, and then on the object of our review, then distinguishing them immediately will be quite problematic.  Designs are very similar to each other, and you can not argue with that. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the case of Sony Xperia Miro, the reviews suggest that the difference between the named models is played only by a small curvature that takes place under the screen of the device.  Users who have already more or less begun to navigate the <span>screen sizes</span> can also note a reduced diagonal and a reduced resolution. </p><p>  Maybe for some it will look ridiculous, but Sony engineers firmly believe that if the hardware keys were moved to new positions or simply changed, then this parameter is already considered a new design.  In fact, this can be argued, but this is not about that. </p><h2>  A look on the edge </h2>

    <p>  Under the screen, you can find the control and navigation keys.  In a situation with Sony Xperia Miro, reviews say that the keys are touch, not mechanical.  Above the screen is the <span>front camera.</span>  You can notice it without any problems, because the engineers did not even think to hide it.  A negative point for the model is the fact that there is no light sensor in the device. </p><p>  At the top there is a jack for a wired headset standard 3.5 mm.  There is also a power button with which you can turn the phone on and off, and also lock the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the left flank we have a connector for synchronizing with a PC.  It is standardly type MicroUSB.  On the opposite side is the key with which you can adjust the volume of the device and play music. </p><p>  On the bottom face is the main microphone.  There is also a small indent.  Its purpose is to make it convenient for the user to remove the cover.  With the help of indentation, it can be easily pry. </p><p>  Well, the rear camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  Next to it is an LED-type flash and an additional speakerphone. </p><p>  The design can not be called original.  There is a small update in this regard.  It consists of a light indicator that has been integrated into the box under the hardware keys.  If a text message arrives on the phone or an incoming call is fixed, the indicator will begin to pulse.  But it is performed at an ordinary level, without access to the settings.  As they say, cheap and cheerful. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, Sony is betting on the availability of the phone.  And as a benefit to buyers, they are trying to imagine a screen.  The Sony Xperia Miro also belongs to the budget type, reviews say that you can‚Äôt count on more.  The device screen has a resolution of 320 by 480 pixels.  Its diagonal is 3.5 inches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If we talk about color reproduction, then on a five-point scale, she confidently went to 4, but then something happened, and she got stuck halfway.  Engineers made an attempt to hide the display flaws through the use of a <span>user interface.</span>  But in sunlight, the screen burns out, and this could not be avoided.  The sensor has an average responsiveness.  But the phone belongs to the budget category, so this is not surprising. </p><p>  It is difficult to hide the grit from the experienced eye, which is the case with the Sony Xperia Miro ST23I.  User reviews say that if you look at the icons, you can clearly see the individual pixels that make up the overall picture.  The problem, again, is the low resolution and low pixel density per inch. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The battery of the device has a capacity of 1460 mAh.  Sony Xperia Miro, whose characteristics are technically modestly evaluated, does not work with such autonomous power for a long time.  However, an ordinary user will be able to spend the whole day with the phone without worrying about recharging it. </p><p>  Strange things sometimes happen to the battery of this model.  At times, the Sony Xperia Miro ST23I does not turn on, whatever the user would do.  In such situations, do not worry prematurely.  You just need to check the reliability of the connection of the contacts.  It should be said right away that a similar problem was observed in the case of other Sony models. </p><p>  In general, according to the logic of things, the power consumption of the phone should not be so high.  The fact is that the hardware stuffing of the smartphone is clearly not the best, therefore, it will not just consume energy just like that. </p><p>  Having correctly distributed the load, in principle, you can squeeze out two days of battery life from the device.  But it is better for active users to turn their eyes to more powerful models, although one of the few advantages that distinguish Miro is its operating time. </p><h2>  Communications kit </h2>

    <p>  In this regard, can not surprise Sony Xperia Miro.  Communication characteristics are quite standard for an ordinary device running the Android operating system. </p><p>  The Wi-Fi wireless module works in the b and g bands, but the n standard does not support.  The device can ‚Äúdistribute‚Äù the Internet to other devices by creating an access point. </p><p>  Bluetooth is available, its version is 2.0.  There should be no problems with profiles. </p><p>  MicroUSB-connector allows you to synchronize the device with a personal computer or laptop, to exchange files.  Some modes are not supported because the engineers decided that the device did not need them. </p><p>  As we can see, the smartphone Sony ST23I Xperia Miro has nothing special in communication stuffing.  But this is not surprising, since the device belongs to the budget type.  But in general, everything is not bad, especially for ordinary users. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  Probably one of the key features of Sony is the move when they use old platforms in new devices.  The last few years about the Qualcomm family, or rather, the 7225 model was not heard.  And suddenly this platform integrates into the Sony Xperia Miro smartphone. </p><p>  Of course, it was slightly modified and modernized.  So, <span>the processor frequency was</span> increased, the architecture was changed, the work was optimized in some way.  But it could have been better.  Applications run for a long time, although the vast majority work stably.  The processor is weak, its work is easily demonstrated by an Internet browser.  ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù pages are loaded for a long time, this can lead to even calm users. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  The RAM built into the device is 512 MB.  Some users ask what to do if the Sony Xperia Miro does not turn on.  RAM can contribute here if the phone was in working condition.  The fact is that it sometimes freezes and therefore does not respond to user requests.  The phone seems to be turned off, but it is not.  Therefore, you can try to simply remove the battery and turn on the device again. </p><p>  For personal needs of the user in the device allocated 2 GB of <span>long-term memory.</span>  The phone has a slot for microSD memory cards.  The maximum size of flash drives that are supported by Miro can be 32 GB. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The rear camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  It is equipped with auto focus.  Also, next to the camera is an LED flash.  The user interface has not changed.  Everything remained the same as it was in Xperia P. It has all the necessary elements, so complaining about an unchanged interface is impractical.  You can take a picture only with the touch button on the screen, since there is no shutter key. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Miro manual, which comes bundled with the phone, will allow you to quickly get used to the management of even the most inexperienced user.  Ease of use and control is another advantage of this model, which confidently falls into the piggy bank of the device. </p><p>  There are no problems with sound quality.  The speaker volume is high.  Skipping the incoming signal will not allow a high volume call.  Communication distortion is minimized.  All this together makes the device pretty enough for people who like to talk on the phone all day. </p><p>  After some time, users are wondering about how to flash Sony Xperia Miro ST23I.  Updates come out not so often, which, however, is not surprising.  For Sony Xperia Miro firmware is available on the official website of the manufacturer, and indeed, it is not difficult to find it on the open spaces of the international network.  Third-party programs will also help stabilize the operation of the device.  If you install drivers on the Sony Xperia Miro ST23I, it‚Äôs easy to get the maximum performance out of the device. </p><p>  Well, for the budget segment, the model is quite decent.  If the engineers worked on the chipset, on the processor, it might be possible to bring the device to a new level, better.  However, all this is still beyond the scope of the company's plans, since they have their own policies and their own views on the promotion of smartphones in the market. </p>
