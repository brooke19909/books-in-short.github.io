  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where and how was Bandera killed: details of death</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After 60 years, the world again cares about how they killed Bandera.  The death sentence to the executioner and tormentor of tens of thousands of citizens of the Soviet Union: Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Jews, issued by the Supreme Court of the USSR, was carried out on 10/15/1959.  This was not an ordinary murder, but an act of retribution for monstrous atrocities, therefore, probably, it generated a lot of rumors and speculation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ukraina.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who killed Stepan Bandera" class="if uuid-3252815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3252815.jpg"></div><h2>  How did it all happen </h2><p>  Warmed by British intelligence and the government of West Germany, Stepan Bandera lived in Munich under the name of Stefan Popel.  After the verdict was passed in 1949, he settled in Germany and went, as they say, into a deep underground, well aware that the punishment for his crimes would come sooner or later, since more than one attempt was made on him.  How was Bandera killed? </p><p>  He kept guard, always carried weapons with him.  Too many people in the world dreamed to settle accounts with him.  The moment of retribution came only 10 years after the death sentence was imposed on him, when he, having lost his vigilance, returned home alone. </p><p>  Opening the porch door, he began to climb the stairs.  The neighbors, hearing a scream, went out into the porch, where they saw a man lying on the stairs.  He was in the blood.  There was no one else in the entrance.  The pop of the shot was quiet, so no one heard him.  An ambulance called in took the person to the hospital.  He died on the way.  The murder of Stepan Bandera is a punishment for innocently tortured, alive burned, crucified, sawn, dead people in terrible torment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zrada.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where was bandera killed" class="if uuid-3252821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3252821.jpg"></div><h2>  Patient with a gun </h2><p>  A small man with sparse hairs on his bald head, who looked like a child with the head of an old man, was delivered to one of the clinics in Munich.  His skull base was broken, his head was bleeding, and blood on his face.  To the confusion of the doctors, he put a pistol in a holster in his belt. </p><p>  They were also embarrassed by the fact that the smell of bitter almonds, characteristic of potassium cyanide, emanates from the face of this unknown.  There was no doubt, the man did not die from a head injury, which he most likely received as a result of a fall.  He was poisoned by strong poison. </p><h2>  What the police found </h2><p>  Police were called in to establish who killed Stepan Bandera.  This person was well known in Nazi Germany, so it was not difficult to determine his real name.  As a result of the investigation, it was revealed that, despite the fact that documents were found under him in the name of S. Popel, in fact it was a Ukrainian nationalist, collaborator, terrorist Stepan Bandera.  How they killed him was beyond doubt: he was poisoned.  It remained to find out who did it.  The detectives received the answer to this question much later. </p><p>  Thus ended the life of the odious person, the executioner of thousands of civilians, including children, Red Army soldiers, Soviet workers, teachers, doctors, ordinary Ukrainian villagers.  It was under his leadership that thousands of Jews were exterminated, all whose fault consisted of belonging to the Jewish nation.  Many of them were not just killed, but died in the most sophisticated torment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__rrj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__rrj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__rrj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__rrj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__rrj"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who killed Bandera in 1959 </h2><p>  Not one attempt was committed on him, but they all ended in failure.  The leader of Ukrainian nationalists was liquidated by Bogdan Stashinsky, an agent of the Soviet special services, who appeared in Munich in May 1959 under the name of Hans Joachim Budait, a native of Dortmund.  According to Soviet agents, Bandera is also located in Munich, where the leaders of the OUN have fled from retaliation. </p><p>  He lived here with his family on fake documents.  A KGB agent found him at a rally in a cemetery dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the death of Eugene Konovalts.  It was not difficult for an experienced agent to track down his place of residence and begin preparatory work for the destruction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="argumentua.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how was bandera killed" class="if uuid-3252819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3252819.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing for the Elimination </h2><p>  Bandera lived in Munich on Chrismantstrasse 7. Stashinsky reported this to the KGB leadership.  He received a weapon with which to be eliminated, as well as an antidote for the attacker.  Stashinsky watched him for nine months, waiting for an opportunity. </p><p>  He knew all his habits and habits, made a duplicate of the key to the entrance, where Bandera was subsequently killed.  Getting to him was not easy.  He always went with security and was armed with a pistol, as he was afraid of revenge from the KGB, knowing full well that his atrocities would not be left without punishment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="lviv1256.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="killing bandera in munich" class="if uuid-3253003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2547/3253003.jpg"></div><h2>  Retribution </h2><p>  The efforts of the agent were not in vain.  He waited until 10/15/1959, at lunch, Bandera, along with his secretary, entered the market.  After that, reaching the house, he nonchalantly released the guards and one headed for the porch.  Outstripping him, Stashinsky was the first to enter there, climbed the top floor and took the antidote.  At this time, the Nazi opened the door, entered the porch and began to climb the stairs.  The liquidator went to meet him.  Having caught up with Bandera, he shot poison in his face and quickly went out into the street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-reading.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bandera killed Ukrainians" class="if uuid-3252822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3252822.jpg"></div><h2>  Weapon of retaliation </h2><p>  How was Bandera killed?  With the help of special weapons, the use of which did not leave him a chance of survival.  It was a special pistol in which a double-barrel cylinder was inserted, inside it were ampoules filled with potassium cyanide.  When you pull the trigger, the powder charge broke the ampoule, and the poison was sprayed at a distance of 1 meter.  When inhaled vapors, a person lost consciousness, his heart stopped. </p><p>  For those who used it, a special antidote was sent, which should be taken before use.  This weapon was well known to the performer, since in 1957 with the help of a syringe he destroyed the leader of the OUN Lev Rebeta. </p><h2>  Bogdan Stashinsky </h2><p>  The son of nationalists in Eastern Galicia (Western Ukraine), a member of the OUN was recruited in the early 50s of the KGB, was trained in a special school in Kiev, and then was introduced into the squad of nationalists.  He transmitted information about its composition and deployment to the Soviet authorities.  All OUN members were destroyed.  Bandera, living in Germany, mistook him for their own. </p><p>  Therefore, the KGB leadership decided to engage him in an operation to destroy the leaders of the OUN.  Stashinsky brilliantly dealt with this.  He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.  His request to marry a German woman and live with her in East Germany was also granted. </p><p>  That is what led him to betrayal.  He told Inga about the participation in the liquidation of the two leaders of the OUN.  She, fearing revenge on the part of Ukrainian nationalists, as well as the liquidation by Soviet intelligence of him, as a valuable witness, persuaded him to get to the West and surrender. </p><p>  They fled to Germany, where Stashinsky admitted that he was an agent of the KGB and killed two leaders of the OUN, including the murder of Bandera.  What year did this happen?  It is very interesting.  In 1961, the day before the construction of the Berlin Wall.  He was tried and sentenced to 8 years in prison, of which he spent 4 years. After that, he underwent plastic surgery and, according to some reports, he moved to South Africa and, according to others, to the USA. </p><h2>  Who is Bandera? </h2><p>  After they killed Bandera, the event attracted the attention of the public in Western countries, where he was practically not known.  This is a Ukrainian follower of integral nationalism, requiring Western Ukrainians to be submissive to his ideas, which most of them did not share.  Therefore, the victims were not only Russians, Poles, Jews, but the majority of Ukrainians who wanted to live in peace and harmony with other peoples. </p><p>  The assassination of Bandera in Munich was the result of total terror conducted in Western Ukraine, which was proclaimed the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe party of Ukrainian nationalists.  Who is S. Bandera?  - The head of the OUN (b), a collaborator who collaborated with the Nazis, after the war - with the American and British intelligence, a terrorist. </p><p>  He spent two years in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany, but, unlike the others, all the conditions for a normal life were created in his ‚Äúcell‚Äù.  He did not wear a robe, but walked in a suit, freely moving around the territory.  He was visited by a wife who lived nearby.  And after such an imprisonment, he, as a potential ally of the Third Reich, returns to his homeland and organizes a resistance movement against the advancing Soviet troops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="usa-evote.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="German camp" class="if uuid-3253384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3253384.jpg"></div><h2>  Did Bandera collaborate with the German fascists? </h2><p>  Those who did not cooperate were executed, died in dungeons, or fought against the Nazis underground.  Bandera spent two years in a concentration camp, leading the UPA, sending money to Ukraine for organization through his regularly visiting wife.  Is this perhaps for the enemy of the Reich?  Not.  Here people of the same views converged, but of different nationalities who needed each other.  Maybe they hated it, but they collaborated. </p><p>  On the need for cooperation with Bandera, Himmler said that they are needed only to poison and destroy the Slavs, and then it is necessary to eliminate this beast - Bandera, since they have no place among people.  With whom did the OUN UPA fight, with the punitive occupiers?  No, with partisans, civilians.  The OUN were not underground during the years of German occupation; they existed openly.  Could partisans and underground fighters fighting the Nazis exist openly?  The question is simply not appropriate. </p><p>  The top of the OUN was taken to Germany, elementary in order to lead the OUN of the UPA under the leadership of the Germans.  The Germans did not trust him and were afraid of re-recounting.  His curators were Abwehr officers.  The order for the Germans - first of all, everyone did his own thing.  They are not amateurs, they knew, if not all, then a lot.  After the war, most of the German agents fell into the hands of the Americans and the British, so there are no former agents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="io.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did the bandera kill" class="if uuid-3252820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3252820.jpg"></div><h2>  Two polar views </h2><p>  Through the efforts of modern followers of Bandera, today he was elevated to the rank of liberator of the entire Ukrainian people from Polish, German and Soviet invaders.  But the Bandera organization fought not only with them, but also with its fellow countrymen, those who participated in the struggle for the liberation of Ukraine from the German invaders, who established peaceful life in the liberated territory.  Who were these people? </p><p>  Bandera killed Ukrainians, those who fought with the Nazis in the ranks of the Red Army, in partisans.  Bandera managed to restore not only the Soviets against themselves, but also their own people.  Self-defense units, called ‚Äúhawks,‚Äù offered them open resistance. </p><p>  It should be noted that the positive biographies of Bandera are written by his modern followers.  If you read the characteristics that his associates endowed with, those who knew him directly, they are not always flattering.  For example, Z. Muller, an employee of the Abverkomanda 202, testified that after Bandera was released from the camp, he continued to cooperate with the German special services and trained saboteurs from among the nationalists to drop them into the rear of the Red Army for subversive work. </p><p>  Colonel Abwehr E. Stolze, collaborating with him in Germany, gave him a characterization as a fanatic, careerist and bandit.  The head of the Security Council of the OUN, Matviyeko, the closest associate of Bandera, described him as a womanizer and family tyrant, beating his wife and possessing potential greed, a petty man who observes only his interests. </p><p>  It should be fair, Bandera was an outstanding person, a good organizer, a speaker, able to lead people.  But he was not strong, since cruelty is the lot of weak-minded people.  According to the American historian T. Snyder, he was a "fascist hero" and executioner. </p>
