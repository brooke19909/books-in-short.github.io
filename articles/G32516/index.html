This is a great gift to a close friend or boss.  One of the popular crafts is considered to be the ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù topiary, since it has the appearance of a large bright flower with many petals.  The middle is made out differently, using your imagination. </p><p>  You can create one sunflower on a strong stem or several small plants on winding stems.  Petals are made of double-sided colored paper, sheets of felt, satin or crepe ribbons, nylon strips or yellow or orange plastic bags. </p><p>  The article will present a master class on topiary "Sunflower".  You will learn what materials to use, how to strengthen the craft in a flower pot, from which the craftsmen assemble the middle of the flower so that it has the shape of a hemisphere, and also how it can be filled. </p><h2>  Components of the craft </h2><p>  Before you make your own do-it-yourself Topiary "Sunflower", let's carefully consider this craft.  It consists of several parts, work on which is done separately.  The main element of the composition, of course, is the flower itself.  Sometimes it is made flat using a circle of corrugated cardboard or a CD.  On a circle in several layers attached separately hot petals glue.  Basically they are made of elongated shape, although there are work loops or made using the kanzashi technique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.frei-atmen.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Satin Ribbon Sunflower" class="if uuid-3095976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3095976.jpg"></div><p>  The middle of the flower is filled as desired.  You can stick a family photo or a photo of a child, fill the space with an assembled strip of brown or black ribbon.  The sunflower topiary with coffee grains glued in the center looks spectacular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Important components of the crafts on which the whole structure is held are considered the rod and the container in which it is installed.  To do this, use a flower pot or any other vase.  The core is usually wrapped in green cloth or corrugated paper. </p><h2>  Making simple petals </h2><p>  Topiary "Sunflower" made of ribbons is a labor-consuming work, because it is necessary to collect a huge number of small parts.  The easiest way is to use a thin tape of yellow or orange color and fold each petal with a loop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunflower petals loops" class="if uuid-3096905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096905.jpg"></div><p>  As a basis for gluing elements, a circle of thick cardboard or a hemisphere of foam is used.  The stitches are glued in staggered layers so that all details are clearly visible. </p><h2>  Kansashi Petals </h2><p>  Topiary "Sunflower" looks beautiful if the petals are made using the kanzashi technique.  For beginners, we can offer one of the easy ways to fold the petal, it is shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make petals" class="if uuid-3096899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096899.jpg"></div><p>  It is more convenient to work with tweezers.  A piece of tape is folded at a right angle, and then its parts are combined.  The bottom edge is wrapped in the center on both sides and held with tweezers.  So that the ends of the tape are firmly connected, but at the same time do not split, they are scorched over the fire of a candle or a lighter.  When a large number of elements are created, you can collect a flower based on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pointed petals </h2><p>  If you are making a Sunflower topiary from satin ribbons, then let's look at another interesting way to make thin petals.  A strip of satin ribbon folds in half, and one edge is cut off at an acute angle.  Then, using tweezers, connect the edges together and singe with a candle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tipjunkie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunflower petals" class="if uuid-3096000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096000.jpg"></div><p>  A flat bottom edge can be assembled by folding the fabric three times in the center, as in the description of the previous sample.  At the end, firmly connect the ends with a candle. </p><h2>  Corrugated Paper Topiary </h2><p>  If this is your first time making the Sunflower Topiary, it will be easier to collect the flower from corrugated paper.  Petals are created from the same stripes, cutting one edge at an acute angle.  On the opposite side, the paper is collected in small folds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liagriffith.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper Topiary" class="if uuid-3096920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096920.jpg"></div><p>  Petals are pasted on the base, starting from the outer circle, in several rows.  The middle is filled with brown paper folded in a thin tube. </p><h2>  Topiary "Sunflower" from ribbons and coffee </h2><p>  The craft looks spectacular, the middle of which is filled with roasted coffee grains.  Stick them to the base with a glue gun.  It is first necessary to sort out the material and set aside to craft grain of the same size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stylowi.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunflower made of ribbons and coffee" class="if uuid-3095970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3095970.jpg"></div><p>  To create a hemisphere, masters use small tricks.  If the flower is performed on a circle of corrugated cardboard or a CD, then you can attach a crumpled newspaper to the center, creating a slight elevation.  So that it holds its shape well, it is recommended to additionally wrap the entire base with threads. </p><p>  You can make the bulk of the topiary on a foam ball or hemisphere.  Some for volume paste coffee grains in several layers, increasing their number closer to the middle of the flower. </p><h2>  Kernel </h2><p>  The stalk of the sunflower must be strong and strong in order to hold the voluminous craft.  They use a variety of rods - from thick wire, a straight branch of a tree, a plastic pipe, a cardboard sleeve from napkins, a wooden stick, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jak.iblog.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a topiary" class="if uuid-3095950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3095950.jpg"></div><p>  Topiary consists of both a single stem and several with different heights.  To hide the base, the core is wrapped with a green satin or crepe ribbon.  Striped corrugated paper can be used.  The edges are reinforced with hot melt adhesive on top and bottom.  It is necessary to supplement the design with several leaves of the same material.  They can also be added to the lower layer of flower petals.  The core is either inserted into the foam ball indentation, or attached to the back of the craft and hides under the fabric. </p><h2>  Installing Topiary in a Flower Pot </h2><p>  The paper craft is lightweight, so it will be enough to support the core in the container with pieces of polystyrene foam or a floral sponge, hiding them under the green sisal threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artsycraftsydad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to strengthen the rod" class="if uuid-3095989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3095989.jpg"></div><p>  Topiary "Sunflower" of ribbons, a master class on the manufacture of which is described in detail in the article, requires more reliable strengthening.  To do this, use a mixture of gypsum and water.  Water is gradually poured into the powder, stirred until the mixture acquires the consistency of thick sour cream.  Then you need to insert the rod, holding it in an upright position with the help of props.  For this purpose, you can make a paper ring, the diameter of which corresponds to the size of the upper part of the pot, and pull it tightly on the stem of the sunflower.  When the gypsum hardens, it is simply cut off with scissors and discarded. </p><p>  It remains only to cover the filler with decorative elements.  You can use artificial grass, sisal threads or pebbles painted with acrylic paint.  It will be interesting to decorate a sunflower with small insects: ladybirds or dragonflies, plant a butterfly on a petal or tie a bow from satin ribbons to the stem. </p><p>  As you can see, even novice masters can create such a craft.  The main thing is to do everything carefully and consistently. </p>
