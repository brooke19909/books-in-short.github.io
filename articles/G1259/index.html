The unique geographical location of a small piece of land is a huge delight for everyone who gets the opportunity to admire the African coast of Morocco, which is several kilometers away. </p><p>  Even in ancient times, an ancient city-state with a difficult fate was considered the legendary pillar of Hercules, beyond which you can see the end of the world.  Where the European continent is as close to Africa as possible, Gibraltar is at its narrowest point, causing disagreement between the two large countries. </p><h2>  Stumbling block </h2><p>  Mons Calpe, as it has long been called <span>overseas British territory,</span> has a long history.  For these lands, the vast majority of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is occupied by the Rock of Gibraltar, German tribes and Moors fought, and during the time of the Roman Empire the miniature state was under its rule. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XVII century, Spanish soldiers captured the land, which later passed under the terms of the imposed <span>Utrecht peace</span> to Britain.  For a long time, the territory with the 426-meter mountain was a stumbling block in the relations of two influential kingdoms. </p><p>  At a referendum of 1967, most residents of a small country expressed a desire to remain in the possession of Great Britain, and Spain, for a long time trying to challenge the fact that Gibraltar belonged, kept the border with it closed for seventeen years. </p><h2>  Country Business Card </h2><p>  A miniature country with a population of about thirty thousand attracts a large flow of tourists who want to get acquainted with "little England".  Hospitable Gibraltar, whose sights are striking in diversity, is primarily known for the limestone rock towering above the city - the hallmark of the peninsula.  You can climb it on foot, by taxi or by special funicular.  From the equipped observation deck, guests of the country enjoy a breathtaking panorama of the picturesque city lying at the foot of the coast of Spain and Africa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Caves formed in the rock </h2><p>  Caves formed as a result of natural processes attract thousands of travelers who admire the unique underground kingdom, which is famous outside the <span>country of Gibraltar</span> (Spain).  Sights created by nature itself are visited by about one million people a year.  According to ancient legends, under the strait is a secret multi-kilometer course. </p>

What to see? </h2><p>  Terrible-looking rock keeps the memory of the bloody wars that took place over many centuries.  In it, in addition to natural voids, there are many tunnels of artificial origin dug by the British.  Great Siege Tunnels - this is a whole defensive complex, many centuries containing the enemy.  Covered galleries, which played the role of communications, dungeons and warehouses for food, are proud of the self-governing British colony. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Gibraltar, the sights of which reflect the military past, will interest an ordinary tourist who discovered in 2005 an intricate labyrinth of underground communications.  Everyone can walk along the forts hidden from people's eyes with many winding passages widened during World War II.  Of course, the numerous <span>caves of the city-state</span> can hardly be examined in one day. </p><h2>  Moorish castle </h2><p>  Built in the Middle Ages, the Moorish castle is another good reason to visit amazing Gibraltar.  Sights built after the Arab fortifications were destroyed by the Spaniards were considered the main building of the region.  The defensive fortifications, which stretched from the sea to the upper part of the city, were rebuilt by the Moors, who conquered the territory in the XIV century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of gibltara" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1359279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The fortress, called the Tower of Honor, after the end of all wars turned into a city museum that receives all visitors, however, you can get acquainted with only four rooms on top of the castle, since the lower part is a stone monolith. </p><h2>  Gate for defense </h2><p>  Part of the defenses built during the years of British colonization are the Gates of Prince Edward, once part of the former city wall.  Prince Edward's Gate, defending the flanks of the bastion, is named after the commander of the infantry regiment.  The historical monument has been restored and is open to all tourists who have come to rest in Gibraltar (Great Britain).  Sights that have an ancient history and survived several wars keep traces of enemy artillery fire. </p>

    <p>  And very close is the famous Trafalgar cemetery, where two valiant defenders who fought for the independence of the state are buried.  About 68 are buried in the necropolis, built at the end of the XVIII century, although in fact there are much more graves. </p><h2>  The kingdom of wild magicians </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about what amazing Gibraltar is famous for the whole world, whose sights are not limited to viewing only historical monuments, I want to mention the wild monkeys that have become a symbol of the country.  This is the only place in Europe where magots live - Maghreb macaques.  Freely primate beggars for food, and a bag can even be stolen from gaping tourists. </p>

    <p>  The kingdom of monkeys is located in the Apes Den reserve, which is in the TOP-10 of the best attractions of Gibraltar.  Here you can take a walk with the whole family and get indescribable pleasure from communicating with funny animals.  Tourists are attracted by the opportunity to watch tailless animals live and even take pictures with them.  However, feeding the magicians is strictly prohibited, otherwise you can run into a large fine. </p><h2>  the main street </h2><p>  Gibraltar, the sights of which are the pride of the indigenous population, attracts tourists not only with its ancient history and picturesque views from the cliffs.  People often come here for the sake of excellent shopping, as the prices for goods in the state are much lower than in European boutiques.  Central street stretching along the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula is very popular with tourists, where souvenir shops, cozy beer restaurants, and entertainment venues are located.  Main Street is not for nothing called the main business and commercial artery of the city. </p>
