    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Are you planning to buy a private house?  You will have to pay attention to many factors.  And the first component is the appearance of the property.  Usually people try to buy houses that do not require major repairs.  An exception is if a complete overhaul is planned.  But in this case, it is recommended to look at the usual land. </p><p>  Often, the appearance of the house is reflected directly in the ad.  So it turns out to evaluate the conformity of price and offer.  If somewhere in the appearance of the building there are flaws, you can "bring down" the value of the property. </p><h2>  Basic data </h2><p>  When buying a home, what should I look for first?  Each buyer clearly knows what he wants to buy.  Accordingly, you need to look for an object that meets the advanced requests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is usually recommended to focus on the basic data of the property.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  locality; </li><li>  area; </li><li>  remoteness from the city; </li><li>  infrastructure; </li><li>  neighbors; </li><li>  building parameters (number of rooms, their size and so on). </li></ul><p>  All this will help to understand how the upcoming purchase meets the initial requirements.  In addition, for all of the above parameters, many can conclude how good the house or cottage is. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  When buying a house, what should I look for already during the initial personal inspection of the property?  On communications that are held to the facility.  The fact is that in some private houses for sale, there is neither water supply nor light.  Somewhere it will not work to carry out a phone or the Internet.  All of this is recommended to focus attention. </p><p>  Also, when examining the condition of the house, it is necessary to evaluate the pipes and other components.  Not too smiling the prospect of buying a building that will have to be repaired before moving.  And thoroughly. </p><p>  If there is no communication, it is recommended that the seller or realtor clarify why there are no options.  If you want to conduct the Internet in advance, it is best to find out the address of the building and call the provider to clarify this possibility.  It is likely that the house is being sold due to the fact that certain communications refuse or cannot lay it.  Then you can refrain from buying.  But that is not all! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Have to buy a new home?  The buyer should pay attention to such a factor as the value of the property.  Often, this indicator indicates the integrity of the seller, as well as the problem of the house. </p><p>  It is worth remembering: in a good area and in perfect condition, real estate is very expensive.  And if the price tag is low, this is an occasion to think: what is wrong?  At low prices, houses are sold only in case of urgent need.  But this is an extremely rare occurrence.  In Russia, it practically does not occur. </p>

    <p>  If the price is suspiciously low, it is best to ask the realtor or seller why this price was chosen.  Most likely, either a specific problem in the house or cottage will be called, which ‚Äúknocks down‚Äù the price, or no exact explanation will be given at all.  In the second case, it is recommended to postpone the purchase and find out exactly why real estate is cheap. </p><h2>  Plot </h2><p>  What other tips can I give?  <span>When buying a home what to look for?</span>  Experts also recommend a closer look at the site, which is adjacent to the house or cottage.  Usually there is at least a piece of land free from buildings. </p><p>  Very often in private sectors near houses there are gardens or gardens.  If the site does not look the best, abandoned for a long time - this is a good reason for bargaining.  It is best to look into all the buildings that are located on the territory.  And in advance to stipulate what will happen to the contents, for example, in a shed near the house. </p><h2>  In a buiding </h2><p>  What else?  Further it is necessary not only to check communications, but also some other components.  At the moment, it is recommended to even invite special appraisers to help quickly understand the real state of the home.  Usually this responsibility lies with the seller.  But the buyer has the right to call an assessment group. </p><p>  When buying a home what to look for?  Experts advise to look at the following points: </p><ol><li>  Doors  How they open, close, what is their condition, a separate item - the presence of locks. </li><li>  Window.  Density at closing, ease of opening, whether a draft is created. </li><li>  Attic.  Here, most often the landlord hides the "skeletons".  For example, leaves old and unnecessary things. </li><li>  Boiler.  In private homes, heating boilers are installed.  It is required to check the correct operation of this component. </li><li>  Walls and floor.  It is required to check for evenness and correct installation.  Also, the walls are checked for cracks and other damage. </li></ol>
