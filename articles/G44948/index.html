But there are great and outstanding women in this intellectual sport.  Nona Gaprindashvili for many years held the championship at the championships among women. </p><h2>  Chess biography </h2><p>  The future great athlete and international grandmaster was born in early May 1941 in Georgia.  Almost everyone in the family was fond of chess, so little Nona Gaprindashvili mastered this game from an early age.  This was facilitated by the fact that her brothers were constantly engaged with her and themselves participated in city competitions. </p>

    <p>  Nona accidentally hit her first championship.  Her brothers should have participated, but one of them caught a cold, and it was urgent to seek a replacement.  Nona was included in the list, and her first rival, who was much older and more experienced, she quickly put a checkmate, which attracted the attention of the coaches.  At the age of 12, she entered a chess school. </p><p>  The first leader and mentor of Nona Gaprindashvili is Karseladze Vakhtang Ilyich, who not only took care of her during training, but also protected her from enthusiastic audiences and fans during the championships.  For higher awards and competitions at the strongest level, the young chess player was prepared by the well-known trainer in the USSR, Mikhail Shishov, and was assisted by grandmaster Aivar Gipslis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nona Gaprindashvili, a chess player who has no equal to this day, has held her champion title for a record time for this game - for 16 years.  In subsequent championships, she was in 2nd or 3rd place. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Nona Gaprindashvili was born in a large family.  She had 5 older brothers, thanks to whom she became interested in chess.  The father of the future grandmaster worked in a technical school in the city of Zugdidi, where the whole family lived, as an accounting teacher.  Mother, Vera Grigolia, kept the household and kept order in the house. </p>
