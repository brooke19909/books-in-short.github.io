    <p>  But with a competent approach to the analysis of existing proposals on the most famous and popular method of saving funds - bank deposits - you can, in any case, receive small incomes and a sufficiently high level of investment reliability, without having any special knowledge.  So, let's figure out what are the beneficial deposits for pensioners, interest rates on pension deposits, and in general, where should I go to open a deposit? </p><h2>  How is a contribution made for senior citizens? </h2>

    <p>  But a little financial literacy in determining a suitable bank is still required.  In order to issue a deposit, some documents are required: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - passport or other document for identification; </p><p>  - TIN and, if necessary, other documents required by the bank (before going to the bank, it is best to check this list in advance); </p><p>  - pensioner's certificate - if it is planned to open a pension contribution. </p><p>  In a situation, if the pension will be transferred from another account, its details should be provided.  The rest of the operation to open a deposit is very simple: drawing up an agreement and depositing money takes no more than one hour.  Profitable deposits for pensioners do not provide for special requirements.  In addition, the reason for retirement does not matter.  If you have a <span>pension certificate</span> on hand <span>,</span> then the bank does not have any right to refuse to open a deposit, even if the pension is not provided for old age. </p><h2>  On what conditions are deposits made? </h2><p>  Since pensioner depositors are not a separate category of bank customers, it is therefore worth considering simple <span>bank deposits</span> and special pension ones. </p>

    <p>  When choosing the most advantageous offer for yourself, first of all, you should pay attention to several criteria: </p><p>  1. The interest rate is a key parameter of any contribution.  For the real profitability of the deposit, it should be higher than <span>the inflation rate</span> (in 2014 inflation amounted to 6.5%), and the higher this indicator, the more profitable it will be to invest money.  The most profitable deposits for pensioners do not always open <span>at high interest rates.</span>  This should also be remembered when opening a deposit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  2. Minimum <span>deposit</span> amount <span>.</span>  <span>Pension deposits</span> are usually issued from one thousand rubles (although there are deposits with a minimum threshold of one hundred rubles). </p><p>  3. The ability to deposit funds in the future, and how interest is accrued when the amount increases. </p><p>  4. How exactly are interest calculated.  They can be added to the total amount of the contribution and increase it. </p><p>  5. Is it possible to partially withdraw funds without early closure of the deposit.  The longer its validity, the more important this condition. </p><p>  6. In addition, it is also very important for pensioners that the contribution can be managed in the event of death without additional transactions.  Fortunately, banks have provided such an option. </p><p>  7. The possibility of extending the contribution (its prolongation).  The interest rate will be determined depending on the conditions for this deposit at the time of its extension. </p><p>  In addition, attention should be paid to the bank itself.  Given the current state of the banking system in our country, trusting your savings even with the largest institutions should be very cautious: it is practically not possible to predict in advance which bank will come into the view of regulators.  Profitable <span>deposits for pensioners</span> can be found in almost any financial institution, just look at what conditions are offered. </p>

    <p>  For this reason, if you want to open a deposit in excess of the maximum amount that can be reimbursed under the deposit insurance program (seven hundred thousand rubles), it is best to contact several banks at once and divide the amounts or contact one of the <span>state banks.</span> </p><h2>  What is the difference between a pension contribution and a simple deposit? </h2><p>  Formally, such contributions differ only in that a pension certificate is required to apply for a pension.  In addition, in most banks, beneficial deposits for pensioners are allowed to be opened only to those customers who keep their pension in the fund of this financial institution.  Still, the conditions of simple deposits and pension may differ by two criteria: </p><p>  - Interest rate.  Pension deposits, as a rule, open at a higher interest rate.  But do not forget that the banking services market also has regular deposits, for which the rate is higher than for pension ones. </p><p>  - Softer conditions regarding the early termination of the contract. </p><h2>  What are the main deposits banks can offer pensioners? </h2>

    <p>  The two main types of pension deposits are demand deposits and term deposits.  The former are very convenient to open for easy receipt and preservation of pension savings, while the latter allow you to save and increase them. </p><p>  Not every bank can offer a special product for the elderly.  Basically, only large organizations have such products, which are actively developing work with pensioners, offering new products for them. </p><p>  Other conditions of deposits for pensioners practically do not differ from the conditions for simple deposits: </p><p>  - The opening dates are from one month to five years. </p><p>  - The currency can be any, in addition, some organizations may offer multicurrency contributions. </p><p>  - Interest rates range from three to eleven percent, and their transfer is mainly carried out monthly. </p><p>  - If the contract is terminated early and all money is withdrawn from the pension deposit, then the interest will be determined based on the refinancing rate according to the banking formula. </p><h2>  Where can I open the most profitable deposits for pensioners? </h2><p>  1. By tradition, Sberbank is very willing to work with people of retirement age.  Of course, they are not offered special deposits for this category of the population, but at the same time, depending on the term of the deposit, they are given the highest interest rate. </p><p>  2. Gazprombank offers deposits on special conditions for Gazfond customers.  The amount for opening is one hundred rubles, the interest rate is a maximum of six percent, and the period is from six months to a year and a half. </p><p>  3. The Russian Agricultural Bank has a special contribution, Pension Plus.  The minimum amount for registration is 500 rubles, and the rate is up to 8.5%, the term is from one to two years.  At the same time, it is possible to partially withdraw funds while maintaining the bet until a minimum threshold of 500 rubles is reached.  The deposit is extended in case of non-demand automatically. </p><p>  4. Profitable deposits for retirees are also offered at Eurokommerts Bank.  Today, he has one of the highest rates - 10.5% on the Pension Income deposit and 10.25% on the Pension Capital deposit.  These deposits are opened for a period of one and a half to three years, the minimum amount for opening is two thousand rubles.  Also, both deposits have the possibility of replenishment.  Their only difference from each other is that the second one assumes interest capitalization, that is, an increase in the deposit amount due to the addition of interest to it. </p><p>  5. In addition, Unicornbank can boast high rates - up to 10%, a minimum opening threshold of one thousand rubles, a deposit term of up to one year, and a partial withdrawal of funds is not provided. </p><p>  In addition to the above, many other banks can offer pension deposits. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Pension deposits are the most affordable way to save and a small increase in savings for a short or long term.  Today, a variety of banks can offer profitable deposits for senior citizens.  Search and comparison of offers in this situation is the most appropriate.  Although interest rates are not very high today, it‚Äôs not difficult to find an offer where the rate is higher than inflation, even in the largest state-owned banks. </p>
