Payment terminal</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The development of monetary relations has become a prerequisite for the emergence of bank cards.  They were intended to simplify the procedure for cashing out funds.  With the development of technological progress, acquiring has appeared.  This banking service has turned the card into a tool for everyday use. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  "Acquiring" (in the translation from the English. "Acquisition") is a system of accepting cards to pay for services.  By its significance it can be compared with the advent of mobile phones.  Acquiring was initially primitive.  Cashiers used an "imprinter", through which a "cast" with details was taken from the card.  The device did not establish a connection with the bank, and the cashier had to call the financial institution to confirm the availability of funds in the client's account.  The modern electronic terminal appeared much later. </p>

    <h2>  Essence </h2><p>  To take full advantage of the service, you need to conclude an agreement with the acquiring bank and connect the terminal at the outlet.  An acquiring bank is a credit institution that settles with enterprises on card transactions and / or issues funds to cardholders who are not considered <span>to be bank customers.</span>  At the same time, the organization can simultaneously issue cards and issue acquiring terminals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Types of acquiring: </p><ol><li>  Shopping - presented in restaurants, shops, hotels, etc. </li><li>  Internet - the purchase of goods on the World Wide Web. </li><li>  ATMs are terminals and ATMs where you can withdraw cash from your account. </li></ol><p>  The terminal provides the transfer of payments to the company account via the Internet or a telephone line.  Buying it yourself is not necessary.  Firstly, each bank has its own lineup of devices, and secondly, not a single lending institution will undertake to provide technical support for a ‚Äúforeign‚Äù device.  For operations, not only acquiring terminals are needed, but also a cash register connected to the payment system. </p><h2>  Trading Acquiring </h2><p>  The process of payment for the goods through the eyes of the buyer can be described as follows: </p><ul><li>  the client passes the plastic to the cashier; </li><li>  the cashier conducts the operation through the acquiring terminal with pre-authorization and asks the client to enter the PIN; </li><li>  a connection is established, that is, the necessary amount for payment of the check is debited from the holder‚Äôs account. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, an enterprise that uses a payment terminal should: </p><ul><li>  place devices on the territory of their premises; </li><li>  accept cards to pay for services; </li><li>  pay the bank a service fee. </li></ul><p>  The Bank, in turn, is obliged: </p><ul><li>  provide equipment; </li><li>  to train employees of the company to work with terminals; </li><li>  check the balance on the account at the time of the transaction; </li><li>  reimburse the organization for the amount paid; </li><li>  submit consumables; </li><li>  provide full technical support. </li></ul>

The whole process is carried out through web-interfaces.  The customer selects the product on the seller‚Äôs website and clicks on the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button.  Next, a special form opens in which you need to enter the details of the payment card.  This is the so-called processing company.  To confirm the purchase, many banks request one-time passwords, which come in the form of SMS messages to the card holder.  Confirming the payment, the client sends a request to the bank to transfer a certain amount of funds to the account of the online store. </p><h2>  Mobile Acquiring </h2><p>  Not so long ago, mPOS terminals appeared on the market through which mobile acquiring is carried out.  They are a card reader connected to a smartphone.  An application is installed on the device, with the help of which the acquiring terminal is managed and work with payment systems.  Such devices have several advantages in comparison with traditional devices: </p><ul><li>  they are mobile; </li><li>  have round-the-clock access to the account; </li><li>  mobile acquiring terminals are cheaper than usual; </li><li>  cashless payments with their help are safe, etc. </li></ul><p>  Mobile terminals are also convenient because they allow you to pay for taxi driver services in the car and pizza delivery at home. </p><h2>  Sequence of operations </h2><p>  The payment operation through the terminals looks like this: </p><ol><li>  The cashier passes the card through the terminal. </li><li>  Information about the payer is transmitted to the processing center. </li><li>  The system checks the balance in the account. </li><li>  If there is a sufficient amount, funds are transferred between accounts. </li><li>  The terminal issues 2 copies of the check.  One remains with the cashier, and the second is transferred to the buyer. </li><li>  The acquirer transfers the funds to the seller minus the commission. </li></ol>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Acquiring in Russia </h2><p>  In the Russian Federation, this system is still under development.  The total number of cards issued in the country exceeded the population.  Although <span>the coverage ratio</span> in the US and Europe exceeds 2-4 times. </p><p>  Amid growing financial culture among the population, the card is perceived as a convenient means of payment and access to resources, but acquiring in the Russian Federation is slower than planned.  Just 15 years ago, the ratio of cash and non-cash payments was 97% and 3%.  Today, the numbers look different: 85% and 15%. However, 70% of transactions relate to withdrawals from the account. </p><p>  You can purchase and connect a payment terminal through any bank in the country.  You need to focus only on the reputation and experience of a credit organization.  For example, PJSC BINBANK provides its customers with the BIN-Go service.  By choosing one of the four terminals, the client receives an acquiring service with the ability to receive cards of four payment systems.  Mandatory conditions - payment of a commission at the level of 1.8% and crediting of funds to the client's account within two days.  You can use the service within seven days after submitting the application. </p><p>  Under other conditions, an acquiring terminal of Sberbank is provided.  The size of the commission depends on the monthly volume of revenue that goes through the cards, and can range from 0.5% to 2.2%.  For the service of acquiring terminals you need to pay 2 thousand rubles per month. </p><h2>  Connecting an acquiring terminal: 1C "Retail" </h2><p>  For settlements in 1C, the document "Acquiring operation" is used.  First you need to activate this function in the "Administration" tab, the "Finance" item, by checking the "Card payments" checkbox.  You can create an ‚ÄúAcquiring operation‚Äù in the ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù tab or on the basis of ‚ÄúSales of goods‚Äù, ‚ÄúCustomer order‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  In the window that opens, part of the details is pulled from the main document.  For example, ‚ÄúCounterparty‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmount‚Äù and ‚ÄúProduct Name‚Äù.  Additionally, you need to specify "Terminal", "View", "Card number".  Information is pulled from the ‚ÄúAcquiring Agreement‚Äù on the ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù tab.  If this document is missing, then you need to create it by specifying in the form: </p><ul><li>  name of the acquirer (with the type of contract ‚ÄúOther relations‚Äù); </li><li>  counterparty acquirer; </li><li>  score; </li><li>  card number. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, you will have to create the acquiring terminal in the program. </p><p>  After filling in the data, you need to return to the original document and conduct the ‚ÄúAcquiring Operation‚Äù. </p><h2>  Bank report </h2><p>  After receiving the account statement in the program, you need to conduct a document ‚ÄúBank Acquiring Report‚Äù.  It is created in the same item on the tab "Finance".  The first step is to indicate a specific agreement with the bank.  Then by ‚ÄúSelection‚Äù pull up ‚ÄúPayment receipt‚Äù.  In the payment window that opens, select a specific acquiring operation and click on the ‚ÄúTransfer to document‚Äù button.  All information will be displayed in the tabular part of the report. </p>

    <p>  Information about the bank's services is filled in on the ‚ÄúAcquiring commission‚Äù tab: cost item, analytical accounts, amount.  The final stage is the creation of a ‚ÄúBank statement‚Äù based on the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù.  With this document in 1C, the proceeds from the sale minus the commission are credited to the cash account. </p><h2>  Ut 11 </h2><p>  The acquiring terminal in this version of the 1C program is connected differently.  In particular: </p><ul><li>  the agreement with the bank lists all payment systems for which the agreement is valid; </li><li>  for operations with depersonalized clients, the document ‚ÄúKMM Checks‚Äù is used; </li><li>  at the end of the day, ‚ÄúClosing a shift‚Äù is held, and a ‚ÄúSales Report‚Äù is automatically generated. </li></ul><p>  In the "Check" on the first tab information about the product is indicated, on the second - about the payment card, on the third - the data of the check and the name of the cashier. </p><h2>  Memo for using the device </h2><p>  When making payments through the terminal, a number of problems may arise: network failure, cancellation of the operation, insufficient amount of funds in the account.  Let us consider in more detail how to use the device correctly and cancel operations. </p><p>  In case of successful completion of the operation, the terminal prints a check, which indicates: card number, authorization and transaction code, payment amount and slip.  The latter is a text with <span>processing center</span> parameters <span>.</span>  If payment confirmation information has not been received, the transaction should be aborted abnormally using the ‚ÄúCancel operation‚Äù command. </p>

In this case, the transaction number (RRN) and the check number are transmitted to the terminal.  After that, the amount paid is returned to the buyer's account.

This technology is convenient to use, eliminates the risk of getting fake money, saves money on collection.  Not to mention the fact that participants in such programs receive special banking products in the form of preferential programs, discounts on services and free staff training.  In turn, the client pays for purchases in a way convenient for him. </p>

    <p>  Traditionally, maps are preferred by wealthier populations.  According to statistics, payment through the terminal leads to an increase in sales by 20-30%.  Owners of "plastic wallets" part with money faster.  The average amount of a check paid through the terminal is 30% more than usual.  The presence of an additional <span>payment method</span> makes the company more reliable and attractive in the eyes of the client.  Acquiring also increases the number of potential buyers. </p>
