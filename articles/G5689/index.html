    <h2>  Briefly about the city </h2><p>  The city of Sinaia (Romania) is a ski and balneoclimatic resort.  It is located in such a beautiful natural place, which is called a natural amphitheater: from below - glades of the Alps, illuminated by sunlight, and from above - mountain ranges covered with coniferous forests, over 2000 meters above sea level.  Sinaia is part of Prahova County (the district is the administrative unit of Romania).  The population is just over 14 thousand people.  In the central part is <span>the Sinaia Monastery.</span>  It was he who became decisive in choosing a name for the city. </p><p>  200 years after its founding, it was officially declared a city.  This great event in history occurred in 1880.  The city of Sinaia (Romania) is located at a distance of 125 km from the state capital - Bucharest.  This resort is located in the Prahova River Valley, in the South Carpathian Mountains.  In connection with the latter factor, the city is also called the pearl of the Carpathians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sinai is popular all year round.  In summer, they simply enjoy the most beautiful mountain scenery and the cleanest air, see the sights, arrange walks in the Bucegi mountain range, located in the Southern Carpathians.  And in winter, skiing, sledding and snowboarding are added to all these activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof sinaia romania" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1375248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The city of Sinaia (Romania) is located in a temperate continental climate.  Winter is snowy, but not frosty.  On average, the temperature in winter drops to 5 ¬∞ C below zero.  And the snow in the mountains lies for a long time - from October to March.  Since Sinai is located in a hollow between the mountains, strong winds do not blow here.  The air is absolutely clean and ionized.  Most precipitation falls during the year in the form of snow.  In summer, the city is not hot, there is no stuffiness.  On average, the air temperature reaches +22 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  The city of Sinaia (Romania), being a ski resort, is one of the most fashionable in the country in which it is located.  As the locals like to say, it "flows blue blood."  The fact is that in the past, the Romanian royal family had a summer residence here.  This was even before the locality received city status.  After the construction of the residence of Carol I, this resort has become the most fashionable, and for 145 years it has remained so. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The resort city of Sinaia (Romania), although the most fashionable, but not the largest in this country.  The leading position is occupied by Poiana Brasov.  However, they are distinguished by the history of creation.  Poiana Brasov at the beginning of the last century was an absolutely desolate mountainous area.  And, as mentioned above, Sinai has a beautiful aristocratic history.  Some people believe that <span>skiing</span> got its start in the middle of the last century.  It's not like that at all.  Since the official announcement of the terrain as a city, skiing competitions have begun here.  And in 1935, the Winter Olympic Games in bobsleigh were organized in the pearl of the Carpathians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sinaia romania sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1375247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ski slopes </h2><p>  The resort has some of the best skiing tracks in the world.  They are located on the eastern and western slopes of Mount Vyrfulkul Dor, whose height is more than two thousand meters above sea level.  The longest of these routes (a total of 14) has a length of 6 km.  And the total length is about 40 km.  In addition, the mountainsides are equipped with cable cars and ski lifts. </p><p>  All tracks have different levels of difficulty.  There are those that are intended for beginner skiers and children.  And after improving skill, you can switch to more complex ones.  For professionals, separate tracks are equipped.  In addition to skiing, there are those that are designed for bobsledding and sledding. </p><p>  A great advantage of this area is the availability of a beginner's school.  Sinaia Resort (Romania) provides sports equipment rental.  In this area, the risk of avalanche collapse is minimal, so you can not be afraid for your health. </p><p>  In addition to international competitions, such as the Olympic Games, domestic competitions are often held here (bobsledding, skiing, sleigh rides).  Until today, the Sinai ski resort has almost never disappointed anyone with regard to sports.  Both professionals and beginner skiers enjoyed the conditions and equipment as much as possible. </p><h2>  Medical resort </h2><p>  In the past, the city of Sinaia was also a popular medical resort, thanks not only to pleasant climatic conditions and ionized air, but also to sulfide mineral waters.  However, at present this direction is practically not developing; demand has gradually lost relevance.  But, of course, what can please tourists is the purest ionized air.  Thanks to it, you can treat diseases of the respiratory organs, disorders of the nervous system and relieve fatigue from the bustle of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="r sinaia romania" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1375246.jpg" width="600"></div>
