    <h2>  Further actions and deadlines </h2><p>  After receiving a statement from a pensioner, government representatives will be required to make an appropriate request to the Pension Fund, in which he received his pension earlier.  According to PF employees, the entire procedure for sending a form takes no more than one business day.  In turn, the required pension case will be transferred upon request within three days (from the date of receipt of the application). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After receiving the case, the PF department, as a rule, gives an order to register a pensioner in a new place of residence.

Firstly, before moving it makes sense to find out the full name of your previous pension fund (you will need it when writing an application).  Secondly, find out the exact address of the place of your move, taking into account the post office index.  This will allow you to avoid possible misunderstandings when applying. </p><p>  And finally, when applying for a new PF branch, bring your passport and pension certificate with you.  If you plan to receive a pension through a proxy, you must take care of drawing up a power of attorney in advance.  If you do everything right, you will be promptly paid a pension when you change your place of residence (we described the procedure above). </p>

    <h2>  When to expect a pension? </h2><p>  According to the current legislation, the calculation of pensions for a new place of residence will resume starting from the 1st day.  In this case, the report will be kept from the filing date of the application.  Thus, you will not lose anything. </p><h2>  How to transfer a pension when traveling abroad? </h2><p>  Do not know how to transfer a pension when changing your place of residence when traveling abroad?  This is fixable.  Let's start with a couple of useful tips.  So, before you leave (but not later than a month) you need to come to the department of the fund, write a statement and submit the following documents: </p><ul><li>  passport of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  The original certificate of change of residence indicating the exact address abroad (issued by the consul or embassy); </li><li>  original certificate of employment (if any). </li></ul><h2>  How to get a pension while living abroad? </h2><p>  If everything is clear with the submission of documents and informing the Pension Fund, then it is completely unclear how to get a pension when changing your place of residence when moving abroad.  According to PF employees, it is not necessary for a pensioner to personally attend to receive a pension. </p><p>  It is enough to open an account in one of the Russian banks or to empower your authorized representative with the appropriate powers.  However, in such a situation, the PF must provide in advance the contact and passport data of an external person.  And, of course, he must have a document notarized by a notary authorizing him with the right to receive your pension. </p>

    <h2>  If you lived in the territory of another state and returned to Russia? </h2><p>  There are times when natives of the Russians leave the country for some reason and come back after some time.  How then is the accrual of pension?  In this situation, payments are credited after the pension business of the country of the previous place of residence is finally closed.  For this, it is also necessary to write a statement and expect the transfer of a closed pension case to a new destination address.  However, in order to accrue a pension it is necessary to have Russian citizenship or a residence permit confirming the fact of the pensioner's residence in the Russian Federation.  It's all about how to transfer a pension when changing your place of residence from one country to another. </p><h2>  Is it necessary to apply for a pension on a card? </h2><p>  If you previously received your pension on the card, then you still have to look for the nearest PF branch at the relocation address and write a statement.  This must be done in order to be registered with the new Pension Fund.  On the other hand, the information in your case may suddenly be needed by you or the PF representative.  For example, this can happen when you review the size of charges. </p><h2>  How can I get a pension? </h2><p>  Getting a pension when moving is one of three possible ways.  For example, it may be Russian Post.  At the same time, elderly people can receive money either with a personal visit to the post office or by a postman.  Alternatively, retirees can open a bank account and withdraw pension accruals through an ATM or cash desk of a financial institution.  And finally, there are a number of organizations involved in the delivery of pensions, for example, courier services. </p><h2>  Can I change my retirement provider? </h2><p>  After moving you have a great opportunity to change your pension provider (if for some reason he did not suit you).  To do this, you must come to the office of your Pension Fund and write a statement.  It should indicate the reason for the transition to another supplier and detail its contacts.  If you don‚Äôt want to make such a statement personally, just go to the PF website and do it through your personal account (if you already had a registration before). </p><p>  Now you know how to transfer a pension when changing your place of residence.  In a word, follow our tips and you will definitely not miss the following pension accruals. </p>
