In our article we want to talk about one of the island's hotels - Mercure Bali Nusa Dua (Bali). </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  The Republic of Indonesia is a storehouse of completely alien and incomprehensible to us culture, which is why our compatriots fell in love with the country's resorts.  Bali is a wonderful place not only for a beach holiday in the bounty style, but also a great opportunity to admire the local beauties and immerse yourself in a foreign culture. </p>

    <p>  Nusa Dua is an elite resort that stretches along the coast with mangroves.  The city has the most luxurious hotels and the best beaches on the island.  In addition, the resort has a walking area with cafes, boutiques, restaurants, water centers called Galleria. </p><p>  To the north of the town stretches the sandy strip of Tanjung Benoa - a former fishing village on whose territory a chain of five- and four-star hotels has been built. </p><p>  In Nusa Dua, significant ebbs and flows are observed.  They swim in the sea until 9 am or after 15:00.  In the daytime, the ocean leaves, exposing the beaches, at such a time the depth is about half a meter.  Deeper places remain only in the lagoons. </p><p>  In Nusa Dua, public transport is provided only by minibuses.  But they do not go into the main gates of the city, so the beaches can be reached only on foot or by taxi, there are also minibuses running along the coast every half hour. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Dusa Nua is an elite tourist guarded city with limited access.  This oasis in Bali was built for fastidious and demanding tourists.  The best five-star hotels in the city boast vast territories, beautiful pools, tennis courts and private beaches.  But at the same time, there are no attractions in Dusa Nua: neither markets, nor traditional Balinese villages, nor shopping stalls with delicacies.  The real life of the local population can only be seen outside the artificial luxury of the city.  Almost all complexes here offer equipment for sea sports, as this is the main local entertainment. </p><p>  To see something interesting, you should go travel around the island.  There are enough interesting places in Bali worthy of attention: monkey forest, Tanah Lot temple, Bali Barat park, Batubulan village, island botanical garden, rice <span>terraces, marine</span> park and safari park, Besakiikh temple, Taman Ayun temple, etc. . </p><p>  In Bali, treatment programs are very developed to improve blood circulation, reduce the manifestations of cellulite, destroy fat deposits, and moisturize the skin.  Most of the procedures are based on the use of algae, sea mud and salts.  Also, for medicinal purposes, use a variety of bathtubs (with sea water, algae, hydromassage, flower, etc.). </p>

    <h2>  Mercure Bali Nusa Dua Reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to turn to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  How good is Mercure Bali Nusa Dua (Indonesia)?  Nusa Dua is a great luxury resort with good hotels, one of which is our complex.  The hotel is located on the second line and is surrounded by its own garden.  The distance to the coast is about 1000 meters.  According to the guests, the hotel has a perfect shuttle service to its own beach, so there are no problems getting to the coast.  Walk to the coast for about 20 minutes.  The beach of the hotel is very clean and well-groomed, it is surrounded by bushes.  Hotel staff provides towels.  On the coast there are sun loungers, and instead of umbrellas there are trees in the shade of which it is very good to relax.  Low tides on the coast do not spoil the whole <span>picture</span> too much <span>, you</span> can <span>swim</span> .  A lot of pesky merchants wandering around the beach wandering around. </p><p>  The hotel does not have a bike or car rental point, but on the way to the shore there is an institution where you can rent a bike.  But the car can be ordered online.  She will be driven to the hotel and taken from there.  The cost of renting a car is about 70,000 rupees per day. </p><p>  The territory of the complex is rather big and very green and well-groomed.  The building is located not on the road, but a little off to the side, which is why street noise does not reach the guests. </p><p>  In Mercure Bali Nusa Dua 4 * (Bali) there are two pools (for adults and children) with overflow.  They turn off the water at night, so the noise from it does not interfere with sleep.  The pools are beautiful and clean, a recreation area with sun loungers and umbrellas is located nearby. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a good spa center, where you can visit massage sessions, and a large gym with excellent fitness equipment. </p><p>  Hotel Mercure Bali Nusa Dua itself (description of rooms is given in the article) is far from new, but inside it is maintained in good condition.  According to vacationers, the rooms are nice and clean.  The apartments on the fourth floor do not have balconies, on all other floors they are available.  If you do not like the proposed number, then at the reception you will try to help in this matter, replacing it with another.  The hotel staff is very friendly and tries to please their guests.  Room service and towels are changed daily.  In case of detection of equipment breakdowns in the apartments, it is necessary to inform the reception staff on duty, as a rule, such issues are resolved quickly enough.  Guest rooms include slippers and bathrobes that are periodically forgotten to be changed during cleaning.  Every day, a bottle (300 ml) of free water for each guest is left in the room.  She, of course, is not enough, but still such attention is pleasant. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to food.  According to vacationers, the restaurant's menu in the hotel is quite acceptable, excellent dishes are prepared here, but you need to be prepared for the fact that the local food is very spicy.  Even if you want to dine elsewhere and don‚Äôt like seasonings that are too spicy, try to choose something from European dishes.  Although the local food is also very tasty, especially seafood.  Eating in nearby cafes, as in other institutions of the city, is not cheap at all.  In general, <span>food in Bali is</span> quite expensive compared to Thailand.  Free shuttles run from the hotel to the mall, which can always be used to get there and back. </p>

    <p>  In general, Nusa Dua is a very quiet resort compared to other <span>cities in Bali.</span>  There are no noisy discos and night shows.  The main attractions include marine activities (surfing, diving) and sightseeing trips around the island.  In terms of attractions, the city is very poor, they simply are not here.  But throughout the island there are a sufficient number of interesting places that are certainly worth a look.  The hotel always has a representative of a tour operator who can tell you information about trips.  There are many points on the street where guides actively offer excursions.  However, experienced tourists do not recommend using their services.  Through the Internet you can find a personal guide who will go with you along the chosen route.  Such a trip is most interesting, since you are not attached to the group and you can spend as much time anywhere as you want. </p><p>  It is convenient to travel around the city by taxi, the cost of travel is low, especially if you book a car with a meter.  You can get from the airport to the hotel on your own.  But at the time of departure, you can use the free shuttle service of the complex. </p><p>  The bulk of tourists in Bali are Asians.  Therefore, all hotels are focused on them.  You can meet Russians not so often.  The same situation is in the Mercure Bali Nusa Dua, in which the Chinese mainly rest. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I want to note that, according to tourists, Mercure Bali Nusa Dua 4 * is a great place for a budget holiday.  The cost of hotel services is much lower than in similar resort complexes.  But at the same time, at an affordable price, guests get quite acceptable rooms, good food and relaxation on the private beach of the complex. </p>
