Along with this, she considered success to be her most important achievements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eleanor Roosevelt Quotes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/270497.jpg" width="387"></div>  in work aimed at protecting human rights.  Eleanor was born into a fairly wealthy and privileged New York family in 1884.  By the age of ten, she became an orphan, in connection with which she was later brought up by relatives.  The girl was not enthusiastic about the atmosphere of social life, which she considered stifling, so she got a job in one of the social centers in Manhattan.  Here she taught dance improvisation and plastic.  In 1905, her promising young politician Franklin Roosevelt became her husband.  Eleanor later bore him six children.

At this time, she worked in one of the canteen of the Red Cross and constantly visited the wounded soldiers in hospitals.  Eleanor <span>Roosevelt,</span> whose <span>quotes</span> are known all over the world, later stated that the feeling that she brought great benefits at that time was her greatest joy in life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roosevelt Eleanor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/270498.jpg" width="396"></div>  In 1920, a misfortune happened in the family - Franklin fell ill with polio.  It was extremely difficult for his wife to be torn between him and volunteering.  However, she managed not only to help her husband resume his political career, but also to win the gubernatorial elections in New York in 1928.  Four years later, Franklin was elected <span>American President.</span>

First of all, she defended the <span>rights of women,</span> minorities and the poor.  After her trips around the country, she reported on the whole head of state and very often persuaded him to change policies on certain issues.  Her information has always been backed up by statistics.  Great success was achieved by Eleanor in the fight against <span>racial discrimination, as</span> evidenced by a number of administrative decrees signed by the president on her initiative. </p><p>  After the death of her husband in 1945, the new president, Harry Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt was appointed to the American delegation to the UN.  Here she dealt with issues related to human rights and freedom of information, and prepared reports on declarations on the status of women and civil liberties.  Later, she became one of the authors of the declaration on human rights, which with great difficulty, but still was approved by the Third Committee of the United Nations.  It was this body that oversaw humanitarian and social issues.  This happened late in the night of December 9, 1948.  The project was supported by representatives of 48 countries, and its author was welcomed with a long standing ovation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eleanor Roosevelt" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/270499.jpg" width="600"></div>
