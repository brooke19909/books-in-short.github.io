  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Elite holidays in Mauritius</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For connoisseurs of high class in everything, a vacation in Mauritius will be the perfect choice.  Not everyone can afford it here.  Officially, <span>holidays on the island are</span> considered publicly available, but in reality, everything is different.  Prices are so high that only very wealthy people can afford to spend a few days here.  World-class hotels are located on the waterfront.  There is no five-star classification, but there is no doubt about the quality of the housing and the level of service.  Even the most inexpensive bungalows will leave behind only the most positive impressions. </p><p>  Most often, people choose holidays in Mauritius because of its snow-white beaches of many kilometers.  Almost all of them belong to any hotel.  You will not find such amazingly beautiful ideal beaches anywhere.  Tourists resting here often dive, as the <span>Indian Ocean is</span> crystal clear.  It is very difficult to imagine the best place to explore the underwater world.  Also, the nature of the island will not leave indifferent.  In Mauritius, you can find 80 species, palm trees, several types of mangoes, pineapples, cokes, bananas.  The main feature of the island's nature is the multicolored soil of Chamarel, which consists of layers of different colors: yellow, brown, orange and pink.  Surprisingly, under all weather conditions, the layers never mix with each other.  A keychain with such land is most often brought home by tourists as a souvenir. </p><p>  It is impossible to imagine a vacation in Mauritius without visiting its Spas.  They are one of the best in the world.  Almost all hotels on the island are ready to provide this service.  Procedures help restore vitality, find beauty and harmony within yourself.  Some tourists come here only for their sake.  The most popular are thalassotherapy, all kinds of wraps, fruit masks, <span>relaxing massages.</span>  A huge number of plants, as well as crystal clear waters of the ocean formed the basis of the most effective cosmetic treatments. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Resting on the island, you must definitely try the local cuisine.  As such, Mauritian cuisine does not exist.  It is represented by dishes from French, Chinese, <span>English cuisines.</span>  The Mauritius menu is a combination of several dishes from different regions of the world.  Most often you can find seafood on the table.  This largely determines the proximity of the ocean and fisheries.  For dessert, fruit in various designs and ice cream are served, tastier than which no tourist has ever tasted anything in their life.  In general, rest in Mauritius can be called lazy and relaxing.  It is very quiet and peaceful.  At the same time, truly paradise landscapes surround. </p><p>  In the past few years, holding <span>weddings on the island</span> has become very popular <span>.</span>  The service is provided by most hotels.  Here you can officially register a marriage, as well as just hold a wedding ceremony.  It is very difficult to find something more beautiful than the union of two hearts on the island, among tropical plants, a crystal clear ocean and a huge number of candles. </p><p>  Buying last-minute <span>tours to Mauritius is</span> quite difficult, because vacation on the island is not massive, but rather the prerogative of a narrow population.  The biggest peak of visiting tourists falls on <span>international holidays.</span>  The climate of the island allows year-round relaxation on its beaches.  Undoubtedly, last-minute trips to Mauritius reduce the cost of the trip, but it still remains practically not accessible to most people.  Most often, the inhabitants of Europe rest on the island, but in recent years there has been a growth in the number of tourists from Russia.  Spending a few days in Mauritius means spending them in a real earthly paradise. </p>
