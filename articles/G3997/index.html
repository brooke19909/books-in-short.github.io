The Huawei company is no exception.  If earlier this company was associated only with products that were fakes and imitations of famous brands in the field of smartphones, now China has its own brands.  In 2014, a model called Huawei Ascend P6S was put up for trial by gadget observers and users.  An overview of this smartphone will be presented in the article.  The phone is a copy of last year's flagship Huawei Ascend P6 in design, but with simpler characteristics, and, accordingly, with a lower price of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Smartphone <span>Huawei Ascend P6S,</span> although it is the younger brother of its predecessor, but its technical characteristics are still very good.  The phone from the Chinese manufacturer of communicators has a quad-core processor, each of whose cores is characterized by a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz.  As a "stuffing" developers also added 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory.  The processor itself runs on the Android 4.4.2 platform.  The phone has two cameras: the main and front, which is designed for video calls.  Moreover, if the main camera has an eight-megapixel sensor, then in the front camera - 5 MP.  The smartphone‚Äôs battery is quite capacious - 2000 mAh.  This volume is enough to hold a charge all day with an average phone load. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  In its design, the phone is no different from its older predecessor in the person of Huawei Ascend P6.  In general, Huawei Ascend P6S has similar features with communicators from Apple and Sony.  The appearance of the model in question is really very similar to some smartphones of companies from the USA and Japan.  Huawei Ascend P6S also has almost sharp corners, and the smartphone screen is located between two rounded inserts that create an image of solidity of the front and back of the gadget.  On the right side of the phone is almost everything that is necessary for convenient work with it.  There are two slots for SIM cards, and <span>volume control buttons,</span> as well as a power button Huawei Ascend P6S.  A review of the smartphone from its upper side will allow you to see two connectors that are designed to charge the battery and listen to music. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Developers from the Chinese company Huawei did not save on the screen of the smartphone and equipped it with a 4.7-inch IPS-display with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels.  The frequency of dots per inch is 312, which may seem like a small number for modern phones.  However, the images on the smartphone look very good.  What else impresses the Huawei Ascend P6S smartphone is its viewing angles and color quality.  Pictures on the phone are displayed very realistically, and you can watch them from almost zero angle.  Smartphone developers also took care of countries with a cold climate.  If most of the models that are currently on the market do not react to anything other than a bare warm finger, then our hero is adapted to work in gloves.  This is an indispensable advantage in winter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cameras and photo quality </h2><p>  The smartphone boasts the presence of two cameras: the main one, which is located on the rear panel, and the front one, located in front of the screen.  The main camera in 8 MP makes quite decent photos.  Of course, you should not demand from the camera a budget model of photographs that would be comparable even with at least modern soap cameras.  For its price, the phone has a very good camera that takes high-quality photos in sufficient light.  The phone can pleasantly surprise its owners with a front camera of 5 MP.  With this camera you can make very good self-portraits.  Also, this camera allows you to conveniently communicate with friends through video calls. </p>

    <h2>  Huawei Ascend P6S: customer reviews </h2><p>  If earlier the goods manufactured in the Middle Kingdom were considered as cheap and low-quality products, today the opinion of consumers is beginning to change.  At lower prices, customers get a product that is no worse than global brands.  The <span>Huawei Ascend P6S</span> is no exception <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> people who bought a smartphone are mostly positive.  Many people liked the design of the phone, although some noticed some similarities with Sony and Apple products.  The communicator performance did not go unnoticed.  Many consumers notice that in their price segment this smartphone has almost the best price-quality ratio.  Questions from buyers are caused by the main camera, which is capable of producing high-quality photographs only in well-lit areas.  It is still difficult to judge how long this phone can work, but from the experience of past models, we can conclude that for at least 2 years it will serve its owner faithfully. </p>

    <h2>  Options and prices </h2><p>  Components that come as a supplement to the main purchase of the phone are standard with Huawei.  In addition to the box with the smartphone, its buyer will also receive documentation that details the manual for using it.  As a headset, the company decided, without spending too much money, to offer the buyer standard earbuds with a microphone for talking while driving or running.  The manufacturers also made sure that the buyer did not have problems recharging the phone by adding as a component a charger that can be paired with a standard outlet in the apartment.  Now, perhaps, the most important question for most interested in the Huawei Ascend P6S model is the price.  Depending on the place of purchase of the phone, its cost can vary from 230 to 300 dollars, which is an undoubted advantage over similar competitors of the company. </p><p>  As a result, the smartphone Huawei Ascend P6S with all its many advantages and the minimum number of shortcomings is a very nice option to buy.  Mimicking the design of his older brother, he was able to leave a good impression for his price, which, on average, is just over $ 250. </p>
