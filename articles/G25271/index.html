    <h2>  Sumgait </h2><p>  The country's third largest city is rightfully included in the best <span>resorts of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea</span> (see photo in the article), despite the fact that it is simultaneously the center of the petrochemical industry.  The settlement is quite young.  They say about Sumgayit that it arose from nothing, before the war there was a tiny village.  But by the 50s of the last century, it had become a large industrial center, which to some extent influenced the environmental situation. </p><p>  It would seem that the resort does not belong here.  However, after the collapse of the Union, most plants were closed, and the ecosystem gradually restored itself.  The city has more than 20 equipped beaches, and all of them surprise tourists at first sight.  The fact is that you will not find pleasant pebbles or crumbly sand heated from the sun on them, but only small shells whitened by the sun. </p><p>  When choosing and evaluating the resorts of Azerbaijan for a future trip, be sure to pay attention to the infrastructure and what you can do there, except for a purely beach pastime.  Sumgait offers its guests a rich historical and cultural program, various entertainments, clubs and restaurants, a water park.  The transport connection with the capital of the country is well established, which provides additional opportunities for a close acquaintance with Azerbaijan. </p><h2>  Kusars </h2><p>  Of the possible 11 climatic zones on the territory of Azerbaijan, nine are determined, and therefore the climate in different parts of the country is so different.  You can go to the country both for swimming in the warm Caspian Sea, and for comfortable ski resorts of the European level.  The main one is Kusary.  It houses the country's first complex of this profile - ‚ÄúShahdag‚Äù.  No wonder the place is called one of the most bewitching and beautiful in the Caucasus.  Modern tracks, equipment rental, clean and ringing mountain air, numerous hotels, traditional cuisine will make your vacation unforgettable, safe and comfortable.  The resort is perfect for everyone, without exception, regardless of the level of training.  Convenient tracks are prepared using artificial snow generators, which allows you to extend the holiday season and form a better and more pleasant surface for skiing.  The place can be safely included in the list of "Best Resorts of Azerbaijan". </p>
