    <h2>  Clarification </h2><p>  Future owners should not be afraid that this camera from the budget class will shoot worse than its older counterparts and products of a competitor.  In fact, it doesn‚Äôt matter which product the customer chooses - the expensive <span>Nikon</span> D 7200 <span>,</span> Canon <span>D600</span> or the rare <span>Sony a77</span> II.  All mirror products with an APS-C matrix on the market are shot in the same quality, and the difference is only in the appearance, functionality and ease of use. </p><p>  Accordingly, all comparisons of cameras will relate only to the listed criteria, and it is useless to argue about the quality of the final image, because they have the same filling.  FullFrame devices do not count - this is a completely different class of mirror devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance and design features </h2><p>  A potential buyer will certainly enjoy the camera at first sight, especially if he opts for the Canon D600 kit 18-135, which is equipped with a lens for creative shooting.  Outwardly, it looks bulky, however, the case is not so heavy.  Plastic has a rough texture, which allows you to hold the camera, even a child with two fingers.  Many owners in their reviews note that, regardless of the size of the palm, the camera lies perfectly in the hand. </p>

    <p>  An external examination of the gadget gives the impression that the case of the device was obtained by casting - the device was assembled in such a high quality at the factory.  During a visual inspection, you will not be able to find a single gap, uneven joints or misalignment of the control buttons and interface connectors.  Even a liquid crystal screen, freely moving on a hinge, does not have any play. </p><h2>  Convenience above all! </h2><p>  Many users have already noticed that more recently, professional photographers laughed at the rotary screen of budget cameras.  But more recently, the market leaders - Canon and Nikon - have updated the line of expensive devices with FullFrame-matrix, providing them along with a touch screen with a hinge.  After all, convenience when photographing and filming is most important. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is a pity that the D600 Canon has a non-touch LCD screen, however, judging by the reviews of the owners, it is very high-quality and convenient.  A three-inch monitor with an aspect ratio and high resolution allows you to not only configure the camera and view the footage.  In real time, the user can take pictures, guided by the image of the screen, as well as video from any convenient angle.  To save battery, the ‚ÄúDISP‚Äù button is present on the device‚Äôs case, which turns off the backlight (in older models, there was a sensor near the viewfinder that performed a similar function). </p><h2>  Work with optics </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that all Canon cameras have built-in autofocus, which is popularly called a ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù.  Accordingly, the lenses will cost the user less than the owner of the budget counterpart from the manufacturer Nikon.  Before buying, the user only needs to know that the optics for the APS-C and FullFrame matrices are slightly different.  So <span>the Canon</span> D600 <span>lens</span> has an EF-S mount, while an expensive representative is equipped with an EF mount. </p><p>  There are many optics for this camera on the market, so the user will always find the right lens for himself.  But professionals recommend that beginners purchase a device in the Kit configuration with 18-135 mm optics.  Such a lens will be enough for shooting households outdoors and indoors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  An important factor for a SLR camera is the speed of preservation of the captured material in the process of photo or video shooting.  The fact that the SD memory card should be used in such gadgets of at least the tenth grade is not worth talking about, because this is the recommendation of the manufacturer Canon.  As for the speed of work itself, there is no hard negative from users.  The processor easily copes not only with saving pictures in RAW format and working in Live View mode, but also manages to quickly process video at maximum quality settings and using special effects. </p>

    <p>  There are minor complaints about saving photos in serial shooting.  Canon D600 camera freezes for 2-3 seconds during operation.  Naturally, this causes a negative on the part of users.  The problem can be eliminated only by reducing the resolution of the final images.  Professionals in their reviews recommend that all fans of serial shooting set 6 megapixels instead of the default 18 megapixels.  This will not affect the quality of the photo. </p><h2>  Sensor operation </h2><p>  The Canon D600 camera, the price of which is within 30,000 rubles, has a unique automatic mode according to ISO definition.  As practice shows, the camera does not miss - in any conditions, in any weather, at any distance from the subject.  Here, however, a digression should be made.  By default, the maximum ISO value in the camera is set at 6400. Accordingly, in automatic mode, the shutter speed is oriented to the matrix‚Äôs high sensitivity to light.  Hence the graininess of photographs taken in low light.  Users in their reviews recommend adjusting the settings for the maximum ISO value, setting it for automatic mode at around 1600 units. </p><h2>  Flash work </h2><p>  The Canon D600 has technical characteristics of the hardware that is directly responsible for shooting, almost no different from competitors in the budget class.  But the additional functionality attracts the attention of many users.  The attention of buyers who decide to engage in creativity will certainly attract the ability of the camera to control system flashes.  This functionality is implemented not via a wired interface, but using the E-TTL radio synchronizer. </p>

    <p>  Which provides not only the possibility of simultaneous operation of all connected flashes to improve the illumination of the object.  The camera can set the time and ranges of the external lighting devices.  With this mode of operation, you can achieve excellent illumination of the subject and completely eliminate unnecessary shadows. </p><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  Video enthusiasts may not like the restriction that exists in the camera for saved files.  The manufacturer preferred to use the obsolete FAT32 format for marking removable drives.  Naturally, the file size is limited to 4 GB.  One could take an example from Panasonic and implement the exFAT format, which has no restrictions. </p>

    <p>  Another weak point of the Canon D600 is the battery.  As practice shows, it consumes electricity very quickly - literally 450 photos will negate the entire charge.  Here the user has two options: buy a high-capacity battery, or turn off the LCD screen for shooting. </p><p>  But the presence of scene programs in the SLR camera will appeal to any user - both a novice and even a professional.  Indeed, in addition to the ready-made settings for shooting the landscape, sporting events, portraits and the like, the device also has a ‚ÄúSpecial Effects‚Äù mode. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  A disk is supplied with the Canon D600 camera, on which the user will find a detailed instruction manual with color pictures and setup examples, as well as a set of applications for image processing.  Professionals recommend taking the software seriously, because it is a lifeline for many photos that were taken with the wrong exposure.  You can extend the quality of photographs both from the JPG format and from RAW, however, users in their reviews recommend stopping at the latter. </p><p>  As for the video editor, which is present in the software package, it is intended for processing video data and applying special effects.  It works reasonably well (relative to similar products on the market), but copes with its tasks.  It is a pity that the program interface is not Russified. </p><h2>  Problems and their solution </h2><p>  In contrast to the work of expensive modifications of the Canon line, which have a magnesium alloy body, it is recommended to handle this camera carefully.  An accidental fall from a small height can damage the device.  You also need to be careful when taking pictures near ponds - the gadget is very easy to drown.  Spare parts for the Canon D600 photo camera are very expensive, regardless of where to buy them - in the service center or order from the manufacturer‚Äôs official website. </p>

    <p>  Manufacturer's high quality lenses are also prone to damage.  It is easy to scratch the glass, naturally, this defect will affect the quality of shooting.  Professionals in their reviews recommend purchasing protective filters for the lens and use them in the shooting process on an ongoing basis. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The D600 Canon product looks pretty attractive in a budget class.  It will be interesting first of all to people who decided to devote themselves to photo business.  The device has convenient functionality, is able to control flashes (Nikon's competitor can only do this with expensive cameras), and the purchase of new lenses will cost an order of magnitude cheaper, because the Canon brand has no problems with a ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù.  There are negatives, but they are small, and for most buyers do not play any role. </p>
