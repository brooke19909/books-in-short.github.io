    <h2>  What happened to Ephraim? </h2><p>  The fact that whole worlds may exist beyond the boundaries of human perception is not officially confirmed.  Scientists do not cease to repeat: there can be no life after death.  It is impossible to find out the truth and believability of the stories shared by people who have experienced clinical death at the level of scientific research.  Until recently, most scientists remained categorical in their judgments, until one case happened with the famous Russian physicist Vladimir Efremov. </p><p>  Being one of the leading experts in the field of designing OKB "Impulse", this man became famous throughout the world.  Relatives have repeatedly stated what happened.  Vladimir Efremov, according to their story, died unexpectedly.  He coughed, then sat down on the sofa.  Despite the fact that the man suddenly calmed down, his family did not immediately understand what had happened. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How the sister Natalya Grigoryevna returned him from the ‚Äúother‚Äù world </h2><p>  Efremov‚Äôs sister, Natalia, was the first to sense something was wrong.  Touching her brother by the hand, she began to ask about what was happening to him.  Instead of an answer, the insensible body fell on its side.  Immediately probing the pulse and not detecting it, Natalya began to perform emergency resuscitation.  She took several approaches of artificial respiration, but the native person still remained lifeless.  Due to the availability of medical education and certain skills, my sister understood that with every minute the chances of saving a loved one are reduced.  <span>Breast massage,</span> designed to "start" the heart muscle, gave its result only in the ninth minute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Efremov" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431493.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Hearing the weak response of the heart, which was again included in the process of vital activity, Natalya exhaled deeply.  The physicist breathed on his own.  Everyone who was nearby at that moment rushed to him with hugs and tears in their eyes, rejoicing that he was alive and that was not the end.  To which the man replied: ‚ÄúThere is no end, there is life too.  She is different, better ... " </p><h2>  The scientific discovery of the afterlife </h2><p>  The certificates received from Vladimir Grigoryevich have no price.  These data could become the basis of many studies and scientific developments.  Like all people who survived clinical death, he wrote down everything he managed to see in great detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="after death" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431470.jpg" width="600"></div>  In fact, what Efremov went through can be called the first scientific study.  The physicist provided the description of what happened to the editors of the scientific and technical publication in St. Petersburg.  Repeatedly with his observations, the specialist shared with colleagues at scientific congresses.

None of the scientists doubted the reliability of the information shared by Vladimir Efremov.  His reputation and fame in high academic circles was transparent and impeccable.  Efremov‚Äôs colleagues have repeatedly spoken about the majority of professional advantages and excellent human qualities.  He was known as: </p><ul><li>  the largest high-class specialist in the field of artificial intelligence; </li><li>  Responsible employee with considerable experience; </li><li>  participant in the launch of the spacecraft with Gagarin Yu.A.; </li><li>  a significant contributor to the development of innovative missile designs; </li><li>  the head of the research team, who became the four-time winner of the State Prize. </li></ul><h2>  Atheist physicist who visited the other world </h2><p>  Vladimir Grigoryevich Efremov himself stated that before the clinical death he did not recognize a single religion, he was a complete atheist.  The judgments and arguments of this man were based solely on proven facts.  All the assumptions and deep faith in the <span>afterlife,</span> he said, had nothing to do with reality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clinical death survivors" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431471.jpg" width="600"></div>  At that moment, when everything happened, the physicist never thought about death.  There was a mass of unfinished business in the service, an intensive life rhythm did not even allow one to take care of one's own health, despite complaints.  For the last couple of years, he felt pain in his heart, suffered from chronic bronchitis, and other diseases.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How it all began: clinical death </h2><p>  The sensational revelations that Ephraim shared with the world are amazing to this day.  It is difficult to imagine what a person was experiencing at that moment, given that until recently his brain worked.  When he was in the house of Natalia, the sister of Efremov, he had a coughing fit.  According to him, the lungs stopped working.  The physicist tried to take a breath, but the attempt was in vain.  I felt as if the body became cottony, my heart stopped beating.  Vladimir Grigoryevich even heard the last air come out of his lungs, with wheezing and foam.  Then the thought occurred to him that these were the last seconds. </p><p>  Further, the body and consciousness lost contact with each other.  Understanding what was happening allowed us to assess the situation.  For no reason, a feeling of extraordinary lightness came to Efremov.  There was nothing: no pain, no worries.  The insides seemed to be absent, nothing bothered.  A sense of comfort, as in childhood, made it possible to enjoy incomparable bliss - a person has never had such a feeling in his life. </p><h2>  The ease and bliss of flying to another world </h2><p>  Meanwhile, Vladimir Efremov did not feel or see his body, but all that he knew, remembered, felt, remained with him.  To a physicist who knew all the laws of nature about flights and landings, it seemed that now he himself was flying through an incredibly huge pipe, but this sensation became familiar to him.  Similarly, similar things had happened to him in dreams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="body and mind" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And suddenly he decided to slow down, change the direction of his extraordinary flight.  And to my great surprise, this was not the slightest difficulty.  He did it all.  There was neither fear nor horror - only calmness and tranquility. </p><h2>  What conclusions did the physicist come to? </h2><p>  Vladimir Efremov is a physicist, and, as you know, it is common for all scientists to analyze what is happening.  He was no exception, trying to draw conclusions about the world in which he fell. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="consciousness and reality" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431481.jpg" width="600"></div>  One thing was immediately clear - it exists, and if Efremov managed to coordinate the direction of his flight and slow down its course, then its existence is also beyond doubt.  The ability to search for a causal relationship is a sign of sound rational thinking.

    <h2>  The power of consciousness and the lack of boundaries of the afterlife </h2><p>  In the pipe where Efremov flew, it was interesting, bright and fresh.  Consciousness and reality no longer had anything in common.  Thoughts were completely different.  It seemed as if you were immediately thinking about everything in the world, there were no boundaries: time, distance - they simply did not exist.  The incredibly beautiful surrounding world was like a rolled up roll, inside which there was no sun, but even light spread everywhere, without causing shadows.  To understand what is the top and what is the bottom was impossible. </p><p>  In attempts to remember the terrain over which Vladimir Efremov flew over, he managed to discover that the volumes of his memory were truly unlimited.  As soon as he decided to return to the previous place over which he flew over, he immediately found himself there.  It was more like teleportation. </p><h2>  A look from the "other" world </h2><p>  The physicist was amazed when he recalled his experiences.  He tried to find out how it is possible to influence the world around him and whether he will be able to return to the past.  Immediately an idea came to my mind about an old idle TV in the house.  Efremov saw this item from all directions and was sure that he knew everything about it: starting from the ore, where it was mined, and ending with the family troubles of the designer-assembler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="there is no end" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Absolutely everything was available for perception, although it could somehow be connected with it.  A global awareness of all the details at the same time allowed him to understand that he still did not work on the TV that had actually been in the apartment for several years.  Some time after the clinical death, Efremov corrected everything: the equipment started working thanks to the ‚Äúnews‚Äù from the other world. </p><h2>  Comparison of life on Earth with the other world </h2><p>  As soon as the wide scientific community became aware of the phenomenon, Efremov rained one after another questions about how he could describe the afterlife.  The specialist tried to do this even with the help of physical and mathematical formulas, laws and terms.  However, according to him, to describe that world and compare with something that is in this reality would be incorrect, and therefore impossible.  The main difference between otherworldly life is that absolutely all the processes take place there not in turn, not in a linear order.  All events are common in time. </p><p>  Each object in the afterlife is represented by a separate information block, and the internal content is determined by its location and properties.  Thus, everything is in communication with each other.  Absolutely all objects and everything connected with them are enclosed by a single information chain.  All processes take place in the other world according to God's laws, where God is the very leading subject.  The boundaries of what is subject to him, it is impossible to calculate.  It can make any process, an object appear or change, deprive it of any properties and qualities, regardless of time. </p><h2>  Man is an information block in God's system of the world </h2><p>  A man is to some extent absolutely free in his actions, consciousness.  Being a source of information, it can also affect objects in the sphere accessible to it.  Staying in the afterlife can be compared to an extraordinary computer game, but, unlike toys, both worlds are a reality.  Despite the pronounced isolation from each other, they regularly interact, forming together with God a single intellectual system.  Unlike the <span>other world,</span> our human is much easier to comprehend and perceive.  It is based on clearly defined constants, which ensure the steadfastness of natural laws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sensational revelations" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1431483.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In the other world, constants are a completely unknown concept.  Either there are no installations, or their number does not allow us to safely declare that they exist at all.  If blocks of information can be safely considered the basis for building the afterlife, then on Earth this can be compared to some extent with the principle of computer operation.  In short, a person in the next world can see what he wants.  Hence the differences in the description of otherworldly life by people who survived clinical death. </p><h2>  The Bible and the Underworld: There Are Coincidences </h2><p>  Efremov also said that those feelings and emotions that he managed to experience in the afterlife are incomparable with any joy on Earth.  Having returned to life, in the very near future an atheist physicist, who was in the next world, immediately set about reading the Bible.  And I must say, he managed to find, even indirectly, confirmation of his speculation.  The Gospel says that "the Word was first ...".  Is this not evidence that the ‚Äúword‚Äù is the very global informational meaning that contains the content of everything that exists? </p><p>  The ‚Äújourney‚Äù to the afterlife brought Efremov a lot of experience and knowledge, which he later managed to put into practice.  Not one difficult task, which he could not solve before his clinical death, was solved after his return from the next world.  Vladimir Grigoryevich is sure that the thinking of every person has the property of causality, but not everyone knows about it.  In any case, the standards of life presented by the Bible exist for a reason.  These canons are the rules for the safe stay of all mankind. </p>
