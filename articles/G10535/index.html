  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet access via MTS usb modem</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  ‚ÄúMobile Internet‚Äù is a relatively new concept which means that the network is accessible without wires either in a computer or in a cell phone.  And all thanks to the miniature modem built into the flash card. </p><p>  Today, the most common are not universal modems, but specialized USB devices into which a regular telephone SIM card is inserted.  They are much cheaper.  True, prices have risen significantly this year, but still it‚Äôs very convenient to have a MTS usb modem.  A significant minus of specialized flash drives is that they can insert SIM cards of one operator. </p><p>  MTS USB-modem is a leader in sales of this device.  Included is a SIM card with a new phone number that can be pulled out of the modem and inserted into the cell phone.  And you can make calls directly from your computer through the software. </p><p>  <strong>MTS usb modem: u</strong> <strong>installation</strong> </p><p>  First, you need to insert a SIM card into the device, usually this is done by a specialist in the salon where you purchase a usb modem.  The device is inserted into the usb port.  The "Installation Wizard" window appears immediately.  To install the drivers and the program, you need to follow the instructions (agree to install).  After installation is complete, it is recommended that you restart your computer.  A shortcut of programs with a convenient interface will appear on the desktop (additional tabs: SMS, call, settings).  Using the shortcut, you can open it and, by clicking the button, connect to the Internet. </p><p>  <strong>Using a sim card</strong> </p><p>  The only unpleasant surprise that you will encounter by inserting a SIM card into your phone and saying all the money in your account number is that you will not be able to establish the promised payment or trust.  For these tariffs, these services are not provided.  This would be disadvantageous for the company. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If, on the contrary, insert another SIM card into the MTS usb modem <strong>, the</strong> money will leave your account instantly (after all, this is a different tariff and the Internet charge is provided for in it). </p><p>  <strong>MTS device speed limits</strong> </p><p>  Mobile TeleSystems OJSC today offers several sets called MTS Connect, which differ in data transfer speeds: up to 7.2 Mb / s, 14.4 Mb / s, 21.6 Mb / s. </p><p>  There is also a device with WiFi, its price is quite high.  This is a convenient device and a great alternative to wired access to the network and usb, if you always need the Internet for a minimum price and on multiple computers.  The only negative is that the neighbors can use your WiFi point, although this task is not easy for them, because the coverage radius is only 50 m. </p><p>  When purchasing a MTS usb modem marked, for example, ‚Äúup to 7.2 Mb / s,‚Äù you should not rely on this particular speed.  The fact is that the indicators will depend on the specific place of use of the modem.  In houses with thick walls, the maximum speed will be equal to 1.4 Mb / s.  But this is enough to communicate through video chat, watch movies, videos, download music and movies.  Before you spend more money on a modem, find out how the Internet ‚Äúcatches‚Äù your home. </p><p>  <strong>How to increase speed</strong> </p><p>  The easiest ways: change the location and go online in hours less busy with telephone traffic: namely, after 10 and in the evening after 20. </p><p>  You can also purchase an antenna for the mts usb modem.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãwill increase 2-4 times. </p><p>  <strong>MTS modem: reviews</strong> </p><p>  Most users are outraged by the name of the tariffs: unlimited-Maxi, unlimited-Mini, unlimited-Super ... There are still restrictions, however.  At the first tariff per day, you can download up to 500 Mb, then the speed will be reduced so much (up to 64 Kb / s) that even sites will "open" for quite some time (5-7 minutes).  In the second - up to 1 GB, etc.  And yet you should not slander the company in vain.  Indeed, others in such cases simply block access to the network until the next day. </p><p>  Of course, there are pluses.  For example, service at MTS OJSC.  Any question you can ask the consultant on the round-the-clock telephone line indicated on the box box.  Convenient tariff and account management through the MTS website is also possible. </p>
