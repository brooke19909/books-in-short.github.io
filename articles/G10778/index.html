Few lovers of this soft, elastic fabric know that the earliest finds of knitwear date back to 3 - 1 centuries BC.  Today, in the wardrobe of every person there are things sewn from knitted fabric.  In order not to depend on shops and clothing designers, you can purchase Severyanka knitting machines and create your own products to your taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns on a knitting machine northerner" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804964.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  The best options for working on a knitting machine are cotton, woolen, half-woolen or synthetic threads. </p><p>  What is convenient is the ability to knit on the Severyanka knitting machine with both new and old threads.  It is enough to dissolve the boring product, process the yarn and create a new fashionable masterpiece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting machines northerner" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing yarn, it is important to pay attention to such indicators as strength, uniformity in thickness and the number of torsions over a certain length.  You can independently improve the performance of yarn, for which most often use steaming, in which the skeins are kept in hot water. </p><h2>  Yarn preparation </h2><p>  To reduce the friction of the threads during knitting, it is possible to carry out initial waxing, for this it is enough to bobbin on which the yarn is wound, grease well with paraffin, or when rewinding, pass the thread through two pieces of this substance, holding them in your hands.  This method is suitable for cotton, woolen and half-woolen threads. </p><p>  If you use yarn from a dissolved product, then it should be thoroughly washed in soapy water with a small addition of ammonia, and then thoroughly rinsed in warm water and dried. </p><p>  In order for the Severyanka knitting machines to work efficiently, it is possible to steam the yarn, for which the balls are put in a colander and put in a water bath for 30-60 minutes, after which they are thoroughly dried. </p><h2>  Device knitting machine </h2><p>  The main elements for a manual knitting machine are needles, deckers and platinum, which together form needle-platinum products.  In the presence of these elements, the Severyanka knitting machine (user reviews confirm) allows their rearrangement without affecting the quality of the resulting knitted fabric. </p><p>  This machine has reed needles, in which a special tongue closes the hook when turning along the axis when another loop is removed from it.  The available bowl facilitates close contact between the tongue and the hook during the loop exit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting machine northerner reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804924.jpg" width="400"></div>

When the carriage moves along the needle bar, the wedges move the needles and create one loop at a time. </p><p>  After new loops are formed, the needles rise to the tongue, which provides the final stage of work, in which the loop slides along the needle and falls behind the tongue.  After this, the needles return to their original working condition. </p><h2>  Needle knitting machine </h2><p>  Hand knitting machine "Severyanka" has a needle bar with five blocks.  The needle bar is divided into 168 grooves, inside of which grooves are made of steel, needles move along them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="severnka knitting machine instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804926.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <p>  Two special rails attached to the needle bar are not only a place for the carriage to slide, but also an element for attaching it to the stand.  The stand is made of <span>sheet steel</span> and has a bar with platinum springs.  Knitting machines "Severyanka" are equipped along the platinum with a special shield with discs with a rubber gasket.  Disks are used at the beginning of the process when securing threads. </p><p>  The needle bar along with the rails is fixed with screws and nuts to the stand, while the displacement of blocks and rails in relation to it is maintained.  This allows the needles to pass freely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Repair of knitting machines "Severyanka", such as replacing the needle, is carried out independently according to the instructions.  More serious failures should be repaired by specialists in household appliances repair workshops. </p><h2>  Needle Replacement </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSeveryanka‚Äù is a knitting machine, the instructions for which offer simple steps to replace a broken needle: </p><ul><li>  First of all, loosen the screws of the upper rail near the needle; </li><li>  raise the weakened rail and remove the broken needle; </li><li>  insert a new needle, tighten the screws and check how the carriage slides along the rail; </li><li>  After checking the slide quality of the carriage, tighten the screws tightly. </li></ul><p>  When performing this work, it is necessary to ensure that all the needles are inoperative. </p><h2>  Installation of a knitting machine </h2><p>  Knitting machines "Severyanka" have a high accuracy of tasks, if all the rules of use and its maintenance are observed. </p><p>  When buying a new manual knitting machine, it should be thoroughly wiped with a soft cloth to prevent grease.  Then, using a thin soft brush, you need to lubricate all the main elements of the machine with machine oil.  This should be done both with new equipment and used.  It is important that kerosene, oil or gasoline do not get on plastic parts. </p><p>  After the preparatory work, the Severyanka knitting machine (customer reviews note this) is easily attached to the edge of the table with the clamps on the stand.  On the needle bar, it is necessary to set the needles in the inoperative position, and only then install the carriage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="repair knitting machines northerner" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804942.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The carriage is inserted into the rails and the ease of sliding is checked.  After this, you should check that the brushes do not come into contact with the platinum, and the loop counter is at the required angle.  All detailed instructions are in the instructions for the machine. </p><p>  Before starting knitting, you need to set the required number of needles in the working position.  To facilitate the calculation, on the Severyanka machine, every 10th platinum is painted <span>black.</span>  In this case, all unclaimed needles should abut against the lower rail. </p><p>  By moving the carriage from right to left, the needles are put into working position, after which the density adjustment of the loops is set.  The length of the loops depends solely on the thickness of the thread. </p><h2>  Knitting methods </h2><p>  There is a trial type of knitting, in which with the help of open loops the density and length of the loops, and the main one, are set. </p><p>  To get an open edge, you need to install the carriage on the left, fasten the tip of the thread to the left washer of the shield made of rubber.  With your right hand, a thread is stretched to the ready-for-use needle tongues, and the carriage is moved to the right.  Then you need to do the same with your left hand, and move the carriage to the left.  It is important that the thread is always wound around the nose of platinum, which is located behind the last working needle. </p><p>  The main thing is knitting with closed loops.  To do this, the thread tip should also be fixed to the left washer of the shield, but do not pull it, and wrap around the heads of the working needles from right to left, and then move the carriage to the left.  In this case, the loops pass under the tongues of the needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting on a knitting machine northerner" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804954.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Then with your left hand you need to get the thread behind the first working platinum, and also draw the thread on the open tongues, after which the carriage will be moved to the right.  The thread is always laid along the movement of the carriage so that there are no breaks.  The carriage must always be brought to the end, otherwise the needles and grooves may break. </p><h2>  Knitting fabrics with patterns </h2><p>  To get not only a smooth knitted fabric, but also patterns on the Severyanka knitting machine, manual operations should be added to the work of the technique.  At the same time, you can create countless patterns for every taste. </p><p>  Using manual operations, you can create incomplete knitwear in which the weave does not form several looped posts.  This is done by simply turning off the needles from the working state, which allows you to create any openwork patterns. </p><p>  With the addition of manual operations, you can create knitwear with uneven and inclined loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hand knitting machine northerner" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/804956.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <h2>  Knitting Machine Features </h2><p>  Using the Severyanka knitting machine, it is possible to produce both knitted fabric with its further application and finished products: socks, gloves, mittens, skirts, sweaters and much more. </p><p>  The main models are given in the instructions, but you can adapt the capabilities of the machine for modern and trendy models of any complexity. </p>
