    <p>  Opinions of vacationers about the hotel were divided.  Some do not advise him.  Others are praised and highly recommended.  The novelty of the rooms is an advantage of the hotel, with which everyone agrees.  For some, impressions of being in Nha Trang were spoiled by a neighboring construction site.  Workers on it worked not only during the day, but also at night.  They were very noisy.  Spotlights shone brightly. </p><p>  They note some and inconvenient location of air conditioners.  Airflow blows straight onto the bed.  Because of this, tourists caught a cold.  In cranes, as many say, a weak pressure of water.  It was difficult to wash.  There were few towels in the bathroom, but there were terry bathrobes.  The maids did not replenish the stock of cosmetic and hygiene supplies.  I had to ask about it. </p><p>  In reviews of Verano Beach Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang), Russians complained about a meager breakfast.  Not everyone had enough cutlery.  Insects were flying in the restaurant hall.  Tables were poorly wiped, so crumbs lay on them.  Every morning, fried eggs were cooked.  Before the weekend, the hotel was flooded with visitors from China.  Queues piled up at the food distribution counter.  Getting your portion was problematic. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2>

    <p>  Visiting card of Nha Trang - Vinpearl amusement park.  Rides are open every day.  Skating starts at 08:30, ends at 21:00.  Adults and children like electric sledges, a Ferris wheel and carousels.  The complex has a water park.  The pools and the water in it are clean.  They come here for the whole day.  In high season there are a lot of visitors.  It is getting crowded. </p><p>  Tourists in a review of Verano Beach Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) recommend that you do not purchase a comprehensive ticket to Vinpearl from a travel agent who is on duty at the hotel.  The food under the All Inclusive offer in the park is very modest.  It’s cheaper to buy a regular ticket and pay for food yourself.  The choice of dishes is large.  A lot of establishments with affordable prices. </p><p>  Another fun in Nha Trang is skiing.  The funicular starts operating at 08:00, but you should arrive in advance.  Already at 07:30 a queue is formed.  From the cabin, which glides over the sea at an altitude of about 75 meters, a picturesque panorama of the island opens.  Visible hills and tropical thickets. </p><p>  Tyama towers rise above the resort.  They can be seen from anywhere in the town.  Entrance to the museum costs about 70 rubles.  Since this place is a functioning monastery, priests and offerings are held in the temple.  A visit to this attraction is included in the programs of most sightseeing tours.  You can visit the monastery yourself. </p>
