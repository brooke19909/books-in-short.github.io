Millions of people rent housing.  And in the modern world this is a normal process.  We break out of the parent nest and go to study in another region, to build a career.  There is no way to do without a rented apartment.  But, how not to become a victim of fraud?  How to rent an apartment without negative consequences?  We will give useful advice to those who are trying to start a new life for themselves. </p><h2>  Be careful in everything </h2><p>  The very first announcement in a newspaper or on the Internet indicates that the apartment is for rent "for a penny" with repair, new appliances and near the metro (if the city has a metro).  Do not jump to the ceiling with joy and think that introducing into this wonderful apartment is only a matter of time.  Most likely, this is just an advertisement.  "Zamanuha," as they would say in the common people.  Probably, these are realtors who thus attract customers.  And after the call they offer completely different options.  They will also tell you that daily rent of apartments in Sumy costs only a symbolic amount.  And, if you are looking for long-term rental housing, be careful. </p>

    <p>  To get started, check the documents for the apartment.  There are so many fraudsters in every city that it is impossible to count.  They act simply, but efficiently.  The tenant transfers the attractive apartment to third parties, takes a deposit several months in advance, and then hides in an unknown direction.  As a result, the owner of the treasured square meters remains “with a nose”, and honest people (who paid the deposit) are left without money even on the street.  How not to become a victim of fraud in this case?  Everything is quite simple: </p><ol><li>  make sure that the apartment belongs to this particular person who is asking for your deposit; </li><li>  check documents carefully, do not be shy.  You have every right to do so; </li><li>  if there are no documents, in no case do not pay an advance.  Perhaps you are a fraudster: </li><li>  in the event that all documents are in perfect order, give money against receipt.  No need to build a relationship "on parole." </li></ol><h2>  Be sure to draw up a contract </h2><p>  Even if you are renting an apartment “by acquaintance, be sure to draw up a bilateral agreement.  For some reason, many forget about this simple rule.  And then unpleasant situations arise, up to involving law enforcement officers in the proceedings.  To everything else, never go to inspect the apartment alone.  It will be great if your companion / companion is a person with a legal education.  Be wiser, and you will surely succeed! </p><p>  According to the materials of the site: www.dobovo.com </p></div></article>
