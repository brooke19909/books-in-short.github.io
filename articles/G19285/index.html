    <p>  How is the new product different from previous models?  First of all, Samsung Wave 3 has become a little more.  The increase in size is striking.  Although the dimensions have grown, the thickness of the device has become much smaller, only 9.9 mm.  The device weighs a little, only 122 grams.  You can use the device comfortably with one hand. </p><p>  Attracts Samsung S8600 Wave 3 and a rugged case.  Users prefer devices running on Bada, precisely because of this factor.  The body of the device is made of <span>anodized aluminum.</span>  We have not forgotten about protecting the display either.  The front of the device is covered with <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  The manufacturer protected its brainchild from dirt and fingerprints.  The smartphone received a good <span>oleophobic coating.</span> </p><p>  The device is collapsible, which means that the battery and slots for SIM cards and flash drives are hidden behind the lid, on the back side.  The panel is removed quite simply, and you should not worry about its damage.  Assembling the phone, as always, is at its best.  Actually, nothing was expected from the device of the eminent Korean company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the front of the device were placed: a speaker, a display, a camera, a Home button and sensors.  The bottom end is reserved for a <span>USB</span> connector <span>, a microphone</span> and a headset jack.  At the back of the device is the main camera, speaker, flash and company logo.  The volume control is "sheltered" on the left side, and the power button on the right. </p><p>  The smartphone looks pretty solid.  The manufacturer did a good job on the appearance of the device.  Compared to devices on Android, Wave 3 definitely wins.  Interesting design and metal body attract attention. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  Given that Samsung Wave 3 features are not the most advanced, the 1500 maH battery looks good.  The device is able to work for two days without additional charge.  Of course, with active use, the battery runs out faster. </p><p>  The battery installed in the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 will last 8-9 hours in talk mode.  The device‚Äôs battery runs out a little faster when watching videos and browsing the Internet. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  <span>Samsung</span> Wave 3 received a five-megapixel sensor from the <span>manufacturer</span> .  Waiting for excellent quality is not worth it.  The camera is no different from many state employees.  For everyday needs, quality is enough.  In addition, the lack of a camera start button upsets.  The manufacturer refused an additional mechanical element on the case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Although the Samsung Wave 3 GT-S8600 camera is modest, it received a minimal set of functions.  The user will appreciate the presence of a flash and autofocus in the device.  Also there are the most necessary settings.  The owner will be able to change the white balance, image resolution, ISO and, of course, contrast. </p><p>  The maximum resolution available on the smartphone‚Äôs camera is 2560 by 1920 pixels.  The video will be more interesting for the user.  The device shoots videos in HD-quality (1280 by 720).  Naturally, the video turns out a bit grainy and without proper sharpness, but in general everything is decent. </p><p>  Present in the "Korean" and frontalka.  The matrix of the facial eye has only 0.3 megapixels.  Such a front camera can handle except video calls.  The front camera is not capable of more.  Self-portrait lovers will be forced to forget about its presence altogether.  The image is obtained with low detail, grain and color rendering problems. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The Samsung Wave 3 screen is pretty advanced.  The manufacturer did not stint and equipped the phone with a flagship display.  The device received a diagonal of four inches.  Of course, a resolution of 800 by 480 pixels is not particularly impressive.  Cubes immediately rush into the user's eyes.  Although for the 2011 device, the quality is excellent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The display has a Super Amoled matrix.  This allowed us to improve the brightness, sharpness and contrast of the picture.  The screen shows itself well in the sun.  Stock brightness and excellent matrix to avoid fading images.  Separately, it is worth noting good viewing angles. </p><p>  Complaints will not arise to the sensor of the device.  The display responds to every touch, despite the <span>protective glass.</span>  The Samsung Wave 3 screen is not inferior to Android devices and even surpasses them.  Few devices released in 2011 can boast of such a set of features. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  Qualcomm MSM8225 was chosen as the Samsung Wave 3 processor.  The chip is single-core, and its performance is only 1.4 GHz.  The processor is not the latest, but for a mid-range device it will do.  The smartphone received an Adreno video accelerator, model 205. </p><p>  The device has only 3 gigabytes of internal memory.  Of course, part is reserved for the platform, and a little more than 2 GB is available to the user.  Fortunately, you can solve the problem of lack of memory using a flash drive up to 32 GB. </p><p>  Like almost all phones released in 2011, Samsung Wave 3 received 512 MB of RAM.  There is enough memory to ensure normal data processing speed. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The Wave 3 firmware is definitely better developed than in its predecessor.  The smartphone is running Bada 2.0.  The manufacturer added its proprietary TouchWiz shell to the platform. </p><p>  The ambiguous impression of the Samsung Wave 3 firmware is emerging. The platform has many settings and looks more interesting than Android, but there are also disadvantages.  Application management is not well developed.  In some programs, the touch elements refuse to work. </p><p>  The lack of many useful applications is also upsetting.  The system is not adapted for the same Skype and other programs.  The "axis" Bada is not able to provide all the needs of an advanced user.  Most likely, even a radical change in the OS will not make it able to compete with Android. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  Together with Wave 3, the user will get: USB cable, headset, documentation, network adapter.  The set is standard and definitely needs to be supplemented.  The user will need a flash drive to expand the memory, and a cover for Samsung will be useful.  Of course, the metal case and protective glass protect the device from damage.  However, the case for Samsung will prevent minor scratches or damage from falling. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Wave 3 works in 2G- as well as 3G-networks.  In addition to GPRS and EDGE, the device received a Wi-Fi function.  To transfer information, the user can use USB and Bluetooth. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Attracts attention to this "dude" and low cost.  You can buy a device for 3-4 thousand rubles.  The price for a reliable device is very affordable.  Low cost bribed the majority of owners of Wave 3. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Like all phones based on the Bada platform, Samsung Wave 3 turned out to be very stylish.  The appearance of the device is much more attractive and interesting than that of the brothers on the "Android".  Tempered glass and the metal case of the device attract users. </p><p>  Give credit and the gadget display.  The smartphone received a flagship screen with excellent brightness and viewing angles.  Of course, against the background of modern devices, a resolution of 800 by 480 looks mediocre, but for the 2011 model, the characteristics are more than impressive. </p><p>  The battery also showed good results.  A battery of only 1,500 maH provides long-term operation of the device.  The "filling" is not particularly "gluttonous", and most of the charge is spent on communication and the screen.  The system also contributed.  Compared to Android, Wave 3 OS consumes less power.  The smartphone is able to "live" for two days.  If you replace the battery with an analog with a larger capacity, you can completely forget about recharging. </p><p>  Despite the terrible quality of the pictures, the video from the device is not bad.  The smartphone is capable of recording videos in HD quality, which is definitely pleasing. </p><p>  The price for this miracle plays a key role for buyers.  Low cost pushed the acquisition of Wave 3 of almost all of its owners. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2>

    <p>  The main problem of the device is precisely its unusualness.  According to reviews, the Bada 2.0 system was not only an interesting solution, but also a problem.  Many applications are not adapted for the OS, and the user loses useful resources.  The system itself also seems unfinished.  One gets the feeling that the platform is devoid of integrity. </p><p>  The hardware will also be a problem for the owner.  If you can still put up with a 512 MB RAM, then native memory drives you into a gloom.  A little more than 2 GB of memory is available to the user.  It is impossible to do without a flash drive, which means that the buyer should include the cost of the card in the price of the device in advance. </p><p>  Not impressive owners and camera apparatus.  A 5 megapixel sensor is not capable of providing acceptable quality.  Low detail and poor color reproduction - this is what the user will encounter.  The front-line also does not cause joy.  An ordinary 0.3 MP peephole is of little use.  The ability to record HD clips slightly improves the impression of the camera. </p><p>  The buyer should pre-configure that the device is intended for the most part for calls and work on the Internet.  Low functionality and the inability to install useful programs make the device unsuitable for advanced users. </p><p>  Many buyers are faced with a picking problem.  In some stores, dialing was incomplete.  Most often, a device headset was missing.  Most likely, the problem is the place of purchase. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The phone is stylish in appearance, but with a fairly simple "stuffing".  Deteriorating position and OS.  Although Wave 3 is considered a smartphone, in fact it is a regular cell phone with Internet access.  The phone is suitable for SMS, calls and small tasks.  The owner should not count on more. </p>
