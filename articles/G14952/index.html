The first general plan of the settlement was approved by Vorontsov.  It should be said that the prince was, in fact, the founder of the city.  The plan was approved in 1849.  According to the project, it was supposed to realize a perpendicular perspective of 22 streets.  A central avenue and several squares were also envisaged.  By 1856, Gostiny Dvor was built.  Today it is a monument of architecture and history.  The area inside the courtyard and the surrounding streets were paved in the 1890-97th years.  By decree issued by Nicholas I, all streets should be constructed in accordance with the adopted project. </p>

    <p>  The architectural appearance of the center reflects all the directions that existed in Russian architecture in the second half of the XIX - early XX centuries.  Each merchant house built at that time has its own characteristics - it is unique and beautiful in its own way.  At the same time, all buildings can be combined according to the variety of decoration elements.  Mandatory details were turrets, porches, laid-out kokoshniks, terraces, openwork wrought-iron elytra, tents, cornices.  In the architecture of the XIX century, this direction was called <span>"pseudo-Russian style."</span>  Its use was mainly associated with the general enthusiasm of provincial and metropolitan circles for "fashion for Russian", a tendency to tried-and-tested, well-known architectural forms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today the city of Yeysk (Krasnodar Territory) is a complex of buildings that were created in the architectural directions of three eras: the monarchist, Soviet and the period of the late 90s.  A new style is under development.  Its implementation is expected during the development of microdistricts 39 and 40, a cottage village and Taganrog embankment.  All this activity has a direct connection with the new leadership of the city - Alexander Laschenkov and Sergey Tulinov. </p><h2>  Areas </h2><p>  Conventionally, you can divide a settlement into several parts.  Of greatest interest to tourists is usually the Yeisk Spit.  Many tourist centers are concentrated here, the main beaches are located.  There is also a yacht club and an amusement park.  The Yeisk Spit is adjacent to the zone, which includes a seaport, the territory of the railway station and a number of plants.  In accordance with the new general plan, it is supposed to transfer the territory of the berths beyond the boundaries of the settlement. </p><p>  In the south-west direction begins the historical part of Yeisk - the Merchant city.  The main development of these territories was carried out in the XIX century.  That part is conditionally limited to the modern streets of <span>Bogdan Khmelnitsky</span> and Sergey Roman.  The territory of the Merchant Yeisk itself is presented in the form of a complex of streets located strictly perpendicularly.  The so-called Center is separately highlighted.  This territory is adjacent to the main city market and Gostiny Dvor.  In general, the Merchant Yeisk retained the appearance of the southern provincial port town. </p><p>  In the west, the village is limited to the airport.  Adjacent to its territory is one of the most populated microdistricts of Yeysk - the Military Town.  This part includes a housing estate and a site occupied by the local Military Aviation Institute.  In the same territory is one of the main attractions of Yeysk - Park them.  Poddubny.  In the south direction from the Merchant part is a new housing estate and industrial zone.  The housing estate includes several microdistricts: 38th and 2nd, "Field of Tears" and "Sunny".  These areas are considered the youngest of all, which includes the city of Yeysk (Krasnodar Territory). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar Territory city of Yusk Avito" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479927.jpg" width="550"></div>
