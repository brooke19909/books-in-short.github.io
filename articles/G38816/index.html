  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since its inception, Kievan Rus was not a <span>unitary state.</span>  Its first division took place as early as 972, and later each new dynasty in power tried to isolate itself.  The political entities that took place at that time in the territory of modern Russia, Belarus and Ukraine existed as separate principalities and were called Udelnaya Rus. </p><p>  Until the 13th century, <span>northeastern Russia</span> was called Suzdal land in chronicles, and from the end of that century it became known as the Great Vladimir Principality.  Studying historical data relating to the period of the XII-XVI centuries, special attention is paid to the main territorial entities, one of which is the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.  Many interesting facts have come down to us from the history of its existence. </p><p>  The princes of Vladimir and Suzdal were laid in the 11th-12th centuries.  Starting with the youngest son of Monomakh, <span>Yu. Dolgoruky,</span> the development of this land began.  He and his sons did much to strengthen not only their own power, but also to elevate the principality over others. </p><p>  After many years of struggle, Prince Yu. Dolgoruky finally established himself in the reign of Kiev.  Later, the capital of the Rostov-Suzdal principality was moved to Vladimir.  This was due to the move of the son of Yu. Dolgoruky, Andrei.  His name is associated with the heyday of Vladimir, who became the capital, which has become famous in history for its competent politics and the desire to unite neighboring lands. </p><p>  The Vladimir-Suzdal principality occupied a fairly vast territory.  It existed in the 11th ‚Äì 13th centuries, geographically located between the Volga and Oka rivers.  From the north, it reached the settlements of Beloozero and Ustyug.  Before the Vladimir-Suzdal principality was formed here, the territory of these lands was occupied by Finno-Ugric tribes.  In the course of history Great Russian nationalities formed here, and in the process of feudalization the cities of Yaroslavl, Murom, Suzdal grew.  In those years, craft developed intensively in these places, which reached a significant level.  The craftsmanship of local artisans was well known far beyond the region. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Vladimir-Suzdal principality was also famous for the processing of iron and other metals.  The building industry, pottery and many other crafts that subsequently reached a decent level were held in high esteem.  Trade that was actively conducted by the merchants of Vladimir-Suzdal Rus did not go unnoticed.  Purchase and sale was carried out not only with the merchants of the remaining Russian lands, but also with the Volga Bulgaria, Byzantium, etc. </p><p>  The monuments that have reached us speak of the high level at which the culture of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality was.  Until now, this region is an ancient historical and cultural center of the Russian land.  This region has had a rich history since the time of the Russian Middle Ages.  It was at that time that the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl, the <span>Dmitrievsky Cathedral was built,</span> the Assumption five-domed Cathedral was restored. </p><p>  Subsequently, Vladimir was barbarously looted, burned and destroyed by the Mongol-Tatar invaders, but even when the crushing of Russian lands again occurred, Vladimir continued to remain the official capital of Russia until the middle of the 15th century.  The Principality officially ceased to exist in 1432, having withstood the heavy burden of various interventions and administrative-territorial changes during its existence.  Despite all this, the culture of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality was preserved in architectural structures, monuments of urban planning.  All of them are of national, historical and <span>cultural value,</span> protected by the state. </p><p>  The princes of the Dolgoruky tried to turn the Vladimir-Suzdal principality into a religious center.  That is why they tried to create it as powerful as possible. </p>
