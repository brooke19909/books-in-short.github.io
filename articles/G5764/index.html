Precious stones are still found on dumps.  Many quarries after workings remain abandoned.  And Lipovsky belongs to this category.  Although it still has reserves, it is not ore, but gems that have not been completely extracted from the earth. </p><h2>  Where did the name of the quarry come from? </h2><p>  Lipovsky quarry (Sverdlovsk region) got its name from a nearby village, just 1.5 kilometers away.  The village is old.  The first house appeared there in 1681. The village was named Lipovsky.  And this is not surprising, since in former times, when they were just beginning to develop this land, peasants constantly found amethysts, quartz, citrine and other gems and minerals on arable lands and gardens.  And treasure hunters began to “stick” to this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lipovsky quarry Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1516671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gem and ore deposit </h2><p>  Over time, the village surroundings were gradually surrounded by artisanal mines.  1920 was the richest in gems found: aquamarines, topazes, amethysts, etc. This year 120 people worked in the quarry.  In the 1930s  Lipovsky quarry (Sverdlovsk region) became even more popular, as a nickel ore deposit was discovered there.  The search for gems came in second place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The quarry began to be developed for nickel mining.  He went to the Rezhevsky plant.  And the first smelting on it took place in 1936. Lipovsky quarry (Sverdlovsk region) exploded at night.  In 1980, tourmalines were accidentally discovered in a quarry.  The vein of the crystal deposit extended over 2.5 km.  The ore mining site was illuminated by spotlights.  And the crystals found after the next explosion sparkled in the light. </p><p>  Workers began collecting gems in bags.  The length of the tourmaline was up to 75 cm, and across - from 15 to 25 centimeters.  But ore was more important for the factory superiors.  And all tourmalines, the workers, by order, were covered with earth.  And then, together with sand and clay, they were taken to dumps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lipov quarry is it possible to swim" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1516670.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1991, when ore reserves were depleted, the Lipovsky quarry became part of the Rezhevsky reserve.  The deposit was closed.  The quarry was filled with water, and a small lake formed.  Its maximum depth is 120 meters. </p><h2>  Lipovsky quarry today </h2><p>  After all ore was mined in the Lipovsky quarry, the deposit was abandoned.  On its slopes, vegetation and young trees begin to appear.  Ore mining facilities are still standing near the quarry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are preserved outbuildings, an office building and a dining room.  But all this is in a dilapidated state.  Due to the extraction of ore for the entire period, 626 hectares of land were destroyed.  Of it (in ha), 422 are arable land, 72 are hayfields, 90 are forests and 38 are pastures.  And somewhere underground many gems are still hidden. </p><p>  On the territory of the Rezhevsky district, the Lipovsky quarry is considered the largest.  Is it possible to swim in it?  Since the field has long been abandoned, nature began to restore disturbed harmony.  And now you can swim in the lake formed on the site of the quarry.  Due to the remaining “crumbs” of nickel and talc, the water in the resulting lake acquired an unusual turquoise hue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dir Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1516669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the quarry? </h2><p>  In order to get to the quarry, you need to leave Yekaterinburg to the city called Rezh (Sverdlovsk region).  Drive him and <strong> </strong>  head along the highway towards Nevyansk.  Round Lipovskoye without stopping until a clear left turn appears.  On this dirt road you need to get to the largest quarry.  This will be the center of the Lipovsky deposit of gems and nickel. </p><p>  The path described above is for cars.  But you can get to the quarry using public transport.  Take a train or bus to the above city.  Then transfer to transport heading to Lipovskoye.  And from there - on foot to the quarries.  This is about an hour's walk. </p><p>  There are other careers nearby.  They are also considered Lipovsky, but much smaller in size.  To get to them, you need to turn right from the asphalt road.  But driving up to them is quite difficult, since the road is partially blurred.  But you can walk on foot. </p>
