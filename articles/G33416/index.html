    <h2>  Hotel building </h2><p>  Stardust Beach Hotel 4 * Family is a great place to relax with the whole family.  The hotel management is trying to do everything possible so that vacationers can feel at home.  The hotel is relatively young since it was built only in 2005.  The last restoration was carried out in 2012, which once again proves the seriousness of the hotel in its intentions to attract a large number of tourists.  The facade of the building is a four-complex, where there are seventy rooms.  The total occupied area is about 4600 square meters.  As for flowers, Stardust Beach Hotel 4 * Large did not use exotic coloring in coloring, but settled on a combination of white and red more familiar to Turkish hotels.  The entire building is painted white with the exception of the roof and visors, which are painted in red. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  This issue may arise immediately after the tourist decided to settle in this place.  Stardust <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> Standard is located not quite in Kemer, but at a distance of 5 km from its center.  That is, we can say that the hotel is located on the outskirts of the spa town in the Camyuva area.  There is no city airport in Kemer, therefore, to get to the city, you must first fly to Antalya, whose airport is closest to Kemer.  You can fly to Antalya through both fixed and charter flights.  The ticket price can vary from 300 to 400 US dollars.  After you arrive at the airport, you need to go to the bus station and wait for the flight to Kemer.  The journey time from Antalya to Kemer is about an hour.  If you do not want to wait for the bus at the station, you can use the service provided by Stardust Beach Hotel 4 * Standard.  The meaning of this service is that you can specify in advance in the conditions of settlement that a taxi is transporting you from the airport to the hotel.  This service is paid, but for those who want to save their time and effort, it will be very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stardust beach hotel 4 standard" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/593483.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is 5 km from the center of Kemer in an area called Camyuva.  The advantage of this arrangement is its proximity to nature and its beauty in the form of forests and mountains.  Also an undoubted advantage is the close position relative to the beach of the Mediterranean Sea.  The distance to the coastline is only 200 meters, which allows tourists to choose between relaxing on the beach or in a sun lounger and under an umbrella, but near the pool.  Among the minuses of this hotel location, it should be noted its greater remoteness from the airport than other hotels.  But even despite the distance of 62 km, from Antalya Airport to Stardust Beach Hotel 4 * can be reached in 40 minutes by taxi.  It is 5 km from the center of Kemer.  This can create difficulties for those people who want to visit the museums and attractions of the city.  So before choosing this hotel, you need to clearly decide for yourself what you want to do in Kemer.  If the goal is to rest by the sea, then this option is very good. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  The hotel is a four-star hotel, which means that all the services it provides correspond to this class.  Conventionally, all services can be divided into those that are provided internally and those that are provided outside the complex.  Among external services, first of all, the possibility of transfer from the airport to the hotel should be highlighted.  Such a service is paid, and it should be agreed upon even before flying to Antalya.  Among other paid hotel services, one can single out the possibility of renting a car for more comfortable movement around the city.  Also, for guests, the Stardust Beach Hotel offers the opportunity to exchange their own currency for the local one.  This service is very convenient, because almost all goods in the city are sold only for <span>Turkish liras.</span>  The exchange rate is not much different from that set by the Central Bank of the country.  Internal service includes the possibility of receiving spa massage (also for a fee).  Among the free services provided by the hotel, it is worth highlighting the possibility of using a swimming pool and sauna, a fitness area for exercising, as well as breakfast and dinner in a local restaurant in the case of the all-inclusive option.  For those people who want to relax on the beach by the Mediterranean Sea, the service of providing sun loungers and umbrellas is provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  All rooms in the hotel are standard, so the cost of living in them does not differ too much.  The main reason for overpricing for one night at the hotel are the options that are included when you enter the room.  The most expensive is the room for living on the concept of "all inclusive".  The cost of one night for two will cost $ 66.  A regular room with breakfast included will cost $ 48.  Despite the fact that ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù combines a lot of free services, options such as renting a car or transfer from the airport must be paid extra. </p><h2>  What to see in the city? </h2><p>  Since the hotel is located not quite in the city, there is a very beautiful nature and forests.  Beautiful and tall cedars grow in the forest, which gives this place a fabulous look.  Most often, they come to the resort town in order to stay closer to the sea.  In our case, the 4 * Stardust Beach Hotel hotel is located just two hundred meters from the sea, which allows you to spend a couple of minutes on the road to it.  In Kemer itself there are several interesting places.  The first of them is a unique park, which tells and shows the whole history of the nomadic tribes who lived here several centuries ago.  There is also an excellent natural park, where a large number of different trees are collected. </p><h2>  Offers for tourists </h2><p>  After checking into a hotel you need to develop a plan for yourself, according to which your vacation will take place.  First of all, you need to enjoy all the delights of the sea, its clean and pleasant water.  Also in Kemer there are several interesting places that, in principle, can be examined literally in one day.  Be sure to visit the forest, which is located near the city.  Kemer is located only sixty kilometers from Antalya, so people who love excursions can go to this amazing city and enjoy the stunning sights that have remained here since ancient Greece. </p>
