    <h2>  Pasha historical background </h2><p>  Rustem Pasha is an extraordinary person in the history of the Ottoman Empire.  His life was bright, and his career path was long and far from boring!  Until now, historians have been arguing about the birthplace of the Great Vizier (about 1500).  Some consider Croatia to be the birthplace of Pasha, others - Bosnia. </p><p>  As a child, he arrived in Istanbul with his brother, enrolled in Enderun (training center in the Topkapi Palace).  And already in 1526, as a sultan squire, he went to the <span>battle of Mohach,</span> where he showed his extraordinary nature.  Then begins his career advancement.  After 7 years, he becomes governor in Teke, after another 5 years, he acquires the post of Bayerbey of Anatolia!  A year later, he was appointed the third vizier of the Sultan.  In the same year, 1539, he marries the Ottoman princess - Mihrimah, daughter of the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Haseki Sultan!  After 5 years, the Ottoman ruler decides to appoint Rustem the Great Vizier of the Empire.  So Pasha took one of the main posts in the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His ascent was not easy.  A huge number of envious people got in the way of the venerable gentleman, but thanks to his insight, wisdom and cunning, Pasha cleverly eliminated enemy intrigues.  This is another reason to visit the Rustem Pasha Mosque. </p>

    <h2>  Family life of the chief vizier of the Ottoman Empire </h2><p>  In 1539, Rustem marries the only daughter of Sultan Suleiman I Mikhrim, whom he had long been in love with. </p><p>  So that no-one (wedding ceremony) would take place, Rustem‚Äôs spiteful critics rumored that he was sick with leprosy.  Then the resourceful Pasha went to the trick - he planted a louse on himself!  Already at that time it was known that lice did not sit on patients with leprosy.  Upon examination, the doctor discovered a parasite on the venerable gentleman and issued a verdict that Rustem was completely healthy. </p><p>  According to the script of the series "Magnificent Century," Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska recommended Rustem as a groom for her daughter.  And the wedding took place only because Pasha was extremely impressed by the Sultan, because the last word belonged to the head of state.  But Mikhrimakh was against this union.  So it was in the series, but not in reality. </p><p>  How happy the daughter of the Sultan was married to Pasha, we can only guess, however, historical sources say that they had common children.  Husband and wife were engaged in charity work together, opened funds and sponsored the construction of various social institutions of the time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Legend of the Great Vizier Mosque </h2><p>  To this day, the Rustem Pasha Mosque is beautiful.  Mr. died already at the age of 60 from dropsy, leaving the young Mikhrimakh Sultan with his children.  In memory of her beloved husband, she decides to build a mosque.  It was designed by the famous architect of the time, Sinan, who created religious centers and madrassas on the orders of the Sultan Suleiman and Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Haseki Sultan. </p><p>  Usually mosques were built with at least two minarets, but the Mihrimah Sultan ordered Sinan to erect a mosque with one elegant minaret, which would symbolize her loneliness and devotion to her husband even after his death. </p><p>  Nowadays, the Rustem Pasha Mosque is open to tourists.  Feedback from visitors is only positive.  Around the building is a noisy market, but when you go inside, the visitor will hear only his own thoughts! </p>

    <h2>  Rustem Pasha Mosque: description </h2><p>  The construction of a religious project began shortly before the death of the aforementioned gentleman in 1561.  So the chief adviser did not even have time to see her.  The opening of the holy place took place in 1563.  The Rustem Pasha Mosque was built in just two years. </p><p>  The appearance of the building is simple.  It has a classic rectangular shape at the base with one main dome and one minaret.  However, the interior of the mosque is amazing at first sight.  The family of Mihrimah and Rustem had a huge fortune, so the daughter of the Sultan did not skimp on the decorations of the mosque. </p><p>  The walls are lined with expensive blue and blue tiles of the time.  It depicts all kinds of patterns and ornaments from flowers, including tulips (a symbol of a noble family).  Ceramics masters from Iznik painstakingly worked on the image of the city of Mecca (center of Islam) on the main tile. </p><p>  The Rustem Pasha Mosque has good lighting due to the large number of windows in the dome and walls of the building.  In combination with blue-blue walls, the lighting seems to envelop the visitors of the mosque with a historical cover. </p>
