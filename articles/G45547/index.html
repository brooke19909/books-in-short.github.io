    <h2>  What is sisal fiber made of? </h2><p>  This material is made from the leaves of a Mexican agave - a herbaceous shrub that grows in a subtropical climate.  Sisal fibers are very stiff and rather coarse, but have very high strength.  Interestingly, for their manufacture does not require any special technology and unpainted material looks very natural, as it has a brilliant shade of yellow.  The main purpose of this fiber is to create strong <span>ropes, ropes,</span> decorative crafts, various brushes and washcloths.  We are interested in the use of sisal as a material for handmade art.  But what if the city does not sell this amazing fiber?  You can make sisal with your own hands, this will require a little patience and inexpensive goods from the hardware store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sisal fiber" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336684.jpg?1392551487901" width="376"></div>

The cost of such a tool is negligible, only 60-70 rubles, and a large amount of fiber can be pulled from it.  You need to choose brushes with a very thin and necessarily natural pile.  Crafts from sisal come in a variety of colors, as the material itself is flaxen in color and requires additional dyeing of the resulting fibers.  This process is also very simple. </p><p>  To give the material a suitable color, powder or tablet <span>food coloring is used,</span> which can be stocked up for free during various promotions held in stores before Easter.  But you can just buy them very cheaply.  Very hot water is poured into a suitable size plate, you can boil water, add a tablespoon of ordinary vinegar and the desired dye.  Sisal is divided into strands, which are soaked in the resulting solution for 2-2.5 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself sisal" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336681.jpg?1392551514525" width="369"></div>

    <h2>  Secrets of shades of sisal </h2><p>  The soaked material is laid out for drying on clean album sheets.  It is better not to use the newspaper, as letters may be printed.  To get a variety of shades, it is worth practicing in mixing dyes.  You can also use ordinary zelenka, blue, potassium permanganate, beetroot juice, coffee, strong tea and many other traditional substances that can convey their color to the material.  To get sisal of pure white color, use the usual "White".  Soak the fibers in this case, you need for 6-8 hours or just at night. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Linen or wicker sisal - what is it?  To create applications using sheets of this fiber, also painted in various colors.  For the manufacture of sisal cloth, an oilcloth is taken, on which the material is laid out in a fantasy manner and coated with wallpaper glue on top.  The resulting preform is covered with another layer of film and pressed down with a flat board. </p><h2>  What to do with finished materials </h2><p>  After a day, the sisal cloth will be ready for further use, the time comes to make the first craft.  Applications from this fiber are considered very popular, as well as various topiary, baskets, decorative shoes and even bouquets.  For example, you can create a design notebook and decorate the cover with elements cut out of sisal canvas: birds, flowers or hearts.  Volumetric figures are created on the basis of simple wire frames, which can be purchased at a florist shop or made independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sisal balls" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336680.jpg?1392551572925" width="374"></div>

    <h2>  Material sisal: master class "Topiary" </h2><p>  To create a unique craft in the form of a tree, the needlewoman will need a small set of tools and materials, as well as two hours of free time.  What will be needed: </p><ol><li>  Sisal is a suitable color. </li><li>  Pot or jar to secure the structure. </li><li>  <span>Floristic wire,</span> glue gun. </li><li>  Gypsum from the nearest hardware store. </li><li>  Special plastic or foam ball.  It can be made independently from tightly packed paper wrapped in thread or cut from a floral sponge. </li><li>  Elements for decoration: sisal balls, beads, satin ribbons, finished flowers and berries. </li></ol><h2>  We are working on the ‚ÄúTopiary‚Äù project </h2><p>  If you plan to use sezal balls, but did not succeed in buying, you can twist them yourself.  The fiber is tough and holds its shape perfectly.  The size of these elements should not be more than berries, beads and flowers in the composition.  In the base ball, make a hole and insert a wire or an ordinary branch to create the trunk of the future tree.  Using a glue gun, we attach all the decorative details to the ‚Äúcrown‚Äù of the topiary.  First, lay out large elements, filling in the gaps with small beads and flowers.  The trunk is decorated with a satin ribbon, and the entire structure is installed in a pot and poured with divorced gypsum.  After the "soil" in the pot dries, the ugly top layer is covered with <span>crumpled paper</span> or sisal clippings, which will become a "lawn".  That's it, the topiary is ready - you can vary the colors and decor elements, which will always allow you to create new unique crafts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sisal master class" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336682.jpg?1392551616850" width="374"></div>

    <h2>  Other natural fiber products </h2><p>  Probably the best known use for this material would be a sisal washcloth.  Such a product has a natural wicker appearance, but it can also be made using a conventional hook.  Sisal washcloth is not suitable for everyday use, but it perfectly performs the role of a natural <span>body scrub.</span>  Of course, dyeing the fiber for such crafts should not be.  I also use washcloths from this material for a very effective anti-cellulite dry massage.  For knitting, you should choose a hook of at least 5th size.  Thin tools are not suitable, otherwise the work will take a very long time, it will be too dense and rough.  The smaller the distance between the loops, the worse such a washcloth will be washed.  To get maximum foam when bathing, it‚Äôs worth inserting a regular bath sponge inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from sisal" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336679.jpg?1392551640306" width="407"></div>

    <h2>  We knit a sisal washcloth </h2><p>  The easiest way to make such a craft is to create a long tubular web of natural agave fiber.  Asking the sisal in the store what it is, you don‚Äôt have to explain, you can just ask for a washcloth.  At the beginning of work, a ring is tied from air columns of a suitable size.  Usually gain about 40 loops.  Then they knit six to seven rows with standard single crochet columns.  This will allow the product to hold its shape in the future, and also hold the sponge inside if there is a desire to insert it.  The entire remaining length is knitted with elongated loops or columns with one or two double crochets, as you like.  Having knitted the entire length - about 30-40 cm, end with six rows of simple loops.  Additionally, you can make handles for washcloths or sew a sponge inside.  The finished product is washed before first use with ordinary soap and soaked for several minutes in boiling water, which will make it a little softer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sisal washcloth" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336683.jpg?1392551669538" width="373"></div>

    <h2>  Other types of sisal washcloths </h2><p>  A very pretty and useful craft from natural agave fiber will be an option for more experienced knitters.  A washcloth in the form of a ball or a coral sponge looks wonderful and fits perfectly in your hand.  Such a product can be used by children to wash their grimy legs and hands.  To create such a model, you need to dial 50-60 air loops.  Then they knit five rows with single crochet - you should not cut the thread.  Next, the resulting tape is sewn into a ring and pulled into a fantasy ball.  You can tie a washcloth in the form of a mitten to make it more convenient to use it for self-massage or in the form of mini-toys for children. </p><p>  So, we studied the sisal material, what it is and what can be made of it.  It remains to wish our readers creative success and unlimited inspiration in their work.  Do not forget to save on expensive floristic sets by self-manufacturing and dyeing sisal fibers in suitable colors.  And most importantly: before using products from this material, they should always be slightly soaked in soapy water or doused with boiling water. </p>
