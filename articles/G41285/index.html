  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fancy Earphones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Headphones are used by many of us.  Someone connects them to a computer, so as not to interfere with listening to music or watching videos.  For some, headphones become a wonderful way to enjoy your favorite audio recordings on the street, in public places, in training, in transport, and so on.  Agree, a person who turns on the music on the phone at full volume and listens to it, for example, in a cafe or at work, looks rather strange.  But a small device for listening to sound completely solves this problem.  In addition, with the help of headphones, we can conduct a telephone conversation and at the same time do other things, because our hands are completely free.  The advantages of this invention can be discussed for a very long time.  In this article, we will tell you why these gadgets have become so popular, and consider the latest innovations in the world of these devices, such as headphones with cat ears. </p><h2>  First earphones </h2><p>  A prototype device for individual listening to music appeared several centuries ago.  It was a stationary device for broadcasting church services and concerts.  For a fee, such a mechanism was installed in the house and contained 4 headphones, but if you pay extra, you could purchase additional "ears".  Microphones were installed in the places from where the broadcasts were conducted, and many employees of the company that provided the service worked at huge remotes and switched channels. </p><p>  The creator of the first headphones, Nathaniel Baldwin, assembled them in his kitchen.  Providing the Air Force with its development, the inventor first received a refusal to cooperate.  But soon the Air Force realized the importance of the device and provided Baldwin with a large order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already in the 1920s, the first portable device for listening to music appeared.  At that time, this was no longer something phenomenal, and each radio amateur considered it his duty to independently assemble such a device.  Already in the late 30s, a prototype of modern headphones such as D-48 was released. </p><p>  Of course, even in those days, headphones were not as popular as they are today.  They were mainly used for military affairs (submariners, radio operators, partisans) or professional sound recordings.  Today, we can observe such a gadget from almost any owner of a phone or player.  Before headphones with ears or similar ‚Äújokes‚Äù appeared, which we will tell you about below, these devices went a long way of modifications and modifications to appear before us in the form in which we can observe them now. </p><h2>  A variety of modern headphones </h2><p>  Today, on store shelves we can see a huge large number of different headphones.  Distinguish such devices for professional studio recording or user (consumer) option.  The latter are intended for use at home or simply for individual listening to music, which we talked about at the beginning of the article.  What modern developers do not come up with.  We can observe wireless <span>headphones, in-ear</span> (characterized by the presence of small rubber bands that are inserted into the ear), in-ear (the most common type), overhead or full-size.  Headphones with ears belong to the latter form - a new invention of Japanese developers.  Consider this product in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Headphones with cat ears </h2><p>  Not so long ago, a new development was introduced - headphones with funny ears on the rim.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a device came about thanks to the usual feline mammals.  The developers were so impressed with the popularity of kittens on the Internet that they decided to experiment with a similar design.  And as we see - they did it. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the designers drew inspiration from another inexhaustible source - anime cartoons.  In the Japanese culture of animation, there is such a thing as "some."  These are called humanoid creatures that have elements of a feline physique (ears, paws, tail, and so on).  To become like your favorite characters, thousands of anime fans around the world buy false ears, cat costumes, gloves with claws, etc. This was the impetus for creating such a model of headphones. </p>

    <h2>  Crowdfunding project </h2><p>  Designers are Wenqing Yan and Victoria Hu.  The creators had to work hard so that the product was not only beautiful in appearance, but also became high-quality and multifunctional.  In 2014, Axent Wear launched a huge fundraising company.  From the first days, crowdfunding project on Indiegogo promised to be extremely successful.  For the most part, Axent Wear relied on a young audience.  Modern youth cares not only about the useful properties and capabilities of gadgets, but also their appearance.  Thus, headphones with ears became the object of desire of many young people, and they were looking forward to their sale. </p>

    <h2>  Headphones with ears and their functionality </h2><p>  Cat Ear - this is the name of the model of this device.  <span>Cat ears</span> are not only an adornment of a device for listening to sound, but also perform an independent function.  They are equipped with speakers.  When you turn them on, the user can not only listen to their favorite tunes, but also demonstrate their musical taste to others. </p><p>  Axent Wear Cat Ear have LED backlight.  There are 4 different colors to choose from: blue, red, green and purple.  If desired, this function can be turned off and the ear-shaped headphones will not glow.  The developers presented an exclusive designer version of the gadget.  These are headphones with ears that glow in different colors.  Such a model is much more expensive. </p><p>  You can connect "ears" to almost all devices, such as smartphones, tablets, computers and players.  The connection is carried out wirelessly or using a standard 3.5 mm audio jack. </p>
