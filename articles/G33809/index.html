This is how a person works: in spite of all his shortcomings, he intuitively feels that he is in the first place in this world.  Representatives of a fine article understand this best of all.  Perhaps that is why in the ancient myths of beauty and harmony, the main role is played not by God, but by the goddess of love.  History shows that a man, despite his strength and abilities, clearly loses in this area.  Let's plunge a little into the world of these wonderful legends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The goddess of love" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/155385.jpg" width="368"></div>

    <p>  Greek goddess of love </p><p>  The name of Aphrodite has long been considered a symbol of beauty and charm.  If you believe the <span>ancient Greeks, the</span> goddess of love came out of the sea, or rather, from the sea foam, so it is also called "foam."  She patronized everyone who had this wonderful feeling in her heart, as well as composers and artists who composed their immortal works on the theme of love.  Aphrodite brought love and beauty to the world, but at the same time she never showed respect for marriage, therefore, the <span>Greek goddess of</span> love often clashed with Hero - the guardian of marital fidelity.  On Olympus, she had a husband - the god of blacksmithing and fire Hephaestus.  He was not too handsome, and therefore the frivolous Aphrodite at times cheated on him, as a result of which Harmony and Eros were born. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greek goddess of love" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/155343.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Egyptians worshiped the tender, sensual and passionate Hathor.  She was crazy about music and dancing, for this reason her symbol was the systra - an ancient musical instrument, somewhat reminiscent of a rattle.  The Egyptians even had a special amulet with his image, which they put on his neck to protect him from evil forces and to protect the goddess in heart affairs.  Hathor took care of young couples and did everything so that their married life was happy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egyptian goddess of love" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/155356.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <p>  The goddess of love among the ancient Slavs </p><p>  Our distant ancestors patronized marriage and hearth was Lada.  Everyone loved her, especially women.  The goddess of love enjoyed special honor among the newlyweds.  She was often brought flowers, honey, live birds and berries, and in the sacred groves of Lada, scarves, embroideries and rings were left on the trees.  Festivities were often held in her honor.  Lada was very attentive to the requests of people and for this she deserved another name - Shchedrynya.  In the old days, from January 6 to 19 (now Baptism is celebrated at that time), celebrations were held in her honor and she sang generous songs that praised peace, harmony and love for people.  Ice holes made their way into lakes and rivers, and they threw grain, pancakes and pies into them, and colored patches were laid out on ice for decoration.  In the paintings, Lada often took on the image of a beautiful young blond woman holding in her arms her son, the winged god Lel.  A temple in her honor could be found in almost every <span>ancient Russian city.</span>  This goddess of love had her own special sign - a circle with a triangle inscribed inside it, directed at an acute angle downward.  These figures were chosen for a reason and carry a secret meaning.  The circle is the universe, and the triangle is its center.  Thus, we see that the Slavs believed that love and harmony are at the core of everything.  It was believed that the stone of Lada is a cornelian, and therefore it was often included in various jewelry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient Slavic goddess" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/155400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Happiness in your home </p><p>  Each of the goddesses of love is charming in its own way.  If you believe in feng shui, place the image of one of them in the zone of helpers (the north-western sector of the house).  You ask, why not in the sector of love?  Yes, because there should be <span>paired objects</span> and a <span>lone symbol</span> here can cause the opposite effect.  But the zone of assistants is the most ideal place.  In the role of a symbol, you can use a figurine, embroidery, a picture, or simply its sign.  After that, you will notice the help of the goddess: the aura in the house will become better, and in life will become more mutual and shared love. </p>
