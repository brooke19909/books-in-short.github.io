These devices are popular all over the world.  Many owners of gadgets from this manufacturer note the high quality of products and the presence in them of the latest achievements from the world of the mobile industry.  Since almost everyone has an Internet in the age of high technology, it is not surprising that reviews of Huawei smartphones can be found on the website of any online store.  Let's try to consider the real reviews of the owners of the equipment of this brand and decide whether it is so good. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Huawei began with the production of modems and other means of communication.  In this field, she had no equal.  The manufacturer released its first smartphone on the Android platform in 2010.  It was the legendary Huawei U8230.  He gained particular popularity in Belarus, as the local operator Life gave it in installments with attractive conditions.  However, a lot of time has passed since then.  Huawei devices have evolved and become modern, universal devices. </p>

    <p>  Now the company is a notable player in the global mobile device market.  Huawei flagships are in demand all over the world.  The Chinese managed to combine in their devices performance, attractive appearance and high quality workmanship.  Huawei Smartphone reviews are proof of this claim.  Consider reviews of several of the most popular smartphone models from the Chinese holding. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Huawei Honor 5X </h2><p>  This device was created as a budget replacement for cheap analogues from Xiaomi and other companies.  It turned out to be inexpensive, attractive and productive.  It is not surprising that the Huawei 5X smartphone has the most positive reviews.  Many owners of this miracle note the highest build quality, which is rarely found in budget devices.  Also, users are impressed with the performance of the gadget.  According to the owners, this smartphone even pulls modern games without any problems.  Only heats up a little if you play for a long time.  Also, everyone praises the camera.  For the module that is installed in 5X, the quality of the photos is excellent. </p>

    <p>  But not without a fly in the ointment.  Some snobs categorically did not like the firmware with a proprietary interface.  It's not even the firmware itself, but a huge amount of pre-installed Chinese software.  You can neither delete nor turn it off.  Superuser rights are required.  However, not everyone knows the skills of rutting and flashing a smartphone on Android.  Negative reviews about Huawei 5X smartphones concern software only.  The hardware and build quality are fine with everyone.  And this is the most important thing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Huawei Honor 5C </h2><p>  This is like an improved copy of 5X.  The device was created specifically for those who want more for the same money.  This gadget even has an NFC chip.  Also slightly increased performance.  Smartphone Huawei 5C reviews are mostly positive.  However, there are complaints from users.  Many complain that the device is too slippery.  It is simply impossible to use it without a case.  Also, some are not satisfied with the small battery life.  But you need to pay for the performance gain somehow.  And the last complaint is the slow fingerprint scanner.  Dear, but you are not insolent?  This is a budget device!  Look for flaws in it - bad manners. </p>

    <p>  With positive qualities, everything is clear: as always, impeccable build quality, a bright and clear Full HD screen, and an amazing camera.  These are the main advantages described by the owners.  By the way, if in 5X there were complaints about the firmware, then this is not here.  Apparently, the company listened to the same constructive criticism.  By default, Android 6 is installed in the gadget, which is also considered by many to be a plus, since it consumes more battery power.  Smartphone <span>"Honor Honor" 5C, reviews</span> of which we just reviewed, it is worth acquiring.  There will be no disappointment. </p><h2>  Huawei Honor 6X </h2><p>  This device can be called the flagship of the Honor line.  It even has a dual camera, which is now so popular.  It is quite clear that its cost is very different from the price of the above models.  But no matter how expensive the Huawei Honor 6X smartphone is, there are still reviews about it.  And even here there were some negative ones.  Some particularly fastidious users even don‚Äôt like flagships.  There are especially many complaints about the insufficient quality of photographs when shooting at night.  Comrades, this is not a SLR!  Hang on a smart a good lens (there are such), a powerful flash - and you will be happy! </p>

    <p>  However, the camera is the only drawback of the device.  More adequate owners of the smartphone note its speed and decent battery life.  Especially pleased some of the pedometer built into the firmware of the device.  This toy is very interested in the people.  Yes, and the stability of the firmware itself, users noted separately, calling it the best of what Huawei has ever had.  Reviews of Huawei Honor 6X smartphones clearly show that the company has obtained a high-quality and modern product with an adequate price. </p><h2>  Huawei Honor 2 </h2><p>  This old man, of course, does not fit somewhat into the general concept, but he can still argue with many state employees from Samsung and other companies.  It has pretty good performance for its age and does a great job with games and applications.  Almost all the owners of this gadget sing odes to him and believe that this particular ‚ÄúHonor‚Äù is the legend with which the entire illustrious line began.  You can buy it now for a penny, but it will be relevant for a couple of years in the budget segment.  Reviews on the Huawei Honor 2 smartphones are not negative in color.  And this is an absolute record. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Chinese brand "Huawei" offers high-quality, productive and modern devices at reasonable prices.
