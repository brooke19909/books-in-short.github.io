From this article you will learn the principles of knitting. <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword=" ">  aran knitting needles </keyword>  , and also learn how to read patterns of complex patterns. </p><h2>  The history of the origin of the drawings </h2><p>  The mentioned patterns come from the Irish islands.  Local residents went to sea where they were engaged in fishing.  Women in anticipation of the return of men knitted warm sweaters for them, wanting to protect them from harsh working conditions.  Tied out ornate and symmetrical ornaments, needlewomen believed in their symbolism and decorated them with clothes in order to protect the sailor from the water element.  Such drawings had certain differences belonging to a separate family.  Related <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword=" ">  knitting aranu </keyword>  it was easy to find out which clan the fisherman belongs to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to knit arana with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2242128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2242128.jpg"></div><p>  Irish motifs gained worldwide fame at the beginning of the 20th century.  Craftswomen began to knit clothes not only for family members, but also for shops, for the purpose of sale.  Over time, the production of warm clothes decorated with Arana grew and in the early 40s was put on stream.  Patterns of ornaments began to be printed in magazines, and today they are very popular all over the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pattern Elements </h2><p>  As already mentioned, each ornament contains a symbolic meaning.  The outlines of the drawings are largely related to the marine theme.  Rhombuses formed by interweaving of braids symbolize a fishing net, while the braids themselves are fishing ropes.  A fine grid represents native fields, beckoning to return home.  The symbol of algae enriching the earth is executed in a small pattern.  Various zigzags and geometric lines contained in knitted <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword=" ">  knitting needles </keyword>  , are treated as water currents and paths winding along the cliffs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of the knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2242129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2242129.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of knitting ornaments </h2><p>  Considering a complex pattern, it is possible to distinguish many individual details that, when knitting, require special attention.  Use some tips to help you get started: </p><ul><li>  Before knitting <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#2" data-keyword="    ">  spokes of arana according to the schemes with the description </keyword>  , it is necessary to study the drawing in detail and determine the available elements. </li><li>  To knit braids and harnesses, use auxiliary knitting needles or special tools. </li><li>  In order not to get confused, separate the different elements of the ornament with delimiters or tags. </li><li>  Knit loosely and loosely - this will help to easily cross the loops. </li><li>  Keep in mind that Aranes tighten the canvas, so pick up a few spare loops around the edges of the product. </li><li>  In order to highlight the texture of the picture and give it volume, the aran is knitted on the wrong side of the face. </li><li>  Please note that when working <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#2" data-keyword="    ">  knitting needles </keyword>  demonstrate the front side of the ornament.  The back rows we also see from the face.  Therefore, in even rows, it is necessary to knit loops opposite to the pattern, so that the front pattern looks right and harmonious. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingkingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Schemes of braids and harnesses in Aran" class="if uuid-2242131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2242131.jpg"></div><h2>  What does arana knitting scheme look like </h2><p>  You can figure out a description of the knitting pattern by looking at it more closely.  The main part of such a pattern consists of braids and bundles of various widths.  On the weave patterns, they are indicated by the symbol "X", directed to the right or left side.  In addition, the upper segments of the icon can cover one or more segments.  Most made for knitting <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#4" data-keyword="      ">  knitting needles schemes Aran, with a description of braids and harnesses </keyword>  , the number of component parts of the symbol may be different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The sign, looking to the top to the right, indicates that the first selected loops need to be knit without putting them to work.  Then knit the number of links marked in the scheme with the front ones, as well as the missed loops, stretching them behind the canvas. </li><li>  The icon, deployed to the left, indicates that the first links must be removed and left before work.  Next, knit the following loops, in the amount indicated by the bottom lines, then repeat this step with the links removed. </li><li>  Empty cells, as well as weaves, are facial loops. </li><li>  Dashes - links knitted in the wrong way. </li><li>  In the schemes you can find a circle, in the place of which you need to create a crochet. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúT‚Äù symbol falling to the right means 2 loops knitted together, introducing the spoke into the links on the left side. </li><li>  If the "T" sign is directed in the opposite direction, then the first loop needs to be removed, the second knit in the facial way and stretch through the removed link. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingkingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2242132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2242132.jpg"></div><p>  Although the description is knitted <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword=" ">  knitting needles </keyword>  contains a small number of characters, the difficulty lies in the multiple movement of weaves throughout the ornament.  During operation, you must carefully monitor the progress of the scheme and take into account the tips given in this article. </p>
