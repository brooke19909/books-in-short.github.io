    <h2>  Defining history </h2><p>  A brief biography of Peter Krasnov can be expressed in a few words - the nobility, military prowess and courage, clearly the “white movement” and emigration, the Nazis mistaken assessment and death.  But between these bloody milestones of the 20th century, which carried human lives on different sides of the barricades, which redrawed entire states and peoples, each of their participants had a different life.  And throughout the entire twentieth century, life urgently required a person to make a choice.  Pyotr Nikolaevich Krasnov, having made this choice once, remained faithful to him until the end of his days. </p>

Having reached the fifth grade, he switched to military training in the Alexander Cadet Corps.  <span>He</span> completed the first stage of <span>military education</span> with the rank of vice non-commissioned officer, at the age of 19 he successfully completed the First Military Pavlovsk School.  The results he achieved were so brilliant that his name was written in gold letters on a marble plank. </p><p>  It is known that he also entered the Academy of the General Staff, but due to poor performance, he was expelled after a year of study.  And yet, at the age of 39, he graduated from the school of cavalry officers. </p><h2>  The beginning of a military career </h2><p>  Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov began his military service at the age of twenty with the rank of coroon, when he was seconded to the Ataman regiment of the heir to the Cesarevich.

    <h2>  World War I and Revolution </h2><p>  At the beginning of the war, he was sent as commander of a regiment in August 1914 to <span>East Prussia.</span>  And three months later he was promoted to major general and placed at the head of the First Brigade of the Don Cossack, then the Caucasian Indigenous Horse Division.  Then he was awarded the <span>St. George's Arms.</span>  In May 1915, he was awarded the Order of St. George of the fourth degree for a successful military operation in the Dniester River, when they managed to push the Austrians back across the river.  In 1916 he was seriously injured. </p><p>  Spending all the time until the first February revolution of 1917 on the fronts of the war, the Cossack commander, General Krasnov Pyotr Nikolaevich reacted to the first coup ambiguously and negatively assessed the actions of the Provisional Government.  He did not participate in politics.  However, he was one of the few who supported Alexander Kerensky after the Bolshevik coup.  Having fallen into the hands of the Bolsheviks, he fled to the Don, where he led the resistance of the Cossacks.  As the ataman of the Great Don Army, he entered into an alliance with the Emperor of Germany, William II.  However, the defeat of Germany forced him to abandon the idea of ​​the Don Caucus Union.  He agreed to go into full submission to Anton Denikin, joining his Volunteer Army.  In 1919, Denikin forced Krasnov to resign due to ideological and political differences. </p><p>  Realizing that he was already holding nothing in Russia, he left Russia and stayed in Estonia in the North-West Army of General Nikolai Yudenich.  He became the head of the army newspaper Prinevsky Krai.  Its editor was the famous Russian writer Alexander Kuprin. </p>
