For example, who is an <span>academician?</span>  <span>Is this a</span> title or position?  What needs to be done to be called an academician? </p><h2>  First academics </h2><p>  Our country is full of educational institutions called ‚Äúacademies‚Äù.  What are the names of those who study and teach there ‚Äî are they really academicians? </p><p>  Of course not.  The first students of the Academy were students of Plato.  They listened to their mentor in a sunny grove, where, according to legend, the Athenian hero Akadem was buried.  Therefore, they began to be called academics, and the school founded by Plato was called the academy. </p>

    <p>  In pre-revolutionary Russia, all academy students were also called academics.  But then the situation changed.  The creation of a ranking table made it possible to distinguish academicians in a special caste of scientists.  And modern students of academies have nothing to do with academicians of the past and present.  As elsewhere, such young people are called students, whom lecturers at the academy give lectures.  And who is the real academician? </p><h2>  Bologna and domestic ranking system </h2><p>  Before delving into the academic jungle, let's look for a definition of what an academic title is.  This is the name of a qualification scientific scale that allows scientists to be ranked according to the degree of their merits and scientific achievements.  In world science, the British system of differences is used, in which uniform requirements are established.  It is also called Bologna, and each country that has joined the <span>Bologna process</span> must streamline its academic ranks and bring them into line with accepted standards.  Within the British system, there are three degrees for each branch of knowledge.  It: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  bachelor (licensee); </li><li>  master; </li><li>  Ph.D. </li></ul><p>  Bachelors study at universities for four years, masters - six years.  To obtain a Ph.D., you must prepare and defend a scientific work. </p>

    <p>  Philosophy here does not mean discipline of the same name, but becomes a synonym for science "in general."  At the same time, there are doctors of medicine, law, theology and more.  The domestic system of qualification originates in the scientific systems of the German model.  In our country, academic degrees are usually distributed as follows: </p><ul><li>  certified specialist; </li><li>  PhD; </li><li>  Ph.D. </li></ul><p>  The degree of <span>candidate of sciences is</span> awarded based on the decision of the dissertation council.  A doctorate can be obtained by applying for the same advice.  Such a decision is made only by the <span>Higher Attestation Commission.</span>  At the moment, a mixed system is operating in our country: a new qualification system is being partially introduced, and in some places the old one is being applied.  It is by studying the domestic qualification system that one can answer the question of who the academician is. </p>

    <h2>  Where are academics - not academics? </h2><p>  In other countries, this title is given for completely different reasons.  For example, the British Academy of Sciences was established in 1901.  Its members are about 800 scientists born within the British Commonwealth.  All of them have the right to be called academicians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the London Royal Society has an invariably greater influence on the development of science in this country.  It sets the tone for all the most famous scientific research.  Scientists who join this organization receive the title of member of the royal society.  And although they are not called academics, they enjoy the highest respect among all the world's scientific schools. </p><h2>  Academy of Sciences </h2><p>  In order to consolidate scientific developments and discoveries, in many countries there are Academies of Sciences.  The main goal of its members is to enrich domestic and world science with new discoveries and inventions.  The <span>Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS)</span> operates in our country <span>.</span>  An active member of the Academy is a citizen of the Russian Federation with scientific achievements in any of the areas of modern science. </p><h2>  Other countries - other academics </h2><p>  <span>Academies of sciences</span> are also available in other countries of the former Soviet Union.  There is the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Kazakhstan and many others.  The academician of the National Academy of Sciences has the same rights and privileges in his country as the academician in the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Scientists from other countries can also take part in the work of the RAS.  Then they are given a special status - foreign correspondent members. </p>

    <h2>  Who can become an academician? </h2><p>  The Academy of Sciences may be attended by its full members and corresponding members.  The difference between the two is as follows: </p><ul><li>  the academic title ‚ÄúCorresponding Member‚Äù goes to scientists who can take part in the work of the Academy of Sciences without using the privileges of full members; </li><li>  members of the highest level, whose work had a decisive influence on the development of science in the country, can receive the title of full member of the Academy of Sciences.  It is assigned by the current members of the academy, with an advantage of 2/3 of the votes. </li></ul><p>  The existing ranking table allows us to determine that the answer to the question of who the academician is can only concern full members of the Academy of Sciences.  Other scientists are forced to be content with those titles that are proportional to their merits in the country's science. </p><p>  Thus, only those who have made a significant contribution to the development and receive scientific title can be called academicians.  The title of academician is given for life, and even after the retirement of the venerable scientist, they will still be called the "academician." </p>

    <h2>  The current composition of the RAS </h2><p>  Each of us who wants to answer the question - who is an academician, immediately imagines a wise husband of advanced years.  The number of academics of this age was steadily increasing, and at the end of 2016 it was decided to limit the age limit for all applicants for the academic mantle.  So, candidates for correspondent members should not be older than 51 years, and for academicians the age limit was limited to 61 years. </p><p>  At present, 522 academicians are registered with the RAS.  All of them are the founders of their own scientific schools, many of the academicians are still engaged in teaching and research activities. </p>
