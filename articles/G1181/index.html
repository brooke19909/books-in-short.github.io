Such a question is asked by beginner needlewomen.  Indeed, in this area there are many different options for clothing design.  Each in its own way is interesting and performs a certain function.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine in more detail where the drawstring is used. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  The drawstring in clothes is used for uniform assembly of fabric.  More precisely, this is a strip of fabric, which is sewn onto the product from the inside or outside, stretch the tie into it.  Thus, you can easily assemble a dress at the waist, make pants with an elastic band or a skirt.  It looks beautiful and practical.  This helps to adjust the size of the clothes. </p><p>  It is necessary to cut the drawstring obliquely and correctly calculate the length.  If it is on the wrong side, it can consist of several parts, in case of location from the front part, the calculations should be made more carefully.  The length should be across the width of the product, when this option is not possible, it is worth making a neat seam, you can issue it with lines on both sides on the front side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oodji.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawstring - belt on trousers" class="if uuid-3104838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3104838.jpg"></div><h2>  Types and sewing </h2><p>  What is a drawstring now it has become clear, but it can be of several types: </p><ul><li>  Scribbled - for making a drawstring of this kind, it is necessary to cut a strip from the lining or braid, then bend the edges.  Clearly mark the place of sewing, pin with pins and make stitches for accuracy.  The width can be different, it all depends on your preference.  For a stitched look, it is better to choose a non-woven material. </li><li>  In seam allowances or bending of the free edge - this implies bending the free edge of the fabric to the desired width with an <span>allowance for the seam.</span>  It can be made on the bottom or top of the product - on the sleeve, it can play the role of a drawstring belt on a skirt, trousers, curtains.  This option has been widely used. </li></ul><p>  The drawstring hole should be designed beautifully so that the material does not begin to climb in different directions.  It could be: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Metal frame or block - you can install it yourself or contact the atelier for help.  Such items can be purchased at any sewing store in your city, they have a different shape and color, the assortment is quite large.  Most often, under these frames, a durable non-woven material is substituted so that they hold more firmly, they do this on both sides. </li><li>  Loop - you can make it on a sewing machine, if there is such a function.  It is quite easy, the main thing is to choose the right size.  So that in the process of wearing nothing happened to her in the place of the future loop, it is better to glue the non-woven fabric or substitute a small piece of fabric. </li><li>  Groove hole - bend the edges to the wrong side and make a beautiful line. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing complicated in the design of the drawstring hole, the main thing is to do it carefully.  As ties, you can use elastic, shoelaces, ribbons, knuckles or braid. </p><h2>  Application in women's and men's clothing </h2><p>  In women's clothing, the drawstring gained great popularity, because there are many options for its location.  This may be the assembly of a dress or tunic at the waist to emphasize the peculiarity of the figure.  It can be located higher, under the chest.  This option is used for pregnant women.  Pants and skirts are no exception, instead of a belt it is practical and beautiful.  On outerwear, you can also see this option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.shopbop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawstring on a woman's dress" class="if uuid-3104869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3104869.jpg"></div><p>  In men's clothing, a drawstring can be found in tracksuits - elasticated trousers and a windbreaker, which can be easily assembled on the bottom.  Also, in uniform, it found its application - it helps to expand the size range, since the composition of all people is different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.iceberg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawstring in men's clothing" class="if uuid-3104849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3104849.jpg"></div><h2>  Drawstring skirt </h2><p>  The easiest option is a half-sun skirt with an elastic band.  If you ask why, the answer is very simple - for its sewing you do not need to have special skills in sewing.  The cut is quite simple, the main thing is to correctly calculate the <span>fabric consumption</span> and size, and to sew you need to make a maximum of two straight lines.  Any beginner can handle this, but the result will exceed all expectations.  Beautiful and practical - uniform assembly on the skirt will delight you with your look.  To sew such a skirt, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  the cloth; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  chalk or soap; </li><li>  centimeter; </li><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  gum. </li></ul><p>  You need to start with a pattern or you can do without it - draw immediately on the fabric, it will be faster.  To do this, measure the waist, add 15 cm to it. So the folds will be more beautiful, set the desired length of the product.  Fold the fabric in half and start drawing from the corner - set aside half the size of the waist with an allowance and draw a line. </p><p>  Then measure the length of the skirt down and draw a second line.  After that, we cut out our skirt and it is almost ready, it remains only to sew.  It remains for us to make a hem of the bottom and drawstring as a belt.  During the cut, it is important to correctly calculate the length of the skirt so that the width of the belt is the right height.  Usually they make it, they make it across the width of the elastic band and add a couple of millimeters to make it easier to insert it into the belt.  You need to leave a hole in order to insert the gum, you can simply leave a small area without a seam, and then carefully sew it up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shwinandshwin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skirt sun on the drawstring" class="if uuid-3104829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3104829.jpg"></div><h2>  Outerwear </h2><p>  What is a drawstring in outerwear?  This is a beautiful decor element that is functional in nature, as noted above.  It looks beautiful on a fur coat - it turns out magnificent and graceful, there are two options for tailoring: </p><ol><li>  One-piece - at the location of the drawstring, you need to add the height of the elastic and allowances for the seam. </li><li>  Unfinished - this method can be used if the fur coat is of dense material, it is quite difficult to bend it.  You can sew both from the inside and from the front, depending on what result you want to get.  If the wrong side, then it is better to choose a lining, and the top fabric on the front fabric. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.fashionfurcoat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fur Coat" class="if uuid-3104821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3104821.jpg"></div><p>  All seams must be done carefully and it is important not to forget to leave holes for the elastic or lace, in which case the drawstring on the fur coat will look beautiful and interesting.  By the way, it can be used not only when sewing a new fur coat, but also to renew the old one - to give a second life to things that have long been in your closet. </p><h2>  Use in interior decoration </h2><p>  When considering the topic of what a drawstring is, it should be noted that this element can also be used in the interior.  And the first thing that comes to mind is the design of curtains and curtains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.queinnovations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curtains on the curtain" class="if uuid-3104824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3104824.jpg"></div><p>  Everything is quite simple here - for this you do not need to buy any additional tapes or contact the studio for help.  It can easily be done independently without any skills.  To make curtains on the curtain, you need to bend the free edge and lay a line along the edge.
