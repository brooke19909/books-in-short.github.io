    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  A fairly popular hotel is Canareef Resort (Maldives).  The description and photos of this complex inspire many people to visit it.  To finally make sure that the hotel is really worthy of attention, you should turn to the reviews left by tourists. </p><p>  The only minus that they note is that it is far to get there.  But it's worth it.  Indeed, upon arrival awaits white sand, tropical vegetation and numerous palm trees. </p><p>  Guests are advised to go swimming on the beach from the ocean, rather than the lagoon.  There is a good, sandy bottom without vegetation.  But there are corals of amazing beauty.  And a huge number of bright tropical fish that can be seen even from the shore.  And if you wear a mask, you can get an unforgettable experience. </p><p>  If you pay attention to the reviews left about the Canareef Resort Maldives 4 * hotel, you will notice that many are advised to check into the villa from the ocean.  It is not only close to a good beach.  It is also very quiet there - privacy is guaranteed.  By the way, the villas have unusual bathrooms.  Outside, they do not close, they are partially under the roof.  But from prying eyes, the bathrooms are tightly enclosed by a wall.  Many guests are curious to take a shower while admiring the palm trees, the sun and the blue sky. </p><p>  More people pay attention to the staff.  The hotel has great workers.  Everyone is smiling, trying to help than they can.  For the convenience of guests, even electric cars go around the hotel, which take them anywhere.  The maids are cleaned twice a day, and each time they bring purified water to the room.  Cosmetics are also regularly replenished.  And this is a shower gel, shampoos and hair balms, body lotions, dental, sewing and shaving kits, a shower cap, etc. </p><p>  Summarizing, we can say with confidence: this is an ideal hotel complex for those people who dream of a secluded vacation in a quiet, unsafe place.  Many tourists who have been here confirm this.  If you want to make sure, you should go here on vacation.  Surely you will not have to feel sorry. </p>
