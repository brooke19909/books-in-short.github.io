People suffered oppression, deprivation and humiliation.  When the patience of the common people was overflowing, a war, a revolution, protests against the arbitrariness of bosses, leaders and the entire government began. </p><p>  There have been many such revolts in the history of Russia.  One of them is Antonovism in the Tambov region.  Consider the previous events.  Let's talk about the man, thanks to whom Antonovism appeared.  It was a truly terrible time - in the battle for justice, equality and freedom, they fought to the death. </p><h2>  A little background </h2><p>  In 1917, after the decree "On Land" was adopted, the Russian peasantry had the illusive hope of a better life.  He was given land, liquidated landlord oppression and agriculture, promised freedom. </p><p>  But hopes were deceived.  One misfortune was replaced by others.  The Bolsheviks introduced the surplus.  Now everything that the peasants sowed and gathered from their lands was subject to strict accounting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antonovschina briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201692.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The norms of personal consumption of products were legislatively established.  Nothing could be left to themselves beyond these norms.

There was a thunder of peasant indignation and indignation.  In many cities, and even entire regions and provinces, rebellions broke out.  Peasants went to rallies, staged riots. </p><p>  In response, the Soviet authorities established harsh punitive measures for those who disagree.  Food detachments were also organized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peasant war" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201691.jpg"></div>

Physical force was used against ‚Äúnegligent‚Äù peasants, food and bread were taken without paying a fixed price, they were shot on the spot for armed resistance. </p><p>  They also punished those who covered dissenting peasants and their families, including children.

    <p>  At this time, the discontent of the peasants reached its peak.  Decisive resistance began.  That is how Antonovism arose in Tambov. </p><h2>  Who was the peasant leader </h2><p>  Soviet propaganda made Alexander Antonov an inveterate bandit, killer and sadist.  And this is not surprising.  The winners write the story.  We find out who the man really was, thanks to which the concept of "Antonovism" appeared.  Briefly consider some facts from his biography. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>Alexander Stepanovich Antonov</span> was born on July 30, 1889 in Moscow.  His father was from Tambov.  Mother is a native Muscovite.  After some time, the family leaves the capital and moves to Tambov.  And from there - to Kirsanov.  Antonov‚Äôs childhood passed in this city. </p><p>  At about 13 years old, Alexander Stepanovich entered the school.  According to historians, it was here that Antonov absorbed the Socialist Revolutionary ideas.  After graduation, he joined the Tambov Independent Social Revolutionary Society. </p><p>  Antonov worked in this organization for several years.  Carried out tasks and instructions of the management.  He was distinguished by humanism, on his account there was not a single murder or robbery.  After some time, according to fabricated data, he was arrested and convicted.  Got into hard labor.  In 1917 he was released under an amnesty. </p><p>  Under the new government, Antonov had the opportunity to somehow change his life, start a career.  And he got into the police.  At first he was just an assistant to the boss.  He was noted by management as a brave and initiative worker.  Soon he was promoted - Alexander Stepanovich became the head of the Kirsanov police. </p><p>  It took Antonov about six months to restore order on his territory.  He made thoughtful and effective decisions; he did his job well.  During his service in the police, he tracked down and arrested the most respected robbers of the county.  He foiled a coup attempt during one of the anti-Bolshevik uprisings. </p><p>  Perhaps he would have worked for the Soviet regime, if not for a number of circumstances.  When Antonov went on vacation, several documents were fabricated against him.  The Chekists did it.  They really did not like the young, ambitious and reckless policeman. </p><p>  At the same time, several people were arrested by the police.  Antonov found out about this and decided to not return to the authorities.  He went to the Volga region, thought there to start a new life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rebellion revolt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201689.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But by the will of fate, he soon returned to Tambov province.  Arriving, he learned that the Bolsheviks accused him of reprisals against the Communists.  Of course, he was innocent.  Antonov was shocked.  He did not expect such betrayal from the people who honestly worked for so long. </p><p>  With several of his supporters, Antonov began work against the Bolsheviks.  The most presumptuous, those who robbed and exceeded their authority, he mercilessly destroyed. </p><p>  Along with this, he did not give up hope again to go over to the side of the Soviet government.  He was ready to serve if he were accepted.  Antonov wrote letters to the authorities several times.  But the Bolsheviks called him a bandit and did not want to have any business with him.  In the end, he was sentenced to death.  The paths of Antonov and the Bolsheviks diverged forever. </p><p>  He began to work seriously against them.  With his, so far few, supporters, Antonov administered justice.  Soon the people began to associate his name with justice, courage and anti-communist sentiments.  And gradually it became a household word. </p><h2>  Antonovschina.  Peasant uprising </h2><p>  Food surplus gained momentum.  The population was starving.  Entire families died, children swelled from hunger.  More and more people opposed the Bolshevik regime. </p><p>  Approaching the topic of the article, it is worth saying: Antonovism is, in fact, the anti-Bolshevik protest of Alexander Stepanovich.  Speaking against infringement of rights, oppression and humiliation.  Supporters of this regime became more and more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antonovism revolt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201694.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In 1920, the government imposed such an extra-surplus rate on the Tambov province that, after its full implementation, the peasant population should have run out of bread.  This threatened a new wave of hunger and death.  Food detachments began to use torture, bullying, rape.  They burned houses.  In a word, they did everything to fulfill the plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antonovschina briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201711.jpg"></div>

    <p>  People could not stand it anymore.  The peasants put up resolute resistance, as a result of which one food detachment was disarmed.  Then they defeated the second, who came to the rescue of the first.  Thus began the Tambov uprising.  Antonovschina was warmly supported by the local population. </p><p>  Local Social Revolutionaries led these spontaneous protests.  The number of those to whom Antonovism was close in spirit was growing rapidly.  The Civil War, which was only gaining momentum, was declared on August 21, 1920.  Antonovism ‚Äî this seemed to be the only solution for peasants tired of oppression.  They had nothing to lose. </p><h2>  How Antonov was involved in the uprising </h2><p>  We figured out how Antonovism appeared.  It happened spontaneously.  Now let's see how Antonov became involved in the uprising. </p><p>  For lack of weapons and certain knowledge, the peasants sent Antonov with a courier for help.  He arrives on August 24, 1920.  A large meeting is being held.  Peasants are asked to lead the uprising.  And Antonov agrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antonovism revolt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201693.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A week later, the entire Tambov region was infected with anti-Bolshevik sentiments.  The Communists were all kicked out.  Someone was shot. </p><p>  Antonov brilliantly led the resistance.  Without any special weapons, his fighters still managed to win big victories.  Antonov‚Äôs army already consisted of several tens of thousands of peasants.  And every day recruits came.  Soon, the Soviet government became seriously worried. </p><p>  Methods were developed to combat Antonov squads.  Poisonous gases were released into the forests where the resistance fighters hid.  Settled ambushes.  They ruthlessly dealt not only with the Antonovites, but also with their families. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antonovism is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/2201717.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Not as fast as planned, but the Antonovites are getting smaller.  Their morale began to decline.  Open resistance entered a conspiratorial phase.  Antonov himself went underground.  The Bolsheviks were able to eliminate it only in 1922. </p><p>  This last fight was not easy.  Antonov, as a reckless and brave man, held the defense to the last.  Despite the wound in the arm, head and chin, he held steady.  He was killed with his brother. </p><h2>  Results of Antonovschina </h2><p>  Resistance was broken.  But management understood that this was not the end.  And if we continue the program on the surplus appraisal further, the collapse of the Soviet regime will come.  Therefore, the surplus was canceled. </p><p>  As Lenin later said: "Peasant uprisings are worse than Denikin, Wrangel and Kolchak combined." </p>
