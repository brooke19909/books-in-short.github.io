It is located in the southeast of the peninsula, not far from Feodosia.  The complex was built not so long ago (in 2015), but has already taken a leading position among the best institutions in Crimea. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Lexx is one of the best Crimean hotels.  The complex is located in a wonderful place and is surrounded by two unique natural areas: the Kara-Dag nature reserve and Quiet Bay.  The hotel, due to its architecture, harmoniously blends with local landscapes.  Koktebel, in fact, is a unique place, which has no analogues in the whole world.  The city is located at the intersection of the steppe, mountain and sea climate, which makes the air of this region healing. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  It should be noted that <span>the Lexx Hotel (Koktebel),</span> whose location is unique in terms of natural areas, also has a convenient location relative to the transport interchange.  Koktebel is located just twenty kilometers from Feodosia and one hundred and fifteen kilometers from Simferopol.  The hotel organizes transfers for its guests.  Experienced drivers who are well aware of the difficult Crimean tracks will meet tourists at the station or at the airport and quickly deliver to the place of rest. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Lexx (hotel, <span>Koktebel, Crimea) is</span> ready to offer its guests one hundred and twenty spacious rooms.  During the construction and decoration of the hotel, they tried as much as possible to use the best natural materials.  Each number is executed in the same style.  A characteristic feature for assigning a certain category to apartments is their location (cottage or main building), total area, number of rooms and, of course, the view from the windows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lexx hotel koktebel crimea" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1424325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the one-room rooms are designed so that they can easily be transformed into two-room ones.  This effect is achieved due to the presence of double doors in the apartments, which are installed according to the rules of the international system for designing individual rooms (doors have a strong sound insulation). </p><p>  The rooms have the following equipment: terraces or balconies with high-quality summer furniture, refrigerator, air conditioning, bathroom and shower, slippers, bathrobes, mini-perfumes, safe, hairdryer, telephone, opaque curtains, orthopedic mattresses, beach towels, extra bed. </p><p>  The price includes: meals at a certain rate, the use of towels <span>for the beach, sun loungers,</span> three swimming pools, parking, children's animation, luggage storage, wake-up service, wireless Internet. </p><p>  Lexx (hotel, Koktebel, Crimea) can offer guests rooms of the following categories: </p><ol><li>  <em>Deluxe with a balcony is</em> designed for two people and has one extra bed.  This category of rooms has one room.  The apartments are located on the 1-3 floors of the main building.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is 22 square meters.  An extra bed is a comfortable chair bed. </li><li>  <em>Deluxe with a terrace in the cottage</em> - a more prestigious room, designed for two vacationers.  Such apartments are located on the first and second floors of separate buildings.  All rooms have a large private terrace.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments is from 25 to 27 square meters. </li><li>  <em>Luxury cottages with terraces.</em>  Two-room rooms are designed for two people, but it is possible to place two more people in extra beds.  These apartments are located on the ground floors of cottages.  Each room has its own terrace (there is summer furniture).  The advantage of such apartments is that when you leave them, you immediately find yourself on a green alley near the pool and next to the entire hotel infrastructure.  All rooms are decorated in the same style.  Each area is 45 square meters.  If vacationers wish, another person can be accommodated in an additional place. </li></ol><h2>  Hotel Lexx (Koktebel): prices </h2><p>  Hotel prices depend on the category of apartments and season.  So, for example, deluxe with a balcony in the autumn will cost 6320 rubles per day, and a cottage with a terrace (one-room) - 7500 rubles, a two-room cottage - from 10 000 rubles.  The room rates shown by us include three meals a day on an all-inclusive basis.  You can only purchase breakfast if you wish.  For the placement of vacationers on extra beds, you need to pay extra. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Placement of children </h2><p>  I would like to note that children under five years old have a rest in <strong> </strong>  Lexx (hotel, Koktebel, Crimea) is completely free if the main places are paid in full.

Hotel animators can, at your request, help organize a children's birthday.  The team has a lot of scenarios based on the most beloved and best fairy tales.  In addition, children will enjoy classes in the creative workshop, which hosts a variety of classes in drawing and modeling. </p><h2>  Lexx Hotel: Beach </h2><p>  The hotel complex is located near the coastline.  It is quiet and calm, there are never many people.  The coast is covered with small pebbles, and at the very entrance to the water begins white fine sand.  The sandy seabed is very convenient for children and adults. </p><p>  The beach is a municipal property, and therefore open to all comers.  The coastal area near the hotel is completely not equipped, but a little further there is a beautiful shadow zone.  All additional services on the beach (umbrellas, deck chairs) are paid.  The shore in this place is spacious and wide, and around it opens a wonderful view of the Kara-Dag protected area.  The main advantage of the coast of Feodosia is the clean sea </p><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  Hotel Lexx is the owner of its own spa, which can offer its guests a wide range of treatments.  Qualified staff develops individual programs tailored to the needs of the body and face.  Using the express methods, the center‚Äôs specialists will help to correct figure flaws. </p><p>  For spa treatments use cosmetics made in France and Italy.

Reviews of tourists who visited this beautiful place confirm its high level and exceptionalness. </p><p>  Hotel guests note the hospitality of the staff, which is very attentive to the wishes of the guests.  As for the rooms, they are all very functional and made in the same style.  Daily cleaning quality.  The apartments are equipped with new furniture, creating an atmosphere of coziness and comfort. </p><p>  The hotel area is very small, but it is very clean and well maintained.  Of particular interest to tourists is the large pool, which is the center of the cultural life of the entire complex.  There are a lot of people here day and night, pleasant music sounds, unobtrusive staff delivers cocktails and ice cream. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have its own beach, but this is not so critical.  There are no crowds on the shore, so you can safely sit.  The sandy bottom sea is an ideal place to relax with children. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel during the day animators work, including adults, offering various entertainments.  The most active tourists can take their advice and try out extreme sea adventures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spa hotel lexx" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1424344.jpg" width="600"></div>
