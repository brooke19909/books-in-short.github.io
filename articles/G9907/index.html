The first references were found in the recordings of the Portuguese chess player Damiano, which were made in the 16th century.  After Damiano, the debut developed in the XVI-XVII centuries by such chess players as Rui Lopez, Alessandro Salvio, Philippe Stamma. </p><h2>  Debut development in the last 150 years </h2><p>  In the nineteenth century, it was used in the match of Labourdonn and McDonnell in 1834 and in the match of Steinitz and Zuckertort in 1872.  In this match, the first world chess champion demonstrated an acceptable black game in this opening.  Subsequently, the adopted queen's gambit was enriched with the ideas of Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, Tigran Petrosyan and other prominent chess players. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="adopted queen's gambit for white" class="if uuid-3164779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/137107/3164779.jpg"></div><h2>  Debut Ideas </h2><p>  In the queen's gambit adopted for white, they strive to create a reliable pawn center, simultaneously developing pieces and methodically strengthening the position.  At the end of the development of the figures, the opponents will put pressure on each other's center.  White will prepare for the advancement of the e-pawn, and then his colleagues from the vertical f, and Black will counterattack along the line c and, possibly, along the line d.  At the beginning of the game, both sides draw the pieces, looking at point c4. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The base variant of the adopted queen's gambit </h2><p>  After the opponent takes the pawn on c4, White takes the knight to c3, thereby preparing a comfortable exit for the pawn on e4.  Black is responsible for the development of his steed from the kingside.  He exits, occupying point f6.  On the fourth move, White has two sequels that the computer considers acceptable today. </p><p>  Mathematically, they are much better than other maneuvers in this position.  This is the knockout on f3 and the advancement of the pawn on e3.  But still the second of the given moves will be better.  Black, in turn, also moves the e-pawn one square forward and occupies the e6-square with it, preparing the way for the dark-squared bishop and castling for the king.  On the fifth move, White takes away the enemy infantryman as an officer, and Black immediately undermines the enemy center with the c5-pawn, offering the exchange of queens. </p><p>  After White develops the last piece of the kingside on f3, and his opponent advances the pawn on a6, thereby taking control b5.  On the seventh move, White carries out a4 to prevent Black from driving the officer by moving his infantryman to b5, and Black leads his second horse to c6.  The further course of the game of the adopted queen's gambit involves a struggle for the center with mutual chances to seize the initiative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="adopted queen's gambit for black" class="if uuid-3164774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/137107/3164774.jpg"></div><h2>  Trap E3 </h2><p>  This continuation of the adopted queen's gambit is also called the old version.  On the third move, White plays e3.  If Black tries to keep the pawn he won last move, he risks losing the game in the next four moves.  After moving the pawn to b5, White immediately tries to undermine the opponent‚Äôs pawn redoubt by moving his infantryman to A4.  It is unprofitable for Black to exchange this pawn at A4, because White‚Äôs rook will gain freedom.  A whole vertical will open for her. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, they strengthen the pawn on b5 by their counterpart c and place it on c6.  The next action is to exchange pawns on b5.  For black this will be a decisive mistake.  After this, on the sixth move, the white queen goes to f3, attacking the enemy‚Äôs rook at a pace, and it turns out that Black can no longer save all the pieces in his camp.  To protect the rook, Black comes to sacrifice one of the easy pieces. </p><p>  You have to either give the bishop to step b7, after removing the knight on e7, or give the knight to b6, after removing the bishop on e7.  In both of these variants, on the seventh move, the queen defends her own rook.  Subsequently, the realization of a material advantage by White will not be difficult for a chess player who will make easy and reliable moves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="chess adopted queen gambit" class="if uuid-3164781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/137107/3164781.jpg"></div><h2>  Fast e4 system </h2><p>  After taking the pawn on c4, White immediately moves his own to e4, taking center on the third move and simultaneously opening the way for his white-billed bishop to take the pawn on c4.  At first glance, this seems like the best continuation, but this move has a weakness.  The next move Black immediately undermines the center by e5, temporarily sacrificing another pawn.  If White agrees, then Black immediately exchanges queens, leaving the White King left without castling.  After this, on the fifth move, the knight is deduced on c6, attacking the pawn on e5. </p><p>  White can try to defend the e5-pawn by taking the knight to f3, or take its counterpart to c4.  The computer evaluates this position in favor of Black with an advantage of 0.4 pawns.  This is a lot for the sixth move.  It is safe to say that White unsuccessfully left the opening because he did not succeed in development, and still remained without castling. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are no queens left on the board, which are the first danger in the absence of castling, White's position can easily be called depressing.  Black does not have any problems.  They also have a weak c4-pawn, which needs protection, but there is one in the White camp, so this nuance can be omitted.  They can easily develop, castle the king and continue the party.  They have fewer problems that need to be solved than the opponent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="chess debut" class="if uuid-3170093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/137107/3170093.jpg"></div><p>  The queen's gambit adopted for Black <strong>is</strong> a reliable debut that was used by famous eminent chess players, even in important matches.  It allows you to get a strong position for dozens of moves. </p>
