  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forebrain functions: fun and understandable</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The forebrain</span> makes us a personality, both intellectually and emotionally.  It is very complicated.  The <span>functions of the human brain are</span> diverse, but the main difference between humans is the uniquely developed forebrain, and therefore most of the higher functions that distinguish humans from animals are performed by this particular department.  The author of this article had the opportunity to read the most interesting and up-to-date literature on this subject, so you can read about the functions of the brain departments related to intelligence. </p><p>  The newest function of the forebrain is <strong>planning and communication</strong> .  This component of intelligence allows us to choose strategies that will be beneficial in the long term in the process of communication.  The front lobes of the cerebral cortex are doing this.  This department is responsible for the ability to reflect, recall the past and critically evaluate one‚Äôs activities, think through possible scenarios of events and solve the good old Hamlet question, whether we should act or not.  Our organization depends on the degree of maturity of this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain.  So the functions of the forebrain are not such an abstract knowledge from life.  Although, of course, you should not blame only your biological characteristics for sloppiness.  This feature can be developed. </p><p>  All students and schoolchildren have no doubt in the importance of such a function of the forebrain as <strong>memory</strong> .  This is also a function of the cerebral cortex.  Why do not we remember what happened to us before two years?  Because the zone of the cortex, which is responsible for conscious recollection, was still immature.  Recent studies allow us to conclude that the storage of information is in those areas where the impulse came from the sensory organs, so different types of memory are associated with different areas in the brain.  However, satiety and fatigue are characteristic of all zones, therefore it is critically important for a good memory to sleep enough (at least 7 hours), because it is in a dream that the brain transfers data from temporary resources to permanent ones.  Therefore, when preparing for exams, it is good to break your day into two parts in the afternoon sleep. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Emotions are</strong> closely related to <strong>memory</strong> , which is used by the best teachers and leaders.  They present the material so vividly that students or workers have a strong emotional mark in their minds, and a person does not even have to make an effort to remember.  Emotions are not only associated with our performance, but also with immunity.  In people who constantly experience negative emotions, the number of cells that fight the development of pathogens that penetrate into us is reduced.  Negative emotions also increase cortisol, which destroys the brain.  Therefore, you need to try to deceive the areas in the brain that are responsible for emotions.  How to do it?  Make facial muscles relax, then make yourself smile artificially.  You will immediately feel how the mood is changing.  This function of the forebrain is not given enough importance in our rational world, but suppressed emotions very cruelly avenge a person‚Äôs disease.  Different parts <span>of the</span> human <span>brain</span> are responsible for emotions; not only the forebrain, but also the cerebellum, works. </p><p>  The function of <strong>speech is</strong> critical for a person to feel good in society.  Scientists, in addition, noticed that a person who constantly shows speech activity is less likely to get <span>Alzheimer's disease.</span>  So talk, read to yourself, write - and you will be healthy for a very long time.  At least three zones in the brain are responsible for speech: part of the frontal gyrus, posterior part of the auditory cortex of the brain and an islet of Rayle hidden in the depths. </p><p>  <strong>Mathematical abilities are</strong> very important for us in everyday life, even if girls allow themselves to make mistakes from time to time, attributing everything to the ‚Äúfemale logic‚Äù.  The significance of this function of the forebrain is confirmed by the fact that for most highly paid professions it is critical to have good analytical brain function.  The basic level of mathematical abilities is approximately the same for everyone, and a lot depends on the attitude to this activity and mood.  It is also interesting that good musicians often have impressive mathematical abilities. </p><p>  <strong>Spatial thinking</strong> is also a very useful function in life.  It includes a whole range of skills - this is the ability to notice details, and the ability to form an arrangement of parts and to compare existing data on similar structures with new ones.  The process involved are basically the same areas that are responsible for vision. </p><p>  As you can see, the forebrain is the base of our intellect; the article described various functions that are components of intelligence.  For those who are interested in the details, I recommend the book by David Gaimon and Allen Braggdon, entitled ‚ÄúSuper Brain.  Manual." </p>
