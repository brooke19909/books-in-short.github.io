Specialists combined them into the following groups: </p><ol><li>  Contribution to the authorized capital. </li><li>  Acquisition from third-party companies and manufacturers. </li><li>  Manufacturing, construction, construction. </li><li>  Exchange for other property.  <span>Fixed assets</span> in this case come in accordance with agreements providing for the fulfillment of obligations through non-monetary assets. </li><li>  Gratuitous receipt.  In this case, the main form of receipt is considered <span>a gift agreement.</span>  In accordance with it, one party transfers or takes upon itself the obligation to transfer the property to the other side of the property. </li></ol><p>  In any of the above cases, the accounting of the receipt of fixed assets is carried out.  All subsequent costs are recorded as investments in assets (non-current) in the respective accounts.  So, accounting for the receipt of fixed assets is reflected in the account on investments in non-current assets.  Information is reflected in the context of subaccounts on the acquisition of land, various nature management objects.  Accounting for the receipt of fixed assets is also carried out under the articles on the construction of relevant facilities and their acquisition. </p><p>  The debit of the account for investments in non-on-board assets reflects the costs of acquiring the assets, bringing them into a usable condition, market value (upon receipt of free of charge), as well as the agreed value (in relation to investing in joint capital). </p><p>  Accounting for the receipt of fixed assets also provides for the reflection of VAT not subject to entry into the initial cost. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the legislation, the founders have the right to make contributions to the <span>joint (authorized) capital</span> both in cash and in non-monetary form.  Founders can be both legal entities and citizens. </p><p>  The following <span>documents</span> should be considered as <span>primary documents,</span> which confirm receipt of fixed assets and which serve as the basis for their adoption in accounting: </p><ol><li>  The decision of the general constituent assembly and the <span>memorandum of association.</span>  These documents contain information about the monetary <span>value of fixed assets contributed</span> to the share capital. </li><li>  Act from an independent appraiser. </li><li>  Invoice and invoice for the value of the assessment. </li><li>  Documents that confirm the costs associated with the receipt (acquisition) of fixed assets, delivery, as well as bringing them into a condition suitable for use. </li></ol><p>  The initial value is the monetary value agreed by the founders, unless otherwise provided by law. </p><p>  The initial cost of the funds received, due to investments in joint capital, includes the actual expenses of the enterprise for the delivery and bringing them into a suitable condition.  In accordance with them, an accounting assessment of enterprise resources is carried out. </p><p>  The organization may take place and disposal of fixed assets.  This may occur as a result of the liquidation, due to complete moral or physical depreciation, of a gratuitous transfer in accordance with the terms of the contract of gift or sale to third parties or companies.  The reasons should include the exchange for other property, as well as the transfer as an investment in the joint capital of other companies. </p><p>  The <span>disposal of fixed assets is</span> carried out by a special commission.  It consists of representatives of technical and economic organizations and services, as well as the person or representative of the enterprise that receives the object.  Members of the commission inspect and establish the possibility or impossibility of subsequent operation.  In accordance with the results of the inspection during liquidation, acts are written off to write off funds. </p>
