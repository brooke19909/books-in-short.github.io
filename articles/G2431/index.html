    <h2>  Grand Bazaar: then and now </h2><p>  The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, whose photo is striking in its variegated colors, has always been like this.  Its history spans more than 500 years, and throughout its entire length this place was associated with major milestones in the history of the city itself. </p><p>  First, the Grand Bazaar was built of wood, but after the fires it was necessary to rebuild it again, already using stone.  Stone structures also could not resist - this time before the earthquake.  After several reconstructions and rebuilds in the 1960s, the market was finally given the final look - exactly the one that it has today. </p><p>  The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul was originally built indoor for the safety of the merchants themselves, as well as to protect the goods from the weather.  Special openings for sunlight were made in the roof, and she herself was skillfully decorated with magnificent ornaments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Each type of goods and each group of merchants was assigned a specific area.  Therefore, to this day the streets of the Grand Bazaar bear distinctive names.  Here you can find the street of jewelers and sellers of carpets, gunsmiths and pottery masters. </p><p>  The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is an unofficial champion in terms of area and quantity of goods.  There are simply no equal to him in the world.  This is a real town with streets and neighborhoods, playgrounds, fountains and even mosques.  In addition, there is a school, a bathhouse, numerous cafes and exchange offices.  In short, you can walk here at least all day. </p><h2>  Where is the Istanbul market located? </h2><p>  The Grand Bazaar is located not somewhere on the outskirts, but in the very historical center of the city.  At a distance of only a kilometer from here is the dream of all tourists - the Blue Mosque. </p><p>  You can get to the Grand Bazaar on foot, or on a special <span>high-speed tram.</span>  He walks on a branch called T1.  Get to the Beyazit stop and you are there.  Right in front of you will be the main gate of the market.  There is another stop, called √áemberlita≈ü, - from it you can also get to the bazaar, through another entrance. </p><p>  If you prefer walking, then from the New Mosque or from the Eminenu pier, you can walk to the Grand Bazaar in just 15-20 minutes.  True, the path runs through the intricate narrow streets in which you can get lost.  It is advisable to explore this area before visiting or use the navigator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Grand Bazaar in Istanbul: opening hours </h2><p>  The capital of Turkey has many attractions: Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia.  The market can also be attributed to their number.  Many tourists, even arriving in Turkey for a couple of days, are in a hurry to visit the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.  Its operating mode is the same as that of many stores.  Trading pavilions open at half past eight - nine in the morning, and close at seven in the evening.  There is enough time to buy everything you need and enjoy the outlandish goods that you will not find anywhere else.  Please note: Sunday the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is closed. </p><p>  If you arrived at the market only in the evening, there is also something to see here.  The bazaar itself closes, but outside, near its walls, merchants lay out their goods in the evening.  If you love flea markets and never miss the opportunity to buy some consumer goods, then be sure to check here after 19:00. </p><h2>  How to navigate the streets of the Grand Bazaar </h2><p>  More than half a million buyers come here every day.  In order not to get lost in the many streets, be sure to remember through which gate you got inside.  There are nine main gates and several secondary gates, each of which has its own intricate name.  A map of the Grand Bazaar will also help with orientation: you can buy it at the entrance or at a newsstand nearby. </p>

    <p>  On a map or market map that hangs at each entrance, sections with different goods are indicated in different colors.  For example, blue - textiles, brown - leather products.  If you come to buy a carpet or ceramics, look for green streets, and those who hunt for Turkish gold should focus on yellow signs. </p><h2>  Gourmet paradise </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews, you can literally buy everything here.  Famous Turkish spices and sweets, carpets and soap, gold and jewelry ... You can even not buy anything at all (if possible), but just wander through the streets of the Grand Bazaar and plunge into the atmosphere of an oriental tale.  And along the way, try a piece of one or another goodies. </p><p>  Many recommend going to the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul before returning home - in order to stock up on the road with groceries.  Here you can find excellent cheese of several kinds, olives, basturma, coffee, all kinds of sweets and much more - both by weight and in boxes. </p>

    <p>  It is impossible to feel the unique flavor of a real Turkish market without a cup of local coffee.  Therefore, visit one of the local coffee shops that are found on the streets of the Grand Bazaar just at every step.  And if you do not like coffee, you will be offered aromatic strong tea - the locals love it as much as we do. </p><h2>  Grand Bazaar prices </h2><p>  Remember: everything that is sold here is already knowingly overpriced.  Therefore, do not be afraid to bargain - especially since in the East this is only welcome.  Be a picky buyer and be sure to check the quality of the product, no matter how much the seller praises it. </p><p>  Keep in mind that going a few streets inland from the gate, you will see much lower prices.  Therefore, do not make purchases immediately near the entrance.  In addition, reviews also indicate: outside the Grand Bazaar, the thing you like can be bought cheaper than inside. </p><p>  By the way, the residents of Istanbul at the Grand Bazaar themselves prefer not to buy anything - it is too expensive.  This place is intended exclusively for tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Grand Bazaar reviews </h2><p>  Even Joseph Brodsky, after visiting the capital of Turkey, was impressed by its trading pavilions.  He called the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul the heart, soul and brain of the city.  He also said that the most famous stores in the world can not be compared with the local "catacombs" full of various goods. </p><p>  Of interest are not only goods, but also the architectural splendor of the market.  The painting of the walls and ceilings of the Grand Bazaar itself is a museum attraction.  Therefore, looking at the counters, occasionally raise your head and look around.  Local authorities do not restore the mural, so everything you see will be a historical original of past centuries. </p><p>  In short, the Grand Bazaar (Istanbul), whose working hours are the same as most stores, is a very colorful place.  The memories from his visit will remain with you for a long time! </p>
