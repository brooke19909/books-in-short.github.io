It was he who introduced this fashion by building a house in St. Petersburg, which was a copy of his housing in Zaandam. </p><p>  The emperor was fascinated by the architecture of this small but picturesque country and wished to recreate its likeness in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="houses in the Netherlands" class="if uuid-2993990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2993990.jpg"></div><p>  A royal decree was given, which ordered all houses to "paint in brick in the Dutch manner."  The pattern was applied over the plaster. </p><p>  The Dutch house in Kuskovo was built by Count Pavel Borisovich Sheremetev in 1749, as evidenced by the inscription on the facade.  Despite the fact that the building dates back to the mid-eighteenth century, it is a fashion statement introduced by Peter the Great.  The house served as an entertainment pavilion for guests and demonstrated the life and culture of the Netherlands. </p><p>  The building has a complete artistic appearance.  Guests at the entrance to the estate saw him the first of the entire ensemble of such buildings.  It was considered the main pavilion. </p><p>  Tea was served here, visitors had the opportunity to eat and relax, interrupting for a while their walk in the beautiful manor park.  That is why the kitchen is located on the first floor of the Dutch house.  At the top is a hall with a dessert room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1975, the movie "Hello, I am Your Aunt" was shot in the estate of Kuskovo.  The house acted as the home of Colonel Chesney.  Today there is a museum. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Dutch house is a red-brown building with a stepped facade.  It is made in a simple style and is an exact copy of the buildings of the Dutch cities of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  The facade is painted according to the requirements of Peter the Great.  The house has two floors.  Windows and a stepping tong also correspond to the declared style. </p><p>  The opposite side of the house looks different than the front facade.  Here you can see the colonnade and the balcony, which can be accessed from the main hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunhome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="back of the house" class="if uuid-2994002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2994002.jpg"></div><p>  Near the house are flower beds.  They are arranged so that they make up a pattern that can be viewed from a bird's eye view.  Today, hyacinths of different varieties and colors are grown on the beds. </p><p>  The Dutch house is surrounded by a fence, behind which is a garden.  Earlier tulips were grown here - a symbol of the Netherlands, there was a small garden.  This was done to create an imitation of the street.  This entire complex is located on the coast of a small Dutch lake, through which a drawbridge is thrown.  This creates the <span>effect of the presence</span> on the streets of the beloved Peter the Great country.  During the heyday of the estate, carp were bred in the pond, which swam to feed, responding to the ringing of a bell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="metrorus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lake in Kuskovo" class="if uuid-2994007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2994007.jpg"></div><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  Entering the Dutch house, guests find themselves in a small canopy.  From here you can go to the kitchen, located here on the first floor.  This is the largest building in the building.  At its end is a hearth of impressive size.  Under the rooms in the past was a fireplace mine, which occupied the entire basement.  The house had a unique ventilation system, but it has not been preserved to this day. </p><p>  Climbing the oak stairs, visitors find themselves in a spacious living room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shagau.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="living room of a Dutch house" class="if uuid-2994013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2994013.jpg"></div><p>  In the room you can see paintings of the eighteenth century by Dutch and English artists.  The same paintings are presented on the stairs leading from the first floor.  Despite the fact that the house is furnished in Dutch traditions, in the living room you can see a fireplace with Chinese painting, which was made by German craftsmen.  The window of this room offers a picturesque view of the pond. </p><p>  The dessert room is a narrow room.  The first thing that catches your eye is the massive gilded carved supporting part of the table, on which objects of a chic service are placed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="countryscanner.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dessert room" class="if uuid-2994025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2994025.jpg"></div><p>  The Dutch house is known worldwide for such outlandish gizmos as a casket and a casket covered in shark skin, which are located in the kitchen.  Pewter fully complies with the customs of the Dutch family. </p><p>  The walls of the kitchen are tiled.  Each tile depicts drawings of rural life.  The living room walls are decorated with tiles of a darker color with patterns.  They are called carpet and brought from Rotterdam.  In the Netherlands, for the sake of economy, such tiles were used interspersed, while Sheremetev covered them with all the walls.  In total, 10,000 tiles were used, which is considered a luxury. </p><p>  The interior of the Dutch house in Kuskovo is simple: high-quality furniture, heavy wooden beams and antique parquet.  All this brutal frame contains real treasures - magnificent porcelain from around the world, which recalls the decorative purpose of the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="decorpro.blog" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="porcelain collection" class="if uuid-2994035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/2994035.jpg"></div><p>  Despite this, there is a warmth and coziness inherent in an inhabited house.
