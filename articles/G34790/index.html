The reviews left about the Atlas City Hotel 3 * hotel are mixed.  There are both positive and negative. </p><p>  Bad comments are made by people who counted on high quality service, spacious modern apartments and developed infrastructure in the hotel.  But this is a simple hotel, albeit marked by three stars.  And if you think about it, the price-performance ratio is adequate. </p><p>  Tourists say that when you plan an economy class trip and literally every euro counts, you should stop at Atlas City Hotel.  A wonderful, comfortable option for people who need a cozy place to sleep. </p><p>  The main thing is that the rooms are good.  It is quite spacious, inside there is everything you need.  The beds are comfortable, linen is clean, towels are changed every day, hygiene supplies are also not forgotten to replenish.  If something is missing or there is a nuisance (for example, a hair dryer has broken), you can simply go down to the reception and explain the situation to the administrator.  The issue will be immediately resolved. </p><p>  Although the reviews about the location of the hotel are mixed.  Yes, it is convenient to get to various attractions from here, but it can be noisy outside.  There are many young people in the area who like to have fun loudly in the evenings. </p><p>  But the rest is not bad.  Even those people who have noticed all the nuances listed above claim that if they were planning yet another budget trip to Budapest, they would have chosen this option.  All the minor flaws and nuances are overshadowed by the beauty of Budapest. </p>
