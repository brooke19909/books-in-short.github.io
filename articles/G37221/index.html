Korean company products are of high quality and prestigious design.  Each gadget receives positive feedback from users, high sales and worldwide recognition.  Very few companies can compete with Samsung.  On a note of popularity, the manufacturer took up the development and production of fitness bracelets and <span>smart watches.</span>  Few doubts that the company will succeed here either.  For several years, a number of models were presented on the market, which will be discussed in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Samsung Gear Fit 2 </h2><p>  Fitness Bracelet Samsung Gear Fit 2 appeared on the market in 2014 and gathered a lot of positive reviews.  The model has all the necessary functionality that allows you to engage in active sports, while it stands out with a pretty design.  Especially the fitness bracelet "Samsung" Gear Fit 2 liked the young generation. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  A Korean company regularly works on its own mistakes.  <span>Samsung</span> Fitness <span>Gear Gear 2, a review of</span> which is presented in the article, has become a revised version of its predecessor.  The first watch model was remembered for having a silver edging that wiped itself over time.  It did not look very neat, because of which, after a few months, an expensive gadget looked like a cheap Chinese copy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Samsung's new fitness bracelet managed to get rid of this problem by getting a metal plate that has the color of the strap.  To spoil this material, you have to try.  Fitness bracelet is waterproof, which allows you to even swim with it.  Therefore, claims to the materials of manufacture do not arise. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen is curved to fit the shape of a hand.  Fitness Bracelet Samsung Gear Fit 2 received a slightly smaller display diagonal than in the older model.  Now this parameter is 1.5 inches.  But the resolution increased - 216x432 pixels.  The screen is made using SuperAMOLED technology.  Thanks to her, the watch is quite energy efficient. </p><h2>  Sensors and controls </h2><p>  Samsung fitness bracelet received the latest generation sensor, which tracks the user's pulse.  Significantly increased the accuracy of its work and the speed of measurement.  The module easily measures the <span>pulse while running,</span> which many budget models cannot boast of.  The results show are pretty accurate. </p>

    <p>  To control there are two small buttons that are located on the right side.  They protrude slightly above the surface of the body and have a pleasant ride.  Touch screen that allows you to control from it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Samsung fitness bracelet received a 200 mAh battery.  Runtime increased slightly compared to the previous version.  The developers managed to slightly correct the power consumption of the screen, the software has become more optimized.  Of course, you can discharge the battery completely in a day, if you activate all the wireless interfaces.  However, with the average use of the Samsung (fitness bracelet), the price of which is about 11,000 rubles, it can work up to 4 days.  It is worth paying attention that the notifications that come to the device have a huge impact on autonomy.  Here you can add the frequency of activation of the display backlight. </p><p>  Charging the device is made in the form of a small block on which the watch is placed.  There is a <span>magnetic latch</span> to which the device sticks.  A full charge takes about 1 hour.  During charging, a screen saver showing the percentage appears on the screen. </p><h2>  Hardware and software </h2><p>  Fitness bracelet with a heart rate monitor received a processor that operates at a frequency of up to 1 GHz.  The RAM in the device is 512 MB, which is enough for a clock.  The internal memory is set to 4 GB, but only 3.5 GB is available to the user.  By the way, the "filling" has not changed - everything is the same as in the first Gear Fit.  In memory, you can save music, which is very convenient.  It can be transferred to a fitness bracelet with a heart rate monitor through a special manager.  True, only wireless headphones can be connected.  But you don‚Äôt have to carry a smartphone during training. </p>

    <p>  In general, the installed hardware ensures stable and fast operation of the watch, therefore, there are no complaints about it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Installed Bluetooth 4.2, which can only be rejoiced.  There is Wi-Fi, which adds additional features. </p><p>  To work with the bracelet, you must download the program from the application store. </p><h2>  Samsung Charm </h2><p>  Companies regularly present models of fitness bracelets exclusively for men or unisex, but only for women it is difficult to find.  The Korean company decided to rectify this situation by launching Samsung Charm specifically for the weak half of humanity.  I must say, they did it very well.  In Russia, sales of Samsung Smart Charm black and other colors started in the early summer of 2016.  Women are delighted with the new items, and for men it is easier to choose a worthy gift. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Completed a fitness bracelet is simple, but tasteful.  Here you will not see wide functionality.  The package includes the module itself, a <span>rubber bracelet,</span> documentation and a charger.  Everything is packed in a decent box. </p>

    <p>  The module turned out to be very small from the manufacturer - a little more than a ruble coin.  Weight is only 3 grams.  The side faces are made of metal, the back side is made of plastic.  The front side is decorated with curved glass.  If you turn the watch at a certain angle, you can see how the color of the display shimmers.  From the outside, it resembles a pearl. </p><p>  In the center of the screen is a small dot that serves to signal the user about events.  You can independently adjust the color of the notification when you first pair with a smartphone.  By the way, in terms of messages about incoming calls, the clock is useless.  Even if you are persistently called, the fitness bracelet will not notify. </p><p>  On the hand, the watch looks very aesthetically pleasing and neat.  The strap made of silicone has a sufficient number of holes.  It sits comfortably, does not put pressure on the hand and does not fly off.  The module holds perfectly in the strap - it is impossible to lose the pearl.  The bracelet is only sold in a single performance.  It‚Äôs quite comfortable doing sports - the bracelet does not interfere. </p><p>  In general, the bracelet from Samsung is positioned as a fashion accessory, so I did not get a full screen with touch controls.  You can buy in three color options: black, gold and rose gold.  In general, the design of the model turned out to be very good. </p>

    <h2>  application </h2><p>  Please note that the fitness bracelet only works with Android smartphones.  Almost all models work with the model without difficulty.  However, iOS owners will not appreciate the capabilities of the bracelet. </p><p>  To fully work, you must install two applications: Charm by Samsung and S Health.  You can download them for free on the Play Market.  The first program is needed for the initial connection and setting up a fitness bracelet, the second one is for tracking user actions. </p><p>  Pairing takes place in seconds.  Everything is simple and clear.  You can immediately select the color of the LED for notifications, as well as allow the utility access to phone notifications.  Here you can configure what the bracelet will inform you about.  Since there is no screen and vibration signal, and the only color is responsible for notifications, you should not choose many different programs. </p><p>  The Charm by Samsung application is quite primitive, it is very rarely used.  Using it, you can update the software, as well as find out how much battery is left. </p><p>  For work, you will often have to use the S Health program.  She is familiar to many owners of other bracelets from the company, as it is universal.  The application will record the number of steps taken.  Unfortunately, the model‚Äôs capabilities are limited to this: the bracelet is not able to track the phases of sleep and other indicators of the owner. </p><p>  S Health settings allow you to specify which device to synchronize in case you have more than one bracelet.  By the way, a permanent connection is optional.  You can walk all day with a bracelet that is not paired with a smartphone, and in the evening set synchronization to get information about the steps taken. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the bracelet is made miniature.  For small dimensions, developers had to pay a small battery capacity.  The device has a battery of only 17 mAh.  However, given the lack of a full-fledged screen and low functionality, this amount is enough for quite a long work. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims that the bracelet can work up to two weeks on a single charge.  In principle, there is no doubt.  After all, the device lacks functions that would quickly discharge it.  The number of notifications and the duration of the connection with the smartphone have a slight effect on the duration of work.  On average, a model runs for more than 10 days; for some users, it can function up to three weeks. </p>

    <p>  The results are pretty good considering the size of the gadget.  And few devices in this category can boast of similar performance.  To surpass the device from Samsung is only possible for models with a battery-tablet, which cannot be charged.  It takes less than an hour to fully charge. </p><p>  Of course, technically there is nothing interesting in the device.  This is a fairly simple bracelet that has received the most minimal functionality.  It does not even track the phases of sleep and vibration, which today is present in Chinese devices for $ 10.  However, there are pluses. </p><p>  For all its technical simplicity, Samsung Charm turned out to be compact and stylish.  Due to the lack of a lot of features, it can work for a long time, weighs little, has simple control through applications.  Most importantly, the device looks great.  The target audience of the model is rather lovers of miniature and prestigious accessories, rather than athletes.  For many women, a serious drawback will only be the lack of alternative straps, which Samsung is not going to release.  As for the cost, the device takes the lower class - up to 2500 rubles.  For such a price, it is impossible to find a device from the same representative company. </p>
