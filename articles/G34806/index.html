It is still unknown where the name of the lake came from.  Some argue that it gives bear power, and therefore received its name.  Others tell a beautiful legend about a bear who came to the shore of the lake to treat a sick paw.  Others find that the shape of the reservoir resembles the image of a bear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The lake consists of two parts that connects a small strait.  Its nutrition occurs solely due to melt water, so its level is highly dependent on the season.  With a large area (61 km <sup>2</sup> ) it is very shallow and warm.

    <h2>  Available treatments </h2><p>  First of all, it is a mud clinic, so most of the patient's requests are related to this area.  In practice, not only wrapping (applications) is used, it is very popular today: galvanic mud, intestinal, gynecological and urological mud procedures. </p><p>  The thermal effect of dirt on the body is unique and inimitable.

At the same time, such a temperature of the mud is perceived as very comfortable, and under its influence in the body, recovery reactions are launched.  The sanatorium "Bear Lake" (Kurgan region) has almost a century of experience in treating patients with various diseases. </p><p>  The second effect is mechanical.  That is, massage the surface of the body with particles of dirt.  At the same time, the gases, vitamins, minerals and other useful substances contained in it are absorbed through the skin and thereby have a therapeutic effect from the inside.  The local dirt is unique in its composition and microscopic particle size.  Because of this, it is applied to the skin like an ointment and is easily washed off with water. </p><p>  The second direction is balneotherapy.  These are various bathtubs - brine, pearl, herbal, hydromassage and many others are used.  The main life-giving and healing power is brine, and not only due to the high concentration of salts.  It contains mineral elements, humic acids, vitamins, hormones, amino acids, fatty acids. </p><p>  Additional healing types of therapy are: physiotherapy (electrical, light and laser therapy), exercise therapy, various massages, herbal medicine.  Used in work: inhalation therapy, speleotherapy <span>(salt mine),</span> hydrocolonotherapy, psychocorrection and much more.  Such a wide range of medical procedures includes the sanatorium "Bear Lake".  Customer reviews contain warm words addressed to caring and professional medical staff who did everything possible for their good rest and speedy recovery. </p>
