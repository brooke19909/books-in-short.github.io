Well-known world brands began to produce all kinds of device modifications.  But in order to make full use of their functionality, you need to decide how to connect the smart watch to the phone and make a full setup.  The procedure may have some differences depending on the model of smart watches, however, the sequence of actions is subject to independent execution. </p><h2>  Preparatory Activities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.newfrog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a smart watch to a phone" class="if uuid-2956052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2956052.jpg"></div><p>  After acquiring smart watches, their owner must familiarize themselves with the attached instructions and perform the following actions: </p><ol><li>  To study the device, its capabilities and control methods. </li><li>  Determine the location of the connectors and control buttons. </li><li>  With the support of the SIM card device, thoroughly familiarize yourself with the installation diagram. </li><li>  Check battery health and contact integrity. </li></ol><p>  Different models are characterized by a peculiar technique and charging time.  Therefore, to charge the device is used: </p><ul><li>  wire charging (contact) with power supply; </li><li>  wireless charger; </li><li>  magnetic charging (docking station). </li></ul><p>  As a rule, it is not recommended that the battery be completely discharged in the first 3-5 charging cycles.  It is advisable to put the gadget on charge at a minimum level and charge up to 100%.  A similar method is a kind of ‚Äúbuildup‚Äù of the device‚Äôs battery.  If the battery does not charge, then the cause of the problem is most likely the integrity of the contacts or the charger itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Install SIM card and setup communication </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.brufind.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a smart watch to an android phone" class="if uuid-2956053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2956053.jpg"></div><p>  Some watch models are equipped with a function that allows you to work with the card of any telecom operator.  These include, for example, smart watches for children or citizens of advanced age.  So, before connecting a children's smart watch to the phone, it is important to adhere to a number of rules: </p><ul><li>  It is strongly recommended that you select a reliable telecom operator that has standard network support that does not require difficult steps to set up communications. </li><li>  Determine the tariff.  It is desirable that it includes an option to prepay Internet traffic of at least 1 GB. </li><li>  To track the balance by phone number, you should create a personal account on the website of the telecom operator. </li><li>  You will need to check whether the card is activated through the phone, and also does not have a PIN code. </li><li>  Be sure to replenish the balance, because otherwise the Internet connection will not function. </li></ul><p>  If the SIM card is installed correctly, then after a while an indicator will appear on the device‚Äôs display showing the signal reception quality. </p><h2>  Set date and time </h2><p>  Many smartphones after the first start-up involve setting the time in a smart watch, which is set based on the time zone.  Some devices do not automatically suggest the date and time.  In such cases, you must open the "Settings" and perform the appropriate actions.  More specific information can be found in the device manual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smartphone Sync </h2><p>  Before connecting a smart watch to a phone, it should be noted that each model is equipped with software that allows you to connect to a smartphone.  Smart devices can only connect to the Android or iOS platform.  However, a large number of smart watches are cross-platform. </p><p>  A step-by-step instruction on how to connect a smart watch to an Android phone consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Installing applications on the phone for a suitable watch model. </li><li>  Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on the clock, and on some Wi-Fi models. </li><li>  Select the name of the watch from the list that opens. </li><li>  Receive a notification with a secret code on device screens. </li></ol><p>  Initiate pairing using the Connect button if the codes on both devices match.  On the gadget screen, after completing all the actions, the inscription "Connected" should be displayed.  In case of failure, the system will also respond with a message. </p><h2>  Installing the application on a smart watch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wareable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a children's smart watch to the phone" class="if uuid-2956073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2956073.jpg"></div><p>  Using a paired smartphone is one of the easiest methods to install additional applications on a smart watch.  Many models of modern devices boast an abundance of both paid and free third-party programs.  To install, it is enough, using a smartphone, to find the necessary application for Android Wear in the Google Play store, download and install it.  Upon completion of the process, the add-on can be used on a watch by opening the installed application. </p><h2>  Connecting a smart watch to an Android smartphone: step-by-step instructions </h2><p>  As a rule, most modern gadgets support the Android operating system.  Therefore, users should not have a lot of questions about how to connect smart watches to Samsung, Lenovo, HTC and other models.  The principle is one and the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wareable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a smart watch to an iPhone phone" class="if uuid-2956080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2956080.jpg"></div><p>  To connect a smart watch to a phone with the Android operating system, you must: </p><ul><li>  Download the free Android Wear app from the Play Market. </li><li>  Turn on Smart Watch on the phone and run the installed program.  Smart watches should be located at a distance of no more than one meter from the smartphone. </li><li>  Select the ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù item in the application, after which the name of the watch will be displayed on the screen. </li><li>  Compare the codes on the device displays and, if they are the same, select ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  If all the actions are performed correctly, then the ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù icon should appear in the Android Wear program. </p><h2>  Connecting smart watches to your iOS phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="appleiwatch.name" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a smart watch to a Samsung phone" class="if uuid-2956083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2956083.jpg"></div><p>  Before you connect a smartwatch to your iPhone, open and activate Bluetooth.  After the gadget is detected by the program, you must select the name displayed on the smartwatch display.  After that, you will need to specify the code, which will also be displayed on the dial. </p><p>  Sometimes the watch and the iOS device do not detect each other.  In this case, you should reset all the settings to the factory settings and try again.  Once connected, the application will ask you to sign in to your Gmail account. </p><h2>  The difference between using Android Wear and iPhone gadgets from sharing with Android devices </h2><p>  As a rule, at present, there are no certain third-party Android Wear-based smartwatch applications that are connected to the iPhone.  Thanks to the OK function of Google, you can perform advanced search on the Internet, as well as set an alarm clock, calendar and record.  However, Hangouts and messaging will have to be abandoned. </p><p>  While searching for the necessary information through OK Google, the results will be displayed on the watch screen.  But this information will be available in the Android Wear application installed on the smartphone.  Unlike working with gadgets on the Android operating system, smartphones do not support Wi-Fi when connected to an iOS device. </p><p>  Now we know how to connect a smart watch to the phone.  This is a procedure that should not be neglected.  Its implementation does not require much time and certain skills.  After reading the instructions, you can connect and configure smart watches in a matter of minutes.  The main parameters of the device are similarly configured at an intuitive level, which contributes to seamless use by any category of users. </p>
