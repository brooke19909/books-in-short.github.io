  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Abiotic factors and their impact on the environment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Living organisms interact with each other and with the outside world, and this makes up their environment.  One of the factors affecting <span>animate and inanimate nature</span> is man.  <span>Abiotic factors, biotic factors</span> and anthropogenic factors are divided depending on the form of exposure to living organisms. </p><p>  A living organism cannot exist outside its habitat.  Biotic and abiotic factors affect the environment and contribute to the growth and development of living organisms.  This process should not be disrupted, otherwise it will lead to global changes and the disappearance of individual species. </p><p>  Anthropogenic factors are caused by human influence on the world around.  This happens as a result of his activities.  Sometimes this effect has devastating consequences. </p><p>  Biotic factors are the interaction of living organisms in the environment among themselves.  These are food chains and <span>natural selection,</span> which make up a complex process that has developed over many hundreds and even thousands of years. </p><p>  Abiotic factors are the influence of <span>inanimate nature</span> on the development and vital activity of living organisms.  These factors have an impact on the body since its inception.  Climate, topography, weather <span>anomalies, water,</span> air, soil - these are all abiotic factors.  Examples of them are found everywhere.  A plant cannot develop without sunlight, a stable temperature regime, etc. is required for the emergence of young animals from eggs. </p><p>  Any change in one of the factors in one direction or another has a decisive effect on the body, even if other indicators are within normal limits.  For example, drought and lack of moisture can lead to the death of plants and representatives of the animal world, or, conversely, excess moisture causes disruption of living organisms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Abiotic factors affect the development of the body to a certain extent.  Each of them is important in its own way, and its change leads to irreversible consequences.  One of the main abiotic factors is light.  The sun, as a source of light, is a prerequisite for the full development of living organisms.  They are influenced by the length, intensity and duration of solar radiation.  Under the influence of light rays in plants, the process of photosynthesis takes place.  Rays of ultraviolet radiation are necessary for the life of animals and humans.  But for each individual organism, a certain dose of <span>ultraviolet rays is</span> needed <span>.</span>  Exceeding or understating it leads to disruptions in the development of a living organism.  Therefore, violations of the ozone layer, which is considered a filter for ultraviolet rays, which has been occurring recently, are fatal to the animal and plant world, as well as to humans. </p><p>  Another major abiotic factor is temperature.  Every living organism needs a special temperature regime.  This determines their habitat.  Therefore, climate change leads to disturbances in flora and fauna. <br>  Humidity is a crucial abiotic factor.  Water is necessary for all processes occurring in a living organism.  Its presence determines the features of the development of living organisms.  Having adapted to a certain habitat, they regulate their life processes depending on the dry seasons. </p><p>  Abiotic factors associated with the composition of the soil are also important.  They determine the presence of plant and animal species that are characteristic of this zone.  The soil itself serves as a habitat for many insects, bacteria, invertebrates and fungi.  Therefore, its influence on the development of living organisms is enormous. </p><p>  All abiotic factors are interconnected.  A change in one of them leads to a disruption of another factor, and, undoubtedly, to a disruption of the vital functions of all living organisms.  Therefore, it is important that they all remain unchanged and not undergo changes under the influence of man. </p>
