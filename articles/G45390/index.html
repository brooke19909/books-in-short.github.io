    <p>  Menorca is a beautiful island located in the northeast of the Balearic Islands.  It is considered the territory of Spain.  Its population does not exceed 80,000 people.  The most significant sights are beaches.  Thanks to them, tourists learned about such an island as Menorca.  Responses of vacationers show that there are more beaches here than on all the Balearic Islands.  Their total length is 217 kilometers.  In addition, there are many places that are of great interest to lovers of history and culture.  The beauty of the entire territory of Menorca can be observed from Mount Monte Toro, which is the highest point of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain menorca island" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/218973.jpg" width="385"></div>

As for the southern coast, there are numerous ravines on it.  It should also be noted that diving enthusiasts go specifically to the island of Menorca.  Reviews show that all the interesting places here will be able to see during the first vacation.  The architecture of the island can be divided into two types.  The first includes white houses.  They are typical for the Mediterranean buildings.  The second type is buildings built in the English style.  They indicate the various stages of the presence of the British in these places.  In addition, there are many <span>archaeological sites</span> in Menorca that make the island an open-air museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="menorca tourist reviews" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/218972.jpg" width="325"></div>

    <p>  Particular attention should be paid to the remains of civilization, which lived here in the second millennium BC.  The covets, tauls, and talayotes are megalithic stone buildings.  If you single out the largest cluster of prehistoric monuments that Menorca is famous for, reviews of tourists <strong> </strong>  show that it will be Naveta des Tudons.  It is here that you can see the large funeral structure of the island, the so-called "libel", the shape of which resembles a ship turned upside down, its height corresponds to the level of a <span>two-story house.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the southern part of the island there is an equally famous ancient attraction - the prehistoric village of Torre d'en Gaumes.  Three stone towers rise here - the Talayots, surrounded on all sides by defensive walls.  Of great interest is the construction of Taula - a kind of temple, the building of which is built in the shape of the letter "t".  And this is not all the ancient places attracting tourists, which Menorca is famous for.  Reviews show that the dolmen funeral room is of interest to guests of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="menorca tourist reviews" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/218971.jpg" width="325"></div>

    <p>  With regard to buildings related to newer history, cities such as Mahon and Ciudadella should be visited.  The first is the capital of the island and the most important commercial center.  The main attraction of the city is the natural harbor.  Moreover, it is the best natural port of the Mediterranean.  The list of interesting places should be supplemented with such structures as a house overlooking the harbor, the Church of St. Mary, whose main value is a huge organ consisting of 3,000 pipes.  It is recommended to visit the distillery, where a fine gin is produced using old technology.  But this is not the only city that the island of Menorca offers for visiting guests.  Reviews show that the city of Ciudadella is no less interesting.  It is completely different from the capital.  Gothic and Baroque buildings, mansions and palaces built in the 18th century prevail here. </p><p>  And on the east coast of Menorca you can visit nature reserves, a walk along which will leave a lot of unforgettable impressions. </p>
