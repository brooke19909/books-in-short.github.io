So, let's start in order. </p><h2>  Educational program </h2><p>  Apart-hotel is primarily a completely <span>commercial project,</span> which involves the construction of real estate for the purpose of its further sale to private customers, who, in turn, can use the purchased meters for the following purposes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  like residential apartments; </li><li>  as an office space to meet their own and personal needs; </li><li>  as an object that you can rent yourself; </li><li>  as an object of an agreement with a management company, which, in turn, incurs all the costs of operating the apartments, and in return pays their owner a certain percentage of income. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Construction of apart-hotels in Russia </h2><p>  Many well-known domestic architects admit that in Russia the construction of such real estate has not yet been developed to the proper level, however, it is more and more often apartments in the hotel services market that are offered to tourists in the White Stone and the Northern capital.  The fact is that, according to many tour operators, comfort and independence at the same time, the ability to relax with family, a large company and more are important for a modern tourist.  Hotel rooms are, of course, good, but apartments are much better at this task.  Need gives rise to demand, which means that the intensification of the construction of apart-hotels is not far off. </p><p>  By the way, foreign tourists use apartments much more often than Russians.  Foreigners do not ask: “Apart-hotel - what is it?”  They are well aware of the advantages of apartments, so they are more actively settled in this particular type of hotel house. </p><h2>  The first apartment hotels of the capital </h2><p>  Despite the poor development in Russia of this type of hotel real estate as an <span>apart hotel, Moscow</span> today has a whole host of these establishments, for example, Havana, <span>Swiss Hotel Red Hills,</span> Crowne Plaza, Intercontinental, Aerostar .  By the way, according to experts in the field of tourism, the first such hotels appeared in Moscow back in 1970. True, then only very “big” people could live in them.  Today in Moscow, you can find apart hotels of various classes, ranging from inexpensive guest houses to 5-star ones.  For example, a hotel on Pokrovka Mamaison is nothing more than an apartment hotel.  Of course, more often metropolitan developers build establishments of the luxury segment, where the cost of 1 square.  m far exceeds the twenty thousandth limits in y.  e. But there is also an economy class, for example, Hanoi-Moscow.  In general, today there is plenty to choose from if you need an apart-hotel.  Moscow, as we have already said, differs in this respect from the rest of Russia and offers a large selection of establishments.  Therefore, in any case, you can choose the most suitable option for yourself without any problems (by the way, both for temporary settlement and for the purpose of investing). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aparthotel: reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34659/1029936.jpg" width="500"></div>
