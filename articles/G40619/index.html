    <p>  A review of smart rings is not required, because there is one model that has captivated all lovers of new technologies.  A detailed description of it, as well as reviews of this model can be found in the article. </p><h2>  Smart ring </h2><p>  Now almost everyone has in their arsenal <span>smart watches,</span> smartphones and other gadgets.  But rings with such possibilities are really something new and unexpected. </p><p>  Jakcom Smart Ring R3 is a smart ring that can be used to perform various actions.  For example, it can be used to open doors, configure commands on another gadget (launching an application, locking, unlocking, and so on).  In addition, it can even clone travel tickets, company passes and other documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart ring" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2162906.jpg"></div>

Also on the packaging is a QR code leading to the user manual on the main site. </p><p>  After opening the box, the ring design immediately catches your eye.  It looks pretty pretty.  The inside of the gadget is made entirely of polished titanium.  The brand logo is also located there.  Three marks are visible from the ends of the product: NFC, ID and M1.  Inside, opposite the second mark, a so-called ‚Äúmagic‚Äù stone called FIR is built in.  It is made by Korean nanotechnology exclusively from natural materials.  Opposite the first mark there is an insert from a natural volcanic magnet, the third - a rare-earth element (germanium). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart ring for phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2162902.jpg"></div>

It has several modules that perform various functions.  The first is a health module that contains volcanic stone, germanium, as well as energy.  All these components can significantly improve a person‚Äôs well-being and charge them positively. </p><p>  The stones themselves can be easily viewed on the inside of the gadget.  According to the manufacturer, they provide their owner with reliable protection against stress, radiation from electronics, as well as high blood pressure. </p><h2>  ID and M1 modules </h2><p>  Quite interesting and functional is the ID module.  It allows you to copy and simulate the frequencies of different types of identification cards (i.e. smart chips).  These include: the key to the intercom, trading, parking, smart, transport and other inductive cards.  Also, the device makes it possible to get rid of boring traditional inductive cards.  Therefore, thanks to him, you can easily go to the desired place. </p><p>  An equally important module is M1.  With it, the owner of the device will be able to simulate and copy contactless IC cards.  And all this is done at a frequency of 13.56 MHz. </p><h2>  NFC module </h2><p>  In addition to previous additions to the device, there is another interesting point.  The last mark on the ring is the NFC module.  It transmits data at a speed of 106 kb / s.  At the same time, it has as many as 100 thousand rewriting cycles.  Stored data can be stored for about 10 years.  The module guarantees the stability and security of this information.  It is also worth noting that it is designed only for the next generation and is suitable for the following mobile functions: </p><ol><li>  Information exchange.  Using the module it will be possible to transfer information about the owner, as well as various messages, photos and other files to other smartphones. </li><li>  Separate entry.  This function is provided in order to save private information.  For example, you can leave unscathed data on accounts, schedules, memos, and so on.  For this, it will be enough only to configure access through the ring itself, so that only the owner can manage the stored information. </li><li>  Fast start.  Using the gadget, it is possible to configure quick loading of applications.  This function will definitely be necessary for people whose hands are constantly occupied. </li><li>  Phone lock  The gadget can easily become the only key to the life of its owner, if you set <span>the screen lock</span> and applications.  All this is done quickly and completely safe. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Mobile app </h2><p>  The ring works using a special application installed on the phone.  It is designed for Android 4.43 and higher.  But to bind one device to another, the phone must have the NFC function.  It will need to be activated in the settings so that the synchronization of the ring and the smartphone is successful.  To start using the functions of a small device, you must run the installed application, press the appropriate button and attach it to the phone. </p><p>  On the main screen of the application there are a couple of tabs - Share Info (data transfer) and Edit Task (editing tasks).  Both of these sections perform various functions.  For example, the first provides access to such opportunities: </p><ol><li>  Electronic business card.  It makes it possible to write to the device basic information about the owner of up to 60 bytes. </li><li>  Link transfer.  Provides a chance to write a link to any site. </li><li>  Message passing.  Allows you to record a small text message up to 130 bytes.  In the future, this record can be transferred to the smartphone of another user. </li></ol><p>  The second has the following functions: </p><ol><li>  Profiles  Represents the download of the selected sets of settings during the approach of the ring to the phone. </li><li>  Super alarm clock.  On the smartphone, it will be possible to set the alarm time, which will turn on or off when the ring is brought to it. </li><li>  Quick start.  When the devices touch, the previously selected files or contacts will open on the mobile phone. </li></ol><h2>  Smart ring: reviews </h2><p>  You can talk about the usefulness or uselessness of the device for a long time, since each user treats him in his own way.  Most buyers, of course, believe that this gadget is pretty good and can come in handy in life.  They argue that with such an acquisition they no longer have to worry about whether they took a work permit or if it could cause problems. </p><p>  In addition, a lot of positive feedback has been received regarding the use of the ring in the form of a payment instrument by attaching a bank card to it.  According to customers, with this device you can forget about all the papers and plastic cards, because all the necessary information fits in one small device, which is quite comfortable to carry on your finger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart ring jakcom smart ring r3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2162904.jpg"></div>
