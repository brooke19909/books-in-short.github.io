  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Investment strategy of an enterprise as an investment management tool</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the effective tools for the long-term management of investment processes in the enterprise, in the conditions of implementation and development with significant changes in macroeconomic indicators, the conditions and uncertainty of the investment market, in the conditions of a system of state regulation of all market processes is the investment strategy of the enterprise. </p><p>  The investment strategy of the company (enterprise) is the developed system of goals related to investing activities for the long-term planning period, and is determined by the investment ideology and general development objectives, as well as finding effective mechanisms for achieving these goals. </p><p>  The investment strategy of the <span>enterprise is</span> a kind of master plan for the actions of the enterprise in the field of investment processes and activities.  It determines the priority areas and forms of this type of activity.  In addition, the financial and investment strategy forms the nature of investment resources, the stages and their sequence in the implementation of long-term tasks and goals, provides planned and thoughtful development (growth) of the enterprise.  When combining in this strategy a system of tasks and goals with ways to achieve them, this is the defining boundary of the proposed investment activity of the enterprise, as well as decisions in the directions and forms of investment activity for the long term. </p><p>  The investment strategy of the enterprise is one of the most important components of the enterprise selection system in a <span>strategic plan.</span>  The main elements of it are the general development goals in a strategic perspective, missions, a functional system of strategies for each type of activity, methods and methods of distribution and formation of resources. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The investment strategy of the company during development is determined by a number of conditions that are responsible for its relevance. </p><p>  1. The degree of intensity of changes in external factors in the investment environment.  This includes - the dynamics of the main indicators of macroeconomic factors that are associated with the activities of the enterprise and investment activity, technological progress and its growth rate, fluctuations in the investment market, the volatility of the <span>investment policy</span> by the state, as well as forms of regulation of such activities.  All this does not allow to use only previously accumulated experience in <span>investment management</span> , and based on traditional management methods.  Therefore, in the absence of an adapted investment strategy to external changes, this can lead to the fact that individual divisions of the company in their investment decisions can be multidirectional in nature, which ultimately leads to inconsistencies and inconsistencies and, as a result, a noticeable decrease in effective investment activity. </p><p>  2. The transition of the enterprise to new levels (stages) of activity.  The investment strategy of the enterprise, which is developed in advance, allows the adaptation of <span>investment activity</span> to changes in the capabilities of the enterprise in the course of economic development (growth). </p><p>  3. A radical change in the tasks and goals of <span>operational activities that</span> are associated with new business opportunities.  When implementing such tasks, a change and introduction of new technologies, a change in the range of goods and services for production, and the development of new markets for the sale of products are required.  Under such conditions, a significant increase in investment activity at the enterprise and diversification of investments should have a predictable nature, which is ensured by the development of a clear investment strategy. </p>
