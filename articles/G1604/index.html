  <section class="page js-page"><h1>June Third Monarchy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1907, on June 3, a new Law was adopted.  According to the Decree, representation from peasants was halved, from workers - by three, from the Caucasus and Poland - also by three times.  ‚ÄúForeigners‚Äù from the Trans-Ural regions, students, military personnel, women, youth under twenty-five years of age, and so on, were not entitled to suffrage.  The June 3 <span>political system</span> allowed only thirteen percent of the country's population to participate in the <span>election process</span> . </p><p>  Half of the members of the Council of State were appointed by the Emperor.  The autocrat possessed the right of legislative initiative, approving all laws before they enter into force. </p><p>  The June 3 monarchy assumed the Emperor‚Äôs right to dissolve or suspend the activities of the Duma.  The king completely controlled the <span>executive branch.</span>  The June Third Monarchy gave the Emperor the right to appoint members of the Council of Ministers, a body independent of parliament.  The government was under the direct supervision of the prime minister. </p><p>  The third monarchy of June assumed the exercise of <span>judicial power</span> on an imperial behalf.  The tsar appointed the highest organ of justice - the Senate.  The first instances (district and peasant <span>volost courts),</span> as well as the judicial chambers (second instances) were elected.  At the same time, judges were elected for life, and juries for a specific term in accordance with the property qualification. </p><p>  The Third Monarchy allowed the existence of laws formally ensuring the freedoms that were acquired during the revolution: the Temporary Provisions on Unions were functioning, censorship was abolished, and economic strikes were not prohibited.  But in reality the situation was the opposite.  The Third Monarchy - it was actually life according to the instructions.  Freedoms were very limited by circulars, by-laws of the government and others.  More than 75% of the territory of Russia had a decree on emergency protection. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Third Duma, elected under the new Law, right-wing nationalist groups, in general, received 32%, right-wing liberal-Octobrists - 30%, left-wingers - 7%, progressives and cadets - 21%.  In the absence of a solid majority, the Octobrists (as the largest faction) had the main influence on the voting process. </p><p>  Despite the current discriminatory Law, the Fourth Duma became more left than the Third.  Although at the same time the Trudoviks and the Social Democrats reduced their representation.  Progressists and cadets received 25%, the Octobrists, after receiving 22%, still retained a decisive role due to their political status. </p><p>  The government increasingly took advantage of the opportunity to pass legislative acts without Duma participation. </p><p>  In 1912-14, the social basis of the Third Monarchy declined quite significantly.  The opposition intensified, which gradually included all political movements, except for the Black Hundreds.  The ruling elite was unable to begin effective transformations.  There were a lot of problems in Russia.  However, the inconsistent tacking policy pursued by the government failed to resolve the main difficulties in the country. </p><p>  At the same time, the modernization of the state, the implementation of transformations to solve agricultural, labor and other issues was recognized by the government as necessary measures, without which other efforts aimed at "calming the country" were pointless.  Prime Minister Stolypin, being an ardent supporter of state power and understanding the need for reform, developed a plan according to which agrarian reform began in the country.  At the first stage of transformation in Russia, a certain upsurge of the peasantry was noted.  However, in the second stage of the reform, activity declined sharply. </p><p>  State policy pushed away the local nobility, which contributed in many ways to the fall of Stolypin.  On the other hand, the union with the right-wing liberals was destroyed.  All these factors provoked a new upsurge in the revolutionary movement. </p>
