And the largest tourist center in terms of area is considered to be the First World Hotel in Malaysia.

Its height is 356 m. This building has 75 floors, and on the roof there is a chic open-air pool with a restaurant and a relaxation area. </p><p>  By the way, the Gevora hotel became the world record holder, as this is the largest hotel in the world, only this year.  Prior to this, the palm belonged to his neighbor JW Marriott Marquis.  This hotel has a height of just one meter less and is <span>355 m.</span> It has 72 floors and no gorgeous pool. </p><p>  Recall that in Dubai there is also <span>the tallest building in the world, the</span> record of which is still undeniable - the Burj Khalifa tower (828 m). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iefimerida.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gevora Hotel" class="if uuid-2532200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2532200.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel description Gevora </h2><p>  The largest hotel in the world is located in the center of the capital of the United Arab Emirates.  It is easy to get to commercial and commercial areas from it.  For vacationers, 528 rooms of various types of comfort are provided here, from economy to deluxe with two spacious bedrooms, a jacuzzi and other amenities that are today mandatory for business travelers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel has everything to make the tourist feel comfortable.  It offers guests - 5 restaurants with different cuisines.  For example, the classic Gevora Kitchen offers traditional dishes and local specialties.  Level Twelve offers Mediterranean delights with notes of oriental flavor.  But the restaurant at the very top of the hotel - Highest View will delight you not only with delicious food, but also with breathtaking panoramas. </p><p>  So that tourists do not get bored and do not lose physical fitness, a fitness center is located on the 13th floor of the building.  It consists of: two gyms, a huge pool for adults and children, a hot tub. </p><p>  A business center is located on the same floor.  There are several rooms for meetings and conferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.popsugar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gevora hotel" class="if uuid-2532203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2532203.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Now, wondering what is the largest hotel in the world, you will know that this is Gevora in Dubai.  The hotel is very young, it was opened on February 12, and began to receive its first guests from March 8, 2018.  For this short period, the world-famous building managed to be visited by several tens of thousands of people.  Many who settled there have already left their comments. </p><p>  According to tourists, this is a good hotel with a high level of service.  Most importantly, the price meets the quality.  In addition, tourists have noticed such positive aspects: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  reasonable prices; </li><li>  Russian-speaking staff; </li><li>  online service management; </li><li>  excellent Internet access at high speed for free; </li><li>  high level of security. </li></ul><p>  The hotel has 6 elevators that accelerate to high speed.  Rise to a bird's-eye view in just 38 seconds.  So, when using lifts, buy ear plugs, otherwise they will lay ears from a sharp drop in heights. </p><h2>  City-sized hotel </h2><p>  The largest hotel in the world by area is the First World Hotel.  It is called the First World Hotel.  It is located in the mountains of Malaysia.  Just imagine, a huge giant has 6083 rooms.  And if you take into account that they settle here not one at a time, but two, three, four and more, then at least 25 thousand people have a rest here during the season, which is comparable to the population of a decent city in the outback of Russia.  It‚Äôs impossible to retire.  It takes several days to go around the whole territory, and to try all the entertainments, a month will be short. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cancelon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First World Hotel" class="if uuid-2532198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2532198.jpg"></div><p>  There are two ways to get to the hotel-city.  The first is along the serpentine mountain road by bus, the second is along the fastest cable car in Asia.  The second way takes only 15 minutes, and the first takes about an hour.  And while traveling by cable car, you can admire the breathtaking views of the Malaysian mountains. </p><p>  The hotel is made in such a way that everything you need is on site.  Shops, clothing boutiques, casinos, all kinds of entertainment and a huge amusement park, occupying 46.5 thousand square meters.  Everything is even difficult to list: a golf club, SPA, tennis court, <span>cinema, theater,</span> karaoke, several cafes, a dozen restaurants, a fitness center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oyster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Giant hotel in Malaysia" class="if uuid-2532195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2532195.jpg"></div><h2>  Everything you need for happiness </h2><p>  Modern hotels fight for the attention of tourists in every possible way.  Someone is building tall giants, someone is building a city in a city.  Both hotels, the Gevora in Dubai and the First World Hotel in Malaysia are listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the most outstanding buildings of mankind.  And if someday you will have the opportunity to visit them, you will understand that in their territory you can find everything you need for human happiness. </p>
