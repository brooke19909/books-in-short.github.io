  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make an origami airplane out of paper and a cardboard airplane using a slingshot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  And although today the shelves of children's stores are bursting with a wide variety of toys, do-it-yourself toys remain the most beloved for children.  Girls can spend hours sitting on clothes for their darlings, and for boys, of course, give tanks and airplanes. </p><p>  Probably everyone, even grandmothers, can teach the youngest member of the family how to make an <span>airplane out of paper</span> using the origami technique.  True, in the days of the youth of grandparents they did not have such a beautiful foreign name - origami.  Teaching how to make a <span>paper airplane out of paper</span> began in kindergarten.  It was the simplest model. </p><p>  Entire books with detailed instructions on how to make an airplane have already been written and published today.  Printed publications and online books contain more than 100 of the most diverse origami-made models, from airplanes from grandfather's childhood to airplanes and hang gliders made up of origami modules.  For example, a book by Jayson Merril will teach your child <span>how to make a plane of paper of</span> a model that even young and extremely advanced dads and mothers have not heard of. </p><p>  But still, how to make an airplane out of paper so that you can play with him in the room while mom is resting?  So that he does not make noise at the factory and when he flies, and could land directly on his mother, and she would not even wake up.  Want to teach you? </p><p>  Just take a regular copybook sheet and fold the top corners so that they close.  Now the right angle formed at the top must be lowered down.  The fold line should extend in the middle of the double fold. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We take the upper parts of the resulting part and connect them to each other so that no angle is formed from above - when the airplane is made with a blunt nose, its ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù increases significantly.  Although you can simply repeat the first action, folding the ends with each other in a straight line, so that a right angle forms at the very top of the part. </p><p>  The next step will be fixing the model so that it does not reveal.  The triangular tip, protruding from under the folded the last time the upper parts of the origami, it is necessary to bend up.  We fold the resulting figure in half so that the place of the model is fixed outside.  And the last step in the manufacture of the airplane is to bend down the wings.  Everything, the simplest model of an origami airplane is ready to launch! </p><p>  And also in the article we will tell you <span>how to make a plane out of cardboard</span> and twigs very, very fast, but one that will fly to a fairly high altitude using a slingshot.  For sure, almost all the boys in the world have slingshots.  So let's direct this ‚Äúhooligan device‚Äù into a useful channel! </p><p>  First you need to prepare the wings of the plane, cutting them out of cardboard.  It should be one part of a pentagonal shape.  To make it, you need to build a 5X20 cm rectangle, mark the middle on the long side from above.  Then set aside 1 cm in width from above and connect this point with the middle marked on the length.  Kryalya obtained with slightly angled to the ends of the corners. </p><p>  Then we make the second part - the tail wings.  In shape, they resemble large wings, but they are only made smaller, from a 3X12cm rectangle. </p><p>  The tail has another aileron - such as a vertical tail wing.  It should be identical in shape and size to the half of the horizontal tail piece.  This part should be done double, leaving the place of attachment free.  It is glued in the middle of the tail wing, spreading the free edges. </p><p>  Now we stick large wings in front of the ‚Äúairplane‚Äù on a 25 cm long rod, and, of course, equip the tail at the end of the twig.  On the very nose of the aircraft, a small shoe carnation must be driven into a twig so that it sticks out strictly down.  By inserting it into the elastic of the slingshot, pulling it and then letting go, we set our super-fast aircraft at such a speed that it, like a bird, soars up!  Where are the factory toys on batteries!  For ours - no batteries are needed !!! </p>
