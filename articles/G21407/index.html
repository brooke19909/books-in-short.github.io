    <p>  What is the most popular tourist attraction in Sochi?  For the answer we turn to the reviews of vacationers.  A simple analysis that we conducted on the Internet soon presented the result: 33 waterfalls are traditionally the most popular excursion site on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus. </p><p>  Sochi (reviews demonstrate this) is known not only for resort infrastructure, but also for its unique nature surrounding the city: mountain rivers and waterfalls, relict trees.  Here is a unique national park.  However, it is the excursion route to the waterfalls that is most demanded by numerous tourists.  One of the most vivid impressions of the local nature can be obtained precisely from the spectacle of a cascade of falling water. </p><p>  The waterfall has always attracted human attention.  It feels power and beauty.  It is remembered by an extraordinary sight - water falling from a height and shimmering in the sun.  And it is transparent, as it can only be in mountain rivers. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  For many vacationers on the North-West coast of the Caucasus, the question becomes urgent: "Where is the famous place called" 33 waterfalls "(Sochi)?"  His address: Lazarevsky district, the tract Dzhegosh. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the highway you can get to the village of Golovinka.  If you have your own off-road vehicle, then you can overcome the next 10 kilometers along a dirt road.  It runs along <span>the Shah River</span> towards the village of Big Kichmay.  By the way, in a certain place - ford - you can cross it by car. <strong> </strong></p>

    <p>  Due to the complexity of this route, even for first-time travelers, it‚Äôs advisable not to test the strength of their car‚Äôs chassis, and, leaving it in the parking lot, simply join the 33 Waterfalls excursion (Sochi).  How to get there, then it will not be a problem. </p><p>  The changeable serpentine road will delight you with a kaleidoscope of changing landscapes: sea, mountains, forest, mountain rivers, <span>tea plantations.</span>  While farming, the locals are picturesque terraces of mountain slopes.  Gardens and vineyards are pleasing to the eye.  However, quite an extreme road with crossing the river will make you hold on to the iron frame of the sightseeing UAZ.  On this Russian army-style SUV, you will be taken directly to the gorge, to the first waterfall in the cascade. </p><h2>  At the waterfalls </h2>

    <p>  33 waterfalls in Sochi (the photo of the lowest of them is presented in this article) is a few fascinating cascades of mountain clear, crystal-like water of the flowing Dzhegosh stream.  In addition to the waterfalls themselves, there are 13 rapids and 7 streams.  Translated from the <span>Adyghe name of the</span> tract Dzhegosh sounds like "a place of weddings and merrymaking."  The stream of the same name flowing in it has a length of about two kilometers with a water intake of 1.3 km <sup>2</sup> . </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, the scale of this water miracle is inferior to such giant waterfalls as Victoria or Niagara.  However, the cascade of Caucasian waterfalls can undoubtedly be called a miracle of nature.  Although their height does not exceed 12 meters, the beauty of this miracle of nature attracts people.  The lowest of the waterfalls is located at an altitude of 70 m above sea level, and the top is at an altitude of 200 m. In addition, these waterfalls are not so powerful as to be dangerous for tourists. </p><p>  Those who wish can swim here in natural bowls washed by falling streams.  Trout is found in the upper reaches of Jegosh.  Narrow long pedestrian bridges are equipped along this multi-stage water cascade.  However, the walking time is limited to one hour (the next excursion is next in line). </p><p>  Recommended clothing for visiting summer waterfalls: windbreaker.  Shoes are better sports.  Sunglasses will not be superfluous.  Those who wish to swim near the falling jets can also bring along, respectively, a towel, bathing or changing clothes. </p><h2>  Ethnomuseum </h2>

    <p>  Obviously, the secret of the lasting success of the 33 Waterfalls excursion lies precisely in the reverent attitude of the organizers towards the Adyghe culture.  Sochi is traditionally rich in hospitality and Caucasian cuisine.  To the credit of the organizers of the excursion object, the unique exterior of the cascade of waterfalls is perceived by tourists in the context of folk traditions. </p><p>  A successfully organized tasting of local natural, environmentally friendly honey, cheese, wine organically complements the memorable visual range.  Especially for this, several thematic stops will take place on your way to the unique water wonder of nature.  You yourself will feel how fresh and very humid mountain air pleasantly fills the lungs. </p><p>  Such substantial and pleasant stops organically complemented by the excursion "33 waterfalls" (Sochi).  The camera is never superfluous.  At the beginning of the journey you will be greeted by a wine courtyard at a private ethnomuseum in the village of Bolshoi Kichmay. </p><h2>  Adyghe wines </h2><p>  Local wines are special, they have a long history.  These drinks are made from the local grapes used in the wine industry, including the famous varieties Santah and Napi Kichmay. </p><p>  Varieties of Adygea wines are known to their true connoisseurs.  White wines "Osaps" and "Good", red "Janet" and "Pyne" - the decoration of any gourmet collection.  However, in these parts, every self-respecting owner of a private house has his own vineyard and produces his own unique home-made wine.  Often, it causes enthusiasm among specialists.  Tourists have the opportunity to buy it in the aul wine yard.  Many people buy several one and a half liter bottles of sparkling live drink. </p><h2>  Adyghe cheese </h2>

    <p>  Next you will have a ‚Äúcheese‚Äù mini-tour.  Adygea cheese - Matekuae - worth it!  It tastes amazingly soft and delicate.  It is popular both in Russia and in the world.  However, the local chefs obviously know family secrets and the traditional technology of its production.  The story about the methods of its preparation and the subsequent tasting are also a memorable moment in the tour. </p><p>  A real ethno-reserve appears before tourists as the valley of 33 waterfalls (Sochi).  Reviews of tourists who visited it are numerous and enthusiastic. </p><h2>  Apiary </h2><p>  Adyghe honey from chestnut and acacia is famous throughout Russia.  Those who want to get acquainted with the Sochi waterfalls will also have to visit a special apiary, the bees which do not sting.  Adygea is traditionally a Russian scientific training ground for the development of beekeeping.  Gray Caucasian bees are considered one of the calmest in the world (of course, if you follow the recommendations of local professionals). </p><h2>  Trout lake </h2><p>  On the way to the waterfalls is a trout fish farm.  Numerous local cafes offer tourists Caucasian cuisine, as well as delicious trout dishes.  This fish, which prefers crystal clear water, has a delicate taste.  In addition, it is the Caucasian trout that is rightfully considered the most delicious. </p><h2>  Legend </h2>

    <p>  33 waterfalls is a special place, symbolic for the indigenous people - Adygei-Shapsugs - living in Sochi and Tuapse district and having their own history of statehood.  They were peasants and warriors, rather successful opponents of the raids of the Crimean Tatars in the Caucasus, and during the hundred-year war they were reliable allies of Shamil. </p><p>  And also the <span>Black Sea coast of the Caucasus</span> - the land of legends.  one of them tells how 33 waterfalls were created.  Sochi as a city has not yet been.  The Shapsug auls located here became the object of the attack of the evil giant.  The people began to call the most worthy warriors to overthrow the adversary.  When the best of the best cast lots, he fell on the blacksmith Guch, famous for his cunning.  With his help, he defeated the giant.  He fell into a sweet trap: a blacksmith placed barrels of honey on his way.  Giant-sweet did not resist and tasted goodies.  However, he was waiting for reckoning in the form of a cloud of bees, which forced the giant to retire to his refuge on the top of the mountain.  And here, weakened by a bee attack, Guch awaited him with his reliable smashing sword.  According to legend, the giant managed to take 33 steps, and where his feet touched the ground, 33 waterfalls arose. </p><p>  In fact, the picturesque cascade of Sochi waterfalls found in the tract Dzhegosh (where, according to legend, the giant lived) in the ice period.  As evidence of these conjectures, a grove of an iron tree, boxwood, common right up to the ice age, grows nearby, near Mafape Falls. </p><h2>  End of excursion </h2>
