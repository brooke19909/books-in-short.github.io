It was he who approved the term "police" in 1718.  Over the 300 years of its development, this state body has changed significantly.  At the beginning of the 20th century, he already had a streamlined mechanism for maintaining public order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The development of the Russian police the main stages" class="if uuid-3012415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012415.jpg"></div><h2>  As it was in Ancient Russia </h2><p>  Until the 18th century, the country did not have a regular police authority.  To understand how the Russian police were created, one must turn to the time when, in her place, this activity was called "deanery." </p><p>  The term "police" itself appeared in ancient Greece.  It was a regular paramilitary authority that was responsible for maintaining public order. </p><p>  In Old Russian statehood, the landowners, governors, courtiers, swordsmen and so on performed the same function.  In fact, the creation of princely squads can be considered the first of the main stages in the development of the Russian police.  When the state began, community members helped them. </p><p>  Then the law enforcement function gradually passed into the hands of the governors.  They had a whole staff of employees.  The trial was carried out by tyunami, and closers called parties to the dispute.  Rulers were responsible for enforcing court decisions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Collection &quot;Russian Truth&quot;" class="if uuid-3012403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012403.jpg"></div><h2>  Criminal Code </h2><p>  In fact, the first Russian Criminal Code is a collection of laws, Russian Truth, written in the 11th century.  In this case, it was not a violation of laws and princely decisions, but an offense that the offender inflicted on anyone.  At the dawn of the history of the police in Russia, the most important concepts were identified that became part of today's jurisprudence. </p><p>  For example, it was the collection "Russian Truth" that began to consider an attempt on a crime.  This could be considered a bare sword.  In addition, crimes committed by a group of persons were sued separately.  The collection contained the concept of the necessary defense, its borders were examined.  So, it was illegal to kill a thief when the danger of his actions had already disappeared.  Mitigating and aggravating circumstances were present. </p><p>  In general, the first legislation was simple.  The one who injured someone was subjected to the same procedure, for example, chopped off hand by hand and so on.  The capital punishment, according to Russian Truth, is the confiscation of property and the transfer of the entire criminal family to slavery.  Such punishment was intended for robbery, arson, horse-stealing.  Also, the perpetrator could be killed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In those days, the history of the Russian police was in its infancy, so some laws were imperfect.  For example, if the offender was hiding, then the victims themselves wanted him. </p><p>  But already in 1497, in the new Code of Law, the crime was not a ‚Äúgrudge‚Äù, namely, actions harmful to the state.  Then the formation and development of the Russian police began - a guard appeared on the Moscow streets.  She kept order. </p><p>  Already by the middle of the 16th century the Robbery had opened.  It was he who fought crime in the Russian state.  From here detectives were sent to the crime scene. </p><h2>  History of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia </h2><p>  From the very beginning, the <span>Ministry of Internal Affairs of the</span> Russian Federation dealt with the most important issues of the state.  Under his leadership, the Russian police also acted.  At the moment, her story goes back 300 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian police" class="if uuid-3012402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012402.jpg"></div><p>  The system included non-commissioned officers who oversaw the streets.  They were located in corners and at intersections.  And from adjacent posts, these service people heard each other.  They did not allow to arrange a booth, helped the sick. </p><h2>  About hiring </h2><p>  From the very beginning of the history of the Russian police, anyone who wanted to serve in its ranks should have possessed a handsome appearance, strong physique.  There was also a demand for growth - not lower than 171 cm. Persons under 25 years of age were not accepted for service.  The immaculate behavior of the candidates was important.  They were pre-trained for 2 to 4 weeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  These city officers subsequently went to the service for 8 hours a day.  Among their main duties was the daily report to higher officials about everything that was noticed during the day, about all the rumors heard.  Law enforcement officers strictly monitored to ensure that trade was carried out in designated places.  They made sure that food stalls were clean when it came to essential goods. </p><p>  He supervised the provincial police chief.  In 1866, a new stage began in the history of the Russian police - division into sections was introduced.  At the head of each of them put a bailiff.  The plots were divided into halves.  They were in charge of <span>near-warders.</span> </p><h2>  The appearance of the police </h2><p>  The lower ranks of the police were considered urban.  They had black overcoats, buttons with a double-headed eagle.  Each was destined for a personal weapon.  It was stored in a black holster, which was attached to the belt.  It looked like every ordinary employee of the imperial police. </p><h2>  Gendarmes </h2><p>  Another stage in the history of the Russian police are gendarme regiments.  They were introduced by Paul I. They controlled the situation in the country, were engaged in the search.  These were territorial security agencies.  For the most part, they investigated political cases. </p><h2>  Stages of development </h2><p>  The history of the police is most clearly demonstrated by the consideration of the changes in this structure, presented over the centuries.  Small adjustments to the already existing system were made by each ruler of the country. </p><h2>  16th century </h2><p>  In Moscow at that time, the so-called slingshots were installed, in which there was a guard.  It was supported by the local population.  The whole city was divided into separate areas that delimited the gates.  It was forbidden to walk the streets at night without light.  Ivan Vasilyevich approved travels around the capital in order to maintain order. </p><p>  Cases for the search for criminals in those years were labial elders.  Until that moment, letters of mouth were issued to the population at their request.  Such documents made it possible to carry out lip cases on their own. </p><p>  In fact, city policemen were city officials.  For some time, the affairs of crime, knew the boyars.  But it turned out to be ineffective.  Then a robbery order was introduced. </p><h2>  17th century </h2><p>  During this period, the affairs that were in charge of the Robbery order were given to <span>Zemsky orders.</span>  There were units that monitored fire and public safety.  They were armed with slings, axes, water pipes.  The employees wore red-green clothes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Under Peter" class="if uuid-3012406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012406.jpg"></div><h2>  18 century </h2><p>  Peter I established the Main Police Authority.  Initially, 4 officers worked here, 36 lower ranks.  This body performed supervision functions in the city.  In addition, it was his representatives who were responsible for paving the streets, draining the marshes, and garbage collection. </p><p>  In 1718, Devier became general police chief.  He began to command one army regiment, as well as the police chancellery.  Thanks to him, lights and benches were installed in St. Petersburg.  The fire safety service was also organized. </p><p>  In 1722, the position of Chief Police Officer appeared in Moscow.  He was responsible for public order in Moscow. </p><p>  And under Anna Ioannovna, the police also became a court.  She herself was involved in sentencing in criminal cases. </p><h2>  19th century </h2><p>  At this time, the zemsky district police officer began to perform the functions of the police head.  He was chosen by the nobles.  The mayors were abolished.  Police departments appeared. </p><p>  For the first time in Russian history, special divisions for solving crimes and inquiries appeared in St. Petersburg.  Here in 1866, the detective police was introduced. </p><p>  Later, the same structure began to be applied in Moscow and other cities.  There was a criminal investigation service.  Already in 1907, there was one in many of the largest Russian cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The history of police in Russia" class="if uuid-3012404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012404.jpg"></div><h2>  20th century </h2><p>  Since 1903, the county police guard began to spread.  Thanks to the reforms of Stolypin, special courses were introduced for the chiefs of investigation.  Even in Switzerland, the Russian investigation was recognized as the best in the world in 1913. </p><p>  However, the February Revolution thundered, and <span>the Police Department was</span> abolished.  This procedure was one of the main tasks proclaimed by V.I.  Lenin. </p><p>  Instead, a popular militia was introduced.  In addition, organized and working militia.  These structures acted under the leadership of a political force, and sometimes without it.  The working police was not connected with the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia" class="if uuid-3012400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012400.jpg"></div><p>  Soon, conflicts began between the people's and city police.  The destruction of this important state structure has been outlined.  The NKVD began to issue resolutions to resolve this issue.  The workers' militia, in fact, was an amateur organization based on voluntary squads.  She could not fight crime.  In 1918, the NKVD recognized the police as a separate state of persons who performed special duties.  He acted independently of the army. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The formation and development of the Russian police" class="if uuid-3012405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3012405.jpg"></div><p>  At the moment, the police are part of the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.  Its tasks are proclaimed by the Constitution and the Federal Law "On Police", as well as the Regulation "On Service in Internal Affairs Bodies".  There are other documents regulating its activities. </p>
