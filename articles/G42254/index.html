Rest, prices, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bulgaria in September is a surprisingly wonderful place to stay.  At the very beginning of autumn, a real velvet season opens here, which pleases travelers with warm air and sea, minimal rainfall, a warm and light breeze and, most importantly, the absence of fuss and a large concentration of tourists.  An important plus is also that you can buy a ticket for this period for very little money.  Well, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what exactly Bulgaria is pleased with for its guests in September, and what all those who wish to relax there should prepare for. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  It is definitely impossible to say exactly what air temperature will be waiting for you in this sunny country.  It all depends on the resort you choose, as well as on the vagaries of nature, which every year surprises us with something new.  On average, the weather in Bulgaria in September is very warm and pleasant.  The air warms up to + 25-28 degrees, the Black Sea will delight with the waves heated to +23 Celsius.  Rains happen extremely rarely, but, again, it all depends on which city you are staying in.  In general, it can be noted that this country is the ideal option for families with children during the beginning of autumn.  There are few tourists, prices are falling, and the summer atmosphere remains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria in September" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483922.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the first group are the most famous tourist centers of the country - Varna, Albena, Golden Sands.  Despite the fact that the cities are located in the north of the country, there is still quite warm in early autumn.  The sea warms up to +21 degrees, and the air - up to +25.  However, some minuses are considered by the health resort to insignificant winds, because of which the sea begins to slightly worry.  As for the southern resort city of Burgas, as well as all its environs, then vacationers note much warmer weather.  The air temperature in the daytime can reach +30 degrees, and the sea is warm, like in summer, + 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in bulgaria in september" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When does Bulgaria ‚Äúcool down‚Äù? </h2><p>  Going on vacation to sunny Bulgaria in early autumn, it is important to know that in summer it is warm here, alas, only in the afternoon.  At night, local thermometers drop to +14 degrees, and sometimes even lower, and quite often a very cool sea breeze rises.  Therefore, you have to take a lot of warm things with you so that evening walks do not cause a cold, especially if you come here with the kids.  Also note that the September weather daily lowers its degree.  During the week of rest, you will not feel anything, of course, but if you compare the temperature indicators of the beginning of the month and its end, the difference is very significant.  Even in the south of the country by mid-autumn it becomes quite cool, windy and damp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria in September" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483924.jpg" width="500"></div>

How does this affect the weather? </h2><p>  <span>Holidays in Bulgaria</span> in September can also be remembered for you by dense and prolonged fogs.  In particular, this applies to those tourists who have chosen resort areas located close to the local mountains.  Among these cities can be called Nessebar, Sozopol and others located next to them.  If a cloudy day is foreseen, then the nebula can be quite dense until lunchtime.  On sunny days, of course, everything quickly dissipates, and the weather again becomes warm and summer.  We also note that many Russian tourists, going on vacation to Bulgaria, rent a car there and travel around the country on their own.  Therefore, we do not forget that in the mountains it is always more cloudy, cold and foggy.  You should be careful on the roads, do not forget to also dress warmer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bulgaria september prices" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483925.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Autumn activities </h2><p>  According to tourists, Bulgaria in September pleases not only with the warm sun and sea, but also with the abundance of various festivals that begin in August and end in the first <span>autumn month.</span>  For example, in Varna, the Golden Rose Film Festival is approaching its logical and very enchanting end.  Various films staged by European directors, as well as film figures from Asia and Africa, take part in this show.  The city of Plovdiv is the venue for theatrical and puppet international festivals.  Events are rather non-standard, because those who visited them assure that they expand their cultural horizons and bring a lot of new impressions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour to bulgaria in september" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483926.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  The brightest days in Bulgaria </h2><p>  Few people know that a tour to Bulgaria in September is a real find for fans of bright shows, fun and holidays.  This month, in the local town called Sozopol, the country's largest festival and exhibition takes place.  Here you can see absolutely everything related to art.  Dance groups and folk choirs show us their honed mastery.  Artists auction their unique works in various styles.  The musicians, in turn, collect whole houses from the pianos and violins, giving everyone an opportunity to listen to a virtuoso game for free.  In September Bulgaria also celebrates the main day of the city - Day of Sofia, its capital.  A stunning show is held here, with fireworks and lighting effects.  You can get there absolutely free, and get a lot of pleasure. </p><h2>  Bulgaria, September: prices </h2><p>  In addition to the sunny weather that persists in the region at the beginning of autumn, Russian travelers are also attracted by very low prices for tours.  For example, a ticket for two adults lasting 7 days will cost you 20-25 thousand rubles.  If it works out, you can buy a burning tour, which will become even more profitable for you.  However, when booking a ticket, it should be remembered that in this country there are a lot of the most diverse hotels.  Think in advance which service will completely suit you, discuss all the details with the administrator.  And, of course, prices are falling for many local services.  Food, rides, and even goods that are sold in the country's stores are much cheaper than in the summer.  In local shopping centers you can buy clothes and shoes at big discounts, in the markets you can choose something with national symbols or antiques at a very affordable price. </p>
