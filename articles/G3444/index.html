The jewelry made at home will be significantly different from the store, and for the better.  You will definitely be sure of the quality of the material and the observance of production technology.  And also, accessories that you made yourself will cheer you up.  Look for ideas for making unique jewelry below. </p><h2>  Feather earrings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="diypick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="feather earrings" class="if uuid-2433256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433256.jpg"></div><p>  Such universal jewelry can complement any outfit.  The leather texture and discreet shades can transform both a business look and an evening bow.  How to make jewelry with your own hands?  Take three small pieces of skin.  You can use both natural material and artificial.  Choose shades so that they blend well with each other.  The ideal option is a color stretch from dark to light.  Now draw a pattern of two feathers.  One of them should be large, and the other a little smaller.  Cut a feather from dark leather over a large pattern.  With the help of scissors you need to make a fringe around the edges.  A small pattern needs to be cut in half.  From two unused skin colors, it is necessary to cut the right and left sides.  We make cuts with scissors, slightly not reaching the middle.  And now you can decorate half of the feather with a light brown hue with white dots.  We make holes in the upper part of all the blanks and collect the earring on the earpiece.  We make another earring in the same way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brooch list </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pionik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brooch sheet" class="if uuid-2433272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433272.jpg"></div><p>  Do you like to make jewelry from beads with your own hands?  Then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis brooch should suit your taste.  The shape of the product is simple and concise, which means that this jewelry is perfect for any outfit.  The color scheme, sustained in pastel shades, is a trend.  A DIY jewelry master class picture is attached above.  You need to make the product according to the following scheme.  Cut the blank from white felt.  Use gold beads to create a medium vein.  Now, alternating white and gold circles, form rows in one of the parts of the sheet.  On the other side, glue a large stone, and then trim it with gold beads.  It remains in a chaotic manner to sew large beads.  The leg of the sheet can be decorated with rhinestones.  Using this technology, you can make other jewelry from beads with your own hands. </p><h2>  Leather necklace </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather necklace" class="if uuid-2433283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433283.jpg"></div><p>  Leather jewelry today is at the peak of popularity.  Moreover, any fashionista can create such jewelry with her own hands.  It is necessary to use not natural, but artificial material.  It is advisable to choose a skin of saturated dark shades: burgundy, emerald, sapphire or brown.  We will make a necklace from this material.  First you need to cut two triangles.  One big, the other small.  Turn the large workpiece inside out and attach to a small part.  The backing of the necklace should be matte, and the upper part should be glossy.  Now truncate the triangles along the edges and form a neckline cutout in the upper part.  We sew the blanks, focusing on the attached picture.  From the lower triangle you need to create a fringe.  On two sides of the upper part we sew leather laces.  You can decorate the necklace with a bead pendant attached to the central part of the product. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lace pendant </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lace pendant" class="if uuid-2433299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433299.jpg"></div><p>  What is most valued in jewelry?  The original idea.  DIY needlework can be created by any needlewoman if she manages to find a good idea.  This decoration option gives a lot of options for creativity.  In fact, such a pendant is a string on which beads are strung.  Such jewelry is very popular today.  And most interestingly, it is difficult to meet two girls who tied the suspension the same way.  How to make a similar product with your own hands?  Jewelry for beginner needlewomen may seem incredibly tricky, but there is nothing complicated here.  Take leather lace and beads.  Fold the lace in half.  Put three beads on two free ends, fixing them in place with knots.  On the second part of the leather lace you need to put on one bead, fix it in place and tie a knot at a small ring.  Pulling the ends of the pendant through the loop, you can fix the product on the neck each time in a new way. </p><h2>  Polymer clay beads </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.artfulhome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polymer clay beads" class="if uuid-2433304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433304.jpg"></div><p>  This product of others may surprise with an original idea.  DIY jewelry will be created from polymer clay.  Before you begin, you need to knead the material well in your hands.  Now take a black piece of polymer clay and roll it into a uniform layer.  Using a special shape or a glass, you need to cut circles.  One of them should be large, while the others should be reduced.  When the circles are ready, you need to deform them a little, giving the workpieces volume.  Roll balls from red plastic.  Flatten them in your fingers and attach the finished circles to the black blanks.  The red elements in the assembled beads will have to create a wave, so keep this in mind when you assemble the blanks as a whole.  We attach an iron ring to each element, and then bake the blanks in the oven.  Put the finished circles on the leather thread in the desired sequence and attach a small clasp to the rope. </p><h2>  Wire ring </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire ring" class="if uuid-2433320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433320.jpg"></div><p>  There are a great many techniques for <span>making jewelry with your own hands</span> .  You can master one of them, which is called scan.  Similarly, jewelers create their products from precious metals.  You can put your first experience on the wire.  Make a decoration.  DIY jewelry is created using nippers and pliers.  Take the wire and use any cylindrical shape to round it.  Now bend one of the ends and run it in the opposite direction.  At the back of the ring, this tail of the wire should rise and take the form of a spiral.  And the lower end of the wire should immediately go down without any excesses.  You can experiment and give the wire any shape.  You can complement such a ring with beads as well as natural stones. </p><h2>  Leather and wood pendant </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual pendant" class="if uuid-2433324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433324.jpg"></div><p>  How to make an unusual <span>decoration with your own hands?</span>  <span>Jewelry</span> may be different.  For example, this option successfully combines natural materials with artificial ones.  To make such a necklace you will need to find a beautiful dry tree branch.  Moreover, you need to take a fairly thick billet, having cleared that from the bark, you will get a branch 1 cm thick. After the billet dries, it needs to be varnished.  So, the tree will better retain its appearance and will not begin to grow moldy.  On the sides of the branches you need to make holes.  Insert a leather lace into them and fasten it with knots.  Cut the lace in half and insert the clasp into its middle.  Under a wooden element, you need to tie a short element of the same material to each leather rope.  As a result, three ropes will hang on each side of the branch.  We attach metal and plastic fittings to them. </p><h2>  A bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chain bracelet" class="if uuid-2433350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433350.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a DIY jewelry bracelet?  The master class of this jewelry is given above.  Creating a stylish accessory will be easy.  You will need a chain and a thick elastic band for hair.  It is advisable to take a colored blank.  But if you are a fan of the classics, you can opt for white, black or milk color.  DIY jewelry is made as follows.  Measure the size of the chain on the arm.  Now, with the help of pliers, unfasten the extreme links.  Thread the gum into the link and close it with the pliers.  If you didn‚Äôt have an elastic at hand, you can replace it with a thick tourniquet.  Based on this workshop, you can experiment.  For example, combine two chains of different sizes, attach a tape or an elastic band to them.  And you can add a similar bracelet with pendants.  On each link of the chain you need to fix a <span>metal bead.</span>  Such accessories should resemble the charm popular today.  If you have such decorative elements, you can decorate the accessory with them. </p>
