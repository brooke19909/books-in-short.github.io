    <p>  Of course, going to spend a vacation in Bali, tourists hope to have fun on the seashore.  What should you count on when settling in the Bali Bungalow 3 * hotel complex?  Kuta is famous for its coast.  The distance to it is no more than 100 meters, so you can take walks by the sea at any convenient time. </p><p>  This is a public beach where a huge number of tourists rest, regardless of the time of year, because the weather here is beautiful even in January.  In the reviews, travelers note that the coastline here is wide, clean and very beautiful - under your feet you will only have soft, fine sand.  For a small amount, you can rent a deck chair or umbrella.  Mostly young people are resting here, so there are lots of cafes and bars on the shore where you can even have lunch.  Beach towels can be requested at Bali Bungalow's reception. </p><p>  The sea here is very clean, and the water is always warm.  From time to time, small waves rise.  Depth increases gradually, so kids often play near the shore.  The shore is regularly cleaned from algae and garbage, and there is always a rescue team here, so you can feel safe. </p><h2>  Water sports and entertainment </h2><p>  On the beach, tourists enjoy relaxing and sunbathing.  But this is not the only occupation.  There is always the opportunity to ride on sea transport.  For example, many travelers get a lot of pleasure from sea skiing, trips on speed boats and more romantic pastime on a yacht. </p><p>  The underwater world is magnificent, because it is the result of volcanic activity.  Therefore, it is worth taking a swimming mask with you, because pure water allows you to see all the charms of the seabed and rich, bright flora.  More adventurous tourists can try diving.  In the water sports center you can not only rent a suit, but also take a quick training course and get an international certificate. </p><p>  The beach has spacious sports fields where you can play volleyball or even football on the soft sand.  Since there are always a lot of young people, various performances and even parties are regularly organized for tourists.  Neither sports enthusiasts nor fans of noisy entertainment have to be bored here. </p><h2>  Description of the service on site </h2>

    <p>  Bali Bungalow Hotel is a modest three-star hotel.  Nevertheless, the rooms are quite suitable for living, and on the territory itself there are some additional amenities.

Of course, you must not forget to close the windows and doors to the balcony, as this is a tropical island with lots of living creatures. </p><p>  They clean it well, maids really come daily, bringing towels and water.  Linen on the bed is changed quite often.  As for breakfast, some guests complain about the monotony.  On the other hand, this is a problem for all hotels.  The main thing is that the food here is fresh and tasty, so you can eat in the morning. </p><p>  The area is quite lively, so at your fingertips you will have everything you need, from shops, cafes and massage parlors to famous rock bars and a very peculiar art market.  By the way, tourists recommend renting a moped or at least a bicycle for the duration of your stay.  There are many attractions in the vicinity of Kuta, and the availability of our own transport allows you to explore all of them. </p><p>  An undoubted advantage is the proximity to the sea and the affordable price of the room.  The service here is on a level - all employees understand English, behave very politely and attentively, help tourists feel welcome here.  Former guests recommend the hotel to those people who plan a busy beach holiday on one of the most beautiful and popular islands in the world. </p>
