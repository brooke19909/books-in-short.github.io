    <p>  Furniture, plumbing - everything is new and works without problems.  From the balconies a wonderful view of the sea opens.  The food is also good, however, apart from beer, many did not like anything else from local drinks.  Delicious ice cream is served daily on the ground floor of the main building, where you can also get free pita bread with french fries and feta cheese wrapped in it. </p><p>  Opinions vary about the beach: some say it is good, others complain about the garbage scattered everywhere. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the work of the staff: the rooms are cleaned carefully.  Another drawback is the weak, according to some Russians, animation, and even then it is almost always in German. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that about eighty percent of our compatriots were satisfied with their choice and intend to return to Gumuldur Resort Hotel 4 * more than once. </p>
