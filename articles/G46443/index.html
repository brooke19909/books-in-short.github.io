Collectors name different reasons for their craving for old coins: this is their historical value, and nostalgia for the past, and children's dreams of mysterious treasures.  Such people are especially interested in antique coins, because they store images not only of rulers, but of entire eras, grandiose events, and their diversity is amazing. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  For the first time, coins began to be made in the Middle Kingdom and India at the beginning of the 12th century.  BC  e.  But the circulation of this banknote did not go beyond these countries.  Much later, the Greeks began <span>to mint coins</span> of silver.  And it was they who became the used medium of exchange and sale, having first got to the Middle East, and from there spreading to neighboring countries. </p><p>  This <span>monetary system</span> persisted further.  <span>Coins of the Roman</span> Empire replaced the Greek, which served as a model for their creation.  In its heyday, Ancient Rome was an example of the highest civilization.  With its disintegration of people, regression awaited, since many achievements were forgotten for centuries.  For a long period, the coins of the ancient Romans acted as the standard <span>element of the monetary system</span> in Europe and Asia, like their predecessors made by the Greeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Antique coins </h2><p>  In a narrow sense, this category includes only banknotes of ancient Rome.  However, in reality this is not so.  It includes coins of all ancient peoples, including Persian, Israeli (Jewish) and Byzantine.  Banknotes of the ancient period were minted from precious metals: bronze, brass, silver and gold.  The material depended on the value of the coin, since it was he who determined its value.  This rule has been observed at all times and exists to this day.  Ancient Roman coins were decorated with the seals of the reigning monarch.  It was a guarantee of weight, fixing its value.  Antique coins are extremely diverse, as new banknotes were issued with each subsequent change of ruler. </p><h2>  Bronze and brass coins </h2><p>  In the monetary system of ancient Rome, an important role was played by such metals as bronze and brass (obsolete. Aurichalk).  It was from them that the banknotes were minted.  The first coin was made of bronze.  Her weight at that time was measured in ounces.  It was copper ass, the mass of which was as much as 12 ounces (340 g).  There were coins of lesser value: </p><ul><li>  Semis - 170 gr. </li><li>  Triens - 113 gr. </li><li>  Quadrans - 85 gr. </li><li>  Sextans - 56 gr. </li><li>  An ounce and an ounce fraction, weighed according to the name. </li></ul><p>  Then came the metal aurihalk (brass) - more expensive than bronze, an alloy of copper and zinc.  Ancient Roman coins were minted from it, such as the Sestercia (27.28 g.), Dupondium (13.64 g.) And Ass (54.59 g.). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Gold and silver </h2><p>  Denarius, Victorians, Quinaria and Sesteria were minted from silver.  The largest of them at face value (denarius) weighed about 5 g, and the smallest - a little more than one gram.  As a result of reforms in 217 BC.  e.  their mass decreased.  Aureuses were created from gold, and after the reform of Constantine I, solids, semis and trienses came into use (names are arranged in descending order of denomination). </p><p>  Today it is considered that the basic unit in ancient coin systems was either stater or drachma.  Thus, within the framework of the Aegin system, silver staters (12-14.5 g) and drachmas were minted (such an ancient Roman <span>silver coin</span> weighed as much as half a stater), and gold in the Miletian, Phocian, and Persian.  It should be noted that banknotes made of brass or copper were also counted using these units.  This custom was especially widespread during the time of Alexander the Great. </p>

    <h2>  About fakes </h2><p>  There are two types of crafts.  Some were created by counterfeiters of that time, while others are modern copies.  In this section, we will discuss the latter, since only they lose in value today.  There are several methods suitable for self-checking: </p><ol><li>  To identify a low-quality fake, it is enough to look at the photo in the catalog.  Now fake ancient Roman coins are made for tourists and ordinary people who don‚Äôt know anything about numismatics.  Therefore, the similarity with the originals is quite insignificant. </li><li>  By comparing the data in the directory, you can weigh and measure the coin.  If the indicators are not written to the indicated values, the conclusion is obvious. </li><li>  In ancient Rome, coins were not cast, but minted.  Therefore, money made with modern equipment can always be distinguished. </li><li>  If the coin has a detachment of particles on the surface - it is genuine.  It is impossible to fake this effect.  It is caused by internal corrosion of impurities. </li><li>  The presence of the stamp also speaks in favor of the item being verified. </li><li>  Ancient Roman coins can be checked with a microscope.  With a strong increase, surface corrosion characteristic of ligatures of that time will be visible. </li><li>  Comparison with the original is the best method to compare the print and its smallest details. </li><li>  <span>Spectral analysis</span> will help determine the sample and composition of the ligature.  If the results of the analysis of the doubtful instance and the authentic are the same, then we can conclude that the coins belong to the same time. </li></ol><p>  Of course, an ignorant person is unlikely to be able to distinguish a fake.  And in this case, the best solution would be to turn to an experienced numismatist. </p>
