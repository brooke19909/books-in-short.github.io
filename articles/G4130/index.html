    <p>  Even employees of the tourist industry prefer this particular complex.  The reason for this is its undeniable advantages over all other Rhodes hotels.  The first thing that attracts attention is the relatively inexpensive price for such a wide range of services.

Especially this place will suit those who like to relax with children.  For little guests there is everything in the best possible way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Post Comments </h2><p>  The reception welcomes friendly staff.  Try to please customers with all their might.  Among the employees there are Russian-speaking administrators. </p><p>  The hotel occupies a vast territory and consists of two parts - Miraluna and Kiotary.  The first complex has a category of 5 stars, the second - 4. Here everything is buried in tropical greenery.  But there are minor flaws.  There are a lot of hidden niches on the territory that are easy to fall into, especially for children.  Wheelchairs are not very convenient due to the large number of stairs.  But there are no complaints about cleanliness.  Trash cans are at every turn. </p><p>  The complexes have different positions with respect to the sea.  Miraluna occupies the upper tier and looks more impressive.  The territory has 3 large outdoor pools for adults and 3 for children.  In the spa area is another pool.  Water is chlorinated only in children's waters, the rest is treated without bleach. </p><p>  In the lower tier of the Miraluna Kiotari Seaside 4 * complex there are excellent children's aquazones with an interesting design. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2>
