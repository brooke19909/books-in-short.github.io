The same can be said about Thailand.  Interesting facts about tourism amaze visitors.  Consider the main ones: </p><ul><li>  The country does not speak elevated tones.  This is considered bad form. </li><li>  In Thailand, it is not customary to walk.  They drive in tuk-tuk, motobike, taxi or rent a car for a while. </li><li>  From Thailand, it is forbidden to export figurines or crafts with the image of Buddha. </li><li>  The tourist season begins in late October and ends in February.  The coldest day when the country is + 28 degrees. </li><li>  Before entering the temple, you must take off your shoes, so you show respect for local traditions. </li><li>  You can export a maximum of 50,000 baht from the country. </li><li>  A visa can be obtained in Bangkok on the day of arrival. </li><li>  The country has left-hand traffic.  This must not be forgotten. </li><li>  Most stores open at 10:00, and close at 20:00. </li><li>  In restaurants you need to leave tips, which make up 10% of the check. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bowiechick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting facts about Thailand for tourists" class="if uuid-2618021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/2618021.jpg"></div><p>  Many facts really surprise tourists.  You will not have time to get used to the customs and traditions of the country, and your vacation is already over. </p><h2>  About the holidays </h2><p>  Locals call their country "State of smiles."  Indeed, they are not far from the truth.  Indeed, in Thailand almost every day there is some kind of holiday.  As the saying goes: "There would be a reason to have fun." </p><p>  So, interesting facts about the holidays: </p><ul><li>  as a rule, many holidays are not tied to specific dates; </li><li>  for local residents, a holiday is an important part of life and it is a sin not to mark it; </li><li>  Thais celebrate New Year 3 times - European, local and lunar calendar (January 1, April 13 and February 16); </li><li>  locals celebrate Thai elephant day;  it is believed that the country on the map in appearance is very similar to this animal; </li><li>  in Thailand they like to walk on October 8th at a festival dedicated to vegetarians;  people subject themselves to various tortures - they walk barefoot on hot coals, do piercings on delicate parts of the body, etc.  it is believed that in this way the gods will forgive them all sins in advance, because they have inflicted injury on themselves for the sake of the future. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="newyearsevelivestream.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand interesting facts for children" class="if uuid-2618024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/2618024.jpg"></div><p>  Thailand is the only country in the East in which local residents are able today to drink and have fun from the heart, and tomorrow, as if nothing had happened to go to work. </p><h2>  About the locals </h2><p>  Thais are very welcoming and hospitable people.  However, they have their own distinctive features.  For example, locals drink alcohol very rarely, and even then, on major holidays.  It is also unacceptable for men with a naked torso to appear on the street.  Even bare shoulders are considered bad form. </p><p>  Buddha is the most revered among the locals.  You can talk about him only in a positive tone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.lbwtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand food interesting facts" class="if uuid-2618035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/2618035.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, Thais have one golden rule - never touch anyone's head.  This is considered a great disrespect for the person.  Never expose your bare heels.  For this they can even beat. </p><h2>  About shopping </h2><p>  Of course, many tourists love to go shopping, benches, markets.  Therefore, interesting facts about Thailand were selected for tourists, not only about locals or children, but also about shopping: </p><ol><li>  Discounts are in large stores much more often than in shops. </li><li>  In Thailand, shopping is ideal a few days before the holidays.  Indeed, it is then that tourists are offered good promotions.  These days, goods can be bought much cheaper. </li><li>  The water market is a tourist attraction in Thailand.  Sellers and buyers float in canals.  Some offer goods, others buy.  However, the prices here are overpriced, since the traffic is quite high. </li><li>  You can bargain with locals not only in the markets, but also in shops, which is a curiosity for the Russian people. </li><li>  In a large store you can buy not only products and electronics, but even a car.  For this there is no need to go to specialized salons.  However, car prices are high. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="pl.depositphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting facts about tourism in Thailand" class="if uuid-2618047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/2618047.jpg"></div><p>  Even after the holidays, many stores still have promotions and discounts until the end of the season.  That is, until February. </p><h2>  About thai language </h2><p>  As you can see, there are many interesting facts about Thailand.  The same can be said about their language.  For example, local residents do not have such a rule - "it is not written separately with verbs."  After all, there are basically no gaps between words.  Therefore, one must be well versed in <span>Thai</span> to understand where the sentence begins and where it ends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="matadornetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting facts about Thailand" class="if uuid-2618064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/2618064.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, locals do not know the rules of punctuation, because they simply do not have commas, colons, semicolons, and ellipses.  Thais know only quotation marks and parentheses. </p><p>  As for plurals, they exist.  For example, the singular ‚Äúdec‚Äù (child) in the plural sounds with the duplication ‚Äúdec-dec‚Äù. </p><p>  The pronoun "I" sounds depending on who exactly speaks.  If a man, then there will be ‚Äúpom‚Äù, and from the female lips you can hear ‚Äúchan‚Äù.  This is the difference. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thailand is one of the most popular tourist countries in the world.  You learned a lot of interesting facts about the country.  Thailand has amazing features and traditions that conquer and surprise tourists. </p>
