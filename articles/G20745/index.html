This is a system of city fortifications with towers, ramparts and temples.  In total, 14 kremlin houses were completely preserved on the territory of Russia, five of which were inscribed on the World Heritage List.  More than a dozen such objects have been preserved fragmentarily. </p><p>  The visiting card of Rostov (do not confuse this city with Rostov-on-Don) is the Rostov Kremlin - a unique <span>architectural ensemble</span> in the Yaroslavl region, which is part of the Golden Ring of Russia.  It is about him that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Museum-Reserve "Rostov Kremlin" </h2><p>  The ensemble photos presented in the article perfectly illustrate the beauty and splendor of this monument.  It is located in a picturesque area on the shores of Lake Nero.  The Metropolitan, or the Bishop‚Äôs Court, was the name of the Rostov Kremlin earlier, because, in fact, it was the residence of the Metropolitan of the Diocese of Rostov. </p>

    <p>  The architectural ensemble belongs to the monuments of defensive architecture, although Rostov itself at the time of the construction of the children did not already have any strategic military significance.  Today, the Rostov Kremlin is a museum that can be visited daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  But they are allowed on the walls only in the warm season.  An entrance ticket to the reserve costs 300 rubles for an adult and 180 rubles for children or senior citizens.  Fans of ancient Russian architecture should definitely visit the Rostov Kremlin.  The photos below will only emphasize the greatness of this outstanding historical monument! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to all this, the architectural complex can also be called a movie star.  So, the Rostov Kremlin was the decoration for the famous Soviet film "Ivan Vasilievich Changes the Profession". </p><h2>  History of the complex </h2><p>  The history of the Metropolitan Courtyard is quite interesting, the ensemble has experienced several difficult moments in its biography.  The Rostov Kremlin was built in the XVII century for 14 years - from 1670 to 1683.  It was planned according to biblical canons: in the center is a garden of paradise with a lake surrounded by high walls. </p>

    <p>  An important and unpleasant event for the Kremlin occurred in 1787, when the metropolis was transferred to Yaroslavl.  After this, the Metropolitan Courtyard in Rostov is gradually declining.  It even got to the point that the bishops were going to hand him over.  Fortunately, at the end of the 19th century, the architectural ensemble with the money of merchants was restored.  And a few years later, a museum of church antiquities was established here. </p><p>  Another sad page in the history of the Rostov Kremlin occurred in 1953: then many of the buildings of the complex were damaged by a powerful tornado. </p><p>  Here is such a turbulent and thorny historical path the Kremlin went through in Rostov.  Fortunately, our ancestors managed to save it to this day.  And already in 2013, the Rostov Kremlin entered the honorary top ten of the "Symbols of Russia". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Complex structure: Rostov Kremlin cathedrals </h2><p>  The architectural ensemble incredibly successfully fit into the surrounding area, located on the banks of the picturesque Lake Nero.  The historical complex includes: 6 temples, Samuel Corps, White and Red Chambers, Holy Gates, eleven towers and other buildings. </p>

    <p>  We list all the churches of the Rostov Kremlin: </p><ul><li>  Assumption Cathedral; </li><li>  Church of the Savior Not Made by Hands; </li><li>  Church of St. Gregory the Theologian; </li><li>  Church of St. John the Evangelist; </li><li>  Hodegetria Church; </li><li>  Church of the Resurrection (Gateway). </li></ul><h2>  Hodegetria Church </h2><p>  This is the latest in time construction of the Rostov Kremlin.  The temple was built in the style of <span>Moscow Baroque,</span> in the northwestern sector of the complex.  Odigitriya church differs from other temples of the Kremlin by the presence of an open balcony on the second floor.  Outside, its walls are decorated with patterned ornaments, which creates the effect of relief, if you look at the structure from afar. </p><p>  The interior of the temple is also especially: the interior is decorated with 20 molded cartouches with painting.  At the time when the bishop's court was in ruins, the murals were badly damaged.  They were restored only in 1912, especially for the visit of Tsar Nicholas II.  Re- <span>painting of the temple was</span> updated at the beginning of the third millennium.  Today in the church of Hodegetria is one of the museums. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of the Holy Savior </h2><p>  In 1675, the <span>Church of the Savior in the Seny</span> grew within the Rostov Kremlin <span>.</span>  Its main difference from others is the presence of eight-slope coverage in the design of the church.  The interior of the temple is striking: an arcade supported by gilded supports.  The walls of the church are decorated with beautiful paintings made in the same 1675.  The Church of the Savior Not Made by Hands was renewed and restored twice: the first time - at the end of the 19th century, and the second - at the end of the 20th century. </p>

    <p>  The central dome of the temple is decorated with a wonderful painting called "Fatherland".  It depicts six archangels with prophetic scrolls, and the vaults are decorated with the main events from the Gospel.  The Last Judgment is depicted on the western wall of the temple, and the iconostasis is on the opposite. </p><h2>  Church of St. Gregory the Theologian </h2><p>  This church was built in the 1670s on the foundation of the Grigoryevsky monastery, which existed on this site earlier.  Unfortunately, the first interiors of the temple burned down during a fire in 1730.  After him, the interior of the church of Gregory the Theologian was updated, in particular, using stucco moldings. </p><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the church was equipped with a new iconostasis, which was decorated with beautiful gilded carvings. </p><h2>  Church of St. John the Evangelist </h2><p>  One of the last churches of the Rostov Kremlin, built in 1683.  Experts note that this temple is distinguished by its elegance in comparison with other churches of the architectural complex.  The facades are beautifully decorated and characterized by an amazing harmony of forms.  The temple survived several tragic events: two fires (in 1730 and 1758) severely damaged it, and in 1831 it lost its roof due to strong winds.  And only at the end of the 19th century did they seriously engage in the restoration of this building.  However, already in 1953 in Rostov there was a powerful tornado, from which the Church of St. John the Evangelist again suffered greatly.  But, despite all the vicissitudes of fate, the temple was able to be preserved and reported to the descendants. </p><h2>  Gateway Church of the Resurrection </h2><p>  In 1670, the Church of the Resurrection was erected on the territory of the Rostov Kremlin.  It is located above the gate, on a high basement.  The facades of the church are complicated by rectangular towers that protrude slightly from the plane of the walls. </p>

    <h2>  Assumption Cathedral and its belfry </h2><p>  <span>The Assumption Cathedral of the Rostov</span> Kremlin is the main monumental building of the ensemble.  It was built in the years 1508-1512 at the place where its predecessors were previously located.  The temple is very reminiscent of the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow in its architecture: five-domed, decorated in simple but noble forms.  It is built of brick, as well as white stone, the total height of the cathedral is 60 meters. </p><p>  The Assumption Cathedral is decorated with a variety of decorative elements: panels, belts and <span>horizontal traction.</span>  Thanks to this, the temple is very beautiful and expressive, even in the XXI century it looks gorgeous. </p>

    <p>  Nearby is the belfry of the Assumption Cathedral, which was built much later, at the end of the XVII century.  It is crowned with four chapters.  <span>Metropolitan Jonah</span> ordered for this belfry to cast 13 large bells, each of which was endowed with its own key.  In general, bells are capable of producing harmonious and pleasant ringing.  To date, 15 bells have survived on the belfry of the Assumption Cathedral of the Rostov Kremlin. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that in 1991 both the Assumption Cathedral and its belfry were returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. </p><h2>  Bells </h2><p>  The bells of the Rostov Kremlin deserve separate words.  The very first - for the bishops' court in Rostov - was cast in 1682.  He received the name "Swan" and weighed only 500 pounds (in comparison with the subsequent bells of the Kremlin it was a little weight).  A year later, the next one was cast - Polyelein, whose weight reached 1000 pounds.  Both bells are the work of one master - Philip Andreev. </p><p>  The largest bell of the Rostov Kremlin (weighing 2000 pounds!) Was cast by another master - Flor Terentyev in 1688.  Only the tongue weighed more than a ton, so two strong men had to swing it.  However, according to the beauty of sound, experts say, he has no equal in Rostov. </p><p>  Another large bell - ‚ÄúHunger‚Äù - weighed 172 pounds.  It was used only during Lent.  All other bells of the Rostov Kremlin are relatively small, weighing no more than 30 pounds.  Almost all of them were cast in the 17th century, as historians say. </p>

    <p>  The bells of the Rostov Kremlin have a unique ringing, the beauty of which was once admired by Berlioz and Chaliapin.  With the advent of Soviet power, all church bells were banned.  And the bells of the Rostov Kremlin were completely planned to be destroyed.  They owe their salvation to A.V. Lunacharsky, who then miraculously ended up in Rostov and saved these most valuable monuments. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Rostov Kremlin is a grandiose monument of history and architecture.  This is one of the most significant ensembles of the country, annually attracting up to 200 thousand tourists.  The Kremlin in Rostov is not only unique architecture and beautiful temples.  Amazing and attractive, and the very amazingly gracious atmosphere prevailing in the territory of this complex. </p>
