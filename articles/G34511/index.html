    <p>  Hotel Pera Inn Hotel 3 * is located almost in the center of the village.  The main attractions of the municipality are about five minutes leisurely walk.  Go to the beach a little longer.  If you do not rush, then the road will take a quarter of an hour.  From the hotel you can easily reach the popular Cleopatra recreational zone, the ancient castle, the complex of caves Dalmash and Dim. </p><p>  Pera Inn Hotel 3 * is focused on the reception of families with small children, couples and the elderly.  Therefore, in the evening, peace and quiet reign in the courtyard of the hotel.  It is noisy only near the pool.  The international airport located in neighboring Antalya is 130 kilometers away.  The hotel offers a paid shuttle service.  If desired, you can use public transport or taxi. </p><p>  Recently, aircraft from Russia are landing not only in Antalya, but also in the neighboring town of Gazipasa.  Between him and Alanya only forty kilometers.  Official carriers charge 3,000 rubles for this journey.  For a minibus for eight passengers, they will take 3,400. Transporting a company of 13 people will cost 4,200. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Information for consideration </h2>

    <p>  The local beach is equipped with sun loungers, parasols and wooden flooring.  Showers, toilets, changing cabins work.  But experienced tourists went to rest in the Cleopatra area.  To get there, you need to take a minibus.  Buses run every five minutes past the hotel.  The driver himself will stop where required.  The entire journey takes no more than seven minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The water on this beach has a distinctive turquoise hue.  The recreation area is municipal, so you will have to pay for sun loungers and tents.  Those who are not ready to splurge can spread a towel right on the sand.  Bars and inexpensive bistros work.  They serve cocktails and simple snacks.  Many guests of Pera Inn Hotel 3 * (Alanya) at the end of their vacation chose Cleopatra. </p><p>  The pool at the hotel is only one.  It is small.  Next to it is a children's aquazone.  The water in it is always warm.  Inflatable toys need to be bought independently.  There are no slides and attractions.  Dry towels are not dispensed.  There are not enough sun loungers during the midday heat.  To comfortably stay by the pool for lunch, you need to skip a meal in the dining room. </p><h2>  Positive impressions </h2>

    <p>  Most of the tourists remained rather smiling and friendly waiters, maids and administrators.  It was necessary to communicate with them in English, but this fact did not spoil the impression of rest.  In their reviews of Pera Inn Hotel 3 * (Alanya), guests praised the cook who came from Tajikistan.  He made delicious soups. </p><p>  All the furniture in the room was in excellent condition.  Plumbing worked.  Bags with shower gel and shampoo were not given.  There was only a dispenser with liquid soap, the supply of which was replenished from time to time.  TV showed Russian channels.  A powerful air conditioner easily coped with the Turkish heat. </p><p>  Local pastries are very fond of vacationers.  Delicious buns, pies, puffs and cakes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Everything was hot and fresh.  The bar was treated to local alcohol drinks.  Beer and wine were enough for everyone.  If you order a cocktail or food in the bar on the coast, which belongs to the ownership of Pera Inn Hotel 3 * (Turkey, Alanya), a sunbed and an umbrella were provided free of charge. </p><h2>  Negative </h2>

    <p>  The Russians did not like the rooms.  According to the guests, they were very cramped.  The pool also turned out to be too small.  Maids neglect their duties.  They don‚Äôt clean every day, but they generally can forget to change the linen.  Need to remind!  Fifty rooms, which occupy five floors, have only two cleaners.  The staff has no days off.  Waiters and cooks work for months. </p><p>  They don‚Äôt put water in the refrigerator.  We need to go down to the cooler ourselves in a bistro and collect a bottle.  The beer that is poured in the bar is warm and tasteless.  The restaurant‚Äôs menu included meat.  In fact, it was soy.  If you can not live without fragrant sausages and grilled sausages, then it is better to consider other options. </p><p>  This hotel is designed for unassuming customers.  Sweet tooth also had a hard time.  Most often they got rice pudding.  Even watermelon was a rarity.  Turkish stews are tasteless.  They are watery and too sharp. </p><p>  At the tour desk, a representative of which can be found at the front desk, travel prices are doubled.  Do not agree to the vaunted sea party.  It is expensive, and the pleasure is very dubious.  The ship shakes all the time, it‚Äôs impossible to dance.  Foam is allowed only twenty minutes before the end of swimming. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2>

    <p>  Do not rush to exchange money at the hotel.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket MiGros Jet.  It accepts American dollars, and change is given in Turkish liras.  The course is very profitable.  Everything is simple and convenient!  The lowest cost of beach accessories was recorded in a small shop nearby.  It is called 82 Sali Pazari. </p><p>  An inexpensive shopping center is located two blocks from the residential building.  To find him, you need to turn left.  Walk about twenty minutes.  If you do not want to walk in the heat, use the 202 shuttle bus. It stops opposite the shopping center.  The assortment of necessary little things in this store is huge. </p><p>  Vacationers found nice prices for local fruits in the Marko shop.  It is located on a street that stretches along the coastline.  At the end of summer, peaches were sold at 30 rubles per kilogram, grapes - at 20. Since the beach, which is considered the property of the hotel, is not the most convenient and clean, tourists recommend going to the right side of it. </p><p>  Landmark - paid pool, which is located right on the beach.  The entrance to the water there is without stones, flat and gentle.  If you believe the reviews about Pera Inn Hotel 3 * (Turkey), for 150 rubles travelers can not only swim in plenty, but also use the well-groomed territory with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Drinks are more expensive in the bar than in the shops.  But the margin is not very high. </p><p>  In Alanya, beautiful leather goods salons work.  They contain interesting gizmos, but you need to bargain.  If the owner of the boutique does not like you, he can easily be rude.  Or even push it out of the room onto the street.  Similar incidents occurred in the institution "Ponto".  In other places, sellers were more accommodating and made substantial discounts. </p>
