But it can happen that both a public servant, an employee, and an unemployed person need a large amount of money that can only be borrowed from a bank.  And from this moment on, people begin to delve into a concept such as credit to the unemployed.

The thing is that one of the main criteria for assessing the possibility of a loan is the assessment of the solvency of the client.  And if he cannot confirm his income in any way, then you can forget about the loan money: the bank will not take risks.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, you can take out a loan to the unemployed.  There are a number of possibilities for obtaining it: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ without providing a certificate of income; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ with the help of brokerage houses; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ contacting a private investor; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ taking a loan for a business. </p><p>  In the first case, a loan to an unemployed is issued as part of one of the express lending programs.  Their main minus is cannibalistic interest rates.  Thus, the lender is trying to protect himself from the risk of default on debt by unscrupulous borrowers. </p><p>  In the second case, you will have to cooperate with an organization that is supposedly interested in helping people.  In fact, its profit is a commission paid by the applicant.  Most often, loans involving brokers are concluded at a high percentage.  In addition, you will also have to provide real estate or a car as security.  My advice to you: do not mess. </p><p>  Also, a private investor can provide a loan to the unemployed.  But here you can‚Äôt do without security.  You should also be aware that the activities of such benefactors are not controlled by anyone.  The consequences of such "partnership" relationships are difficult to predict.  It is good when everything is good.  And if not? </p><p>  The latter option is completely legal.  Here the state gives a loan to the unemployed.  That is, a citizen receives all the <span>unemployment benefits</span> due to him <span>in</span> one amount, but only if he successfully defends his business plan and has completed the procedure for registering his own business. </p><p>  There is another answer to the question of where to get a loan to the unemployed.  It is about illegal assistance.  Surely many saw the ads, the meaning of which is that some intermediaries promise their help in obtaining a loan.  Moreover, special emphasis is placed on the fact that the level of income and credit history does not matter. </p>

An unemployed citizen receives a fake stamp in the work book and goes to the bank.  If, when checking the place of work, the bank manager calls the ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù, where the borrower allegedly works, then a special person (front man) will confirm this fact.  However, one must understand that such schemes work only if the financial institution is young, that is, in the sense that its <span>customer base</span> is limited.  If, as they say, it‚Äôs impossible to conceal the awl in a bag, then all responsibility falls on the unemployed who succumbed to weakness.  Obviously, intermediaries cannot be found.  So think a hundred times, is it worth the risk?
