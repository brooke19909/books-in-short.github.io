    <h2>  Interest after a thousand years </h2><p>  But the history of the ancient Scandinavian people - the Vikings - attracts special attention of modern mankind with its originality, mythology, and culture.  There are many such modern archaeological sites, and they are quite different in nature, but the most famous are: the village of Borg, located on the Lofoten Islands (Norway);  Viking village Svengard, near Vyborg (Russia);  and the Viking village in Tallinn (Estonia).  In addition, a large number of historical reconstruction festivals are held that recreate the life and traditions of the Scandinavian people.  The festival ‚ÄúLegends of the Norse Vikings‚Äù, which takes place annually in St. Petersburg, is considered the most popular among them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Homeland of the Scandinavian warlike people </h2><p>  The real Viking village called the ‚ÄúLofotr Museum‚Äù was reconstructed in the village of Borg, which is located near B√∂stad in the commune of Westw√∂g√∂ in Norway.  It is based on <span>archaeological excavations</span> in Nur Norg, on the Lofoten archipelago.  The museum itself has been open since 1995 and consists of a king, whose length is 83 meters, a forge and a real ship of the brave sailors of the Middle Ages - the drakkar.  For tourists there are also prepared entertainment for guests and real Viking cuisine, as well as dramatization of their life.  A movie about the Vikings is shown at the museum, and tourists can also buy a commemorative gizmo in a local gift shop.  On the territory there is a real farm with horses, cows and other animals.  But not only this is famous for the Borg.  Every year there is a Viking festival, where designers come from all over Europe and not only. </p><h2>  Viking village near Vyborg </h2><p>  Russia is a huge country with an ancient rich history, so a large number of different fortresses, ruins, historical monuments and other archaeological sites are scattered throughout its territory.  In the Leningrad Region, 16 kilometers from the ancient city of Vyborg, on the ninth kilometer of the Svetogorsk highway, which is on the A 124 highway, there is a unique reserve of historical and cultural significance - Svargas Manor, better known as the Viking Village Svengard (or Svargas).  Both names are relevant.  The word ‚Äúsvargas‚Äù has Indo-European roots and is translated into Russian as ‚Äúsunny sky‚Äù.  This object represents a "living history", because it is a real inhabited settlement, a model of a princely estate of the eleventh century in full size.  This is a project of experimental archeology, as the creators themselves call it, which was created by the historical and cultural center Varyazhsky Dvor in 2005-2008. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  A unique project of "living history" </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the settlement is known as the ‚ÄúViking Village‚Äù, ‚ÄúSvargas‚Äù, according to one of the founders Alexei Dudin, or ‚ÄúSven‚Äù, as he is called, this is a model of reconstruction not only of Scandinavian culture, but also of Slavic and Finnish.  In the estate, everything is truly real, and almost like a millennium ago, there is no water supply, electricity and other benefits of civilization.  But instead of the hearths of that era - stoves with pipes. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there is very little reliable data about those times, the life of the Middle Ages was most accurately recreated in Svengard.  For the construction, authentic technologies were used.  Each visitor to the estate can touch deep antiquity, even smell it and taste it, having tried original dishes, see how the life of the Vikings in antiquity was arranged.  You can even plunge into the secrets of crafts, not only observe, but also try to create something yourself.  There is also a unique opportunity to see how the weapons and armor of those times were created.  Well, of course, any person can feel like a real Viking for a while, clothed in chain mail, fought with swords, fired from a bow and overcome obstacles prepared by the villagers.  This is a great option for relaxing with friends and family, the children get a fantastic experience. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment and leisure center in Estonia </h2><p>  In a very picturesque place of Estonia called Saula, on the banks of the Pirita River, since 2005 another Viking Village has been located.  Tallinn is located almost 30 kilometers along the Tartu highway from this entertainment center with a historical slope.  If the Vyborg Viking village is, rather, an experimental project of the so-called living archeology, then its Estonian counterpart was created specifically for the recreation and entertainment of tourists.  Despite this, the owners of this place tried their best, having recreated an excellent model of the medieval settlement of the Scandinavian people.  Tourists, if desired, can stay here for the night, for this there are separate rooms.  True, the bathroom and shower in them are still modern, albeit stylized antique.  In the tavern will feed any starving traveler from 11 to 22 hours.  There are plenty of attractions for tourists. </p>
