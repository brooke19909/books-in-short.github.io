Photos of this city, its wide sandy beaches and dunes covered with pine trees, are surely known to every resident of the former USSR.  And all the more so, everyone saw, at least on TV, the Dzintari concert stage, with which so many Soviet pop stars had “started”. </p>

    <p>  This Baltic resort has only one minus - moody weather.  Everything else is impeccable.  Therefore, if the sky is cloudy and drizzling nasty rain, we will not be upset, but will go to explore the <span>sights of Jurmala.</span>  There are so many of them in this pearl of the Riga seaside! </p><h2>  Local "Arbat" </h2>

Now these are the urban areas of Kemeri, Bulduri, Lielupe, Maiori and others.  They feel rural pastorality, a patriarchal way of life.  But still, you can’t name Jurmala outback.  There is also an axis of social, cultural life.  This is Jomas Street.  It is entirely pedestrian, designed for leisurely walks, so that both people can see and show themselves.  On this boulevard in season, as at a social event, you can meet many celebrities, especially the stars of the Russian showbiz.  In addition to a series of restaurants, taverns and fashion boutiques, there are the oldest pharmacy and market in the city.  And on the corner of Omnibus and Jomas in 1870 the first resort hotel with a garden was opened on the Riga Seaside.  It is worth taking a walk along this "Arbat" among artists and street musicians to see the sights of Jurmala.

Walking along it, you quietly get to another village.  Here is the attraction, because of which, in Soviet times, Jurmala was famous - the Dzintari concert hall.  This is an open amphitheater, without walls, like the ancient Greek.  At this place, then called Edinburgh, concerts were given back in the late 19th century.  F. Chaliapin, F. Stravinsky, <span>E. Obraztsova,</span> M. Caballe sang here, pianists G. Neigauz, <span>S. Richter,</span> G. Ginzburg, R. Pauls demonstrated their skills.  Then in 1936 a concert complex was erected here.  And in 1962, the stage and a hall for two thousand spectators were covered with a roof.  For more than a century, various international concerts have been held here annually.  In 2006, the complex was reconstructed, the acoustics were improved, and the park was expanded.  Well-known contests and festivals such as Jurmalina, New Wave, KVN, Ballet Stars, Summertime and others are also held here.  In general, during the summer season, about a hundred concerts are held on this stage.  Near Dzintari there is an amusement park, as well as an excursion bureau.

Spa services are provided in most resort hotels.  Ayurveda, body wrap, massages, healing mud, sulfur springs and Vichy showers are available to all who wish to improve their health in special centers.  You can recommend Baltic Beach SPA - as many as three floors of bath pleasures.  The resort's attractions are three water amusement parks: Nemo, Aqualandia and Livu.  The latter is an indoor complex, the largest not only in Latvia, but also in all <span>countries of Eastern Europe.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park in Jurmala" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/396435.jpg" width="600"></div>  The water park in Jurmala “Livu” is open all year round, but in the summer months amazing attractions in the open air are added to the pleasures under the roof.  Among the most exciting entertainments one can name “Tornado Lāsēns” and “Chupa-chups Island of Fountains”.  And besides, there are about 40 more types of saunas, baths and other recreational facilities.

All of them are covered with white quartz sand left by the departed Litorin Sea.  Take a closer look: suddenly a piece of amber will light under a honey star under your feet?  They say that whoever found this petrified resin is destined for luck.  The ancient sea and wind also created sand dunes.  They are overgrown with pine trees exuding a delicate aroma.  The coast here is shallow and warms up quickly, as soon as the sun leaves the clouds.  Therefore, most vacationers still prefer not a water park in Jurmala, but the most natural sea.  The beaches, especially in Jaunkemeri and Maiori, are awarded the Blue Flag every year for cleanliness and developed infrastructure.

    <h2>  Museum City </h2><p>  Surely no city on the planet can boast of so many richly carved wooden buildings!  More than four hundred houses are architectural monuments and protected by law.  The first buildings of the "summer resort" type began to be erected here in the 70s of the year before last.  Moreover, the owners of the villas - wealthy Latvian aristocrats and industrialists - did not skimp on funds and showed imagination.  Here you can find a wooden "Gothic castle" and an example of classicism, here you can find art Nouveau and chalets.  The sights of Jurmala are also the cottages of Augusta and Kristan Morberg with a botanical garden.  Interesting wooden structures for various purposes from all over Latvia are also brought into the city.  They form the exposition of the Jurmala <span>Open Air Museum.</span> </p>

    <h2>  What to see in Jurmala for nature lovers </h2><p>  An unforgettable pastime awaits you in the emeri Park.  It was founded in 1997.  Pedestrian paths lead through peat bogs, among white sand dunes and sulfur springs.  You can come here in the evening - to watch the life of bats.  Wild horses graze in the valley of the Slocene river, in the Dundur flood meadows.  Theme tours and events are held in the park - for example, kayaking or sport fishing.  On the shore of Lielupe is another national park - "Paracana".  On its territory there is a fishing museum - a reminder of the glorious past of Jurmala.  Here you can see a typical hut, as well as get acquainted with the process of drying, salting and smoking of the catch, followed by its tasting.  In general, the Lielupe district is intended for outdoor enthusiasts.  Here you can ride a yacht, go kayaking or kayaking. </p>

    <h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  For many people, the sights of Jurmala are its unique microclimate, air drunk with iodine and pine volatile, peat mud and sulfur sources.  Thousands of people come here every year to improve their health.  Wraps, baths and inhalations help to cope with diseases of the respiratory system and the musculoskeletal system.  For several decades, health resorts such as emeri ’and  Jaunkameri’ have held the bar high for servicing spa residents.  The first sanatorium is also an architectural landmark.  The building of the building was built in 1936 in the style of neo-eclecticism.  Now reconstruction works are being carried out there.  For those who wish to improve their health, various offers are available: <span>full board</span> or just medical care, procedures. </p>
