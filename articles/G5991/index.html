    <p>  The history of the family is closely intertwined with the strengthening of the Russian state.  For many years, representatives of this family faithfully served the state. </p><p>  Pushkins belong to an old noble family.  This is confirmed by the fact that there is a separate emblem of the Pushkin family.  But before describing it, it is worth learning a little more about the genus itself. </p><p>  The family takes its origin from a certain Ratsha.  He supposedly lived in the twelfth century, came to Russia from another kingdom.  He served under the Grand Duke of Kiev.  Another ancestor is called Gavril Aleksich, who was a prince of Novgorod and served with Alexander Nevsky. </p><p>  The ancestor of the family is Grigory Alexandrovich, who lived in the fourteenth century.  During the service, about which nothing is known, he received the nickname Cannon.  From him went the name of the Pushkins.  The genus soon divided into separate branches, some of which were crowded.  Almost nothing is known about the representatives of the separated branches, but more information has been preserved about the Pushkins.  Who were they in the Russian state? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bright representatives of the Pushkins </h2><p>  Many of the noble family held various positions at one time.  They glorified the coat of arms of the Pushkins, a photo of which can be found in the General Tomb of the All-Russian Empire. </p><p>  The list of posts that Pushkin held most often: </p><ul><li>  Messengers </li><li>  governors; </li><li>  governors; </li><li>  stewards; </li><li>  roundabouts; </li><li>  boyars; </li><li>  diplomats; </li><li>  Governors </li><li>  officers. </li></ul><p>  Pushkin Evstafy Mikhailovich, being ambassador to Ivan the Terrible, receives a patrimony, which by the seventeenth century the clan was able to pass on by inheritance.  It became the village of Boldino, as well as the neighboring village of Kistenevo. </p><p>  One of the first known representatives of the clan was Pushkin Ivan Mikhailovich, who lived in the late sixteenth - early seventeenth centuries.  He was a duma nobleman, a deceased and a diplomat. </p>

    <p>  One of the last descendants of the clan was Alexander Pushkin, who lived from 1833 to 1914.  He became famous in military affairs, being a cavalry general.  In addition, he was the eldest son of the famous poet and playwright Pushkin Alexander Sergeyevich. </p><h2>  great poet </h2><p>  The coat of arms of Pushkin would hardly have been so famous without the brightest representative of the clan.  It is known that Alexander Sergeyevich was interested in his own pedigree.  He studied it both through the mother, and through the father. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  So in Boldino, the writer took notes, which was given the title "Experience in the reflection of some non-literary accusations."  He also wrote about his ancestors in the famous poem ‚ÄúMy Family Tree‚Äù. </p><p>  The poet had four children.  On the male line, only son Alexander left offspring.  The last direct descendant of the writer on the male line is Alexander Pushkin.  He was born in 1942 and still lives in Belgium.  He is a philanthropist and public figure.  In 2005, he received Russian citizenship, remaining a citizen of Belgium.  Lives with his wife Maria-Madeleine Pushkina-Durnova, they have no children. </p><p>  Despite this, many descendants of the old family live in the world.  They all know and honor the story of a kind, of which the family coat of arms is also a part. </p><h2>  Coat of arms description </h2>

    <p>  Researchers cannot say exactly who created the coat of arms of the Pushkin family, nor how exactly when it appeared.  It consists of several elements.  Each of them has its own meaning.  In its beauty and wealth, it becomes apparent that the family was in a good financial position and held a high status in society. </p><p>  The main part is a shield divided by a horizontal strip.  At its top is a princely hat of scarlet velvet, lying on a purple pillow.  All this is placed on the background of an ermine field. </p><p>  The lower part of the shield is divided into two halves.  On the right side of the blue field is a hand in silver armor.  She holds a pointed upward sword.  On the left side, which is trimmed with gold, there is an eagle, which has spread its wings to half.  In its claws, the bird holds a sword and power. </p><p>  Above the shield is a noble helmet with three ostrich feathers.  On a helmet - a noble crown.  Around the helmet is a bast, consisting of blue and gold leaves intertwined.  In places, leaves and curls are complemented by silver. </p><h2>  What can be learned from the coat of arms </h2><p>  In the old days, the coat of arms of Pushkin was a symbol of noble origin.  Today, it is also a source of valuable information about the origin of the genus. </p><p>  What can the coat of arms of Pushkin tell: </p><ul><li>  The princely cap means that the above-mentioned Ratsha arrived in Russia and fought under the victorious banner of Alexander Nevsky. </li><li>  The arm in armor was a long-standing emblem, which was accepted by the descendants of Ratsha in memory of the fact that their ancestor came from Slavonia. </li><li>  The eagle was the family coat of arms of the Ratsha ancestors. </li></ul>
