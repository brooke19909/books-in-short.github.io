Sometimes the characters that the kids want to play with are not on sale or their parents do not have enough money for toys.  Therefore, self-made <span>fairy</span> - <span>tale characters</span> will come to the rescue <span>:</span> making them with your own hands is quite simple, especially if the child helps you.  The most valuable thing in making toys with the baby is the development of his abilities and imagination.  Any material can come in handy: plasticine, bumps, fabric and paper. </p><h2>  Zmey Gorynych </h2><p>  Fairy-tale heroes can turn out colorful and vivid.  With their own hands, without the help of elders, even schoolchildren make them, using plasticine at the same time.  This is the most convenient material for children's modeling.  You can try to fashion the Serpent of Gorynych from a fairy tale, while at the same time endowing him with a kind smile, a kindly character.  You will need to roll a lot of green plasticine balls: from one we make the body, three will go to the heads, four - to the paws.  Each of them needs to be slightly pulled out, rolled up in sausages.  Now it remains to attach all the elements to the back of the <span>fairytale character</span> .  But that‚Äôs not all: from two balls we create wings, fasten to the heads of the eyes, mark the nostrils with a match, cut our mouth and put in place the scarlet language.  The snake will be very kind.  And rightly so: there is enough evil in the world. </p><h2>  Gingerbread man </h2><p>  Crafts of fairy-tale characters are different.  For example, it can be characters of Russian folk tales, <span>cartoon characters</span> and feature films. </p>

    <p>  Making toys in simple easy ways is recommended along with young children, and with older ones, you can try more sophisticated technologies.  Whatever hero you have to craft, the main thing is that he be kind.  For example, a smiling and amusing kolobok from a Russian folk tale can be made from ordinary threads.  To do this, take a balloon, glue, thread and colored paper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Inflate the ball, while the color does not matter.  A jar of glue should be pierced with a needle, a needle with a thread will pass through this hole, smeared with a sticky mass from all sides.  Then we wind the thread on the ball: everyone chooses the density himself.  After there are a lot of threads, the workpiece needs to be dried.  When the process is complete, the ball must be pierced. </p>

    <p>  Then you need to pull it through the hole between the threads.  The ball can still serve and please the baby, if you do not pierce it, but simply gently untie it and let it out of the air.  It remains only to glue the eyes, mouth and cheeks, which are cut out of colored paper.  You can add a hat.  That's it: the mischievous and funny bun is ready. </p><h2>  Cheburashka </h2><p>  How are fairy-tale heroes made with their own hands?  Now we will tell.  For example, we propose to make the cute and beloved character of E. Ouspensky Cheburashka.  The following materials are useful for its creation: cardboard (only necessarily corrugated) in two colors corresponding to the natural shades of Cheburashka: yellow and brown.  It will take several types of glue: PVA and hot. </p>

    <p>  The body and head of the toy are made the same.  They will need four parts: two front and the same back.  The first to be made front.  They are curled from yellow cardboard.  Add two rows of brown cardboard on top.  To give volume, we squeeze out the middle of the parts a little and fix it with glue.  It will be the muzzle and tummy of Cheburashka.  The backs of the head and torso are made in brown.  They need to be glued together.  Legs, handles and ears are similarly performed.  With the help of cut out individual details, a characteristic muzzle with eyes, nose and mouth is created. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pinocchio </h2><p>  It is rare in which house you can find wooden toys.  Only real masters create beautiful and original wooden fairy-tale characters.  It‚Äôs difficult to make them yourself, but it‚Äôs quite possible.  If you read a fairy tale about the wonderful boy Pinocchio with your children before working on the character, they will with great pleasure begin to help in the decoration of some details. </p>

    <p>  For beginners, the softest types of wood are suitable.  These include aspen and linden.  Of the integral elements, the head, body of the toy, arms and legs are made.  All small parts can be made from residues.  Then they must be sanded with <span>sandpaper.</span>  Mounts for wooden Pinocchio parts can be of two types: from wire and on hinges.  The first connection will be effective for small toys.  If you plan a voluminous <span>large doll,</span> then you have to work hard on combining its parts.  Her nose, eyes, hair, expressive hands and bright clothes will be revived.  Such Pinocchio, made and assembled with his own hands, will become a favorite toy not only for children, but also for grandchildren.  This toy will be a unique <span>heirloom,</span> passed on to next generations. </p><p>  Lovers of soft toys do not need to be specifically looked for.  Even adults still buy fluffy fairy-tale characters for themselves, as well as for their kids.  Soft toys are sewn in the classroom classes.  For children engaged in such creativity, they sell ready-made sets. </p><h2>  Origami </h2><p>  But the simplest material from which crafts of fairy-tale characters can be made is, of course, paper.  Original patterns for the whole fairy tale can be completely invented by yourself or you can find ready-made ones.  In any case, there is an opportunity to be creative and imaginative by coloring elements and details in their own way.  Thus, you can make Karabas-Barabas, Pierrot and Malvina.  And then play the whole play with friends.  The result is a puppet theater at home.  If you want to continue demonstrating your talents, you can consider various ways to make Cinderella, Snow White, Jasmine and other magical characters.  Fairy-tale princesses can be created from ordinary color cardboard.  For this, one color sheet, blue or pink, is folded in the shape of a cone - this will be our dress.  From the other part of the cardboard we cut the body and head, attach them to the skirt.  Then draw a face.  Instead of hair, glue the threads.  As a result, we get a gentle Cinderella or a beautiful Rapunzel. </p>
