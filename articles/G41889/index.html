  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gluconic acid and sodium gluconate: industrial use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gluconic acid is formed during the oxidation of the aldehyde group of monosaccharides (glucose).  The presented acid reacts with alkali metals to form carboxylic acid salts - gluconates.  Gluconic acid is an indispensable component of cosmetics used for peeling.  The specified component easily overcomes the skin barrier, penetrates the skin and does not cause side effects.  That is why gluconic acid is an indispensable tool for the care of hypersensitive and aging skin.  Peeling using acid increases the elasticity of the skin, improves the oval of the face, reduces the severity of wrinkles, restores the barrier <span>functions of the skin.</span>  It should be noted that this acid is also used as an acidifier, a synergist of antioxidants, and a regulator of acidity. </p><p>  Sodium gluconate (formula C6H11O7Na) is a complexing agent for metal ions (calcium, iron, aluminum, manganese) in industrial alkaline cleaning solutions.  This component is used in liquid formulations in combination with other ingredients, such as phosphorus and sodium silicate, surfactants and sodium hydroxide.  Gluconic acid <span>(sodium gluconate),</span> when added to solutions, interacts with calcium, forming chelating compounds.  Surfactants are generally more effective in demineralized or soft water.  Since the demineralization process itself is very expensive, adding sodium gluconate to the detergent formulation is a more profitable solution.  The action <span>of sodium hydroxide is</span> supplemented by silicates, they increase the alkalinity of the solution and prevent metal corrosion.  Sodium gluconate is the best complexing agent for creating alkaline mixtures.  It is used in bottle detergent formulations.  This is due to the high resistance to hydrolysis and biodegradability. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gluconic acid is added to glass washing solutions.  As a rule, the composition of the formulation depends on the size of the deposits and the <span>hardness of the water.</span>  Sodium gluconate is added to concrete mixes.  It has been established that when this component is added, the process of setting concrete is slowed down and its ductility is improved.  Sodium gluconate is easily adsorbed on the surface of cement particles, when interacting with water, it prevents their contact with it, as a result of which the setting process of concrete is slowed down.  When this substance interacts with calcium ions, an insoluble complex of <span>calcium gluconate is formed</span> on the surface of the cement particles.  As a result of this synergism, the hydration process slows down, which leads to an increase in curing time.  The formation of long microcrystalline fibers contributes to an increase in the mechanical strength of cement mortars. </p><p>  Thanks to the use of complexing substances, calcium ions are isolated, which, in turn, prevents the formation of crystals.  Through the use of sodium gluconate, the dispersion of cement particles in the mixture is improved, wetting is improved.  These processes can reduce the concentration of water.  It is proved that the presence of long microcrystalline fibers significantly increases the strength of concrete after 28 days.  The use of complexing substances reduces the concentration of water in mixtures, which positively affects the strength, hardening and plasticity of concrete. </p><p>  In the metallurgical industry, C6H11O7Na is used as a chelating agent that binds metal ions, preventing the deposition <span>of aluminum hydroxide</span> on surfaces.  In steel pickling, the bio-compound presented prevents the deposition of metal salts from deposition on sheets or in bathtubs.  This greatly improves the condition of the metal surface. </p>
