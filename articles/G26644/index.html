    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Green World Hotel is not located on the first line.  According to the guests, it took them about 5-7 minutes to get to the shore.  Many tourists were surprised by the fact that the hotel has its own plot on the beach.  Sunbeds here for guests, respectively, are free.  True, the sun loungers and umbrellas themselves are extremely few (no more than 20).  Therefore, all vacationers living in the Green World Hotel 4 * space is not enough.  However, this did not become a particular problem for anyone.  After all, you can sit next to a towel or rent a lounger on any part of the beach.  It costs quite inexpensively.

True, sometimes the sea throws garbage ashore, but it is quickly removed. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the hotel we are considering does not have its own territory, it does not offer special entertainments for its guests.  However, there is a swimming pool (on the fourth floor) and a spa in its building.  According to some travelers, the water in the pool seemed to them too cool.  But all visitors were satisfied with the quality of service in the hotel spa.  However, in their opinion, the prices for services here are very high.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to go to one of the spa centers located near Green World, if you wish.  The quality of services in them is in most cases no worse, but the cost is more acceptable. </p>
