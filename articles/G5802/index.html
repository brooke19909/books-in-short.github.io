Its sights will be interesting to tourists.  It is worth noting that this city is one of the youngest in Russia.  Magadan was founded in 1929.  At first it was a small working village, and the status of the city was assigned to it ten years later. </p><h2>  Amazing terrain </h2><p>  The port city located on the shore of <span>the Sea of ​​Okhotsk is</span> able to amaze the traveler with its harsh beauty, in which there is something pristine and majestic.  The nearby two peaks of the Upper Kolyma Upland - Snezhny Peak and Aborigine, made this area attractive not only for tourists, but also for climbers.  And in the upper reaches <span>of the Kolyma River</span> there is a picturesque lake, named after the writer Jack London.  It seems to be an accurate illustration of his stories.  This lake is surrounded by a flowering meadow, mighty pine trees, in the water surface of which the peaks of the mountains are reflected and even ice floats in the summer.  300 km from the city there is a therapeutic thermal spring, and near it there is a balneotherapeutic resort "Talaya".  The amazing landscape of the <span>Magadan Reserve is</span> best admired by helicopter ride.  Only by helicopter can you reach the easternmost point of Russia - Ratmanov Island, located in the Bering Strait, and from it, figuratively speaking, you can easily reach Alaska. </p><h2>  Statues </h2><p>  As in St. Petersburg, in Magadan you can admire the beauty of white nights.  The city’s guests are greeted by the deer family sculptural ensemble.  Three years ago, an unusual mammoth sculpture was installed in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is made of scrap metal.  The huge beast is covered with gears, wheels and castors, brackets and other details.  Streams of rust on the sculpture give a wide range of interpretations of its name “Time” - nothing lasts forever, everything changes. </p><p>  Neoclassicism predominates in the architecture of the city, residential buildings resemble houses in St. Petersburg, as they were designed by Leningrad architects in the fifties of the last century. </p><p>  By the sixtieth anniversary of the city, a beautiful fountain “Inspiration” was built on Cosmonauts Square, which has backlighting and musical accompaniment. </p><h2>  Music and Drama Theater </h2><p>  Describing the main attractions of Magadan, we will talk about the musical and drama theater.  Its building was opened in 1941, but the acting troupe and first productions appeared much earlier, even before the city itself.  Together with the first builders, prisoners arrived on the shore of Nagaev Bay in the thirties of the nineteenth century.  Many of them were ministers of art, who fell under the wheels of a hellish repression machine.  The theater building was opened in the fall of 1941.  For many decades, famous artists of his time performed on its stage, including USSR People's Artist Georgy Zhzhenov, who later was remembered by the audience brilliantly played the main roles in the films “Crew”, “Resident's Error” and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mask of Sorrow </h2><p>  What other sights of Magadan are known?  The monument “Mask of Sorrow” is dedicated to the memory of bloody pre-war and post-war political repressions.  This is a face made in the manner of Cubism, from one eye of which tears flow in the form of masks, and a prison lattice is inserted into the other. </p>

    <p>  On the back of the monument you can see a sculpture of a kneeling crying woman at the crucifix.  Inside the huge mask, visitors can see two rooms equipped as a prison cell and a prison cemetery.  The author of the monument is Ernst Unknown. </p><h2>  Holy Trinity Cathedral and other churches </h2><p>  The sights of the city of Magadan can not only surprise or suggest, but also awaken a person's spiritual thirst.  A tribute to people who suffered during the sinister times of repression is Holy Trinity Cathedral. </p>

    <p>  The white-stone building with five gilded domes majestically rises above residential buildings.  The cathedral was built recently, in 2008.  This is the largest, but not the only Orthodox shrine in the city. </p><p>  Continuing the story of the harsh northern settlement called the city of Magadan, the sights of which we will describe further, we can not help but recall another iconic object.  In 1996, the one-domed chapel of St. George the Victorious was erected on the Alley in memory of the soldiers-defenders.  Twelve years ago, the church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker was built. </p><p>  In addition to the Orthodox, the city also has the Catholic Church of the Nativity of Jesus.  The building attracts with its simplicity, the octagonal bell tower with a tented dome gives it a austere and at the same time elegant look. </p><h2>  Kozin Museum and Pilots Memorial </h2><p>  In Magadan, there is a museum dedicated to the life and work of the famous singer <span>Vadim Kozin,</span> one of the founders of the modern stage. </p>
