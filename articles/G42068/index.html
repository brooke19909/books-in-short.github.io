    <h2>  How to make payments </h2><p>  For simplicity and convenience of borrowers, most credit organizations make a payment schedule.  It indicates the amount to be repaid and the day of the month.  It is issued together with a loan agreement. </p><p>  Before you begin to understand how to pay a loan in cash through the terminal, you need to find out the type of payment schedule.  It can be composed according to a classical or annuity scheme.  That is, payments are made in different or equal amounts. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is necessary to repay the monthly loan debt in advance.  Crediting a payment in some cases may be delayed for two, three days.  This is extremely rare, but it is better to protect yourself.  So any borrower will be sure that the payment is not past due and penalties are not charged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
