    <h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Kerch is one of the oldest cities on the peninsula, because here you can easily combine a beach holiday with sightseeing and educational.  The city and its environs are full of natural, cultural and historical monuments.  Among them are <span>Mount Mithridates</span> and the Great Mithridates Stairs, excavations of the ancient city of Panticapaeum and a more modern historical monument - the obelisk of Glory. </p><p>  It will be interesting for both adults and children of school age to visit the Tsar‚Äôs mound with the tomb of the ruler of the Bosporus state, as well as two ancient settlements located east of Panticapaeum, the Ottoman <span>fortress Yeni-Kale, and the fortress of</span> Kerch, which was built in the 19th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerch city beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360123.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can visit Adzhimushkaysky quarries, which impress all guests.  Fans of religious buildings will also not be disappointed by the city of Kerch.  Here is the oldest church on the peninsula of St. John the Baptist, a recognized monument of Byzantine architecture. </p><p>  Well, for everyone who came to rest with children and just wants to unwind, we recommend you to go to the Exotic Ostrich Breeding Farm or visit the unique museum of marine fauna and flora. </p><h2>  Kerch beaches </h2><p>  And although there are really many attractions in the city, tourists are usually very interested in the beaches of Kerch (reviews confirm this).  In the city and its immediate surroundings there are both well-equipped coastal areas with well-developed infrastructure, and almost wild, where people who are tired of the hustle and bustle of the big city like to relax. </p><h2>  Kerch: city beach </h2><p>  In 2011, the city beach was renovated, and it was given the name Sun Dali.  It should be noted that he was among the twenty best beaches of the peninsula.  But in the Crimea there are over 500 of them. </p><p>  Sun Dali is located on the outskirts of the city, so it is better to go by taxi.  According to the townspeople, this is the most equipped and attractive beach of the city.  Here for vacationers there are showers with fresh water, changing cabins, toilets.  There is a cafe-bar on site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof kerch" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360122.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most guests arriving in Kerch must visit the city beach.  It is very wide, sandy, with a flat bottom.  Guests can enjoy a variety of water activities, and you can rent everything you need for water sports.  Inflatable slides and other attractions are installed on the beach, which will be interesting not only for children but also for adults. </p><h2>  Moscow </h2><p>  This beach is named after the street, which ends right by the sea.  It runs parallel to the coast and has several access to the sea.  I must say that vacationers who come to Kerch choose beaches both on the Black Sea coast and on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><p>  Moskovsky is considered one of the best equipped in the city.  It belongs to the waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The coastal line is sandy, but the coast itself is rocky, with numerous boulders and rock formations.  In July-August it overgrows with grass.  But it is vacationers who consider it rather a plus than a minus: on the grass, you can conveniently sit on a towel.  And for lovers of greater comfort, you can rent an umbrella and a sun lounger at a rental point located on site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kerch beaches reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360121.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <p>  There are locker rooms, showers, toilets.  Despite the well-developed infrastructure, on the outskirts of the beach you can find completely wild sites, where there are very few vacationers.  From here, however, it is far from shower rooms, but here it is calmer, there is no noise and fuss.  The beach is narrow, although on the second level (slightly above the coastal strip) there are stationary places with benches and tables.  Here, during the day, you can have a bite and even cook kebab. </p><p>  There is not much entertainment here, moreover, this beach is not too suitable for relaxing with very young children.  The entrance to the water is gentle only in some places, but basically it is pretty steep.  However, he finds his admirers from among those who come to Kerch.  The beaches here are very different, so everyone can choose according to their own taste. </p><p>  "Moscow" is usually preferred by those who do not like a large concentration of tourists and appreciate the beauty of untouched nature. </p><h2>  Youth Beach (Kerch) </h2><p>  And this place is considered the greenest and most picturesque in the city.  It is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe popular city park.  Voikova, where not only city guests, but also local residents like to relax.  Directly from the park you can go to the beach.  Its name was not chosen by chance - young people really prefer to relax here, although older tourists will definitely like it here. </p><p>  In addition, families with children feel quite comfortable here.  A gentle descent into the water, a shallow depth, thanks to which the water warms up perfectly, attract parents with small tourists here.  The beach is small: its length is just over twenty meters, and its width is about five.  But this is enough to settle in a sun lounger, and on the second level, where there are tables, gazebos and barbecues, you can relax from the hot sun and have a bite to eat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach youth kerch" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360124.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To the left of the beach is a large gazebo, which offers stunning views of the cliffs and the sea.  You can drive to Molodezhnoye by car.  There is a guarded parking lot. </p><h2>  "Traps" </h2><p>  This beach got its name in honor of the microdistrict on the eastern outskirts of the city, where it is located on the shores of the warm Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The coast here is high and rather steep, which is not too characteristic for a city like Kerch.  The beaches created by nature in some areas are small but very cozy, covered with sand and shell rock.  Most of them are narrow and short (from ten to one hundred meters). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kerch beaches" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1360119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The bottom is flat and flat.  Despite the fact that the residential area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKapkany is densely built up with private houses, there is practically no infrastructure here, these beaches can most likely be called wild.  Locals do not rest here, because the descent into the water is steep and often dangerous. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists say that for many years in a row they come to Kerch.  The beaches here suit them primarily by the possibility of choosing the most convenient place for themselves.  For example, on the city beach there are all conditions for relaxing with children, while the "Traps" are more suitable for extreme lovers. </p>
