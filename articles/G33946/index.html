    <p>  Differences in reviews are observed mainly on such aspects: </p><p>  1. Some tourists praise the cleanliness of the rooms in vain, while others note that the bed may not change for 10 days, the cleaning of the bathroom is carried out negligently. </p><p> 2. The reception also has mixed reviews.  Some tourists thought that the employees here are conscientious, quickly check in, and immediately respond to all requests.  Other tourists in their reviews report on the carelessness of the staff and their sluggishness. </p>
