Owner reviews indicate that this device is just perfect for such purposes.  Moreover, it has a low cost and sufficient technical specifications.  The possibilities of this modification of such an access point to the Internet will be devoted to this material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tp-link.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TP router - Link TL WR841N. Reviews" class="if uuid-3146879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3146879.jpg"></div><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  As previously noted, in the implementation of entry-level computing networks, the TL-WR841N Wi-Fi router is most often used.  At the same time, the reviews emphasize that with such use of the technical specifications of the device, it will be more than enough to create a connection to the Global Web. </p><p>  Most often, such routers are used in the implementation of home computer networks.  In this case, the number of connected devices does not exceed 6-8 pieces, and the requirements for information transfer speed are not so high.  Also comes to the fore is the cost of the router, which in this case is quite democratic. </p><p>  In some cases, this model can be found in the office.  Again, the number of personal computers during this operation should not exceed 8, and the amount of regularly transmitted information is not so significant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are the two main cases of using this router model.  Another application of such a router is impractical due to modest technical parameters.  In this case, it is more correct to use expensive network Internet access points with improved specifications and high cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wi-Fi router TL - WR841N. Reviews" class="if uuid-3146889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3146889.jpg"></div><h2>  Delivery list </h2><p>  No complaints do not cause a complete set TL-WR841N.  Reviews call it "sufficient."  That is, after acquiring a router, the newly-made owner receives everything necessary to configure it and begin to operate after that.  The manufacturer included the following in this list: </p><ol><li>  A router with two fixed antennas. </li><li>  Power supply with a built-in plug and a separate lead and plug at the end. </li><li>  User manual, which indicates the technical characteristics of this device, the procedure for its settings and recommendations regarding the further operation of such a network system. </li><li>  Compact disc.  This digital media has special software for configuring the access point, and it is on its example that the procedure for preparing for operation of this router in the future will be given.  Also on it you can find documentation for this model of router. </li><li>  Warranty card, valid for 1 year from the date of purchase of the router. </li></ol><h2>  main parameters </h2><p>  Typical technical specifications, as for an economy-class router, are those of the TP-Link TL WR841N router.  Reviews focus attention of potential users on their sufficiency.  The main parameters of this network device are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  One RJ-45 input connector with a WAN designation.  It is capable of exchanging data at speeds up to 100 Mbps. </li><li>  Two wireless antennas to create a wireless network.  For each of them, a gain of 5 dB is declared.  As a rule, the range of a wireless network does not exceed 15 meters.  But in the absence of barriers.  Therefore, the real distance of receiving a wireless signal is 8-10 meters.  If you need a greater distance, then use repeaters. </li><li>  Four wired RJ-45 ports.  They are labeled LAN and their transmission speed does not exceed 100 Mbps. </li><li>  The power supply voltage of the router is 9 V. At the same time, the current consumption does not exceed 0.6 A, and the power is 5.4 V. That is, this router is an energy-efficient device. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="greggborodaty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TP Router - Link TL WR841N. Reviews" class="if uuid-3146893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3146893.jpg"></div><h2>  Switching and setting up the router.  Procedure </h2><p>  It is very simple to configure the router model TL-WR841N.  Testimonials indicate that before launching such an Internet access point, you need to perform a minimum number of actions.  The general setup procedure consists of the following main steps: </p><ol><li>  Selection of installation location, supply of communications and connection. </li><li>  Turning on the computer and the router.  Configuring the latter using a PC. </li><li>  Health Check. </li></ol><p>  After that, the device is ready and it can be used for its intended purpose.  That is, to receive or send information to the Internet. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Switching is the first step in configuring the TP-Link TL WR841N router.  Reviews indicate that it consists of two main stages.  The first of these is the installation of the built-in plug of the power supply into a power outlet.  Then the wire is supplied from it and the plug is installed in the router socket.  In turn, the second stage is connecting the wire from the provider to the WAN connector.  The above switching is mandatory.  Without it, such a device cannot function normally. </p><p>  But there are also optional connections.  That is, without them, the router can work correctly.  These are wired connections using LAN1 to LAN4 ports.  In this case, the wires are laid to the computing devices and connected to the access point. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  TP-Link TL-WR841N v. Reviews  14. 0 or any other device of this series indicate that it is much easier to perform this operation using the software recorded on the complete digital media.  In this case, you need to perform the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  We turn on the PC and the network access point to the global web.  We are waiting for them to be fully loaded. </li><li>  If you use a wired connection between a PC and a router, then there is no need to change anything.  When using the wireless network, we search for all available connections.  At the end of it, choose the one called TL-WR841N.  You must also enter a password to verify.  It can be found on a paper sticker from the bottom of the device. </li><li>  After that, you need to install digital media from the router configuration into the drive.  If the PC does not include such a device, then you can pre-download this program from the website of the manufacturer.  After starting this utility, select the item ‚ÄúConfigure the router‚Äù. </li><li>  At the first stage, specify the connection parameters to the equipment of the provider.  That is, we indicate the type of switching (for example, PPPoE or L2TP), the type of addressing used, login for network identification and password.  In some cases, you must enter an address.  The provider indicates all these parameters in the contract.  In extreme cases, you can call his specialists and clarify the necessary data.  We save the parameters and move on to the next step. </li><li>  Next, you need to change the wireless settings.  On it we indicate the new name of the network, a convenient password and a dynamic way of addressing.  Save the changes again and exit the interface. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless router TP - Link TL - WR841N. Reviews" class="if uuid-3146898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3146898.jpg"></div><h2>  Health Check.  Execution order </h2><p>  After the previous manipulations, you have fully configured the TP-Link TL-WR841N wireless router.  Reviews also indicate the need for additional diagnostics, with which you can verify its performance.  In this case, we connect any wireless device to the router using the predefined login and password.  Next, it launches a browser and go to any information resource on the Internet.  If everything is done correctly, its original page will open.  Otherwise, we check with the setup program the previously set parameters and find the error. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.build.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TP - Link TL - WR841N v. 14. 0. Reviews" class="if uuid-3146909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3146909.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Fairly low price for the TP-Link router TL-WR841N.  Reviews indicate that its cost is 1250-1300 rubles.  You can also find promotional price offers for 1000-1100 rubles.  That is, it is a very affordable access point to the Global Web.  In addition, it is very easy to configure and operate.  Therefore, it is often used at home to create a small computer network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TP - Link TL - WR841N N300 Reviews" class="if uuid-3146915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3146915.jpg"></div><h2>  Router Owners </h2><p>  Most positively characterize the reviews TP-Link TL-WR841N N300.  The first plus of the device in question is its low cost.  When creating small computer networks, this factor is very, very important.  There are also advanced requirements for the reliability of the router and the hero of this review simply perfectly matches them.  He also has excellent equipment.  It allows you to configure it without the use of additional tools.  Separately, it is also necessary to note the presence of two antennas.  Due to their presence, the coverage radius of the wireless network increases.  This is not a complete list of the advantages of this device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novosibirsk.e2e4online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="budget router" class="if uuid-3147254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/3147254.jpg"></div><p>  Its only drawback is the white color of the case.  Dust and dirt are visible on it.  Therefore, the router is recommended to clean at least weekly.  So this minus is not so significant. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this review, the router model TL-WR841N was considered.  Reviews attribute it to a series of budget network devices.  It is great for home or office use.  Both in the first and in the second case, the number of connected computer networks should not exceed 8 pieces.  Moreover, the more computers, smartphones or tablets connected to it, the lower the speed of information transfer.  This nuance must be taken into account when implementing such information networks.  It essentially has no shortcomings and an impressive list of advantages. </p>
