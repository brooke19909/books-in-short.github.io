  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exchange business: commodity securities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern world is diverse due to millions of the most diverse opportunities to make money and arrange your life.  The exchange is an amazing place where in one second you can become a millionaire or lose everything and stay on the sidelines of life.  With the advent of the exchange, people got the opportunity to earn thanks to their instincts, play adult games and experience a constant sense of risk. </p><p>  People who are familiar with the exchange only in words, think that it is only possible to sell and buy shares and bills on it, they have not heard of other documents.  These are misconceptions, on the stock exchange are traded securities, securities of title, payment securities and others.  There are a huge number of <span>types of securities:</span> it is a complex and voluminous system.  We will dwell in more detail on one form, and consider in more detail commodity securities. </p><p>  By name you can judge that the paper is directly related to the sale of goods.  Such securities cannot be called marketable, but they have a certain value.  Inventory securities are divided into warrants and bills of lading. </p><p>  Warrants.  The word "rights" can be considered a synonym for this concept.  Warrants are such commodity securities, by purchasing which its owner can make a purchase of shares in a certain period of time at a predetermined price.  Agree, this is a very convenient option - you will be sure that the price will not rise, and you will be able to plan your operations, for example, a month in advance.  Warrants are commodity <span>securities</span> that most often join shares and bonds at their initial issue.  Warrant shares and bonds are most popular among exchange participants.  Less commonly, warrants are issued separately from securities.  Most often, warrants are not long-term securities - everything changes very quickly on the exchange, so selling at fixed prices is not always favorable for sellers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are two <span>types of</span> warrant <span>prices</span> : temporary and hidden.  With regard to hidden prices, they make up the difference between the <span>market price of the</span> paper and the price of the warrant.  Temporary prices are the difference between the price in the future and the price in a given time period.  An experienced stock player can earn good money by playing on these values. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, there are also other types of securities of title - bills of lading.  Such securities are required for transactions with goods in <span>foreign trade operations.</span>  Most often it is sea cargo. </p><p>  A bill of lading can be compared with an order, it can be made in the name of the recipient or bearer of the goods.  This is a very important document that does not allow corrections, erasures and adjustments, if something needs to be changed, you will have to draw up a new document.  The bill of lading has a clear structure, the main part of which is the endorsement.  The name of the carrier, receiver and sender, the name of the vessel, the signature of the person in charge and the date of signing the document must be indicated on the back. </p><p>  Foreign trade transactions are a responsible and expensive undertaking, therefore, when they are executed, all the rules must be strictly observed.  The bill of lading testifies to the trust of the sender of the cargo and the carrier's responsibility for its safety.  In addition, the consignee must meet him on time and pay the sender at the agreed time. </p><p>  We briefly told you about commodity securities, but each of them has a lot of its features and rules.  The main thing that needs to be remembered is the following: all securities must be clearly executed, payment is due on time, signatures of the parties responsible are mandatory, and a fine or forfeit is threatened for non-compliance with obligations. </p>
