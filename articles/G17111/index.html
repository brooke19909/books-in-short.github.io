  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accounts payable analysis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Accounts payable</span> arise when the date of provision of services (materials, work or goods) does not correspond to the date of their payment upon fact.  Also, late accrual may relate to contributions to <span>extrabudgetary funds</span> and to the budget.  This also includes payments to staff, contractors, suppliers and other lenders.  In a broader sense, untimely repayment of loans received to various enterprises and banks also refers to this type of debt.  Moreover, it does not matter whether they are short-term or long-term.  The debt of the organization, not paid on time, tends to increase.  So, if at the beginning of the year the amount was, for example, 297,000 rubles, then by the end of the year it would amount to 327,000 rubles.  And this means that its growth will reach 10.1% or 30,000 rubles. </p><p>  Before conducting an analysis of accounts payable of the enterprise, you need to identify which part is unjustified.  It may include: </p><ul><li>  debt on unbilled deliveries; </li><li>  overdue repayment of payments on settlement documents. </li></ul><p>  This type of debt arises through no fault of the enterprise.  In this case, it receives materials from suppliers earlier than the organization and the bank that serves it, settlement documents arrive. </p><p>  When analyzing accounts payable, one should also establish its dynamics, the time of its occurrence, its duration.  In addition, it is necessary to consider its composition, taking into account the <span>documents of the organization.</span> </p><p>  It also happens that accounts payable remain unclaimed, the terms of the claim for it expire (they are three years).  In this case, it is considered part of the profit of the organization for which it was registered. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When analyzing accounts payable, you should pay attention to its other types.  For example, a view consisting of several settlement items.  This is the so-called other debt.  Settlement articles can be both commodity and non-commodity in nature.  This type of late payments includes deposit amounts that were not claimed. </p><p>  When making an analysis of accounts payable of this type, one should also not bypass the question of the time of its occurrence, duration.  It is necessary to take into account the reasons for its appearance, its composition. </p><p>  In order to have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow financially reliable and stable the enterprise is being analyzed, it is necessary to study payment calendars, if any.  In terms of time, they compare the receipts of money and future expenses. </p><p>  There are a number of indicators that indicate that the company can not cope with timely payment of services: </p><ol><li>  This is an absolute <span>past due payable.</span>  Its amount is the amount that remained unpaid at the time of the expiration of a three-month period after the specified repayment date.  This information can be found in the document attached to the balance sheet. </li><li>  Account <span>payable turnover ratio.</span>  This is a <span>relative indicator.</span>  It shows how many times this debt was put into circulation for a specific period of time. </li><li>  This indicator is also relative.  This is the time for which accounts payable are repaid.  In other words, this is the duration of the turnover of the unpaid amount, calculated in days.  For its calculation, a special formula is used.  The number of days included in a given period (as a rule, a year is taken, i.e. 365 days) is divided by the number of accounts payable revolutions completed during this time. </li></ol><p>  Both last indicators give a description of how and how many times an enterprise launches an amount not paid to another organization.  But if the first is expressed as an abstract number (number of revolutions), then the second has a more specific unit of measurement - days. </p><p>  From everything that was said above, it becomes clear that the analysis of accounts payable is very important in compiling the characteristics of the financial stability of the enterprise. </p>
