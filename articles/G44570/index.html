Travelers compare this corner of the island with paradise.  It is here, in an unusually beautiful, special place that everyone who came to Thailand should visit. </p><p>  Nong Nooch Tropical Park is a complex of diverse gardens and parks.  Its area is almost 240 hectares.  It is only 17 km from the city. </p><p>  All year round, guests visiting the park are surprised at the rich colors of plants that are brought here from <span>exotic countries.</span>  Inexplicable feelings along with admiration and amazing memories - those who share this park share such feelings. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  It all started in 1954.  Then Pattaya was an ordinary fishing village located on the coast of the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  To create fruit and vegetable plantations, Mr. Pisit and Madame Nong Nooch Tansaca acquired land in the province of Chonburi. </p><p>  Traveling around the world and visiting famous gardens and parks, Mrs. Nong Nooch completely changed her plans.  She decided that instead of planned vegetable plantations, she would create tropical gardens where exotic trees and flowers would grow. </p><p>  I had to work for a long time.  Mrs. Nong Nooch invited the first visitors to her garden in 1980.  Every year, the number of tourists visiting the Nong Nooch Park is constantly growing.  Thailand accepts travelers from all over the world.  Gradually improving, it became the largest botanical park in southeast Asia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is Nong Nooch Park </h2><p>  Nong Nooch is a huge landscape project.  The <span>styles of Asian</span> and European countries are closely intertwined here.  Next to the sculptures, marvelous houses made in the national Asian style, the European <span>park of Versailles is</span> adjacent <span>.</span>  Shrubs and lawns were given the correct geometric shape. </p>

    <p>  The whole area is divided by park and garden areas.  Between them there are a large number of footpaths, bridges and paths.  The park has built many large ponds, made artificially, fountains.  Open to view pavilions.  Here you can ride on a small railway, take a walk in the zoo, admiring a large number of a wide variety of bright statuettes.  You can see the Nong Nooch garden from below, taking a walk in the park.  To see the beautiful park from above, you can use the suspension bridges located near the tops of the trees.  Plants of the established type flaunt in each park and garden zone. </p><h2>  French garden </h2><p>  The most beautiful place worthy of the highest praise is the French garden, which is characterized by a bizarre combination of classic European design and temples of Thailand.  With particular care, the creation of landscape compositions with amazing clarity of lines, the hardness of geometric shapes.  The appearance of perfectly trimmed trees, borders, trimmed lawns makes one doubt their naturalness.  Tourists who visited the garden, note that, having been here, as if they had visited the world of a fairy tale. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cactus park </h2><p>  This park has a rare collection of cacti.

    <p>  But of particular interest are dwarf palm trees.  These plants have a height of only 30 cm. They gained popularity in Japan in the XVII century.
