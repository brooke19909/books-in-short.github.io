Square and rectangular folding or single products are traditional.  More original postcards in the form of Christmas trees, snowmen, Santa Claus, Snow Maiden.

Older children, especially under the guidance of adults, will also perform more complex products with slotted windows, unusual surface textures, voluminous parts made of paper and other materials, as well as all kinds of decor.  The more parents work hard on the selection of beautiful materials and the selection of interesting technologies, the more interesting and original the process and the result of children's creativity will turn out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  3D do-it-yourself Christmas <span>card</span> for children </h2><p>  Modern materials for decorative and applied works and children's craftsmanship allow you to create very beautiful and spectacular postcards even in the form of flat products, but souvenirs with voluminous details look especially unusual.  You can do this thing in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  applique with embossed decor; </li><li>  in the technique of quilling; </li><li>  with origami elements; </li><li>  in <span>silhouette carving</span> technique and kirigami. </li></ul><p>  Such voluminous postcards are beautiful, even when made of ordinary sheets of white paper, and if you use decorative sheets, then home-made souvenirs will not only be worse than purchased ones, they will turn out to be just fabulous gifts, especially when they are made by children on their own. </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  If you are going to make New Year cards with the hands of children in kindergarten or at home, prepare the following: </p><ul><li>  cardboard, paper (white, color, textured, metallized with a pattern, embossing and other effects); </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  eraser; </li><li>  ruler and other <span>drawing instruments</span> (compasses, stencils); </li><li>  patterns and designs; </li><li>  scissors, stationery knife; </li><li>  <span>curly hole punchers</span> with snowflakes, asterisks (if any) or the usual one that makes round holes; </li><li>  PVA glue or thermal gun (both options are possible); </li><li>  felt-tip pens, <span>colored pencils,</span> gels, sparkles; </li><li>  decorative elements (stickers, sequins, satin ribbons, beads, beads). </li></ul><p>  In fact, nothing complicated and expensive is required.  The main thing is imagination, patience and the desire to do something especially beautiful. </p><h2>  Accordion trees </h2><p>  Such blanks can easily be performed by a child on his own, especially if a diagram is printed or drawn on paper, that is, lines along which bends should be performed.  Similar Christmas cards with children with their own hands can be done quickly.  To complete the Christmas tree in the first way, work according to the following scheme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Take a sheet of green paper and mark it on it in the form of guides located at an equal distance. </li><li>  Fold the workpiece in an accordion. </li><li>  Glue one of the sides of the resulting part so that you get the shape of a triangle. </li></ol><p>  There is a second way. </p><ol><li>  Cut a triangular blank from green paper. </li><li>  Mark out at equal or different distances. </li><li>  Perform folds. </li><li>  The resulting accordion tree can be strung on a wire, decorated with laces, a rod or a beautiful wand. </li></ol>

    <p>  Now go on to build the postcard. </p><ol><li>  Take a sheet of color cardboard and fold it in half. </li><li>  Glue the Christmas tree created by the way you like on the front side of the resulting blank of the postcard. </li><li>  Decorate the green beauty with beads, beads, sequins, thin tinsel. </li><li>  Decorate the background with artificial snow, cotton wool, balls of white <span>crumpled paper,</span> and also glue the snowflakes or circles made by a hole punch that imitate the falling snow. </li></ol><p>  Postcard is ready. </p><h2>  Three-dimensional herringbone </h2><p>  Simple, but beautiful New Year's cards with your own hands together with the children can be made using the same accordions, only in this case take not one blank, but several. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Christmas card ideas with kids" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1150741.jpg" width="496"></div>  A herringbone will form inside the folded postcard.  The product is made as follows.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Prepare strips of green paper (according to the number of tiers of the Christmas tree). </li><li>  Make stripe markings. </li><li>  Bend all workpieces. </li><li>  Glue the accordions folded in half, tiers inside the card.  Thus, when you open the tree will unfold, becoming voluminous.  By the same principle, you can make a base for it (preferably made of white paper).  It will be an excellent imitation of snow. </li></ol><h2>  Volumetric application </h2><p>  This way it is easy to make a variety of New Year's cards with children with their own hands.  As the main element, you can again take the Christmas tree (the simplest), a snowman or a whole plot picture of a winter theme.  Consider the Christmas tree example. <br>  To create a foundation, follow the steps below. </p><ol><li>  Take a rectangular sheet of colored double-sided paper and fold it in half. </li><li>  In the front part, cut a hole of a suitable shape, for example, a rectangular one.  Get a frame.  Proportions choose for yourself. </li><li>  The tree will stick on the right side of the card‚Äôs spread, that is, it will peek out of the window. </li><li>  You can twist the elements of the Christmas tree using the quilling technique or make them from strips of corrugated paper. </li></ol><p>  To work in the first way, you need to perform a few simple manipulations. </p><ul><li>  Cut the green paper into strips about 5 mm wide and twist the parts from them using a toothpick, knitting needle or special tool. </li><li>  Removing the element from the axis, form the desired configuration and glue the edge of the strip with the base and the layers together. </li><li>  Make an image of a Christmas tree from the created parts. </li></ul><p>  To use the second method, work as follows. </p><ul><li>  Cut corrugated paper into wide strips (1.5 - 2cm). </li><li>  Fold the strips according to the type of accordion and make cuts on one side. </li><li>  Expand the workpieces and roll tight rolls from the resulting ribbons.  Glue the last layer with the previous one. </li><li>  Fluff the incisions. </li><li>  Glue the made elements in the form of a Christmas tree silhouette. </li></ul><p>  5. Now decorate the Christmas tree itself, the background and the frame on the front side. </p><p>  6. Sign the card, and on the front side stick the inscription "Happy New Year!". </p><h2>  Origami </h2><p>  This technology allows you to make a New Year's card with your own hands with a child with almost no glue, only cutting and folding paper.  It‚Äôs better to use a template here. <br>  Work is carried out in a strictly defined sequence. </p><ol><li>  Take the Christmas tree blank and print it or draw it on the base sheet. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself Christmas card with a child" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1150754.jpg" width="600"></div>  As you can see, the tree will be formed inside the card along the fold line. </li><li>  Make bends and cuts according to the diagram. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Christmas card ideas with kids" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1150758.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Take the second base sheet and glue both layers so that there are no through holes in the tree. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself Christmas cards with children" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1150759.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Decorate the Christmas tree and background with prepared details. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself Christmas cards with children" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1150752.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Kirigami </h2><p>  The brightest and most joyful holidays, of course, are the New Year.  A do-it-yourself postcard (we make it with children or completely trust the process for the kids) will be a pleasant gift for the New Year, Christmas, and Epiphany. </p><p>  The Kirigami technique is very interesting.  In fact, in this case, the technique of silhouette cutting from the plane of the postcard is used, and then due to the folding of the sheet, the picture becomes three-dimensional. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Christmas card templates for kids" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1150761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to simple drawings in the form of Christmas trees, Christmas balls and snowmen, which are easy to make on your own, you can download very complex, but amazing Christmas card templates on the Internet.  With your own hands for children, you can easily prepare a scheme.  You can cut out complex elements, and entrust the child with folding or cutting large parts. </p><h2>  Christmas tree card </h2><p>  The design of such a card is similar to the version with a harmonious herringbone that occurs when opening a souvenir, only the manufacturing process will take less time.  The volumetric Christmas tree that will appear inside the card when opened is formed not of horizontal elements-tiers, but of vertical Christmas trees. <br>  A similar thing is performed as follows. </p><ol><li>  Prepare the base sheet, folding it in half. </li><li>  Draw a half tree template or print it ready.  On a sheet folded in half, circle the outline of the half of the tree and cut it out. </li><li>  Expand the workpiece.  Here is a neat symmetrical shape. </li><li>  The resulting details need to be made somewhat the same.  A minimum of 3, but better more, then the drop-down design will be more voluminous and spectacular.  It is enough to circle the scheme on one sheet, and the rest - simply fold them together and fasten together or in the form of half-shoes on sheets already folded in half. </li><li>  Cut the required number of blanks for the silhouettes of Christmas trees. </li><li>  If you performed Christmas trees without bending lines, now you need to glue them along the central axis.  Glue the blanks sequentially so that the right side of the first Christmas tree is aligned with the left side of the second, etc. </li><li>  When all the details are connected in a three-dimensional Christmas tree, it will be enough to glue the left part of the free edge to the card on the left, and the right to the right inside of the card; </li><li>  The process of decorating both the tree itself and the space around it can be carried out in any way by all available materials. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, there are many ways to make voluminous New Year cards with children with your own hands.  Choose your favorite idea.  Create original gifts and stimulate your kids to develop creative abilities and other useful qualities. </p>
