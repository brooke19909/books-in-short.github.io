    <p>  Today it is unrealistic to imagine the functioning of the world banking system without cards.  Plastic cards are an integral attribute of the everyday life of almost every citizen. </p><h2>  International payment systems </h2><p>  International payment systems Visa, MasterCard, JCB, American Express, Diners Club operate through a cashless payment system around the world.  The popularity of the system is due to its simplicity, convenience and reliability.  Simply put, many customers keep their savings in bank accounts tied to plastic cards.  If necessary, a person does not use cash to pay, but a card from which the amount demanded for payment is debited.  Sberbank cooperates with two payment systems - MasterCard and Visa. </p>

There is a certain set of rules for the functioning of the system, and all financial institutions are required to obey them.  Being a member of the payment system, the bank performs two functions.  First: produces plastic cards.  Second: conducts their maintenance.  As a rule, a bank combines both of these functions.

    <h2>  How many numbers are there on a Sberbank card </h2><p>  Sberbank is one of the largest banks in Russia.  According to the official web resource of the institution, the number of its clients exceeded 800 thousand people.  And many have at least one plastic card issued by the bank.  And although all the cards are similar in appearance, each of them has its own different number from the others.  Consider the number of digits on the card of Sberbank and what they mean. </p><p>  The first figure defines the industry of the issuer.  In the case of the banking sector, this may be the number 4, 5 or 6. </p><p>  The next five digits are the identifier of the issuer.  In particular, they can be used to determine which payment system the card belongs to: </p><ul><li>  4 determines whether the card belongs to the Visa system; </li><li>  in the range from 51 to 55 - MasterCard; </li><li>  numbers 34 and 37 - American Express; </li><li>  Maestro starts at 6. </li></ul>

    <p>  The number of digits in the number of different cards can be 13 and from 16 to 19. Old-style cards have 13 digits.  Most plastic cards issued today have a 16-digit number.  The number of 18 digits on the Sberbank card is found on <span>Maestro</span> plastic <span>cards.</span>  <span>Cards</span> with 19-digit numbers were most likely issued as supplementary to the primary. </p><h2>  Cards of Sberbank of Russia </h2><p>  There are two types of plastic cards issued by Sberbank of Russia: debit bank cards and credit cards.  Many of them are similar in their parameters and the range of services offered.  But this is only at first glance.  In fact, all cards differ from each other depending on the purpose that is assigned to them. </p><p>  Visa Classic and MasterCard Standard cards are designed for people who often leave the state.  Due to the large number of service points, they are very convenient for traveling. </p>

    <p>  To pay wages, pensions, scholarships, social benefits, one of the most common cards is used - the Maestro-Sberbank card.  How many digits contains its number, each owner can count.  This information is useful when transferring funds between cards, for identification of the holder, in case of contacting the customer service center.  You can find out the card number if it is not at hand by calling the Sberbank hotline.  True, in this case you will have to answer a number of questions (to identify the client). </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Many bank card holders are sure that by keeping their PIN code secret, they can protect themselves from fraudsters.  Alas, this is not so.  Naturally, the PIN code should not be reported to outsiders.  However, this is not enough.  In order to pay for goods on the Internet, it is enough to know how many numbers are on the Sberbank card, what are these numbers, the card expiration date, its security code.  With this information, criminals can easily pay with other people's money.  Therefore, any holder of a plastic bank card should understand that it is better to reliably store all the information that is printed on it. </p>
