    <h2>  A decree is ... </h2><p>  Can I get a loan on maternity leave?  It is difficult to answer this question.  First, find out what is called a decree. </p><p>  So it is customary to describe the period of child care.  A woman goes on vacation shortly before the birth to prepare for the birth of the baby, receiving benefits from the employer.  After the appearance of the newborn, the so-called decree begins - a period of up to 1.5 or up to 3 children.  It stands out so that the mother or any other close person can always be near the baby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The decree provides citizens with monthly payments.  They are either issued by the employer depending on the salary for the last 2 years, or accrued by the state.  This is the constant income of the maternity.  It is different - both scanty, and very worthy.  But can a person take a maternity leave loan? </p><h2>  Basic loan conditions </h2><p>  It is not easy to answer this question.  After all, the decision is made on an individual basis.  And a loan is granted depending on many factors. </p><p>  First, get acquainted with the basic requirements for the borrower.  Banks most often require: </p><ul><li>  age from 18 years (more often - from 21 years); </li><li>  having a good credit history; </li><li>  absence of debt on loans at the time of circulation; </li><li>  the presence of a constant source of income. </li></ul><p>  Based on these requirements, we can conclude that the loan on maternity leave is real.  By law, this is so.  But in practice, they do not really like to meet with mummies.  There are reasons for that.  For example, a high risk of borrower insolvency. </p>

    <h2>  Jars for maternity </h2><p>  Which bank gives credit on maternity leave?  Answer definitely will not work.  By law, all financial institutions can issue a loan to a person caring for a child.  But, as we have said, citizens often face denial of service.  Sometimes this decision is justified. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Banks giving maternity leave loans: </p><ul><li>  VTB; </li><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  UralSib; </li><li>  "Renaissance Credit"; </li><li>  SovKomBank; </li><li>  Gazenergobank. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of financial organizations issuing loans to people on maternity leave.  In general, you can contact any bank with a corresponding request.  It is possible that the company's employees will not be denied service. </p><h2>  Types of loans </h2><p>  Of course, the purpose of lending plays an important role in solving the issue under study.  Allocate different types of loans.  And some of them are available to almost any person, even maternity. </p><p>  Credits are: </p><ul><li>  mortgage - for housing; </li><li>  consumer - for current minor expenses; </li><li>  automobile; </li><li>  urgent - for different needs urgently; </li><li>  on business - for the development of their small business. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can select credit cards.  They are somewhat reminiscent of consumer credit, but getting them is easier.  Perhaps this is all.  Each type of loan has its own characteristics. </p>

    <h2>  Types of maternity </h2><p>  Do they give credit on maternity leave?  In fact yes.  Everyone has a chance to get a loan at any bank.  Indeed, theoretically, the borrower has a source of constant profit - benefits from the employer or from the state. </p><p>  In addition, close relatives of the newborn are divided into several types.  Namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  a person is officially employed, receives benefits and works part-time; </li><li>  a citizen is employed, has an allowance, does not work; </li><li>  the borrower has no job; the allowance is issued by the state; </li><li>  the applicant has his own business and combines it with a decree. </li></ul><p>  In the first and in the latter case, you do not have to worry about the loan.  It is almost 100% likely to be issued.  Moreover, as practice shows, any.  The second category of persons is less likely to succeed.  And as you might guess, if a person receives benefits from the state, then they are unlikely to give him a loan.  Although there are exceptions.  For example, if you prove the urgency and importance of lending. </p><h2>  Loan features </h2><p>  Where to get a maternity leave loan?  In any bank of the Russian Federation.  Especially if a citizen has an additional source of income.  For example, rents an apartment for rent.  In this case, even the lack of employment will not be an obstacle to lending. </p>

    <p>  It is important to remember that the service being studied has a number of features.  The main one is a high percentage on loans.  People on maternity leave are raising interest rates.  Therefore, some prefer not to talk about caring for a child.  Unless to indicate the presence of children.  This will only positively affect the request - banks trust family people more. </p><p>  In addition, a person will definitely have to confirm his income.  And therefore, it is necessary to bring a maximum of papers with you to the bank - from form 2-NDFL to extracts from the PFR or MFC.  It all depends on the situation.  People on maternity leave often do not have time to collect evidence of their income.  In this case, you can not hope for a loan. </p><h2>  No bounce anywhere </h2><p>  Loans on maternity leave do not give out very willingly.  Especially if a person does not have a permanent decent source of income.  In this case, you can count on consumer lending in small amounts. </p><p>  But every citizen has the right to get a credit card.  For example, in Sberbank.  To do this, it is enough to have a residence permit in the Russian Federation, be a citizen of the country and reach a minimum of 21 years. </p><p>  The request is made either at the bank or through the Sberbank Online system.  Similarly, you can contact any financial institution.  Most often, banks put forward the same requirements for the client when issuing credit cards. </p>

    <h2>  Getting a card </h2><p>  To take a loan on maternity leave, you just need to get yourself the appropriate plastic.  It is advisable to do this in the selected bank in person.  Online applications are not accepted everywhere. </p><p>  To get a credit card, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Collect documents: passport, registration, income statements (preferably). </li><li>  Contact the selected bank and draw up an application for a credit card. </li><li>  Choose a credit card. </li><li>  Submit a processing request. </li><li>  Get the finished plastic at the appointed time. </li></ol><p>  Simple, fast and convenient.  It is advisable not to focus on your status.  It is possible that the bank will increase the interest rate on the loan (even on plastic) for the person caring for the child. </p><h2>  Documents for a regular loan </h2><p>  Now consider the procedure for obtaining a loan without cards.  A maternity leave loan is indeed issued.  But not always.  And not all types. </p><p>  Extremely careful attention should be paid to the preparation of a package of documents for the implementation of ideas.  The thing is that the applicant is required to: </p><ul><li>  identification; </li><li>  Help with registration; </li><li>  document in the form of 2-personal income tax. </li></ul><p>  The main difficulty is proving your income.  If a citizen in the decree receives only benefits from the state, then you will have to contact the social protection service to indicate the amount of assistance to the family. </p><p>  Other profits must also be confirmed.  For example, extracts from the FIU or property lease agreements.  These are the most difficult situations. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  Taking a loan while on maternity leave is easy.  But only if you properly prepare for the procedure.  What to do in this or that case? </p><p>  The algorithm of actions is not much different from the procedure for obtaining a credit card.  The only difference is that employees will ultimately sign a loan agreement, and not give out plastic from a financial institution. </p>

    <p>  A guide to taking a loan with maternity loans can be imagined as follows: </p><ol><li>  Form a package of documents.  We already spoke about him. </li><li>  Choose a loan that I would like to get. </li><li>  Contact the bank with the appropriate request. </li><li>  Wait for a response from a financial institution. </li><li>  Sign a loan agreement and receive cash. </li></ol><p>  It turns out that everything is not so complicated.  Especially if you specify in advance which bank gives credit on maternity leave on certain conditions.  It is advisable to contact large financial organizations.  There, the probability of failures is less. </p><h2>  About the size of loans </h2><p>  We figured out <span>how to get a</span> maternity leave loan.  It is important to understand that the decision of the company is often affected by the purpose of the loan and its size. </p><p>  Small amounts are recommended.  The higher the loan, the more a citizen should have an official income.  Otherwise, they will refuse to lend.  This is a completely normal and legal phenomenon. </p><p>  On average, Sberbank gives out cash loans of up to 100,000 rubles.  They have the least problems.  Failures almost do not occur.  For more significant loans, it is better to choose the time after the decree or to prove the fact of obtaining additional profit. </p><h2>  Loan features </h2><p>  Now a few words about the features of each type of loan.  Some of them are not issued to decrees, only as an exception. </p><p>  For example, mortgage lending to caregivers is available.  Especially if this is the second baby in the family, and the borrower earns money or receives good payments from the employer.  You can send maternity capital to repay the loan.  So many are doing today. </p><p>  Oddly enough, a car loan can also be obtained, but there are more problems with it.  It is enough to have about 40% of the total loan amount.  Then the maternity ward will not be refused.  Nevertheless, car loans over time cause a lot of trouble. </p><p>  Consumer loans are issued without much work to almost everyone.  Often you can get a loan right in the store, and then pick up the purchased item.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><p>  For a loan for a small business, you must have a deposit.  In this case, the maternity woman will be able to get a loan.  But, as practice shows, there are problems with the pledge.  This means that additional subsidies are not available to everyone.  The securities listed above will have to report certificates of ownership of the collateral. </p><p>  Urgent loans are most often issued by passport.  They are accessible to all adults.  But you should not take them - credit conditions are not the most favorable. </p><p>  There are also so-called microloans.  It is better to refuse them to the majority, and not only to maternity wards.  Microloans provide a high interest rate.  And even the slightest debt collectors knock out. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  You can get a loan while on maternity leave.  This is a fairly common occurrence.  Especially among those who work on maternity leave and have additional sources of income.  When receiving the minimum allowance from the state, one should not count on a loan.  In Russia, such payments are made from the applicant by the insolvent borrower. </p><p>  Otherwise, the operation under study has no particular features.  When applying for loans, some experts recommend being silent about caring for a child.  Simply indicate the presence of children.  So the chances of a positive response will only increase. </p><p>  If the applicant was denied one bank, you can submit a request to another.  As practice shows, parental leave is not an obstacle to lending. </p><p>  What else do experts advise?  For example, a spouse or close relative can apply for a loan.  A similar scenario is quite common.  In fact, then the loan will be requested by another person who is not connected with maternity leave. </p>
