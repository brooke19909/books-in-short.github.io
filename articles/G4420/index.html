And once here, on the banks <span>of the Kola River, there</span> was only one hut of a Pomodor fisherman named Semyon Korzhov or Korzhnov, or Korzhnev (more precisely, the surname was not established), as the legend says.  He was the owner of the land here - Kildin Pogost.  Later, a small village appeared, but the islands, the lake and the brook flowing from it, have since been called Semenovskys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murmansk Semenov Lake" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2175346.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Gradually rich in natural gifts, the polar places began to attract Russian seekers and merchants.  For the first time in the annals, the mention of the <span>Kola Peninsula</span> is found in the X-XI centuries.  The camp of the Lapps (Sami) was growing.  Fisheries, and fur trade flourished, only the Normans (Norwegians) or Murmansk, Danes and Swedes constantly claimed this territory.  The patronage of Russian immigrants helped to repel raids, but the Arctic became completely Russian only by the middle of the XIX century.  How did this happen? </p><p>  From the village in the second half of the 19th century the city of Romanov-on-Murman was formed, and already in 1917 it was renamed Murmansk. </p><p>  It is hard to imagine that on the site of the largest city of the Russian Arctic - Murmansk, after regular bombing of fascist aircraft in 1945, only 3 houses remained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park Murmansk Semenovskoe lake" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2175370.jpg"></div>

Semenovskoe Lake Murmansk is a prime example.  This picturesque place has a pleasant stay with family or friendly company.  It was here in May 2013 that it was opened on the territory of the cultural and park complex named after O.P.  Naydenova is the only amusement park on Lake Semenovskoye in Murmansk. </p><p>  The park complex itself has existed here for a long time.  He gradually ennobled, developed.  It is with pleasure that both children and adults visit the aquarium, the Lapland Center for Children and Children, and an entertainment town for children.  On warm summer days, you can admire the fountain, which is located directly in the Semenovsky Lake of Murmansk.  There is also a boat station with catamarans and ATVs that can be rented.  In winter, a skating rink is poured, ski slopes are laid. </p><p>  In addition to entertainment, there are many cafes and restaurants in the park on the Semenovskoye Lake in Murmansk, where a vacation company can have a tasty meal, relax, and take shelter from a sudden rain.  Skateboarding is developing, scooters ride along the alleys, there are bicycle paths.  For older travelers, comfortable benches are installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park on semenovsky lake murmansk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2175338.jpg"></div>

There is a fabulous walking train that will have fun for the little one.  There are trampolines where even the most energetic child jumps, as well as an attraction with bumper cars "Cheesecakes" - a circuit.  This is an exciting pastime for children, and especially for dads and mothers.  In total, more than 20 attractions for different ages and preferences. </p><p>  A few years ago, “Fun Slides” was technically updated, and now they are really fun - this can be understood from the laughter coming from there.  Here the Romashka carousel is installed, where the whole family will ride at the same time, as well as the Ferris Wheel, from where a panoramic view of the surroundings is available, and you can take unique photos of Lake Semenovskoye (Murmansk).  There are pavilions where prize games, a shooting gallery, a 5D cinema attraction are located. </p><p>  All the rides are bright, colorful, and when the lights turn on in the evening, then parents, like the children, may think that they are in a fabulous country where they want to return. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Semenovskoe Lake Murmansk photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2175504.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fun for the little ones </h2><p>  The amusement park on the Semenovskoye Lake in Murmansk provides entertainment for children - for children from 1.5 years.  These are funny trains, where, accompanied by an adult, the baby will roll, sitting in a bright booth.  There is a usual swing, a playground - “Rocking chairs”, where the little one hones her skills in making figures in the sandbox.  And the entertaining "Children's Fishing" did not leave a single kid indifferent - neither a boy, nor a girl.  So great to catch a fish yourself. </p><p>  And to attract large families, special discounts are provided on the map of the amusement park on Lake Semenovsky. </p><h2>  Favorite vacation spot of citizens </h2><p>  In summer, the park hosts fun events, such as “Visiting a Fairy Tale”, “Ice Cream Day”, the holiday “Tykvograd” and many others.  And for children they organize holiday programs every weekend. </p><p>  Here are competitions in the national Sami games, and this is a fascinating sight in the Arctic.  The "Amusement Park" hosts mass festivities dedicated to local and state festive dates. </p><p>  The festive salute is reflected in the smooth surface of the water and creates a sense of magic, keeping the festive atmosphere in memory for a long time.  And the fountain that beats from the lake adds extravaganza. </p><p>  And it is worth visiting the cafe “Izba of Grandfather Semen”.  Such a barbecue, as here, nowhere else to taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions on the Semenovsky lake Murmansk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2175334.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Amusement Rides </h2><p>  Official opening hours are from 11:00 to 20:00.  But in fact, employees work until the last client leaves the entertainment complex. </p><p>  Some attractions in the amusement park on Lake Semenovskoye work in the winter, too, until the air temperature drops below -15 ° Ϲ.  This is an excellent occasion to spend time outdoors in the cold snow season. </p><p>  The park area is kept clean.  The administration makes every effort to landscaping the surrounding area.  As before, Semenovskoye Lake in Murmansk is surrounded by a limitless forest zone - this beautiful green sea and tundra stretches to the horizon and further. </p>
