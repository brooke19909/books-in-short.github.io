Such establishments are increasingly opening up even in regions that cannot be called "paradise sunny corners."  In this article we will tell you about one of them. </p><h2>  City Kogalym </h2><p>  This is a small town located in the Tyumen region in the north of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, between the rivers Kirill-Vysyagun and Ingu-Yagun.  The area of ​​the city of Kagalym is only twenty and a half square kilometers.  Its name is translated from the Khanty language as “black spot”, “swamp”. </p><p>  The city is located in the Surgut lowland, on the Central Ob lowland.  Countless swamps and endless taiga massifs densely surrounded the city from all sides.  The climate in Kogalym is sharply continental.  Severe winters sometimes last up to seven months of the year, with frosts reaching -50 ° C, and summers are very short and cold.  These places are characterized by rather significant and frequent differences in atmospheric pressure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kommersant.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Kogalym" class="if uuid-2233471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2233471.jpg"></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Once upon a time in the village, which was located on the site of the current city, lived no more than a thousand people.  When oil and gas companies appeared here, the population of Kogalym began to grow rapidly.  More than 44 thousand people already lived in the city in 1989, by 2005 this figure had reached 57 thousand people.  Today, more than 62 thousand people live in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy soggy water park" class="if uuid-2233472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2233472.jpg"></div><h2>  “Galaxy” - water park in Kogalym </h2><p>  Frosty long winters, short and cool summers, a climate completely not reminiscent of a tropical paradise - all this, at first glance, does not allow the inhabitants of this northern city to even dream of warmth, gentle waves and relaxation.  But recently it has become possible, and you can experience all these pleasant sensations without leaving the village. </p><p>  To do this, just visit the SCC “Galaxy” - a water park in the city of Kogalym, where excellent conditions for recreation are created.

You can book a ticket, contact the administration regarding the organization of the party, sign up for classes with an instructor or ask questions of interest to you by calling the Galaxy water park in Kogalym, which is listed on its official website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekskursii-sochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kogalym water park" class="if uuid-2232485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2232485.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost of visiting </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this is the only water park in Kogalym, prices at Galaktai for vacation are quite affordable.  Children under a meter in height are free to enter the water park, for children up to 140 centimeters in height, parents will have to pay between 500 rubles for two hours on weekdays and 650 rubles on weekends.  For four hours of rest on weekdays they will ask 750 rubles, and on weekends they will have to pay a thousand.  A full day of rest for a child will cost a thousand rubles on weekdays and a half on a weekend. </p><p>  Tickets for adults (from fourteen years old) are more expensive: in two hours - from 800 (on weekdays) to a thousand rubles (on a weekend).  The cost of a four-hour vacation will cost you 1200-1500 rubles.  From 2000 to 2200 rubles you have to pay for the whole day of rest.  Not such a big amount for a piece of summer in the midst of a harsh winter. </p><p>  Parents with one or two children will be able to rest for four hours at the “Happy Baby” tariff: on weekdays - 2000 rubles, on weekends - 2500. The same cost of common leisure for large and low-income families (no more than six people). </p><p>  The administration of the complex provides discounts to those who have a birthday, some categories of the population are provided with benefits: people who accompany disabled people of the first group, labor veterans, disabled people of the second and third groups, pensioners.  Disabled people of the first group and children with disabilities rest for free in the water park. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Probably, it is not necessary to say that the complex that appeared in this northern city very quickly became one of the most popular and most visited vacation spots of citizens.  Judging by the reviews, the water park "Galaxy" in Kogalym attracts guests with large pools, an excellent system of purification and filtration of water, a large area, a great opportunity to rest and relax. </p><p>  Another advantage of the complex is the presence of a children's town.  Such a decision, according to guests, is convenient in terms of the diversity of entertainment for young visitors, and ensures their safety.  The disadvantages of the guests include a small number of complex attractions and a ticket payment system for children, which takes into account not only the age, but also the growth of the baby. </p>
