    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The four-star hotel called Raina Beach is located in a small resort village called Incekum.  The distance to the nearest settlement - the village of Konakly - is two kilometers, and to the center of Alanya - 22 kilometers.  Buses regularly run between all the settlements here, so you can always go to the city, where a lot of restaurants, clubs, bars, shops, souvenir shops and other establishments are concentrated.  The closest international airport to Raina Beach Hotel is in Antalya.  The distance to it is about 100 kilometers.  Thus, the journey from the air harbor to the hotel will take you about an hour and a half.  You won‚Äôt be bored on the road, as you can admire beautiful landscapes through the window of a bus or car, as well as listen to an interesting guide's story about this region and the country as a whole (in case the transfer is provided by a travel agency).  Recently, most travelers are trying to choose new hotels in Turkey for their stay.  However, it should be noted that not all of them have their own beach.  As for the four-star hotel ‚ÄúRaina Beach‚Äù (Incekum), it has its own wonderful sandy beach.  It is only 25 meters away.  Here, the services of vacationers are not only sunbeds, mattresses and umbrellas, but also equipment for sports and entertainment on the water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

So, populate arriving tourists in rooms as a rule should start after 14:00.  However, the hotel staff always tries to do everything possible to reduce the waiting time in case of early arrival of guests.

Some travelers note the not entirely successful layout of their rooms, but this did not become a serious problem.  The rooms were cleaned regularly.  Sometimes the maids forgot to replace the towels, but the reception desk quickly resolved the situation. </p><p>  A little surprised our compatriots hotel staff.  So, most of the employees here are ‚Äúmultifunctional‚Äù.  For example, you can see the administrator fixing the crane, etc. However, all employees are friendly, helpful, and conscientious. </p><p>  As for food, for the most part, guests recognized its level as quite worthy of a four-star hotel.  So, the food here was quite diverse.  For lunch and dinner, tourists were offered a variety of meat and fish dishes.  In addition, there was a sufficient selection of vegetables, fruits, snacks and desserts. </p><p>  Pleasant impressions among tourists remained from the hotel beach.
