  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital prefix. How to choose, configure and connect it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Digital prefix.  This is the name of the device for watching television in a modern format.  Today, almost every house has a TV-receiver, which means that this year many Russians will have to buy a tuner (receiver).  These names also apply to the same digital set-top box.  What is the difference between analog television and what is replacing it now? </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth mentioning that with analog broadcasting, each channel has its own frequency.  Digital stations are united in the so-called "multiplexes".  Also, these groups can include digital radio stations.  For example, now in Russia there are two multiplexes.  The total number of television channels in them is equal to twenty.  This also includes three digital radio stations: Radio of Russia, Vesti FM and Mayak.  A digital set-top box is required to view these multiplexes. </p><h2>  Built-in and external models </h2><p>  Some televisions have the ability to display TV in a modern format without the need to connect digital set-top boxes to them, since such a device is already built into them.  How to find out that the TV model is endowed with such a function?  To do this, look at the instructions of the device.  Information about this often also indicates the product packaging. </p><h2>  Broadcast standard </h2><p>  In addition to the information that the TV is equipped with a built-in digital set-top box, the documentation should also indicate the format with which this device can work.  In Russia, digital television is broadcast in the DVB ‚Äì T2 standard.  The abbreviation can be deciphered as "second generation digital television" (short for English words).  It will be possible to set up digital broadcasting only if the device is designed to work with this particular standard.  If the instructions specify a different format, for example, DVB ‚Äì C, then watching a new generation of television using it is possible only in those countries where such a standard is accepted, but not in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If your TV has the function of viewing digital TV, then all that remains is to set it up correctly.  This procedure will be described in detail at the end of the article about digital consoles.  Now is the time to talk about what to do if the TV model is not equipped with a built-in device for receiving modern TV. </p><h2>  External device </h2><p>  In this case, you should consider buying a digital set-top box.  Fortunately, there are many such equipment in stores now.  In addition, it is usually placed in a prominent place, since this product is currently in great demand and will not lose its popularity in the foreseeable future.  Why?  It is known that this year they promise to completely complete the transition to a digital television format.  Analog broadcasting, which has existed in our country for more than half a century, will be gradually turned off. </p><p>  The final cessation of broadcasts of this standard is scheduled for the summer months.  At the end of this period, only regional channels will remain in analog mode.  But gradually they will be transferred to the "figure".  Therefore, do not wait until your TV stops showing your favorite shows and think about purchasing a digital set-top box. </p><h2>  Variety of models </h2><p>  As a rule, television tuners differ from each other by the presence or absence of certain additional functions.  The most useful of them can be considered a recording of television programs, as well as "Time Shift" - a shift in the display time.  Also, it may not be superfluous to play various media files (video, audio, photo).  Some consoles can be connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi, which makes it possible to watch videos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.activ8me.net.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wi-Fi logo" class="if uuid-3155599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3155599.jpg"></div><p>  But if you are not interested in these functions, then you can safely buy one of the most affordable models, the main thing is that the device provides stable signal reception. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Having purchased the model you like, the user, as a rule, is faced with the problem of how to connect a digital set-top box. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homedepot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV antenna" class="if uuid-3155588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3155588.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, you need to connect an antenna to it that can receive television waves in the decimeter range.  Such devices are not very rare, since some analog channels were transmitted at the same frequencies.  When the antenna is connected through a special ‚Äúsocket‚Äù on the back of the device, it's time to ‚Äúdock‚Äù the set-top box and the TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lovemyauto.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prefix Connectors" class="if uuid-3155584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3155584.jpg"></div><p>  How to connect a <span>digital set-top box to a TV?</span>  Most often, an HDMI or RCA connector is intended for this purpose (to which the Russian people gave the beautiful nickname "tulip").  If the connectors on the TV and on the receiver do not match, then it is possible to connect using an adapter.  If you have a stereo system, then it can be connected to the console via the tulip connector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="RCA cable" class="if uuid-3155612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3155612.jpg"></div><p>  When all the above steps are completed, it remains only to figure out how to configure the digital set-top box. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  The easiest option is to use the automatic channel search, called from the menu.  If it did not succeed, then the broadcast frequencies in your area will need to be specified manually. </p><p>  After this, the connection process can be considered complete, the same can be said about the article, which briefly talked about digital set-top boxes. </p>
