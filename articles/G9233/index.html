    <h2>  Trust or not </h2><p>  A wide range of short-term loans (from 13 to 75 weeks) helps customers to borrow money for their needs.  Here you can also get a loan by wire transfer - it is convenient and profitable.  After all, you don’t have to specially go to the office of this organization to get a loan, but you can just specify the address and wait for the money from Nano-Finance.  Reviews always help people figure out how the institution works, how many disadvantages it has and what benefits it has.  After that, you can determine for yourself whether you can trust this organization or get a loan in another place, at more favorable interest and for a longer period. </p><h2>  The main types of loans and their interest rates </h2><p>  Credit "Special" allows you to get from 10 thousand to 50 thousand rubles.  <span>The interest rate</span> is 3% of the amount of debt per week.  This loan is issued for 52 weeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A "universal" loan can be obtained for a period of 13 weeks, the amount is available from 15 thousand to 30 thousand rubles, i.e.  You can draw up a contract for any amount in this limit in increments of 5,000 rubles. </p><p>  A loan under the Pension program is available to everyone in the <span>Nano-Finance</span> organization <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about this type of loan are good because people are offered a low interest rate.  It takes into account the fact that pensioners who do not have large funds and are used to saving on everything can take advantage of this program.  The loan term in this case will be 52 weeks, and the <span>interest rate will</span> be no more than 2.62% of the principal amount per week. </p>

    <h2>  Credit "Elite" and "VIP" - effective interest </h2><p>  Very popular in this organization are loans under the Optimal Loan and Convenient programs.  Small interest (up to 6.31%), a long period (up to 52 weeks) and you can get up to 50 thousand rubles in a few minutes.  You can also get a loan "VIP" and "Elite" in the organization "Nano-Finance".  Reviews about these programs are very diverse.  However, it is necessary to study lending schemes in more detail so that later it doesn’t turn out that the money was received, the contract is drawn up, and the borrower does not know what period of repayment has been granted to him or what interest rate he will have to repay the debt.  The term for making payments, which will reduce the loan, is increased to 75 weeks here - this is convenient for each client.  The interest rate for these programs will be minimal and equal to from 2.46% to 6.14% per week of the amount of the main debt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Basic requirements for documents and the borrower </h2><p>  Applications for a microloan are accepted only from citizens of the Russian Federation who have reached the age of 18 to 75 years.  Applications are reviewed within a few hours.  If a citizen who wants to receive money on credit is not 22 years old, then he must provide a guarantee of one of the parents.  This document, together with a passport and an application, is submitted to the credit department of Nano-Finance.  The feedback on the work of this financial institution is good, and therefore you can turn to its help for a loan to purchase expensive equipment, to make repairs, pay for training or treatment.  In order to receive a loan “Optimal”, “Pension”, “Special”, registration in an identity document must coincide with the actual place of residence. </p>

    <h2>  How fast will the application be reviewed </h2><p>  To receive money, you can call or call the specialists on the website of the Nano-Finance company.  The customer reviews of any such institution are always true, and therefore, having read them, we can conclude about the work of the organization.  Only after that you can safely contact the LLC and get money in debt.  When the initial data will be provided to the company, it is necessary to make an appointment with the house manager at the specified address so that all documents can be completed.  If the decision is positive, then the money is transferred to a plastic card or to the client’s bank account.  It is worth noting that through the CONTACT transfer system it is also realistic to receive money from Nano-Finance LLC.  Reviews say that in this way to purchase funds is much faster and easier. </p>

Payment can be made by bank transfer or through special terminals, which are usually located in all major supermarkets and other similar institutions.  If there is a delay or non-payment of the weekly loan amount, then a fine of 500 rubles may be charged. </p><h2>  Everyone can apply! </h2><p>  Everyone needs money without exception, but there are situations in our life when they are urgently needed.  In this case, a successful and modern company called "Nano-Finance" will help.
