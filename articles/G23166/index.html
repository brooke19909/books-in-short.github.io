It is also always pleasant to spend time in the rooms - a great atmosphere, a wonderful view from the window, comfortable beds and modern appliances make the rest really comfortable.  Tourists also highlight local cuisine, because in restaurants you can always eat, and chefs try to please their guests with new delicious dishes.  On the territory of the hotel there is always something to do, but the proximity to one of the most beautiful beaches is the main advantage of the hotel.  The weather in Limassol is perfect for relaxing, not only in the summer, but also in the spring and autumn months. </p><p>  Guests always thank the hotel staff who are attentive and kind to the guests.
