  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political Science Methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the historical formation of political thought, the main <span>research methods</span> in political science gradually developed.  This historical development can be divided into several periods. </p><p>  The time period until the 19th century is considered a classic period.  During this period, such methods of political science as moral-axiological, logical-philosophical and deductive were introduced. </p><p>  The period from the 19th century to 20, researchers define as the institutional period.  At this time, normative-institutional and historical-comparative methods of political science come first. </p><p>  The behavioral period lasted from the 1920s through the 1970s.  At this stage, mainly quantitative methods of political science were introduced. </p><p>  In the last third of the 20th century, the post-behaviorist period began.  At this stage, traditional and new methods of political science are combined. </p><p>  Since the days of Aristotle and Plato, a comparative (comparative) means of analysis and evaluation of the theory has been known.  It is based on a comparison of two (or more) political objects.  Using this tool, it becomes possible to establish common features of objects or determine their differences.  The use of comparative <span>political analysis</span> allows us to develop a system of political knowledge that can be verified, to evaluate institutions, experience, behavior and procedures based on causal relationships.  In addition, this tool provides an opportunity to predict the consequences, trends and events. </p><p>  <span>The sociological method of</span> political science is a complex of techniques and means of certain sociological studies.  These studies are aimed at collecting and processing facts of political life taking place at the moment.  The means of sociological research should include questionnaires, surveys, statistical analyzes, experiments, mathematical modeling.  Based on the collected rich factual material, it becomes possible to study processes and phenomena. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The anthropological method, closely associated with human nature, is quite common when analyzing the institutions of power, mechanisms, and means of social control that existed mainly in <span>pre-industrial society.</span>  This method can also be applied in assessing the problems of transformation and adaptation of traditional control tools in the transition from classical systems to modern ones. </p><p>  The study of subjective mechanisms of behavior, character traits, individual qualities, typical means of logical motivation in politics is based on the psychological method of political science.  It is based on the outstanding ideas of Seneca, Aristotle, Russo, Machiavelli and other thinkers.  Among the sources of the modern psychological method, the ideas of psychoanalysis are of great importance. </p><p>  In a sense, a revolution in the science of politics was made by the behaviorist method, which was formed as an alternative to the legal one.  The behavioral method of analysis and evaluation is based on a certain ‚Äúindividualization‚Äù.  The followers of this method consider politics as an independent social phenomenon, a type of social behavior of groups (or individuals), characterized by motivations and attitudes that are closely connected with the rule and power. </p><p>  The use of expert assessments as a method of analysis is advisable in solving various unformalized problems.  These include the development of a <span>managerial decision, the</span> forecast of <span>political development, and</span> an assessment of the situation. </p><p>  To develop a cybernetic model of the process, a communicative method is used.  In this case, political interactions are explored as informative flows.  The main thing is the decision and reaction to it. </p><p>  <span>The modeling method</span> involves the study of political phenomena and processes through the development and study of models.  It should be noted that today it is the most promising way. </p>
