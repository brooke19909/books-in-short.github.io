It features a stylish design, ease of control of a multimedia player and support for a sufficiently large memory card.  In addition to this, the <span>Nokia X3</span> is compact and light in weight.  The price of this model is also pleasing.  The following is a review of a mobile phone that will reveal all the pros and cons, talk about innovations and functionality, and also help you decide on a purchase. </p><h2>  Mobile Phone Overview </h2><p>  The first in the line of such sliders, <span>Nokia X3 has</span> become a solid alternative to multimedia phones from other manufacturers.  At the same time, he wins in price and his external attractiveness.  Although it is considered a budget model, in terms of quality and characteristics, especially media, it is not inferior to even more expensive models of the same brand. </p>

    <p>  It is presented in several colors at once.  Included with it are branded headphones, a charger, a microSD card with 2 GB of memory, a USB cable, a set of soft ‚Äúcaps‚Äù for headphones, a user manual and a book with a detailed description of how to use the Ovi store. </p><p>  The phone holds a good charge.  Due to the not very large screen diagonal and moderate color saturation, this model can work in standby mode for up to 7 days.  At the same time, the battery will not completely drain, and it will still be possible to make calls on the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The amount of internal memory in the phone is very small, only 40 MB.  This is very small for a multimedia model, so a 2 GB card is included.  In total, this phone can read flash drives up to 16 GB. </p><p>  The back cover opens tight.  If the phone falls, it will not open and will help protect the battery from damage.  The weight of the phone is small.  Speaking on it is convenient.  He does not slip out of his hand, does not fog up and can be operated in speakerphone mode. </p><p>  <span>Nokia X3</span> does not support Symbian technology, therefore, programs written for this system are not compatible with the device.  It is implemented on the 40 series platform (sixth edition), so it works quietly with applications written in the Java language.  And this fully compensates for the lack of support for Symbian. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The front side of the phone is made of plexiglass.  Along the display, implemented on the basis of a TTF-matrix (more than 260 thousand colors), on the left are buttons for quick access to multimedia.  The resolution of the screen itself is 240x320 pixels.  Due to the reflectivity, the screen remains bright, all the inscriptions are readable, and the images visible on it from almost any angle. </p>

    <p>  There are practically no <span>blind spots</span> on this display.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons that makes the Nokia X3 phone an optimally profitable model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The buttons on the top panel are sensitive and comfortable.  <span>The volume control</span> is located on the right, and the hole for the memory card is on the left.  Headphones and a charger are connected via ports located on the top edge of the phone. </p><p>  This phone has a soft keyboard.  Thanks to this, the main buttons are soft, work without sticking, and are not afraid of falls.  The keyboard itself is equipped with a backlight that automatically turns on when you move the top panel.  Despite the fact that this model is a slider, the <span>key lock</span> function on it is also supported. </p>

    <p>  The combination of buttons to switch the layout and disable the T9 dictionary has remained unchanged.  In addition to the multimedia buttons on the top panel, this phone is no different from other Nokia models in its control. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There is only one camera in the phone, located on the rear panel.  The resolution of its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã3.2 megapixels.  In addition, it is possible to shoot average quality videos.  Despite having a camera in the Nokia X3, the features of this phone show that it was designed as a budget phone for multimedia playback. </p><p>  On the case on the right there is a button for quick access to the camera, which works only when the keyboard is unlocked. </p>

    <p>  The quality of the received photos is average, yet this phone is designed for completely different purposes.  The built-in editor allows you to use several basic effects (black and white picture, sepia, etc.).  Photos are more convenient to store on a removable flash card, in the slider itself, as mentioned above, there is too little built-in memory. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  In this model, there are two speakers: communication (internal) and external (for hands-free calling or listening to music without headphones).  The speakerphone is comparable in power to its sound in small desktop speakers for a computer. </p>

    <p>  Sound quality is a hallmark of this model.  The speakers of this phone are not only powerful, but also capable of transmitting bass frequencies well.  This makes listening to music on such a phone a real pleasure. </p><p>  The battery capacity is 860 mAh, which guarantees more than 25 hours of continuous sound.  You can download songs to your phone in 3 ways at once: </p><ul><li>  connect to a computer via a USB cable and download your favorite songs; </li><li>  Download them via Bluetooth from another device that supports this technology; </li><li>  Download from Ovi Store. </li></ul><p>  A multimedia player is not the only way to listen to music.  This model has a built-in FM tuner with the ability to memorize your favorite radio stations.  It is powerful enough to guarantee the quality of signal reception.  You can listen to the radio without a headset connected, which is different from the Nokia X3 from some other similar models from other manufacturers, where the reception of a radio signal is impossible for headphones. </p><p>  The phone also plays FLV video and various flash animations, thanks to the support of Adobe Flash plugins. </p><h2>  Nokia X3: price </h2><p>  This model from Nokia belongs to the budget line.  But the price for it can vary from region to region.  It is more profitable to buy it in large chain stores selling mobile phones.  There, the cost of the gadget starts at 3250 rubles.  In smaller retail stores it can go up to 4,500. </p><p>  There is nothing superfluous in Nokia X3, the interface is convenient and clear.  The phone itself is reliable: it can survive a fall from a small height without any significant damage and malfunction.  By purchasing this model, you can immediately see for what functional features money is given.  Fans of good music will appreciate the Nokia X3. </p>
