  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a compulsory medical insurance policy, what documents are needed for this</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Compulsory health insurance protects the interests of citizens of the Russian Federation in the field of health.  In the life of every person, situations arise where medical attention may be required, be it a sudden illness or an annual preventive examination.  The <span>compulsory medical insurance policy</span> guarantees that a citizen will be provided with medical care in any city, on the territory of the whole country.  What is the principle of its action and how to get a <span>compulsory medical insurance policy?</span> </p><p>  Prior to the onset of 2011, rules were in force in Russia, according to which working citizens received a compulsory medical insurance policy from their employer.  2011 brought some changes, now you can get a policy not only at the place of work, but also independently, in an insurance company. </p><p>  In order to find out how to get the MHI policy, you can go to the site of the territorial department of health insurance, there is all the detailed information.  A citizen has all the rights to choose an insurance organization.  Old policies received before 2011 are also valid; they can be used until replaced with a new document. </p><p>  In order to get a medical policy, you need to make a few simple steps.  Firstly, an application is submitted to the <span>insurance medical organization</span> stating information about which company you want to insure in.  After that, after a certain time, in the territorial fund you will be awarded a policy or a temporary certificate. </p><p>  In addition to the application to the insurance company, you will need to provide some more documents: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - for children under 14 years of age, <span>a birth certificate,</span> SNILS, passport of one of the parents is required; </p><p>  - for citizens of Russia over 14 years of age, a passport (or a document replacing it) and SNILS are required. </p><p>  - For people who fit the definition of ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù, the question often arises of how to get a policy in the Russian Federation.  To do this, they must present a certificate of refugee status or a certificate that the assignment of this status is under consideration by the official authorities; </p><p>  - citizens of other states permanently residing in Russia provide a residence permit, passport, and SNILS to obtain a policy. </p><p>  How to get a compulsory medical insurance policy for stateless persons?  For this, a representative of this category of the population must also write a statement to the territorial <span>health insurance fund</span> and provide a document proving that this person does not really have Russian citizenship. </p><p>  Since 2011, a medical policy is issued prematurely and must be replaced only in some cases: </p><p>  - if a citizen changes his last name, first name or patronymic; </p><p>  - when changing the place of residence; </p><p>  - if the policy has not been issued to a citizen before or has been lost by him; </p><p>  - if the insured has expressed a desire to change the insurance company. </p><p>  Sometimes citizens ask themselves how to get a compulsory medical insurance policy if unusual situations occur, for example, a change in gender or date of birth.  In such cases, you just need to submit an application to the insurance company to reissue the policy and upon presentation of the required documents to receive a medical policy. </p><p>  The health insurance policy is fully valid in the entire state, regardless of which subject of the Russian Federation was issued.  If you are going on vacation or business trip, be sure to bring this document with you, if necessary, assistance will be provided to you at any medical institution, and all polyclinics and hospitals are required to do this completely free of charge. </p><p>  In order to find out the phone numbers and addresses of insurance companies providing policy making services, you can simply contact the nearest clinic or call the territorial health insurance fund. </p>
