    <h2>  The identity of Temuchin </h2><p>  The formation of the Mongol state owes everything to Temuchin (Temujin), as he was called in his youth.  His father, Esigey of the Borjigin clan, kidnapped his beautiful wife in the Merkit tribe when she was already married.  Her son Temujin was born in the middle of the XII century in the ulus, who wandered along the banks of the Omon River.  When the Tatars poisoned Esigey, Temuchin and his family were expelled from their native places.  Tatars became Temujin's personal enemies.  Temuchin was taken prisoner by taychutes, so that the growing boy could not avenge his father and regain his lands.  Temujin managed to escape, found a twin of his father, who gave him protection, married the bride Borte intended for him by his father, and began to strengthen his strength by raiding neighboring uluses.  He did not kill the captives, but took them to his service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formation of mongolian power reasons move results" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1556951.jpg" width="600"></div>

Trying to get as much cattle as possible, they developed more and more pastures - the old ones were exhausted.  The traditional territories of nomads became cramped for herds and herds.  That case intertribal conflicts flared up.  The tribal system was replaced by "nomadic feudalism."  The energetic and talented commander Temujin contributed a lot to this.  In addition, the Chinese, in order to maintain calm at home, sowed hostility between nomadic tribes.  Temuchin conducted many fights before subjugating the tribes of Tatars, Taichiuts, Merkits, and Oirats.  By 1206, all of Mongolia was under his rule.  At Kurtulai (the congress of all Mongolian khans), Temuchin received the title "kagan" and adopted the name Chingiz, which meant "ocean" or, in another version, "chosen one of heaven."  The reasons for the formation of the Mongol state: </p><ul><li>  Decomposition of the tribal system. </li><li>  Lack of pasture for large tribal formations. </li><li>  The insidious policy of inciting tribes against each other by the Jurchen (northeastern Chinese), whose vassals were the Mongols. </li></ul><h2>  New laws of the Great Khan </h2><p>  Nomads Genghis Khan mixed and from different tribes and clans amounted to a strictly organized army.  Discipline and mutual aid in it were iron.  If he fled alone from the battlefield, then the dozen he entered was executed.  Of the dozens, hundreds were made, of hundreds - thousands, of thousands - Tumen (10 thousand people).  For unauthorized passage from one dozen to another executed.  Only personal abilities and devotion to the khan now helped to advance in the service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the formation of the Mongol power" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1556967.jpg" width="500"></div>  He fought his first big battle when the Merkit opponents captured his wife.

Reasons, course, results are partially considered.  Formally, Mongolia was a vassal of the Jurchen tribes living in the territory of the Primorsky Territory, Korea, Northeast and Central China.  In 1209, the Mongols used siege weapons and captured the city of Urakhai, besieged the capital of the kingdom of Si Xia.  The ruler asked for peace and married his daughter to Genghis Khan.  Thus, military experience was gained, and Mongolia expanded.  The Uighurs who lived in Xinjiang voluntarily joined this dangerous neighbor.  In 1210, two more khans followed this example.  The lands and the army of the Mongols increased.  Genghis Khan was preparing to conquer the settled state of Qin.  In 1213, Mongol troops invaded the empire.  The huge army was divided into 3 parts and conquered the east, south and southeast.  Beijing paid off. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formation of a mongolian power briefly" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1556972.jpg" width="600"></div>  But a year later, in 1214, Genghis Khan returned, took Beijing and burned it.  The city burned for a month.  Altogether, 90 cities in China were destroyed.  In China, the Mongol Empire <span>(Yuan Dynasty)</span> was founded by the grandson of Genghis Khan <span>.</span>  It existed for about a hundred years.  So the formation of the Mongol state proceeded.  Reasons, move, results - in the process of consideration.

    <h2>  The Conquest of Central Asia and the Caucasus </h2><p>  In 1218, Mongol detachments conquered Semirechye and East Turkestan - the lands of Naiman, and before them the road to Khorezm, Bukhara, Samarkand, Urgench opened.  Cities were taken and destroyed.  The Mongols professed the principle of "scorched earth."  When the eldest <span>son of Genghis Khan</span> began to protest, because it was his ulus, and he wanted to leave him rich for himself, then a month later he died from a poisoned arrow.  In 1220, Northern Iran, Transcaucasia and Crimea were conquered. </p><h2>  Campaign in Russia </h2><p>  In 1223, the Mongol ambassadors arrived at the Russian princes.  They were killed.  The Mongols did not forgive this attitude to the embassy and after the defeat of the combined forces of the Russian princes during the battle on <span>the Kalka River,</span> they arranged a feast.  They laid planks on the still living prisoners and sat on them, arranging a celebration under the cries of painfully dying people.  It is amazing that the Mongols were only 20 thousand, and the number of Russian and Polovtsian troops, according to various estimates, ranges from 40 to 100 thousand.  Meanwhile, the troops of Genghis Khan reached the Indus.  So the formation of the Mongol state took place.  It can be briefly added that in 1241, when Russia was conquered and burned, the Mongols reached the Danube, Hungary and Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formation of the Mongol power of Genghis Khan" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1556976.jpg" width="600"></div>  Fortunately for them, they turned back to the east and for 240 years gained a foothold in Russia.

    <h2>  <span>Civil wars</span> and the collapse of the empire </h2><p>  The formation of the Mongol power of Genghis Khan took place in the most severe conquest wars.  There was no mercy on anyone.  In Russia there was fear and horror after the arrival of the troops of Batu.  Gradually, the Mongol khans gained the capital, became less energetic.  Quarrels broke out between them more and more often.  Meanwhile, Russia was strengthening, and the yoke ended by standing on <span>the Ugra River.</span> </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  In Russia, the autocracy has strengthened, the Orthodox Church has strengthened.  There remained the Kazan Khanate, which Ivan the Terrible defeated, freeing about 60 thousand Russian slaves.  In Kazan, the Tatars lived peacefully, becoming pagans Muslims.  Remained a fragment of the Mongol empire in Crimea.  He was conquered by His Excellency <span>Prince</span> Potemkin.  The city of Kasimov continued to exist in the Ryazan province, where the Tatars have long been settled.  In the XV century, when the Golden Horde broke up, the Siberian Khanate appeared in the lower Ob.  Only Ermak‚Äôs detachments and the subsequent development of Siberia in the 16th century allowed Russia to build new fortresses on its borders. </p>
