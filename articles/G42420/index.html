This lovely little animal evokes a smile and uplifting, especially if it is made by skilled craftswoman hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.readysteadyknit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hedgehog Knitting" class="if uuid-2848182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2848182.jpg"></div><p>  A knitted hedgehog will become your favorite toy or interior decoration if you knit it carefully and with love. </p><p>  You can knit a hedgehog with knitting needles or crochet. </p><p>  There are different levels of difficulty knitting this toy: it all depends on the number of parts. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  For the manufacture of hedgehog toys, crocheted, you will need such materials: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  yarn hook; </li><li>  directly the yarn itself, preferably several colors; </li><li>  scissors to cut the thread; </li><li>  a marker to mark the beginning of a row; </li><li>  filler for stuffing toys, ideally - holofiber. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.saylittlehen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hedgehogs knitting" class="if uuid-2848191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2848191.jpg"></div><h2>  Toy Making Tips </h2><p>  Before you start knitting a hedgehog, you need to decide on the model of the toy, the complexity of execution, time costs.  Then you need to choose a suitable scheme with a description in accordance with their capabilities. </p><p>  Particular attention to the craftswoman, especially the beginner, must be paid to the selection of the hook: he should easily pick up the thread without splitting it.  But at the same time, the hook should be as thin as possible with respect to the yarn used, so that the knitting is dense enough. </p><p>  The yarn should be selected about the same thickness so that the toy is uniform and holds its shape well. </p><p>  Stuff the toy as you knit.  This is most conveniently done with tweezers, especially when you need to place the filler in the narrow parts of the toy.  The filler should fit tightly inside the toy, as if bursting it.  But at the same time, holofiber should not look out of a knitted fabric, this reduces the quality of the product.  It is important to keep the packing balanced, but it comes with experience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gray hedgehog" class="if uuid-2853037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2853037.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple toy </h2><p>  A hedgehog is a toy that fits easily, is available for execution even by a beginner needlewoman. </p><p>  The simplest crochet hedgehog can be crocheted in the shape of a cone. </p><p>  This model consists of only one seamless knit part, while yarn of different colors is used: </p><ul><li>  for nose and eyes - black; </li><li>  muzzle - beige or gray; </li><li>  needles - brown or dark gray, and maybe even multi-colored. </li></ul><p>  Here, for the fantasy of a craftswoman, there are absolutely no boundaries. </p><p>  Knitted hedgehog, like any other toy crocheted, knits in a circle, or rather, in a spiral.  This means that no lifting loops are made at the beginning of the row. </p><p>  Therefore, in order not to lose the beginning of the row, you need to mark it with a colored thread, or with a special marker. </p><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  First you need to remember how the main types of loops fit together and how they are indicated on the diagram when describing a toy: </p><ul><li>  air chain - VP; </li><li>  single crochet - sbn; </li><li>  decrease - this is when one of two unbound columns is tied out - ub; </li><li>  an increase is when two columns are tied from one loop - etc. </li></ul><p>  Remembering the basics, picking up yarn and a hook, you can proceed directly to knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onemancrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the simplest options for crocheting a hedgehog" class="if uuid-2850550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2850550.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of crochet hedgehog </h2><p>  It is best to start knitting a toy with a nose, gradually expanding the fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First you need to make the amigurumi ring a black thread in order to start knitting the hedgehog's nose.  In the ring you need to knit 6 SC without crochet (sb).  It will be 1 row. </p><p>  Next, we make an increase (etc.) in every second column of the previous row, it should turn out 9 sb.  Accordingly, this is already 2 row. </p><p>  The next, 3 row, fits without changes, 9 sb. </p><p>  4 row: pr. In every third sbn.  the previous row, as a result of 12 sb. </p><p>  5 row fits without changes, 12 sb. </p><p>  Having knitted 5-6 rows in such a way with black thread to get a beautiful nose, you need to change the thread to the color of the body, for example, gray or beige. </p><p>  We knit further 8-10 rows according to the same principle, making increases through a row.  More precisely, the number of rows in the face is determined during the knitting process. </p><p>  Next, change the thread to dark brown or to another color of hedgehog needles that is suitable in your case. </p><p>  We knit a row without changing the number of columns, it is better to start increasing in the next row, after changing the color, so that they are not so noticeable. </p><p>  To make the transition from the muzzle to the head with thorns look natural for a knitted hedgehog, from this row, increments should be made in each row so that the expansion of the canvas is more pronounced. </p><p>  The nose and face must be filled with holofiber at this stage. </p><p>  Having knitted several rows (approximately 7-10) with increases in each row, the head smoothly passes into the body.  The number of rows with increments depends on the planned size of the toy and the thickness of the thread. </p><p>  We knit the body of a hedgehog without increases.  We consider how many columns you have succeeded.  Now you need to knit this number for another 25-30 rows. How much to knit in rows depends on the shape of the future hedgehog: you need to decide which one should be round or oval. </p><p>  Having reached the desired length of the body of the hedgehog, we begin to make decreases, in each row knitting together two single crochet tables, first after 4 sc, in the next row - after 3 and so on.  It is important not to miss the moment suitable for stuffing the toy, otherwise it will be difficult to do so later. </p><p>  Final step: Tighten the remaining hole and gently remove the tip of the thread with a needle. </p><p>  The eyes of a knitted hedgehog are either attached ready-made or embroidered with black thread. </p><h2>  Hedgehog Feet </h2><p>  If desired, you can tie the legs and sew to the toy.  Feet can be round or elongated.  They also fit in single crochet columns with a thread of the same color as the muzzle of the hedgehog. </p><p>  First a flat circle fits: </p><ol><li>  Amigurumi ring, 6 prs. </li><li>  In the next row, the number of sbn doubles.  - 12 pcs. </li><li>  Etc.  after 1 sbn., 18 sbn. </li><li>  Next, 2-3 rows are knitted without increases, then decreases are made in the reverse order, 6 ub.  in each row. </li></ol><p>  If paws are needed more authentic, then the number of knitted rows without increases increases.  Having filled the paws and closing the hole, we leave a small tail of thread for attaching the paws to the toy. </p><h2>  Knitted hedgehog with knitting needles </h2><p>  Toys can be knitted not only with a crochet, but also with knitting needles. </p><p>  For example, here such a cute hedgehog can be connected by this description: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toysew.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hedgehog Knitting Scheme" class="if uuid-2850496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2850496.jpg"></div><p>  Eyes can be made of beads by attaching charming cilia to them.  They can be purchased at needlework stores.  To decorate the toy, flowers are used that can be made from any suitable materials, as well as crocheted or knitted or just bought ready-made ones. </p><p>  A master class on knitting a hedgehog with knitting needles can be seen in the video below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="PnMuGxL-8VU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=193&amp;v=PnMuGxL-8VU" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/9/3/5/4/9354.jpg"></div><h2>  More hedgehogs: good and different! </h2><p>  In fact, the variety of models, shapes, and manufacturing options for knitted hedgehogs is simply amazing! </p><p>  They can be knitted standing on legs vertically, sitting on four legs or without legs at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vse.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amigurumi Hedgehog" class="if uuid-2848203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2848203.jpg"></div><p>  You can put a hedgehog in a beautiful blouse and panties, give a bundle in the paws, attach apples to the needles. </p><p>  In the manufacture of toys you can use a wide variety of yarn, for example, for knitting needles needlewomen widely used yarn type "grass". </p><p>  There are toys that are very difficult to perform, there are simpler ones.  Any craftswoman can choose the right model.  There are a great many descriptions and schemes. </p><p>  You can tie a hat to the child in the form of a hedgehog or decorate the baby's clothes with the figure of this animal. </p><p>  There are simply masterpieces of knitted art.  Such toys will perfectly fit into the interior to create coziness, and will also suit even adults as a gift. </p>
