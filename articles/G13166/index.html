    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about what people who have already visited this hotel leave about their stay at the Esperos Village Hotel 5 * (Rhodes).  And I must say, for the most part they are positive. </p><p>  Guests are pleased with the location - the hotel is located on a hill, on the opposite side of which there is a zoo.  You can go for a walk along the fence, behind which various animals live.  And it's free.  So you can walk as much as you like - positive impressions are guaranteed.  By the way, deer live near the main building. </p><p>  Even the guests who spent their holidays here in the summer of 2016, that is, not so long ago, are advised to contact Russian-speaking girls at the reception on all issues.  They will not refuse advice, they will try to provide everything that is needed. </p><p>  In general, you can talk about this hotel about the amazing attitude of the staff towards guests and conditions for a long time.  But if you make a general conclusion, it‚Äôs worth declaring with confidence that this is an ideal place for a honeymoon or just for a pleasant vacation in silence, near the sea, in comfortable conditions.  The hotel has a calm, romantic, secluded atmosphere.  And, as the guests themselves say, the children do not make noise, which is very important.  Only occasionally can you hear the songs of the peacocks.  In general, you should go here and see for yourself on your own. </p>
