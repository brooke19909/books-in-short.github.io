Customer reviews especially emphasize the stylish and delicate design of the device.  An elegant floral ornament on a white background, as well as a wide range of functions, makes the Scarlet SC-411 crock-pot a favorite of women. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Perhaps all crock-pots have a concise and stylish design, but the Scarlet SC-411 certainly surpasses all other models.  The manufacturer has provided two colors of the device.  Pink flowers on a white background, resembling sakura, turn thoughts to the east.  The blue gzhel ornament is more traditional and intimate. </p><p>  The case of the multicooker looks elegant and stylish thanks to the glossy white color.  Durable plastic, resistant to high temperatures and impacts, allows the device to maintain its original appearance for a long time.  In addition, the material is very easy to care for and clean as well.  At the front of the case is a control panel, the design of which echoes the general design concept. </p><p>  An important feature of the model is the presence of a condensate tank.  Thanks to this detail, you don’t have to worry about safety, because the contact of water and electricity simply will not occur.  In addition, this container is used during cooking in the double boiler mode. </p><p>  The lid opens quite easily by pressing a button on the handle.  The lid also has a special valve that allows steam to be released from the appliance during cooking.  Particularly noteworthy is the Scarlet SC-411 multicooker bowl, which is characterized by high strength and ease of cleaning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Well, and, perhaps, one of the most pleasant moments that characterizes the Scarlet SC-411 multicooker is the price.  It ranges from 2500 to 4000 rubles, depending on the store. </p>

    <h2>  Instructions for managing the multicooker “Scarlet SC-411” </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the easiest kitchen appliances to operate is the Scarlet SC-411 crock-pot.  The manual contains a detailed guide to the operation of the device and the preparation of various dishes. </p><p>  The device is controlled using a special control panel, which is incredibly easy to use.  Thanks to the presence of a two-color display, it is convenient to monitor the timer settings, as well as the time it takes to prepare dishes.  It is worth paying attention to the convenient location of the control panel buttons, which are another feature of such a device as the Scarlet SC-411 multicooker.  Reviews say that they are much more convenient than touch panels.  The “Delayed start”, “Timer” and “Heating” buttons are placed in the lower part, and the buttons responsible for the preparation of certain dishes are grouped in the rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Delay Start button is useful for those who don’t want to start cooking this very minute, but want to get a warm, fresh treat when they return from work or wake up in the morning.  If you already have ready-made food in the refrigerator, use the “Heating” button.  Thanks to it, you can reheat food much faster than in the microwave, without using a single drop of fat.  The instruction manual in Russian describes these functions in detail. </p>

    <h2>  Cons multicooker "Scarlet SC-411" </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is nothing perfect.  This statement is also true for such a device as the Scarlet SC-411 multicooker.  Customer reviews note the following disadvantages of this model: </p><ul><li>  there is no special button that would turn off the multicooker without disconnecting it from the network; </li><li>  it is not very convenient to wash the crock-pot due to the fact that there is no way to remove the inside of the lid; </li><li>  the length of the cord is a little more than a meter, which requires placing the device directly near the power source. </li></ul><h2>  Vanilla semolina for children </h2><p>  Recipes for the Scarlet SC-411 multicooker are very numerous.  Sweet semolina will certainly be appreciated by both children and adults.  To prepare it you will need: </p><ul><li>  half a liter of milk; </li><li>  40 grams of semolina and sugar; </li><li>  a spoonful of butter; </li><li>  a bag of vanilla sugar. </li></ul><p>  First you need to pour milk into the bowl so that it boils in the "Milk Porridge" mode.  Further, carefully interfering the dry ingredients, you need to let the porridge cook for another minute, after which it should be infused.  Before serving, you need to flavor the porridge with butter. </p>
