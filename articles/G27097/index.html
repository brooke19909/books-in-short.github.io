History and modern territory of Flanders</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Flanders is a county in medieval Europe that existed from 866 to 1384.  In the XV century it was a territory within the duchy of Burgundy, after which it was part of the Habsburg Netherlands.  Today, Flanders is the administrative unit of Belgium, as well as the historical region of France (part of the region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais) and the Netherlands (Zeeland Flanders). </p><div class="photo" data-original="dalby-mikkelsen.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flanders is" class="if uuid-3044911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3044911.jpg"></div><h2>  History of education </h2><p>  Flanders is a county located in northwestern Europe; it was founded in 866 by Baldwin Iron Hand.  It was located on French territory.  The entire territory of the country did not enter the county, as part was annexed to Germany.  The early feudal period of its history is a struggle for borders, feuds, wars with the kings of France, barons and dukes of Normandy.  This was facilitated by the fact that Flanders was in a favorable part of Europe, and not one of the important historical moments of this part of the world was left behind.  It bordered on France, England and the Netherlands and had access to the sea. </p><h2>  The beginning of development and prosperity </h2><p>  Starting from X to XI century, the history of the county went a different way.  Due to the good location, as well as the entrepreneurship of the inhabitants, crafts and industry began to develop in the country.  Trade was particularly successful, this was facilitated by the fact that the county was at the crossroads of the main trade, economic and cultural routes, Flanders is a sea country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to trade and developed industry, which provides large incomes, cities were built and developed that in their beauty overshadowed many European capitals.  They had unique recognition, they could not be confused with any city.  The capitals of Europe envied the luxuries of royal Bruges, the wealth of Antwerp, the skill of the weavers of Ghent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourias.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flanders castle" class="if uuid-3044926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3044926.jpg"></div><h2>  Dynasty of counts of flanders </h2><p>  Its founder was Baldwin I, who was given the nickname Iron Hand for courage, cunning and cruelty.  He led his troops against the Normans, showing his courage.  Where it was impossible to act by force, he used cunning.  To force the kings of Europe to reckon with him, he abducted the daughter of the French king Karl Lysy and forced him to recognize himself as his son-in-law.  The territory of Flanders grew over the allotments of the princess of France. </p><p>  His son Baldwin II, having rejected all the canons and disregarding the level of kinship, called himself the descendant of Charlemagne - Caroling.  All his children and grandchildren began to call themselves the same.  Over two hundred years, Flanders has significantly expanded its territory.  Particularly successful in joining the lands of Baldwin V, introducing to the county the territory of the Holy Roman Empire. </p><p>  But his descendants began to fight among themselves no less cruelly than their ancestor Baldwin I with the Normans.  The former allies of the once mighty Flanders began to claim on its territory.  And this is not surprising, since a small country was located between the large states of France, England and the Netherlands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flanders what country is it now" class="if uuid-3044921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3044921.jpg"></div><h2>  Political Orientations of Flanders </h2><p>  The fate of the county is to seek independence and not find it.  Often one could hear the question: "Flanders is what country?"  The constant problem of the county is who to choose as the overlord of the English or French king, despite the fact that both kingdoms wanted to have the county as their vassal.  In Flanders itself there was also no unity on this issue.  Merchants, industrialists, city dwellers were more attracted to England, and the feudal lords, who did not accept the centralized politics of the count, sought France, which also feared the increasingly growing independence of a small country. </p><p>  It was not easy for the Flanders counts, who had to turn around to please England and France, as well as their cities and feudal lords.  In the next war at the Battle of Buvin, which took place in 1214, the combined forces of England, Germany and Flanders opposed France.  They were defeated by the French, and the county fell under French rule for a long time. </p><p>  The growing wealth of cities made them increasingly independent, and even the French kings had to reckon with this.  Although they, especially Louis IX, still intervened in the life of this proud country and supported the rulers.  The uprising of the townspeople in Bruges led to the defeat of the French at the Battle of Curtre in 1302.  Flanders is a country, one of the few where the cities and the bourgeoisie located in them at that time defeated the feudal lords. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.schubert-touristik.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flanders is a country" class="if uuid-3044914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3044914.jpg"></div><h2>  As part of Burgundy </h2><p>  The French king John II the Good presented to his youngest son Philip Burgundy.  He married the only heiress of the Count of Flanders Margarita.  In 1384, Philip united the two territories.  In the 15th century, these two regions flourished, and the richer Flanders developed in the sciences and art subjugated provincial Burgundy.  And even the capital from Dijon was transferred to the Flemish Lille. </p><p>  The golden time was for Flanders, where wealth and wealth reigned.  The country became an increasingly independent state, which did not suit its neighbors.  Flanders traded with the whole world, its cloth and lace could be found in distant Russia and even Calcutta. </p><h2>  Ruled by Austria </h2><p>  The last Burgundian monarch, who has no male heirs, Karl Smely, died in January 1477.  This happened in the decisive battle of the Burgundy War, the Battle of Nancy.  Burgundy became French again.  The daughter of <span>Karl the Bold,</span> Maria, married Maximilian of Austria.  Flanders passed into the possession of Austria.  This did not bring her any benefit.  She became the provincial outskirts of the Habsburg empire. </p><p>  The capital of weaving, the city of Bruges, gradually fell into decline.  Antwerp, through which there were trade routes with the Spanish colonies, passed into the possession of Brabant, the historical region of the Netherlands.  In almost all cities of Flanders, there were Spanish garrisons.  The Inquisition got here.  Her bonfires flamed across the country. </p><p>  Dissatisfaction with the new rulers grew, it was a harbinger of the Revolution, which stirred up the whole Netherlands.  The duke of Alba was sent to the county by the ruler.  At this time, one could hear that Flanders is a country where cruelty and fear, blood and tears reign. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.martinschlu.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what country is flanders" class="if uuid-3044924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3044924.jpg"></div><h2>  Reign of the Duke of Alba </h2><p>  Independent cities began to oppose the Spanish rulers.  The uprisings in the 1560s led to the fact that on August 22, 1567, the Duke of Alba arrived in Brussels with a ten-thousand-strong army, which included Italian and Spanish soldiers.  Upon arrival, he invited noble Flemings who were against his appointment to a banquet and arrested them.  On his orders, a "riot investigation tribunal" was formed.  His cruelty was just awful.  One day he sentenced 500 people to death. </p><p>  The Duke of Orange opposed Alba.  His brother, Louis of Nassuan, led the army that defeated the Spaniards.  But Alba only intensified the repression.  They executed not only ordinary citizens, but also dukes.  The last straw was the introduction of excessive taxes on trade.  The population of cities revolted against this.  Many noble people in Europe, including kings and clergy, opposed the politics of terror.  Even the sea giza (pirates) captured the port of Brille.  This served as a signal for the uprising of the northwestern provinces. </p><p>  The Spanish henchman, frightened by the unprecedented scope of the uprising, canceled the tax, but it was too late.  Oransky with his army invaded Flanders.  The inhabitants suffered no less from the cruelty of his soldiers than from Alba.  The rebels were supported by France and England.  But suddenly France retreated.  The rebellion crashed.  Only a few cities did not give up, and the Duke of Alba himself led an army against them.  But the king ordered the removal of the cruel ruler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flanders now this" class="if uuid-3044915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3044915.jpg"></div><h2>  Flanders - what country is it now? </h2><p>  Spain turned the once-blooming Flanders into a battlefield with France.  From former well-being, only memories remained.  The Great French Revolution in 1790 led to the proclamation of the United States of Belgium.  In 1830, Belgium proclaimed its independence, it included most of Flanders, which did not become an independent country. </p><p>  Flanders is now a politically extinct state, but quite prosperous territories of the three countries.  Only the history, full of dramatic events, Flemish culture, language, is left of the past country, half of Belgium speaks it, the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, whose architecture still fascinates tourists.  Other parts of Flanders are part of France and the Netherlands, where many inhabitants of glorious cities fled during the time of the Duke of Alba. </p>
