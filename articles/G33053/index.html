Moreover, Evgeny Ivanovich Shaposhnikov forbade the military to intervene in the country's political events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shaposhnikov Evgeny Ivanovich" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1420743.jpg" width="600"></div>

After the failure of the coup on August 23, 1991, Gorbachev, while still president, signed a decree on the appointment of Evgeny Ivanovich Shaposhnikov as defense minister.  This decision is submitted to the Supreme Council session.  A few days later, Evgeny Ivanovich Shaposhnikov received the rank of Air Marshal.  Then the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR</span> approves him as Minister of Defense.  Actually, he did not stay in this position for very long - only a few months: until December. </p><p>  When, at the end of 1991, Yeltsin, Kravchuk and Shushkevich, having met in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, decided to ‚Äúend‚Äù the USSR, the issue of unified armed forces has not yet been resolved.  Therefore, the troops could withstand this.  But that did not happen.  It was <span>Marshal Shaposhnikov</span> Evgeny Ivanovich who became the person who ensured the success of the Bialowieza Treaty. </p><h2>  After the collapse of the Union </h2><p>  He recognized the agreement on the disbandment of the USSR immediately after its signing.  On December 21, 1991, Evgeny Ivanovich Shaposhnikov was appointed to the post of commander of the USSR Armed Forces until their final reformation.  A few months later, in February, he becomes the Commander-in-Chief of the CIS Allied Forces. <br>  In this post, the last air marshal stayed until September 1993, when this position was abolished.  Yeltsin highly appreciated Shaposhnikov, considering him a devoted and loyal ally. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shaposhnikov Evgeny Ivanovich biography" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1420746.jpg" width="500"></div>

In 1994, Shaposhnikov resigned.  But even then he does not stop working for the good of the country.  Almost simultaneously, he becomes the representative of the President in such an organization as Rosvooruzhenie.  It was this state-owned company that was engaged in the import and export of military equipment and weapons. </p><p>  From 1995 to 1997, Evgeny Ivanovich Shaposhnikov was appointed to the position of Director General of the country's largest airline, Aeroflot, to ‚Äúraise‚Äù Russian international airlines.  But here he does not work long: after a year and a half, he becomes an assistant to the President of the country.  The marshal was in charge of everything related to the development of aviation and space.  Shaposhnikov Evgeny Ivanovich, whose family was never in sight, unlike many other political figures, always thought first of all about the good of the country, and only then - about personal interests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshal Shaposhnikov Evgeny Ivanovich" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1420744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Merits </h2><p>  This outstanding military man is really quite large.  The behavior of the marshal has always had its impact on the worldview of the surrounding senior ranks, especially during the coup attempt.  Yeltsin‚Äôs confidence that the Airborne Forces and the Air Force would not support the Emergency Committee, allowed him to plan events as clearly as possible and predict the coup‚Äôs intentions.  And a lot of this was facilitated by the clear position that Evgeny Ivanovich Shaposhnikov adhered to. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Many years of productive activity and impeccable service for the benefit of the Fatherland were highly appreciated by the country's leadership.  Evgeny Ivanovich was awarded two orders, including the Red Star, as well as seven medals.  The contribution of this honored pilot to improving flight safety was marked in 2003 with an Honorary Diploma. </p>
