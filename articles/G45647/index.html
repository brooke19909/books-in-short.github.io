    <h2>  Holidays in Turkey </h2><p>  The variety of leisure options combined with the wonderful mild climate made Turkey a very attractive place where you can go scuba diving and windsurfing, go for a yacht trip or go on a safari, in short, just relax in harmony with nature.  The tourist season in this country opens at the end of April, but by the last spring month the air here warms up to a comfortable indicator for vacationers.  During this period, the price of vacation packages decreases slightly, therefore, going on vacation, many get the opportunity to spend unforgettable holidays on the sea coast, while significantly saving. </p><h2>  Where in Turkey is warmer in May </h2><p>  Those who consider themselves the discoverers of the beach season opt for more southern regions, where it warms faster.  Resorts on the <span>Antalya coast</span> and the warm Mediterranean Sea are popular.  In May, Turkey has the warmest water in Kemer, Antalya, Alanya, Belek and Side, which are literally buried in abundance of flowers and greenery.  The beaches here are ready to give vacationers a Mediterranean bronze tan, and the sea caresses with warm and crystal-clear water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Kemer, for example, is suitable for a relaxing family vacation with young children, and for youth entertainment.  During the day you can sunbathe and swim on the beach, as well as participate in informative excursion programs, and in the evening attend incendiary discos or themed interesting parties, including for children.  Another city only twenty kilometers away from Kemer is Alanya.  This is one of the best holiday destinations that Turkey is famous for.  In early May, the weather is already so warm that roses bloom and oranges ripen.  Tourists have the feeling that they came here in the highest season. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question: "Where in Turkey is warmer in May?"  The answer is unequivocal - this is the Mediterranean coast, where the temperature rises to thirty degrees.  However, at the end of spring, those who come here to improve their body can already bathe in the springs of Pamukkale, in which, according to legend, the <span>Egyptian Queen Cleopatra</span> used to take baths <span>.</span>  In the spring, many people visit the town of Yalova, known for its thermal and mineral healing springs, as well as the resort of Kangal, where some skin diseases are treated with fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water in Turkey in May" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/365524.jpg?1396461658686" width="600"></div>

The tourist season this month is just beginning to gain momentum.  But since this is not the peak time, the resorts are not clogged, so the hotels have a lot of free places.  And if you order tickets from the end of March or the beginning of April, then the prices for holidays in May will be quite cheap.  In addition, at this time, you can choose not from what is left, but what will appeal to and afford.  For example, the cost of a ticket to Kemer with an air flight from Moscow, transfer, hotel accommodation, food and medical insurance for two costs between twenty and twenty five thousand rubles, depending on the category of hotel and the level of accommodation.  This means that visitors in May have a real opportunity to stay in one of the best Turkish hotels at the cost of a three-star in the high season.  In addition, this period is very rarely accompanied by a large influx of vacationers, who are so attracted to Turkey.  The beginning of May is relatively calm here: on the beaches and in entertainment venues there is no usual fuss or crush. </p><p>  Many tourists already know where it is warmer in Turkey in May, and therefore come year after year in this season, because the prices of vouchers and hotel accommodation here are significantly lower than, say, the prices for holidays in Egypt or Bulgaria. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey holidays in may prices" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/365525.jpg?1396461749231" width="550"></div></h2><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Holidays in the resorts of the Mediterranean coast in May are a good option for those who know where it is warmer in Turkey in May and want to save money while enjoying a mild and not too hot climate.  The weather in this country in the last month of spring is already much warmer than in April.  Typically, the average air temperature is twenty-six degrees of heat.  There are relatively few rains during this period.  The temperature of the sea rises to twenty-four degrees, that is, it is already quite suitable for swimming.  Many tourists are attracted to Turkey in early May: the weather during this period suggests that they can bask on the beach for hours without any risk of sunburn.  At the same time, the gentle sun gives an incomparable tan, absolutely safe for health.  The sea is already quite warm this season, so by the end of May even the most heat-loving tourists can swim.  However, in the evenings, the air temperature is a maximum of seventeen degrees, so warm clothes in the wardrobe will be out of place. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  If the slightly cool sea does not cause some enthusiasm, they can always visit the indoor pools, which this season work as usual in all hotels.  Those who prefer to take their vacations in the spring can find out where in Turkey it is warmer in May, as well as ticket prices, on the sites of numerous tour operators offering last-minute tours and big discounts.  Tourists have a lot of choices for spending time: these are water sports, excellent diving, and numerous water excursions.  In addition, Labor Day is celebrated in Turkey in early May.
