  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to knit home boots with knitting needles?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, the popularity of knitted slippers has increased dramatically.  Experienced needlewomen explain this by the fact that it helps to keep the legs warm and look interesting, beautiful and fashionable.  However, many people prefer to knit this wardrobe item on their own, because store products are mainly presented in several copies, and not all buyers like this.  In the article, we will study in detail the technology for making home boots using knitting needles. </p><h2>  Determine the appearance of shoes </h2><p>  Both beginning masters and professionals know that the realization of any idea begins with the purchase of knitting threads and the selection of comfortable knitting needles.  However, before work it is important to carefully consider how the desired model should look.  Everything should be thought out: style, color, the presence of decorative elements and the type of sole - felt / knitted insole or real sole, left over from old shoes.  Then pick up the pattern.  It is traditionally believed that knitting home boots is best done with a simpler and not too openwork pattern, although in this case there are no strict recommendations, and each needlewoman has the right to rely on her taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boots home description" class="if uuid-3017591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3017591.jpg"></div><h2>  Cooking yarn </h2><p>  Professional craftswomen recommend that beginners use fairly thick woolen yarn to realize their idea.  The main thing is that it should not be prickly!  Otherwise, wearing the product will be uncomfortable.  In addition, it is worth noting that if you decide to work with a complex pattern, it is better to choose a single-color skein.  If home boots are knitted with a simple front surface, a garter stitch or a simple embossed pattern, you can decorate them with an unusual knitting thread.  For example, gradient. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Choose a tool </h2><p>  A few words must be said about the choice of knitting needles.  Experienced needlewomen believe that it is easiest for beginners to work with metal.  However, some young ladies knit too loosely (with large, elongated loops), so it is better for them to choose wooden ones.  There is an opinion that it is better to knit both children's and adult domestic boots on hosiery knitting needles.  The diameter should be equal to the thickness of the selected thread.  If the reader does not have suitable tools, they must be purchased at a needlework store.  But it is important to carefully consider each spoke.  There should not be any ‚Äúburrs‚Äù, roughnesses or rough edges.  Otherwise, the creative process will turn into a real torture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="he.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home boots step by step" class="if uuid-3017582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3017582.jpg"></div><h2>  Measure foot </h2><p>  To wear the finished product was comfortable, it is important to correctly measure.  To do this, you should prepare a centimeter tape, schematically depict the boot on a piece of paper, and then specify all the parameters directly on the pattern.  In this case, you need to find out the following: </p><ul><li>  distance from the floor to the base of the lower leg; </li><li>  girth of the foot at the base of the lower leg; </li><li>  the length of the upper part of the boot. </li></ul><h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  Knitting home boots with knitting needles, like a crochet, will be much easier if you calculate the number of loops and rows in advance.  But for this, you need a sample of the pattern with which you will knit the product.  We prepare the yarn, knit fifteen loops on the knitting needle and knit as many rows.  Then we measure the resulting fragment using a centimeter tape.  Share: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  girth of the foot to the width of the sample, multiply by 15; </li><li>  the distance from the floor to the base of the lower leg and the length of the upper part of the boot by the length of the sample, we multiply by 15. </li></ul><p>  If necessary, round each new value and mark it on the pattern. </p><h2>  Knitting soles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="boots home scheme" class="if uuid-3017576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3017576.jpg"></div><p>  Professional craftswomen are convinced that the simplest way is to make the whole product using knitting needles.  However, in this case, it is necessary to build a sole pattern for house boots.  With your own hands, even novice masters can do this: </p><ol><li>  We prepare a notebook sheet in a cage. </li><li>  We outline the foot on it. </li><li>  We correct the contour, giving it a more rounded outline. </li><li>  Slightly expand and extend the sole. </li><li>  And draw a contour over the cells. </li><li>  We knit, taking one cell per loop. </li><li>  We supplement new ones after the first loop and before the last.  We are also reducing. </li></ol><h2>  Bringing Ideas to Life </h2><p>  Having tied the sole, we take a hook and pull new loops along the entire contour.  We distribute them into four knitting needles and knit without increases and decreases, lifting 1/3 of the distance from the floor to the base of the lower leg.  In the center of the bow, we begin to close three loops through one row.  When we go out on the girth of the foot at the base of the tibia, we knit the product in a circle without additions or decreases.  Having tied the desired length of the upper part of the boot, we cut off the thread, fasten and hide from the inside.  Next, we knit the second home boot with knitting needles, and then, if desired, we decorate the finished shoe, complement it with decorative elements, ears or bows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ivoiregion.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting boots" class="if uuid-3017612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3017612.jpg"></div><p>  This concludes our article.  We hope that we explained the principle of operation in a clear language, and the reader will be able to please himself and his loved ones with beautiful, original home boots that will keep the warmth of your feet. </p>
