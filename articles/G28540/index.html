    <h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The National Art Museum of the Republic of Belarus has an extensive collection, but its history is far from so impressive.  The State Picture Gallery was opened in 1939.  Her expositions were based on works from the museums of Vitebsk, Mogilev, <span>Gomel, Minsk,</span> some were donated by the Tretyakov Gallery and the Hermitage.  In addition, the collection included canvases from castles and estates of Western Belarus - Slutsk belts from the Radziwills collection, eighteenth-century French tapestries and portraiture.  The years of World War II became a difficult time.  Many exhibits were taken out of the country, and their history is still unknown.  After the war, work on the collection was restarted.  The National Art Museum of Belarus, or rather, at that time, the BSSR, acquired paintings by Kustodiev, Bryullov, Levitan, Polenov.  Some of the exhibits were transmitted by the galleries of St. Petersburg and Moscow.  In 1957, the exposition was opened in a new building, which was built according to the project of Mikhail Baklanov.  The facade is decorated with allegory sculptures depicting painting, sculpture and fame.  <span>This building</span> is one of the first in the history of Soviet architecture.  At the moment, his image is used on a thousand rubles banknote.  Throughout the years of its existence, the National Art Museum of the Republic of Belarus has been collecting new masterpieces from private collections, works in the genre of icon painting and the best works of Belarusian masters.  Over the past decades, it has become a complex with five branches, two of which are not located in Minsk - in Golshany and Mir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="National Museum of Art in Minsk" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New building </h2><p>  The National Art Museum in Minsk has grown so much that by the end of the twentieth century it needed a new room.  All departments, lecture halls and other office premises were moved to neighboring buildings.  A new building has been created for the museum, which combines past features and modern architecture.  Designer Vitaly Belyankin designed the interior with classic arches and columns, decorated with stucco molding, and a glass dome acts as the ceiling.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new building is almost nine thousand square meters.  In addition to the exposition, which is owned by the National Art Museum of the Republic of Belarus, there are restoration workshops and storerooms.  A special tour allows you to observe the process of restoration of paintings.  The new halls served as a platform for demonstrating ancient and modern Belarusian art, as well as artifacts from <span>Western Europe</span> and Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Minsk, National Museum of Art" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/753275.jpg" width="600"></div>
