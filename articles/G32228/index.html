Thrill lovers, climbers and skiers have come here for a long time.  Since 1982, a sports school of the Olympic reserve was deployed on the slope of Mount Adzhigardak.  Since then, much has changed, but the charm of these places has remained unshakable. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Perhaps someone will be surprised that, living very close by, never once visited the Ajigardak.  The ski resort is famous for its moderate air temperature, which does not hinder to spend all day on the slopes, as well as a huge amount of sparkling clear snow.  It is located in the Chelyabinsk region, near the city of Asha. </p>

    <p>  Places are amazing with their originality.  These are majestic mountain peaks and picturesque Ural forests, where a real Russian spirit is felt. </p><h2>  Local climate </h2><p>  Thanks to the natural conditions, Adzhigardak became so famous.  Ski resort <strong> </strong>  where the average temperature is 7-12 degrees below zero, this is a real paradise for lovers of winter sports.  Many routes in the northern part of Russia are inferior to it precisely with their 30-degree frosts. </p><p>  One gets the impression that you are in the Carpathians with their mild climate;  in rare cases, the temperature drops to minus 18. But even on such days, Adzhigardak - a ski resort - does not stop working. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
