    <h2>  Black &amp; Decker </h2><p>  This company was founded at the beginning of the 20th century in the state of Maryland.  Two young businessmen opened a machine shop.  Then they could not even imagine that their company would become one of the most reputable and recognized leaders in the sales market.  In order to achieve excellence in this activity, the manufacturer completely plunged into the work.  Everyone understands that it is quite difficult to get success, trying to achieve it in several areas at once, so the founders decided to choose three main areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, the company is creating automobile, <span>garden vacuum cleaners,</span> as well as household appliances.  Owners of equipment distinguish large lists of advantages.  It is about functionality, small dimensions, as well as ergonomics.  A car vacuum cleaner can run on battery power for about 30 minutes.  This time is enough for cleaning vehicles.  The company offers several fairly popular Black Decker car vacuum cleaners for cars.  But the article will focus on the PAV1205, AV 1205, PAD 1200, ADV 1210/1220. </p><p>  You may notice that many obsolete models are quickly discontinued, and more modern products are replacing them.  These devices should be purchased in company stores or on the Internet.  Service centers operate in many cities around the world.  In order not to resort to their help, it is recommended that before making a transaction pay attention to the comments of those people who have long used the chosen model. </p><h2>  General characteristics of vacuum cleaners </h2><p>  Any car owner will agree that it‚Äôs quite difficult to clean the interior.  If, under normal conditions (indoors), a person only has to tilt the case a little, then in the car‚Äôs interior you will have to bend down, turn around and so on.  Because of this, the work is very complicated.  In order to minimize inconvenience, manufacturers create good designs with a small body, elongated nose.  Also, for maximum comfort, other (other than household) nozzles and brushes are used.  Car vacuum cleaners Black Decker - these are great devices that have high consumer characteristics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Buyers note that the devices are light and compact.  However, they also emphasize that, unfortunately, the set of accessories is minimal.  Often in the kit you can find several brushes.  If you want a more diverse supply, then you need to choose expensive models.  All fixtures have a 5 meter cord.  Thanks to this, you can not only vacuum the interior, but also the trunk.  Buyers notice that the functionality (in the form of storage, transportation) of the device is thought out as clearly as possible, so there are no problems.  Most of the models have a special bag-bag, where not only a hose, but also nozzles are placed. </p><p>  What are the benefits of Black Decker car vacuum cleaners for users?  Reviews of them indicate low weight, small dimensions, good suction power, both for its price and weight category.  It is convenient to store devices, they are easy to use, trash containers are easy to clean.  A quick charge system is built in, as well as vacuum cleaners are constantly ready to clean the cabin. </p><p>  Buyers also highlight certain disadvantages that should be clarified.  They indicate that all models have a small garbage tank, because of this you have to constantly clean it.  The suction rates, although not bad for cleaning in the car, but when compared with household appliances, in fact they are very low.  The power of all models is different, but it does not exceed 10 watts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car vacuum cleaner black decker 1205" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2079836.jpg"></div>
