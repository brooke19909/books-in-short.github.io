These are real estate agencies, of which there are a lot in the capital.  More recently, the construction of a residential quarter with the intriguing name SREDA was completed in Moscow.  He immediately became known among the real estate market players.  First of all, attractive value played its role.  For example, a studio apartment was sold for 3.4 million rubles.  For <span>Moscow, this is a</span> very low price, which delighted and alarmed those who were interested in buying a home in the Sreda residential complex.  Customer reviews say that today there are too many cases when people invested their money in poor-quality housing, built with many disruptions, and as a result remained face to face with their problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd customer reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954599.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to do </h2><p>  However, the demand for affordable housing is too great to ignore the Sreda residential complex.  Customer reviews began to spread over the Web, but today there is no reason to trust this data, because they are written to order, with any content.  But when it became known that a metro station would be opened very soon next to the block, journalists were also interested in this.  Indeed, what are these buildings and is it possible to recommend buying an apartment here?  Where to find real customer reviews?  LCD "Wednesday" was to visit one of the journalists in order to find answers to all questions on the spot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  First of all, we need to tell you what the environment is.  Customer reviews are pretty mean and one-sided, so try to fill in the gaps.  So, the project is long-term, its completion is planned around 2021.  By this time, an entire quarter should grow on the site of the old industrial zone.  Previously, the Karacharovsky Mechanical Plant stood at this place, now monolithic-brick houses with underground parking, a school and a kindergarten are gradually growing. </p><p>  But that is not all.  A walking park area and a huge business center will be built on the territory of the complex.  The first floors will be non-residential, there will be shops and offices.  As you can see, the project is very large-scale.  The built-up area is more than 19 hectares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mystery shopper reviews" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954597.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  The first phase of construction </h2><p>  So, in 2018, five huge tower houses, two mid-rise buildings and a kindergarten are preparing for delivery.  It is them that the reviews of the mystery buyer will affect.  LCD "Wednesday" will be renting out the property in stages.  Now only apartments in two tower houses are on sale.  All of them pass into the ownership of new owners without interior decoration, this is the task of each owner.  So, the mystery shopper had the opportunity to talk with managers and inspect the buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Clarification required </h2><p>  The first thing that confused the journalist was the distance between the towers.  It is no more than 30 meters, that is, future residents will be able to look into each other's windows.  The second point is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãphased construction.  The first stage houses will already be completed when the builders start working on the next part of the quarter, which includes the construction of another 10 buildings.  This will be followed by the third and fourth stages.  The managers explain that by the time people move into the houses of the first stage, construction work on the second (10 residential buildings) will be completed.  However, all other work will not interfere with people, since the objects are located in the distance.  This is a park area and tower houses on the border of the green massif.  The last will be laid walking lanes and bike paths, a club and a fitness center.  To figure out whether the construction is actually going on, the feedback from the mystery buyer will help us.  Description LCD ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù will be especially important for those who plan to purchase a home in the near future. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mystery buyer reviews review" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954600.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  The developer of this facility is PSN Group.  If the name of this company does not tell you anything, then let's pay attention to it.  The company has been on the market for 15 years, but so far has been engaged in other facilities.  Previous projects were business centers of the largest cities in Russia.  Only recently, ‚ÄúPSN Group‚Äù began to engage in housing construction.  And in the mass housing segment this is her debut. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Developer Reliability Review </h2><p>  The recall of the mystery shopper (ZhK Sreda) contains information about a small investigation, which we will now turn to.  He began by questioning managers about why the company decided to start building a housing estate.  The answer was predictable: the opening of new horizons and the development of a new market.  All this is good, but the buyer went a little further in his inquiries and asked a question what the company can boast today.  Managers allocated land assets, although according to the documents, this plot is leased. </p><p>  To give an assessment of the company‚Äôs activities, it‚Äôs very useful to recall a secret customer.  LCD "Sreda" (reviews of other buyers will soon begin to appear on the site, as people are preparing to move into their new apartments) - this is a large company with good assets.  But there are a couple of points that need attention: </p><ul><li>  Offshore structure in documents. </li><li>  Lack of experience in the construction of residential real estate. </li></ul><p>  I would very much like to give an example of one of the already commissioned objects.  But right now all the projects are underway, and it is impossible to evaluate the quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mystery buyer reviews description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Information on the Internet </h2><p>  A logical question arises, why take complex steps in the search for information, if it can be found on the official website, as well as characteristics of interest?  The recall of the secret buyer of the Sreda residential complex will be more informative, since the name site contains very little information.  But here there is a convenient search for apartments by parameters of interest, there are prices and a project declaration.  There was a camera that broadcast the construction site online, but today it was removed. </p><p>  In general, the <span>description of the project</span> on the site is presented in general terms, there is little concrete and useful information.  A video about a new building is a cartoon that declares that you are a person and choose the best for yourself.  Nice, but I would like something more.  In particular, the ‚ÄúMortgage‚Äù section is needed with a description of bank programs, payment terms, and much more that excites buyers. </p><p>  Rescue websites of sellers, that is, real estate agencies that sell finished apartments.  In addition to the Mortgage section, on the Bon Ton website you can see which apartments are currently available and where they are located (in buildings).  But the main thing is that there are floor plans, and you can even print the plans.  An additional bonus is the availability of permits.  In addition to the <span>project declaration</span> and the decree of the Government of Moscow, there is a cadastral passport and a lease agreement for the land, a land plan.  For information availability, you will have to lower the company's score, because you have to spend a lot of time searching for the necessary data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Wednesday Mystery Shopper Reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Future buyers are attracted by the fact that there will be a metro station near the complex, and it is not a problem to come here by ground public transport.  Now the metro is far away, not reachable on foot.  The construction site and sales office are 5.5 km from Ryazansky Prospekt Station.  But ground transportation helps out, as several bus and trolleybus routes follow here.  You can use minibuses (No. 63, 463, 351). </p><p>  By the time the object is commissioned, they are planning to launch the Ryazansky interchange hub.  Then there will be no need for an extra transplant, and the residents of the Sreda complex will have several routes to other parts of the city and beyond.  In the future, an overpass will appear next to the complex.  However, it cannot be said that this is a convenient place for car owners.  The most logical way to come here is along Ryazan Avenue, because the rest of the roads are very narrow.  A large freeway is always busy, so traffic jams are a common occurrence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mystery buyer reviews address" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954595.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Ryazansky Prospekt, ownership 2 is the address of the Sreda residential complex.  The recall of the secret buyer allows us to judge that at the moment he has not made the impression of a cozy one.  In the future, it is planned to build a metro station and create a route without traffic lights with <span>underground passages,</span> that is, accessibility problems should be solved.  But all this is in the future, and today it is noisy and unsightly.  To get here, you have to wait a long time for the bus, and in your personal car you risk losing even more time. </p><h2>  Sales office </h2><p>  It is located on the territory of the complex, in one of the former workshops of the plant.  Exterior decoration sets it apart from the rest of the buildings, so do not pass by.  In parallel, you can inspect the construction site itself.  It is fenced, but everything is perfectly visible.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine a cozy LCD ‚ÄúSreda‚Äù here.  The feedback of the mystery shopper, the photo, all this suggests that the work is still very far away.  While a pit has been dug here, equipment is working, the remains of the factory with brick pipes are preserved on the territory. </p><p>  The sales office is quite cozy, it is bright and airy.  The developer does not sell housing, there are two sellers for this, these are Metrium and Bon Ton.  Offices are open until 21:00 every day.  Near the reception are two layouts of the quarter, this allows you to consider it in its entirety, as well as first of all.  Managers are competent and well-informed people who are ready to answer all questions.  Judging by the reviews of the mystery shopper, you can rate highly for the service in the sales offices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd mystery buyer reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1954593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Let's look again at what the reviews of the mystery buyer of the Sreda residential complex are saying: </p><ul><li>  The rating of the developer is quite high, it is a large, well-known company.  However, some buyers are confused by the standard contract, which is drawn up at the time of transaction.  According to this document, the developer has a minimum of obligations, no guarantees.  Lawyers say signing such papers means taking risks.  Score 7 out of 10. </li><li>  Information accessibility.  The developer does not care too much about this, but the real estate companies that sell are helping out.  On the other hand, each has its own profile of activity.  Score 6 out of 10. </li><li>  Transport accessibility is not the best, but in the future they promise to solve this issue by opening a new metro station.  Score 6 out of 10. </li><li>  Service.  The work of managers in sales offices is estimated at 8 out of 10. Managers have room to grow, but today they can provide the client with all the necessary information and answer questions. </li><li>  Infrastructure - without even considering the promise of the developer, we can say that there is everything that is needed.  Business center and shopping center, shops, kindergarten and bank branches, that is, social.  objects are quite enough.  The school and kindergarten are rented out by the developer along with the facilities of the first line.  Score 8 out of 10. </li></ul><p>  In general, we can say that in the near future this housing estate will turn into a very developed and attractive for buyers. </p>
