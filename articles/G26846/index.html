    <h2>  Where is Rosabianca 4 located </h2><p>  The hotel is not far from the historical center and from the beach.  At the same time, it is convenient to get here from Federico Fellini Airport.  Therefore, the location at the hotel is the most successful.  It is sometimes called Rosabianca Marina Centro 4 because it is located in an area called Marina Centro.  Not far from the hotel is not only the beach, but also the train station.  In addition, there is a tourist street nearby with various shops, cafes, music and nightlife.  Nevertheless, the hotel is located in the depths of the quarter, and therefore sleep lovers will not suffer from this neighborhood at all.  And in order to get to the historical center of Rimini, you just need to walk through the park.  In a word, almost everything is nearby - shops, the sea, and public transport stops.  Free buses leave from one of them at once for several shopping centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosabianca 4 rimini reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/569628.jpg" width="415"></div>
