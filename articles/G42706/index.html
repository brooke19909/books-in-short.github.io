    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is a Kiwi Conscience card?  Reviews indicate that this product is the most common banking plastic.  As you might guess, it is served by Qiwi-Bank. </p><p>  "Conscience" is an installment card.  It is also sometimes called a credit card with interest-free rates.  That is, a person will have to return exactly as much as he spent.  This is a tempting proposal.  And many potential users are interested in plastic. </p><h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  Map "Kiwi" "Conscience" reviews are very mixed.  Among them are both good and not very good.  We can say with confidence that ordering plastic is not difficult.  But for this you will have to meet some requirements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to Conscience card holders, plastic is issued if: </p><ul><li>  a citizen has an official and stable income; </li><li>  the applicant is already 18 years old; </li><li>  a person has a good credit history; </li><li>  no debts and open loans; </li><li>  the applicant is a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  There is a permanent residence in Russia. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, foreigners will not be able to test the studied card.  But this is not such a big drawback.  The "Kiwi" installment card "Conscience" appeared in Russia recently.  And therefore, it is possible that soon foreign citizens will be able to use the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi conscience installment card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2055684.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  It is not difficult to get the studied plastic.  Reviews on the Kiwi Bank credit card Conscience in this area are mostly positive. </p><p>  The thing is that it is allowed to fill out an application for the issuance of plastic: </p><ul><li>  personally in Qiwi representative offices ("Geobank", "Svyaznoy"); </li><li>  through the Internet. </li></ul><p>  You can act in different ways.  It all depends on the personal preferences of the client.  But if you believe the reviews about the "Kiwi" "Conscience" card, it is better to apply for plastic yourself.  When processing applications via the Internet, the applicant may be denied a service.  This happens even with an ideal credit history.  What is the cause of failures?  In banal system failures, from which no one is safe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Documents for registration </h2><p>  What will be required to issue a studied card?  If you believe the numerous customer reviews, paperwork will be minimal.  Getting a Kiwi installment card Conscience is easier than it sounds. </p><p>  Each citizen will need: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  income statements (preferably); </li><li>  application for issuing a card. </li></ul><p>  It's all.  No more documents are needed.  The application is filled out by a citizen directly on the Internet or at a Qiwi dealership.  Therefore, it will be issued at one point or another.  Kiwi customers say they can actually get plastic called Conscience with just one passport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi conscience installment card reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2055683.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Steps to use </h2><p>  But only after the card is issued, a person will not get access to all the required services.  Plastic will have to be activated. </p><p>  Thus, many reviews of the Kiwi Conscience card emphasize that the order of the ‚Äúdocument‚Äù is divided into several stages.  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Collection of papers.  We have already said about them. </li><li>  Application Form. </li><li>  Confirmation of operation. </li><li>  Getting a card. </li><li>  Activation. </li></ol><p>  Only after all this, everyone will be able to use the interest-free loan from Qiwi-Bank.  Is it really that easy? </p><h2>  Online order </h2><p>  Not really.  Some users complain that the design of plastic over the Internet does not always end successfully.  Quite often, system failures occur, which lead to rejection of requests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  How can I issue a "Conscience" via the Internet?  This will require: </p><ol><li>  Open sovest.com in a browser. </li><li>  Click on the "Get a card" button. </li><li>  Fill out an application.  All available fields have signature hints. </li><li>  Wait for the operator to call.  This is necessary to confirm the request.  Call back usually after 10-15 minutes. </li><li>  Provide the plastic delivery address. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, all the manipulations end.  It remains only to wait for the readiness of the card.  It would seem that everything is simple.  But if you believe the reviews about the ‚ÄúKiwi‚Äù card ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù, you can see that sometimes the operator calls back and reports about the impossibility of processing plastic.  This happens not only because of failures, but also if a person has a bad credit history.  The refusal is completely legal; Qiwi is not obliged to justify it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card kiwi conscience reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2055682.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Activation </h2><p>  Card "Kiwi" "Conscience" user reviews are not the best earned for the activation process.  It is simple, but at the same time activating the plastic is a lot of trouble. </p><p>  Typically, to translate ideas into reality, the client needs to send 16 digits engraved on a bank card to 5152.  In response, a message with a pin code will come.  It remains only to make some purchase using the card. </p><p>  But it‚Äôs not so simple.  Numerous reviews of the Qiwi Bank credit card (Conscience is its name) emphasize that activation does not always succeed.  Often, citizens cannot handle the operation.  Plastic simply does not activate for one reason or another.  For example, due to a person having an open loan. </p><p>  That is, you can draw up a Conscience card, but you will not be able to use it.  Not the best phenomenon.  It is emphasized by citizens quite often. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Interest-free card "Kiwi" "Conscience" receives positive reviews for the features of plastic maintenance.  No need to overpay or spend a lot! </p><p>  Card issuance is completely free.  Not requiring any costs and SMS-informing about payments and bonuses.  Need courier delivery?  You won‚Äôt have to pay for it either.  For this feature plastic "Conscience" receives a lot of positive feedback. </p><p>  The content of the card in the first year of its use will cost 290 rubles, in the subsequent years - 590. Plastic is issued for a maximum of 5 years.  After that, it can be reissued.  No Qiwi client has encountered this operation yet.  For re-registration will have to pay 590 rubles.  If the card is lost, then the restoration will cost 690 rubles. </p><p>  All of these are pretty favorable terms for using the card.  They attract customers.  But most often, reviews about the Kiwi Conscience card emphasize the lack of interest on loans.  In fact, a person will be able to purchase plastic goods by installments. </p><h2>  Delay </h2><p>  But this does not mean that you can delay payments.  Reviews on the ‚ÄúKiwi‚Äù interest-free card ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù indicate that this plastic offers installments for a maximum of one year.  The period of validity of the loan and interest-free payments depends on where the citizen made the purchase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi bank credit card conscience reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2055681.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the allotted time to pay off the debt has passed, you will have to face a number of penalties.  For each month of delay, the holder of plastic "Conscience" must pay 290 rubles.  In addition, a fine of 10% per annum is imposed.  This is where the interest rates end.  If you pay your bills on time, there will be no overpayment.  Installment plan is really provided to all holders of Conscience cards.  This is not a hoax, as some people suggest. </p><h2>  Payment Features </h2><p>  It would seem that the proposal under study is simply ideal.  Installment without interest and overpayments - what could be better?  But everything is not as simple as it seems. </p><p>  What do the reviews say about the Qiwi Bank card?  "Conscience" - plastic, which is sometimes problematic to issue.  And using it is also not so easy. </p><p>  The thing is that you can pay with a Conscience card only in certain stores.  It's about Qiwi partners.  This is indicated by many owners of plastic.  And this fact gives rise to a lot of negativity.  Customers do not like that paying with a card is not possible everywhere. </p><p>  In total, Qiwi has more than 45 partners.  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  MVideo </li><li>  La'moda. </li><li>  Lego </li><li>  "Daughters and sons." </li><li>  "Platypus". </li><li>  Burger King. </li><li>  "Ile de Beaute". </li><li>  "Shatura". </li><li>  Aeroflot. </li><li>  The Messenger. </li><li>  Euroset. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of Qiwi-bank partners.  But it is precisely at these retail outlets that citizens make their purchases most often. </p><h2>  Without partners </h2><p>  What happens if I use the card not in partner stores?  How dangerous is this? </p><p>  The "Kiwi" ("Conscience") installment card will simply not work.  This is indicated by many owners of plastic.  You won‚Äôt be able to make purchases anywhere.  The owners of this credit card are very limited.  And this fact repels some. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi bank card conscience reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2055680.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cashing out </h2><p>  Real reviews about the "Conscience" ("Kiwi") card often emphasize another small drawback of plastic.  What is it about? </p><p>  The card being studied does not provide for cash withdrawals.  No ATM will process the request.  But at the same time, you can replenish the balance of plastic "Conscience" in cash. </p><h2>  Limits </h2><p>  Feedback from users of the Kiwi card Conscience often indicates low limits on funds allocated to customers.  Under current conditions, the maximum installment plan is 300,000 rubles.  But to achieve such a limit, you will have to try.  Sometimes a card has to be reissued several times. </p><p>  When you first request for a plastic, you should not count on a high limit.  It will be set in accordance with the income received by a person.  The more stable earnings, the higher the limit. </p><p>  Reviews of the Qiwi card (‚ÄúConscience‚Äù - the studied plastic was given this name) demonstrate that the first design will allow you to take in installments in the amount of about 5-10 thousand rubles.  Maximum up to 20,000. High limits are a rarity.  This fact is frustrating.  Especially considering the fact that no one talks about such serious restrictions.  Some feel altogether deceived.  Indeed, in terms of using plastic from "Kiwi" a limit of 300 thousand rubles is indicated! </p><h2>  About delivery </h2><p>  Kiwi bank card "Conscience" receives not the best type of feedback for courier delivery.  Customers are pleased that you do not need to pay for it.  But this is where the advantages of the service end. </p><p>  Sometimes you can see that the Conscience card is delivered for a long time.  A small but still a drawback.  In addition, many plastic holders talk about the not very polite attitude of couriers.  These data are not confirmed, but such information is not so rare on otzovik sites. </p><p>  The good news is that the ordered cards are not lost.  And using the courier delivery, the client can be sure that he will have plastic. </p><h2>  Closing </h2><p>  Qiwi credit card reviews (‚ÄúConscience‚Äù is the name of the proposal under study) of the negative type are earned due to problems with closing the plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi map conscience user reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2055679.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Customers say that Qiwi does not have a single bank in Russia.  Representative offices are replaced by partner stores.  But they can‚Äôt close the plastic.  You will either have to personally contact the Qiwi public service center, or refuse the opportunity being studied by mail. </p><p>  The only Qiwi customer service department with Conscience cards is located in Moscow.  Therefore, most often you have to act by mail.  Closing plastic takes a lot of time.  In addition, Qiwi Bank requires the return of Conscience cards.  Of course, they also have to be sent by mail.  This technique is not credible. </p><h2>  What's the catch? </h2><p>  We found out what reviews on the Kiwi installment card (Conscience) are left by modern citizens of the Russian Federation.  Some are interested in what is the catch of plastic. </p><p>  As we already said, you can pay with a card only in certain stores.  Close the plastic is problematic, you can not withdraw cash.  In addition, the disadvantage is that cards may be refused activation without any explanation.  And this happens quite often. </p><p>  There are no more features with interest-free Kiwi Conscience cards.  Customer reviews are different.  But with their help, you can understand that the service being studied is not a scam.  If you consider all the features of plastic, you can get the most out of the offer! </p>
