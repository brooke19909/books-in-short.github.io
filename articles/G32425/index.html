Most hotels in the city offer service to the highest quality standards.  One of the best options for accommodation here will be the Armani Hotel Dubai, which is located in the heart of Dubai.  It is about him that we will talk about in this article.  Consider its infrastructure, number of rooms, as well as reviews of guests who were lucky to stay at the hotel earlier. </p><h2>  More about hotel location </h2><p>  Dubai is a huge and rapidly developing city, in each part of which there are many luxury hotels.  Tourists note that the Armani Hotel Dubai 5 * at all has the best location.  The fact is that it is located not just in the city center, but in the tallest building in the world - the Burj Khalifa skyscraper.  The hotel itself occupies as many as 11 floors in it, and also has a separate entrance for guests.  Accordingly, next to the hotel there are many infrastructure facilities: restaurants, bars, shops.  In the immediate vicinity is the famous <span>Dubai</span> Mall and an artificial lake with a musical fountain.  But the coast, unfortunately, is a decent distance from here.  So, you can drive to the famous Jumeirah Beach Park in 15 minutes. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.1975148" data-lng="55.2748732" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/8/8/4688.png"></div><p>  The nearest international airport is in the suburbs of Dubai.  The distance to it is approximately 30 km.  Tourists arriving to rest in a hotel, as a rule, are picked up from the airport by a comfortable bus equipped with comfortable seats and air conditioning.  Transfer to the hotel usually takes 15-20 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  The hotel is considered a vacation spot for extremely wealthy people, so living here is not cheap.  Planning a trip and making a reservation at the Armani Hotel in Dubai is best in advance, because in the high season there may simply not be enough rooms for everyone.  In total, the complex offers 160 modern apartments equipped with the latest technology.  The hotel itself was opened for tourists in 2010.  It is worth noting that a dress code is applied in the skyscraper building, so visitors in beachwear or too open clothing are not allowed inside.  It is no coincidence that the hotel received just such a name.  The fact is that the famous Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani was involved in the development of the entire interior design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.honeymoondreams.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Entrance" class="if uuid-2561602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2561602.jpg"></div><p>  Despite its status, the hotel adheres to the standard accommodation rules for Dubai.  It is allowed to come here with children of any age, but pets are best left at home - their stay is strictly prohibited.  When registering, the administrator will necessarily require tourists an identification card and a credit card.  Upon arrival, all guests will be charged a deposit, which will be returned after eviction.  The hotel has Russian-speaking staff.  The last renovation of the rooms was held here in 2012. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Armani Hotel Dubai </h2><p>  The choice of guests is offered several categories of rooms.

We list the basic amenities that guests can find in their rooms: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  a plasma TV and a set of satellite TV channels; </li><li>  central cooling system; </li><li>  Wireless Internet - available for a fee; </li><li>  a refrigerator for storing food and a minibar for drinks; </li><li>  coffee machine and tea or coffee making facilities; </li><li>  direct telephone, which can be used both for communication with staff and for international calls; </li><li>  built-in hairdryer in the bathroom; </li><li>  a bathrobe, slippers and a set of towels for each guest; </li><li>  bath accessories (shampoo, shower gel and soap). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderersdiaries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom" class="if uuid-2561592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2561592.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The Armani Hotel in Dubai, the photo of which can be seen in this article, is located in a skyscraper and does not have its own territory.  However, this did not prevent its owners from creating developed infrastructure on the available area.  We list the main services that are available to hotel guests: </p><ul><li>  private parking - guests can leave their car here for free, and car rental is also available on site; </li><li>  ATM and currency exchange; </li><li>  a 24-hour front desk, which also has a tour desk and a ticket sales point for various recreational activities; </li><li>  paid laundry; </li><li>  a flower and pastry shop, as well as a souvenir shop; </li><li>  therapist's office - he provides his services only for a fee. </li></ul><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that the hotel has a separate business center.  It offers tourists 10 conference rooms, each of which is equipped with modern computers, projectors and other equipment.  The largest of the halls seats up to 150 delegates.  There are also small meeting rooms on the territory, designed for only 4-6 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restroom" class="if uuid-2561619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2561619.jpg"></div><h2>  More on Catering </h2><p>  It is worth noting that at the Armani 5 * hotel in Dubai there is no way to pay the all-inclusive system, which is convenient for many tourists.  The price includes breakfast only.  They are served at a common buffet in the main restaurant, which is called Mediterraneo.  There are also three restaurants on site, where visitors are served an √† la carte menu.  In them, for a fee, tourists can have lunch and dinner with delicious dishes from around the world.  Guests can order elite alcohol or other soft drinks in two hotel bars: Armani Lounge and Armani Prive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insydodubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Restaurant" class="if uuid-2561618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2561618.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the hotel decided to strictly observe the fast during the holy month of Muslims Ramadan.  During this period, tourists can only eat in the evening.  Iftar is offered to guests after sunset.  An hour after it, guests are allowed to drink alcohol, and hookah at this time is completely prohibited.  At the same time, guests are not provided with a sukhur. </p><h2>  Beach holidays at the hotel </h2><p>  Since the Armani hotel in Dubai is considered a city, not a beach, it does not have its own plot on the coast, where its guests could relax.  Tourists usually visit the nearest city beach, Jumeirah Beach Park, which can be reached in 15 minutes.  However, the hotel does not provide guests with a free bus to it, so they will have to travel on their own.  Entrance to the beach is free, but there is a charge for renting sun loungers, sun umbrellas and mattresses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach view" class="if uuid-2561587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2561587.jpg"></div><p>  For those guests who do not want to spend a lot of time on the road, the hotel has an outdoor pool.  Next to it is a sun terrace with free sun loungers and parasols. </p><h2>  Other types of entertainment </h2><p>  City hotel "Armani" in Dubai offers not the best conditions for a beach holiday, but it compensates for this with a considerable number of other leisure options.  For example, for a fee, guests can visit the luxurious spa, which offers a lot of wellness and beauty treatments for face and body.  There is also a sauna and a steam room, a jacuzzi and a massage room.  You can relax in the evening at the Prive nightclub, where discos are regularly held.  Sports enthusiasts can also spend time in the gym.  And for connoisseurs of art on one of the floors equipped with a real art gallery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderersdiaries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View to a pool" class="if uuid-2561588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2561588.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for placing with small children </h2><p>  The Armani Hotel in Dubai accepts tourists with children of any age, but you cannot call it family.  The fact is that it is located in the very center of the city, so in the evenings and nights it is quite noisy on the street.  In addition, a huge selection of amenities for young children is not provided here.  So, for example, tourists can request from the administrator in the room a separate cradle for babies under 2 years old.  It is provided free of charge.  There is a mini club for kids at the hotel.  The restaurants have high chairs for feeding.  Guests can also call a qualified nanny in their room for a fee.  She charges an hourly fee, but tourists also have to pay her taxi. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the Armani Hotel in Dubai </h2><p>  This hotel is considered one of the best in the city, so, of course, tourists most often respond positively about living here.  They believe that the high cost of a hotel stay is fully justified by the quality of local services.  In their reviews, they usually name the following advantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the rooms overlooking the singing fountain have a magnificent view; </li><li>  qualified staff who always politely and good-naturedly communicate, and also strives to fulfill all the requirements of tourists; </li><li>  stylish rooms with modern and quality furniture; </li><li>  Great spa on site </li><li>  varied and delicious breakfasts, every day new dishes appear on the buffet. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Despite the large number of positive reviews, the Armani Hotel in Dubai sometimes receives negative reviews.  According to tourists, the owners and staff of this hotel should pay attention to the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  inconvenient location for a beach holiday; </li><li>  on the floor of the rooms there are scratches from the suitcases of previous guests; </li><li>  the hotel does not provide guests with air conditioning; </li><li>  from the singing fountain in the evenings it is quite noisy; </li><li>  cramped rooms, furnished in some rooms. </li></ul><p>  Thus, having examined the hotel description and reviews of tourists about it, we can conclude that this complex is ideal for a respectable vacation in the very center of Dubai. </p>
