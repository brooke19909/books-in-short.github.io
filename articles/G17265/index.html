Regardless of the time of year or weather outside the window, most knitters either knit sweaters or think of another model. </p><p>  A sweater with braids is a classic knitwear that combines functionality with beauty.  If you refer to the terms with rigor, then a sweater should be called a type of knitted clothing without a fastener with a high neck, designed for the upper body.  In practice, pullovers and sweaters are so called. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater with braids with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168935.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <h2>  Types of sweaters </h2><p>  Over the long history of development, this type of clothing has received extreme distribution and has undergone several modifications.  Basically, any changes concerned the pattern that was used to make the canvas.  However, the most popular is a sweater with braids.  The cut and model of the sweater remains virtually unchanged.  The most popular models are: </p><ul><li>  classic plain or fitted sweater; </li><li>  raglan; </li><li>  fancy patterns (knitting diagonally, from the sleeve, across). </li></ul><p>  In the past few years, sweaters are also very popular, the cut of which involves the presence of a shortened front part along with an elongated back part. </p><h2>  Women's <span>sweater with</span> <span>braids</span> : the scheme and description of the classic model </h2><p>  The traditional model of a sweater involves knitting details of the front, back, sleeves and neck.  The front and back cloths can be straight or fitted.  The latter always look more elegant and sit better on the figure.  Even if the sweater is not designed to fit the silhouette tightly, a slight narrowing of the canvas in the waist area avoids the formation of a ‚Äúbag‚Äù on the back.  Despite the elasticity of the knitted fabric, to tighten the sweater with braids, you need to make calculations and correctly identify the bottleneck.  Otherwise, the silhouette may be distorted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, knitting even canvases is much simpler and faster, there is no need to calculate loops for reduction and subsequent expansion.  Straight fit for wide <span>volume sweaters.</span> </p><h2>  Patterns for sweaters </h2><p>  As a pattern for knitting straight and fitted parts, the scheme of a female sweater with braids, located below, is perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit sweater female pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168922.jpg" width="242"></div>

    <p>  Its charm is that it uses only the front and wrong loops.  Their intersection creates both the main pattern - the scythe, and the background pattern resembling a honeycomb. </p><p>  The sweater design with braids knitting, proposed later, consists of the same types of loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit sweater pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168921.jpg" width="464"></div>  However, here, unlike the first scheme, not only front loops are intertwined, but also front loops.  Crossing these types of loops in series, one obtains a mesh of facial loops on the wrong fabric.  This technique is used to weave the most complex braids and knots.  Such patterns will require a decent amount of yarn.

Almost every knitter came across a description of the knitting process.  As well as the <span>armhole, this is a</span> real test for nerves and patience. </p><p>  Often, the scheme of a sweater with braids with knitting needles does not provide abbreviations for knitting the necessary round contours of the fabric and they have to be invented independently.  At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the canvas at the exit is symmetrical and without distortions. </p><h2>  Secret tricks </h2><p>  To facilitate the work, you can apply such techniques: </p><ul><li>  draw a pattern on a piece of thick paper and apply knitting to the picture; </li><li>  sequentially record the process of reducing and adding loops.  When knitting the next part, this sequence will need to be repeated in mirror image; </li><li>  the okad will have a smooth shape, if you first reduce the edges of 10-15 loops, then 30% of the height of the okat reduce one loop in each front row, 50% knit evenly, 20% cut intensively (two loops in each front or one loop in each row). </li></ul><p>  The armholes of the front part should be deeper than the armholes of the back part.  Many people think that such subtleties are unnecessary when knitting a knitted fabric, that a sweater with braids "will still stretch as it should."  However, the correct cut largely determines the beauty and accuracy of the model. </p><h2>  Knitting raglan sleeves </h2><p>  The advantage of knitting sweaters and pullovers with <span>raglan sleeves</span> is that you do not need to count loops and rows for knitting armholes and ridges.  The model provides for the formation of uniform bevels of the front and back parts at an angle of 45 degrees.  The sleeves have the same slope. </p><p>  A women's sweater with braids with a raglan sleeve can be started from above (from the neck) or from the bottom.  When knitting on top, it is very convenient to start work with the manufacture of a long neck.  Then, having distributed the fabric into four parts, they continue to knit at the same time both the parts of the front with the back and the sleeves.  The areas reserved for knitting sleeves should be narrower than those that turn into front and back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater with braids" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168919.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  To expand the canvas in four places in succession, in each front row, two loops are added, separating them with one or more loops.  Thus, every second circular row increases by eight loops, and a neat line forms along the ridge.  Sometimes this place is used to place an additional decorative element (braids or openwork pattern). </p><h2>  Neck Sweaters </h2><p>  A sweater element such as a neck can be made in several ways: </p><ul><li>  knit separately and sew; </li><li>  dial loops after stitching the main parts and knit up; </li><li>  tie the neck during the knitting process of the main parts (with a single web). </li></ul><p>  The first method is most convenient, since you can pre-calculate the required number of loops and correct defects in time.  The disadvantage of this method is the seam formed when the neck is sewn.  If you tighten it, it can crush and dig into the neck. </p><p>  The traditional method of knitting the neck remains the most popular: after the details of the front, back and sleeves are sewn, closed and shortened loops are gathered on circular knitting needles and knitted to the desired size.  This process is rather inconvenient and fraught with errors.  The actual size of the neck becomes clear after knitting 10 cm of the canvas, it may be too large, or vice versa, narrow. </p><p>  The latter method consists in the absence of any seam between the details of the sweater and the neck.  The advantage of this method is the ability to connect a sweater with braids, the scheme can be absolutely any, with a pattern that continues on the neck.  As in the photo below, an ornament from complex braids smoothly transforms into a neck pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's sweater with braids" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168923.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  The importance of neat seams for the quality of knitwear </h2><p>  To knit the canvas is half the battle, one of the most important stages is ahead: stitching the sweater.  As a rule, a sweater with braids with knitting needles is female, the scheme describes only before knitting the fabric, which then needs to be assembled.  The exception is only those that are made in circular rows with raglan sleeves.  But they will need to sew sleeves. </p><p>  There is a special knit stitch.  Its principle is clearly illustrated by the picture below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater with braids diagram" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168984.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  The essence of the seam is that it turns out to be as elastic as a knitted fabric.  There is another option, it is designed for faster sewing knitted fabrics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diagram of a women's sweater with braids" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1168968.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <p>  To use it, you need a hook.  This kind of knitted seam is made from the wrong side of the fabric. </p><p>  Properly stitched fabrics look neat even with strong stretching.  In such aspects, the class and quality of the knitted product is manifested. </p>
