Why do I need a flashing? </p><p>  For starters, the pros: </p><p>  1) You can get updated software, fix small errors of the current software; </p><p>  2) Change the interface: replace pictures, melodies, color schemes, screensavers; </p><p>  3) Change the functions of the buttons; </p><p>  4) Improve the quality of shooting photos and videos; </p><p>  5) Improve the volume and quality of sounds. </p><p>  Manufacturers now offer many official free updates and step-by-step instructions so that there are no problems how to flash Nokia.  In this case, everything is quite simple: you need to connect the phone to a computer, go to the official website, flash the Nokia according to the instructions for the models.  As always, at the same time their ‚Äúbuts‚Äù appear ... For example, <span>Nokia 6131 is</span> possible to update, but only with the help of a signed service on the phone, which is not supported by domestic operators.  There are other nuances. </p><p>  - The warranty for the phone expires after it is independently flashed.  In case of problems, the service center will fix them only for money. </p><p>  - After the update, the phone may not respond to switching on, or it will be impossible to call from it. </p><p>  - Some functions of the phone may disappear, for example, Bluetooth or sending SMS in Cyrillic. </p><p>  Well, and other troubles.  Therefore, before looking for opportunities, how to flash a Nokia phone, you need to answer the questions: what will you get from this action, and is the game worth the candle.  A less risky way is to take your favorite phone to a service center to get guarantees of its future performance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if you still decided to update the firmware yourself, and after that the phone stopped showing signs of life - what should I do?  Let's look at the example of model 6300 how to flash Nokia in the ‚Äúdead‚Äù state using the Phoenix program (Phoenix). </p><p>  The firmware of a non-working phone is not very different from the usual one. </p><p>  Connecting the phone to Dead Mode (if the phone does not boot at all): </p><p>  1) Find the "device manager" on the computer in the "Hardware" folder. </p><p>  2) Remove the SIM card and flash drive from the phone, connect it to the computer via cable.  It is important that the phone is maximally charged (at least 30%). </p><p>  3) Install the driver.  To do this, on the phone connected to the computer, you need to press the power and hold the button for a few seconds, then release.  Repeat this three times with an interval of 10-15 seconds.  As a result, Nokia USB flashing generic and Nokia USB flashing parent will be installed.  If any of these devices is highlighted with a yellow exclamation mark, the installation failed.  The reason is the remaining drivers that were not removed before installing Phoenix.  If everything is in order, you can start the firmware. </p><p>  How to flash Nokia: </p><p>  1) On the computer, launch Phoenix and select the No Connection mode.  In the program itself we find "File" - "Open Product". </p><p>  2) Select the type of phone, click OK.  A new menu will appear on the screen.  Select "Flashing" - "Firmware Update". </p><p>  3) Next, you need to select the correct code (Product Code).  If you know him, just enter.  If you don‚Äôt know, then choose the one in the name of which you see either ‚ÄúRU‚Äù or ‚ÄúCyrillic‚Äù.  This is the case when you need Russian in the phone.  If this is not important, choose any code. </p><p>  4) After selecting the code, select ‚ÄúDead Phone USB flashing‚Äù, then click the ‚ÄúRefurbish‚Äù button. </p><p>  5) ‚ÄúPress the phone's power button‚Äù appears in the Output window - this means that the phone must be turned on in the standard way. </p><p>  6) Then we wait until the firmware goes.  If everything goes well, the phone will turn on automatically. </p><p>  There are no guarantees that a dead phone can be revived.  Most often, phones stop working just after unsuccessful independent updates or after lowering the current firmware version.  Therefore, it is necessary to have at least minimal knowledge and skills, and be sure to preliminarily study in detail the possible complications and reviews of other owners of similar phones.  Even a small error that arose due to carelessness or misunderstanding can lead to the fact that the phone will not be taken to recover even in the service center. </p>
