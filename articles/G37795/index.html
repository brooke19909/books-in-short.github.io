  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Theory of social exchange: the essence and basic provisions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The theory of social exchange is a scientific, special approach based on the concept of social interaction, which is understood as the following process: any participant will be able to benefit from the results of actions of all participants in this communication. </p><p>  The emphasis will be on those actions that bring significant benefits.  In its quality can be both material reward and intangible.  In addition, often participants in this process choose a symbolic good - a sign of respect and prestige, <span>positive emotions</span> and more. </p><p>  The theory of social exchange highlights the motivation features of those people who commit acts useful to others.  The fact is that the explanation lies in the expectation, a stable idea that in response to their actions they will receive significant benefit from the actions of another person. </p><p>  Therefore, the concept of social exchange states that the basis of the process of interindividual interaction is the fact that its participants expect confirmation of expectations.  As a result, a behavioral pattern is fixed, a social reflex that connects a system of certain actions in the consciousness of each individual as a ‚Äústimulus ‚Äì reaction‚Äù relationship. </p><p>  A model for researchers who adhere to this concept was the theory of social exchange by Homans, its founder, an outstanding American sociologist. </p><p>  In his main work, he was able to distinguish the following provisions and patterns that explain personal behavior by the fact that everyone wants to maintain their social exchange. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, the more often a specific action of a person is rewarded, the more he or she seeks to perform this action. </p><p>  Secondly, if some kind of stimulus led to a specific action that was rewarded, then when it is repeated, the individual will try to repeat this chain of actions. </p><p>  Thirdly, the result of actions most valuable to a person will contribute to the fact that he will try to take actions aimed at achieving such a result. </p><p>  Fourth, the more often in the past an individual received any reward, the less important it will be to repeat it. </p><p>  Fifthly, if an individual has not received the expected reward for himself, then he will strive to show demonstratively <span>aggressive behavior,</span> and his result will become more valuable than the reward that is not received.  But when receiving remuneration of a fellow-expected, a person will strive to commit demonstratively loyal behavior, the result of which will become very attractive. </p><p>  The theory of social exchange argues that since all individuals will seek to maintain and renew interactions that benefit them, and avoid negative interactions, stable interhuman relationships will form, which are the structure of exchange. </p><p>  They develop on the basis of direct (bilateral), or direct exchange.  In addition, there are options for the presence of indirect or generalized exchange. </p><p>  This can be considered in more detail using the learning process as an example.  So, it is beneficial for students to gain knowledge, abilities and skills in the audience, and the teacher gains in the recognition of his status and self-affirmation.  This is a direct social exchange. </p><p>  If we talk about indirect exchange, it should be noted that the work for which the teacher receives a salary is paid by the students.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, we are talking about <span>budget financing,</span> or about training on a contractual basis. </p><p>  In general, the theory of social exchange covers all areas of human interaction without exception. </p>
