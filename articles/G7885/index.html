    <p>  A business trip is an employee‚Äôs trip in order to perform their duties outside the company‚Äôs location.  She never does without expenses that are compensated to the employee in accordance with applicable law. </p><p>  Travel expenses include: </p><ul><li>  Round trip, but only if the employee has tickets. </li><li>  Rental of housing (checks or receipts are required to be presented). </li><li>  Additional expenses included in the per diem. </li><li>  Telephone calls, mail, currency exchange, transit and commission fees, baggage ticket and any other event, without which the main purpose of the trip will not be achieved. </li></ul><p>  All of the above costs must be documented.  If we talk about per diem, then their size is usually specified in the order or in the provision on business trips, published at each enterprise.  The amount may vary depending on where the employee went: within the region, to another constituent entity of the Russian Federation, or abroad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The legislation does not establish the maximum daily allowance, but if their value inside the country exceeds 700 rubles, and outside it - 2500 rubles, then they must be taxed with personal income tax.  Problems with how to properly prepare an expense report after returning from a business trip should not arise.  The deadline for submitting a document is no more than three days from the moment of arrival.  If the reporting amount was not completely spent, then the difference must be returned to the cashier by means of a cash receipt, but if, on the contrary, there was an overspending, then the employee is compensated with everything using a cash register. </p><h2>  What are the consequences of an incorrectly prepared expense report? </h2><p>  An employee must correctly draw up an <span>advance report on a business trip</span> within three days, otherwise the supervisory authority may consider this amount as income for which personal income tax and insurance premiums should be charged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="correctly draw up an expense report on a business trip" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41113/1530761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The term for compensation of funds overspended by an employee is not established by law.  Therefore, if the accountant did not immediately indicate the information about the expense order in the expense report, this will not entail any penalties. </p><h2>  Compensation terms for salary card overruns </h2><p>  At present, almost all organizations transfer salaries to employees on a bank card.  Is it possible to return the amount spent on the expense report to the employee in the same way? </p><p>  Legislation does not have a clear answer.  The document itself involves only one form of reimbursement of the overspended reporting amount - cash. </p><p>  In 2006, the Central Bank of Russia shared the same opinion in its letter No. 36-3 / 2408.  At the same time, his own letter, but dated December 24, 2008 No. 14-27 / 513, contains information about the question: is it possible to use a bank card to calculate the accountable amount is not the responsibility of the Central Bank.  That network enterprise must independently deal with its problems in this case.  And so that the supervisory authority does not have unnecessary questions, it is recommended to use the cash register. </p><h2>  How to compensate for an employee‚Äôs personal money? </h2><p>  An employee of the organization can go to acquire the necessary goods (works, services) at his own expense.  In this case, there is no need to fill out an expense report.  How to draw up the above actions? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expense report how to format" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41113/1530754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A statement and confirming the purchase of <span>documents (cash</span> receipts, invoices, strict reporting forms, travel documents, etc.) will be quite enough. </p><h2>  Preparation of an advance report in 1C </h2><p>  Each accountant should be familiar with a document such as an expense report.  How to issue in 1C?  The location of the document in the program is the ‚ÄúBank and cash desk‚Äù section. </p><p>  In the created window, you should first specify information about the organization and accountable persons.  The ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button will make the table available, in which it is necessary to reflect all the information on the issued funds. </p><p>  There are three types of advance payments: </p><ul><li>  <span>Cash documents.</span>  This takes into account air and train tickets, tickets, postage stamps and more. </li><li>  Cash.  The main purpose of the document is to write off cash. </li><li>  Payment account.  The document is necessary in order to take into account the debiting of the non-cash amount from the current account of the company. </li></ul><p>  In order to generate information on cash withdrawal, you need to start by creating a new expenditure cash order.  After filling out the document, it should be printed out and handed over to the accountable person so that the latter fills in the line on receipt of funds and signs it.  Only then can you save and post the document. </p><p>  Information on goods and materials purchased by an accountable person should be indicated in the tabular part of an expendable cash warrant.  If the purchase of goods was accompanied by the issuance of an invoice, then it is necessary to put the SF flag, select the Supplier and fill in its details. </p><p>  The section "Returnable packaging" requires filling in the information about the packaging that the Supplier is waiting for back. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúPayment‚Äù section records the amounts paid to the supplier for previously purchased goods.  The advance paid is reflected by posting D 60.02 To 71.01. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúOther‚Äù tab is designed to account for other expenses of the accountable person (business trip, travel, fuel expenses, etc.). </p>
