During his career, he went through several campaigns and bloody battles, defending the honor and interests of the kingdom. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  The future Admiral Horatio Nelson was born in 1758 in the family of a priest.  His father had 11 children, but this did not stop him from raising them all in an atmosphere of love and attention.  Edmund Nelson tried to accustom Horatio to physical labor and exercise.  His son was notable for ill health, but at the same time had an energetic character. </p><p>  The 12-year-old Horatio decided to follow in the footsteps of his uncle and become a sailor.  In 1771, he first appeared in the ocean.  His ship "Triumph" went to the West Indies (Caribbean Islands), where the young got his first professional experience. </p>

    <h2>  US War of Independence </h2><p>  In 1777, the young Horatio Nelson finally connected his life with the Navy, having successfully passed the exams for the rank of lieutenant.  He was still drawn to the western seas, where Britain had many colonies.  However, it was at this time that the kingdom faced a serious problem.  The American colonies declared war on the mother country, wanting to gain independence.  In 1776 they formed the United States of America. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The colonists were supported by Spain, which had large possessions on the continent.  In response, Britain sent a fleet to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.  Horatio Nelson was on one of those ships.  He participated in the landing at the mouth of the San Juan River.  The operation was unsuccessful.  The British failed to gain a foothold in the territory of the modern country of Nicaragua.  In addition, Nelson was sent to Jamaica during the campaign.  Perhaps this saved his life, since most of the British remaining on the mainland died. </p><h2>  In peacetime </h2><p>  Soon the war for US independence ended.  However, Horatio Nelson's ship remained in the West Indies.  Great Britain still had colonies in this region.  For several years, the officer was engaged in regulating trade with the Americans.  At this time, a new market was created, the rules of which were dictated by the United States. </p><p>  In the late 80s, Nelson returned to his homeland.  But he did not succeed in a quiet life.  In France, a revolution broke out that overthrew the monarchy.  The king was executed, and supporters of the republic were in power.  Most European monarchies were horrified by these events.  Over the next few years, they alternately formed anti-French coalitions. </p>

    <h2>  Wounds and the rank of Rear Admiral </h2><p>  All these military campaigns went through and Horatio Nelson.  The officer‚Äôs biography is a battlefield full of suffering.  In 1794, in Corsica, he injured his eye.  A few years later, Nelson lost his right hand.  This happened in a battle in the Canary Islands, where the British fought with the Spaniards, who supported the French. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In a battle near Cape St. Vincent in Portugal, Nelson on his own initiative took his own ship out of the general squadron and took a risky maneuver that helped the British win a landslide victory.  A brave officer led the capture of two Spanish ships that were boarded.  After this battle in 1797, Nelson became Rear Admiral.  He was not yet 40 years old. </p>

    <h2>  Fleet Hero </h2><p>  In 1798, Nelson received a squadron in his command.  It was not for nothing that the authorities entrusted him with the fleet - this officer was distinguished by courage, a sharp mind and the ability to make a strong-willed decision in the most difficult moment.  Nevertheless, he was not without some sailor superstitions.  On the mast of the flagship of Horatio Nelson hung a horseshoe - a symbol of good luck.  Sailors from any country have always been distinguished by a love of omens.  What is only the <span>international custom of</span> launching a ship into the water! </p><p>  Meanwhile, the successful and courageous commander Napoleon Bonaparte was gaining more and more popularity in France.  He did not want to depend on the republican government.  In 1798, the general organized an Egyptian campaign.  His goal was to break the connection of Great Britain with the colonies in India.  Formally, Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire, but the main confrontation in the region broke out precisely between the French and English troops. </p>

    <p>  When the British squadron entered the Mediterranean Sea and headed towards an exotic country, a horseshoe still flaunted on the mast of the flagship of Horatio Nelson.  He hoped that he would not fail his country at such a crucial moment for the whole nation. </p><h2>  The Battle of Abukir </h2><p>  The decisive <span>naval battle</span> in the Egyptian campaign was the battle of Abukir, which lasted from August 1 to 3, 1798.  For the previous three months, the British fleet hastily pursued the French ships, on board of which was an expeditionary force under the command of Bonaparte.  Napoleon managed to land in Egypt, after which he went inland.  The fleet anchored on the shore of the Gulf of Abukir not far from the famous Alexandria.  At the disposal of Commander Francois De Bruyet there were 13 <span>battleships</span> and 4 frigates.  It was a formidable force.  Admiral Horatio Nelson sailed to Egypt with a small quantitative lag - 14 <span>battleships</span> and a sloop. </p><p>  The main reason for the failure of the French was that they allowed the British to maneuver and surround the flotilla from two sides - from the sea and land.  In addition, De Bruet was too smug.  He believed that the British would not dare to attack his large fleet and did not even prepare cannons with which he could repel the first attack.  In the heat of the ensuing battle, the commander died.  The mast of Horatio Nelson and his entire ship were also constantly under fire.  But this time the admiral was lucky.  He not only survived, but also won the battle.  The French fleet was destroyed.  Napoleon was cut off on a land alien to him, which predetermined the failure of his adventurous campaign. </p>

    <h2>  On the eve of the last battle </h2><p>  The Egyptian campaign again rallied the European monarchies.  They created a new coalition against the republic.  Meanwhile, Napoleon returned to his homeland was at the center of the coup.  At first he became the first consul, and in 1804 - the emperor. </p><p>  The entire beginning of the XIX century was marked by the Napoleonic wars.  France was still supported by Spain.  Bonaparte planned to arrange a landing landing in the UK.  But he was prevented by the fleet, which reliably guarded the English Channel.  Therefore, the admiral ordered Admiral Villeneuve to conduct a deceitful maneuver, heading for the <span>Caribbean Sea,</span> where there were English colonies. </p><p>  However, the plan did not work.  The British, not wanting to leave their native island unguarded, remained in the strait.  Napoleon abandoned the original plan and decided to attack the Kingdom of Naples in Italy.  Meanwhile, the French fleet returned to Spain, where it was blocked by Nelson in Cadiz. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  Napoleon ordered Villeneuve to break out of the encirclement and go to the Mediterranean Sea to help him in Italy.  The admiral tried to execute the order, but failed.  His fleet was destroyed by the British, led by Horatio Nelson.  The biography of this brave officer is full of episodes with his injuries.  But this time, on the first day of the decisive Trafalgar battle, he was shot dead by a sniper from a distance of 15 meters. </p><p>  This happened on October 21, 1805.  The death of the admiral only angered the British.  Enraged, they destroyed 22 ships, without losing a single one.  Every contemporary contended about the departed national hero.  Horatio Nelson personified all the ideals of an impeccable officer. </p><p>  In honor of his last victory, one of the central London squares was renamed Trafalgar.  The center of her architectural ensemble is the <span>Nelson's Column, which was</span> installed there in 1843 in memory of the talented admiral. </p>
