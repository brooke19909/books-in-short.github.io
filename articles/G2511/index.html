    <h2>  The history of the estate </h2><p>  The first mention of the estate dates back to the 16th century.  Then it was a small village belonging to the landowner Volynsky.  The most significant period for the village began in 1843, when it passed into the ownership of the writer S.T. Aksakov. </p><p>  Being a passionate fan of hunting and nature, Sergei Timofeevich felt great in the estate.  N.V. Gogol and I.S. Turgenev came to visit him.  There were actor M. S. Shchepkin and historian <span>M. P. Pogodin.</span>  Aksakov worked fruitfully in Abramtsevo.  Here were written "Childhood of Bagrov the grandson", a tale beloved by many generations about a magical <span>scarlet flower.</span> </p><h2>  Estate of Savva Mamontov </h2><p>  After the writer was gone, the estate quickly fell into disrepair, and in 1870 the heirs of Aksakov sold it to the famous industrialist S.I. Mamontov.  Savva Ivanovich immediately set about restoring him.  First of all, he renovated the house, built several new utility buildings.  Unfortunately, most of them are lost today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abramtsevo Museum" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339708.jpg" width="500"></div>

In Moscow, his house was always open for talented, creative people.

Its composition included such great masters as V. A. Serov, I. E. Repin, V. D. Polenov, M. A. Vrubel, V. M. and A. M. Vasnetsov and other artists.  They often stayed for a long time on the estate, creating their masterpieces.

    <h2>  Craft workshops </h2><p>  Over time, thanks to the initiative of the son of Savva Ivanovich, his wife, well-known artists, a rich collection of folk art objects was collected in the estate.  She is of great artistic value today.  According to her unique designs, magnificent wooden furniture was created in a carpentry workshop located on the estate's grounds. </p><p>  In 1890, a ceramic workshop began to work on the estate.  Her inspirer and creative leader was M. A. Vrubel.  Decorative sculpture was produced here, tiles of extraordinary beauty for the Moscow Mamontov house and their estate, author's dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abramtsevo museum estate address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339707.jpg" width="600"></div>

They began to be sold in stores in St. Petersburg, Moscow and in several other cities of Russia.  Specialists admired the high quality of these artwork.  In 1900, the products of Abramtsevo masters were awarded honorary awards at the World Exhibition in Paris. </p><p>  The significance of the famous art club cannot be overestimated.  Its participants preserved priceless monuments of Russian decorative and applied art.  Thanks to their efforts, the craft traditions of manufacturing tiles and wooden carvings were revived. </p><h2>  A difficult period in the history of the estate </h2><p>  The end of the 19th century brought great changes to the measured life of the estate.  In 1899, Savva Ivanovich was accused of economic abuse and was imprisoned for several months.  He was acquitted in 1900, but the well-known industrialist lost almost all his fortune. </p><p>  The house in Moscow, along with a collection of works of art stored there, was sold.  Fortunately, Abramtsevo was saved.  The estate was written in advance by Mamontov to his spouse.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a ceramic workshop was transferred from the estate to Moscow, which was transformed into a small pottery factory.  Not everyone knows that it was the Abramtsevo craftsmen who made the facades of the Metropol Hotel, as well as the magnificent exterior decoration of the Tretyakov Gallery building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abramtsevo Museum" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1340259.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Manor after 1917 </h2><p>  In 1918, after the establishment of Soviet power, the Abramtsevo estate was nationalized.  The museum on its territory was opened in the same year.  Its main keeper was <span>Alexandra Mamontova</span> - the daughter of Savva Ivanovich.  The Abramtsevo House Museum lasted until 1932.  Then, a rest house for filmmakers was opened on the estate.  Since 1938, the estate began to be used as a sanatorium.  And during the Second World War, the estate turned into a military hospital. </p><p>  During this difficult time for the whole country, the most valuable relics from the estate were transported to Sergiev Posad.  The exhibits returned in 1950, and the Abramtsevo (museum) opened its doors to visitors.  During this period, Vsevolod Savvich Mamontov, the son of an industrialist, was appointed museum keeper.  In 1995, received a special status "Abramtsevo".  The estate museum has become a monument of federal significance. </p><p>  Today, the artistic traditions of the old manor workshops are continued by the Art and Industry College, which bears the name of the Russian artist V.M.  Vasnetsova. </p><h2>  "Abramtsevo", museum-estate </h2><p>  The current museum complex covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfifty hectares.  It contains several architectural monuments and a beautiful park.  "Abramtsevo" (museum-estate), whose address is: Museum Street, 1, has rich collections.  They count more than twenty five thousand unique exhibits.  These are graphic and pictorial works, sculptural compositions, folk art products, rare archives and photos. </p><h2>  Manor house </h2><p>  The central place of the museum complex is occupied by the oldest building in the estate - the main manor house.  It was built in the XVIII century.  Despite numerous restructures, its symmetrical silhouette, conceived during the construction, is visible today. </p><p>  The eastern facade of the house has an open terrace and overlooks the park, the western - into the courtyard.  Along the eastern facade was the front suite of rooms - a hall, a living room and a front bedroom.  Along the western fa√ßade stretched the daily enfilade, which housed the living quarters of family members.  A spacious corridor ran between two enfilades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abramtsevo Museum opening hours" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today in the manor house there is an exposition dedicated to the Aksakov family, their friends.  Here you can see paintings and photographs, books and furniture.  All these items were collected by the Mamontov spouses.  They were bought in Moscow antique stores. </p><p>  In the manor house is another interesting exhibition, which is dedicated to the Abramtsevo art circle.  Here are portraits of the Mamontov family, members of the art circle, and the situation has been preserved since those ancient times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museum abramtsevo reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339704.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building of the former medical building today houses a permanent exhibition of works by Russian and Soviet artists. </p><h2>  Church of the Savior </h2><p>  "Abramtsevo" is a museum that has unique structures on its territory.  First of all, it is the Church of the Savior.  The author of her project was the famous artist V.D. Polenov.  Later, his work was continued by V.M. Vasnetsov.  Magnificent stylization under Russian antiquity, the iconostasis of the temple is a real work of art.  Most of the icons for the church were painted by great artists who were part of the Mammoth Circle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="house museum abramtsevo" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339706.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gazebo </h2><p>  Another monument that has become the hallmark of Abramtsevo.  The museum stores the original <span>architectural structure.</span>  This is an unusual wooden arbor - ‚ÄúHut on Chicken Legs‚Äù.  It is located near the church.  The arbor appeared in the estate in 1883.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits creation belongs to V. M. Vasnetsov. </p><p>  Looking at her, it seems that Baba Yaga is now looking out of her.  Despite the fact that this fabulous building is located very close to the church and other buildings, it seems that the hut is in a dense impassable forest. </p><h2>  A park </h2><p>  "Abramtsevo" is an amazing museum.  If you happen to visit the estate, be sure to take a walk in the wonderful park that surrounds it.  It was divided into three terraces that descend into the valley of the small river Vori. </p><p>  The park is beautiful at any time of the year, but in summer or at the very beginning of autumn it is especially attractive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to the abramtsevo museum reserve" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339709.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum branch </h2><p>  The arts and crafts department of the Abramtsevo Museum-Reserve is located in the town of Khotkovo, not far from the estate.  Its appearance was due to a powerful impulse given by the Abramtsevo workshop to the development of decorative and applied art in the vicinity of Abramtsevo. </p><p>  Actually, the history of the creation of this museum originates from the workshop, which at first was led by Elizaveta Grigoryevna - the wife of S. Mamontov.  Then she was replaced by Elena Polenova.  The carpentry workshop was a school that annually, starting in 1876, accepted five to six children from neighboring villages for training. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abramtsevo Reserve Museum of Arts and Crafts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1339775.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For three years the boys studied for free.  After completing the training course, the graduate received a workbench and a set of <span>carpentry tools</span> as a gift <span>.</span>  The guys returned to their villages and got work at home.  The workshop provided them with orders and material.  More than two hundred magnificent experienced carvers came out of its walls.  Many of them worked, not only performing ready-made samples according to the developed sketches, but also creating their own works.  Some of these works can be seen today in the museum. </p><p>  Now they work and create interesting products not only carvers, but also graphics, masters of ceramics and painters.  Modern authors take an active part in exhibitions, for which several halls on the ground floor are reserved. </p><h2>  "Abramtsevo", museum-estate: how to get there? </h2><p>  From Moscow Yaroslavl Station are electric trains that make a stop at the station "Abramtsevo".  These are the trains heading to Alexandrov, Balakirevo, Sergiev Posad.  The journey to the station you need takes 1.15 hours.  From the platform you need to walk along a picturesque forest trail for about one and a half kilometers.  The road will bring you great pleasure - not often the townspeople have a chance to walk in the forest.  It is impossible to get lost here - there are numerous signs on the trees. </p><p>  If you are planning a car trip, then from Moscow you need to go to the Yaroslavl highway, and drive to the turn to Leshkovo and Radonezh.  Then drive to Khotkova and turn onto Abramtsevo.  The museum is at the end of the main road. </p><p>  You can use the bus.  From Sergiev Posad to the museum you will be transported by buses and minibus No. 55, which makes eight flights a day. </p><h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  From April to October, the Abramtsevo Museum awaits visitors.  Opening hours are convenient to visit.  The manor park is open every day from 10.00 to 20.00, on weekends - until 21.00.  Museum expositions can be viewed from 10.00 to 18.00 on weekdays and until 20.00 on weekends.  You can get to the Main Museum House only when the tour takes place.  In "Abramtsevo" (museum reserve) they are held daily. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Everyone who has already visited the Abramtsevo Museum leaves reviews, as a rule, positive.  The magnificent nature, well-groomed and cleanliness of the territory, interesting expositions, professionalism of the guides admire. </p><p>  Some visitors include the high prices of tickets, souvenirs, photography and even the entrance to the temple to the museum‚Äôs drawbacks.  But, probably, one should not be so categorical in this matter.  The money received for visiting the complex goes to the restoration of the estate and its further development. </p>
