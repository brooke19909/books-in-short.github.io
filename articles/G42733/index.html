    <h2>  Miracle corner </h2><p>  In recent years, the tourist infrastructure of this Black Sea coast has begun to actively develop.  New hotels, pensions and motels began to appear, offering travelers comfortable accommodation and a level of service that meets international standards.  Tourists call this country a miracle because on its rather small territory there is everything that nature is rich in.  This is an amazing purity of the lake, river, waterfalls, mountains, forests and, of course, the sea.  Apparently, this is why holidays in Abkhazia have become so attractive to many people: every visitor searches and finds incredibly beautiful nature, comfort and friendly locals in this country. </p><p>  It is difficult to find a better place for a spa holiday than Sukhum or Gagra, Gudauta, Pitsunda or New Athos.  On the one hand, they are surrounded by the Black Sea, and on the other, the Caucasus Mountains, which protect the coast from the winds and contribute to the creation of a subtropical climate.  In the resorts of Abkhazia, therefore, you can relax from early spring to late autumn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Inter-Sukhum Abkhazia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/963643.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotels here are of two types: either they are capitally restored buildings inherited from the Soviet era, or new modern buildings.  Many boarding houses, hotels and motels of the capital of Abkhazia have their history for many decades, maintaining the best traditions and at the same time constantly improving the level of service.  More and more often, new objects began to appear - these are <span>private mini-hotels that</span> are designed for a wide variety of incomes.  At the same time, prices for accommodation in <span>Sukhumi hotels</span> are considered more affordable than on the adjacent Russian Black Sea coast.  On average, all offers range from a thousand to six to seven thousand rubles per room per day.  Even the most fashionable local hotels delight tourists with their reasonable rates, and especially during the off-season, including the Inter-Sukhum Hotel.  This hotel is familiar to many as a former "Intourist". </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  It is located in a park area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital of Abkhazia on the very shore of the sea.

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the Inter-Sukhum Hotel is equally comfortable to relax both in summer and at other times of the year.  Many tourists note the good location of the hotel, as well as a rich excursion program. </p><p>  Most Russians rate food at five points.  There are no complaints about the work of the staff.  Some tourists did not like the fact that in the lobby of the hotel is always smoked, and the fact that walking in the beach is not allowed. </p><p>  Nevertheless, most vacationers agree on one thing: the price / quality ratio is good, and therefore Inter-Sukhum (3 * hotel) can be a great place to spend a vacation. </p>
