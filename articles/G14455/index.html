Then attach 2 elastic bands to the central posts.  To the central part, a piece twisted by an eight is thrown off from above.  Then a couple more rubber bands are thrown. </li><li>  At the next stage of <span>weaving from gum on the machine "Monster Tail" the</span> lower part is thrown into the center.  Then you need to throw two more elastic bands and transfer them to the middle.  The elastic band from which the layer of ice cream will be made should be fixed to the central pegs.  Then erasers sticks are thrown off.  An elastic band of white color is poured in a horizontal plane, rainbow elastic bands are added from each edge, they need to be wrapped 4 times. </li><li>  Then 2 elastic bands are attached on the right and left sides, a horizontal elastic band, as well as one with four turns, is thrown into the center.  The primary color material is attached to three pegs.  In the vertical plane, 4 more gum clings.  At the next stage, rubber bands of white color and the main one, located horizontally, are thrown off.  Then you need to hook one in the bottom row and two in a vertical position.  Together with the bottom layer, gum located horizontally is removed. </li><li>  The above steps are repeated twice.  At the third stage, the central part should remain empty, and the rubber band located in the horizontal plane should be twisted twice.  Then all materials are distributed over the central pegs.  Then the last gum clings to which everything needs to be thrown. </li><li>  At the final stage, make a loop and remove the figure.

    <p>  So, <span>how to weave bracelets on the</span> Monster Tail?  To create an ornament you will need elastic bands of two colors, for example, blue and raspberry.  The blue one needs to be pulled over the nearest columns of the machine, while it needs to be twisted to get the figure of eight.  Raspberry is worn over blue, but not twisted. </p><p>  At the next stage of work, you will need a hook.  The elastic is removed from the column on the left and throws off in the center, you don‚Äôt need to put it on anything.  A gum of raspberry color clings to the right column, then from the same edge is worn on the left. </p><p>  Then, blue elastic is thrown over the used columns.  Both colors should alternate.  Then you need to repeat the previous operation, but in reverse order. </p>
