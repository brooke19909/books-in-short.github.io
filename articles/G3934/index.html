It is quiet, absolutely no audible noise of passing cars.  Many are impressed by the hotel‚Äôs own parking lot, good beds with clean and high-quality linen in the rooms, and a cafe where they are varied and deliciously fed.  According to reviews, there is always enough parking space for everyone (parking is closed at night).  Nearby is the TNK gas station, which many travelers consider one of the pluses of the establishment. </p><p>  Some guests were pleasantly surprised that the breakfast in the Voyage is included in the room rate, although this is not indicated when booking.  For breakfast, hotel guests say, they usually serve one dish for free (at choice): pancakes, porridge, fried eggs.  Particularly hungry are offered increased portions (for an extra charge: about 70 rubles). </p><p>  Many guests note that the hotel is very clean and calm.  For children, cots are provided, as well as a corner with toys.  Separately, travelers express their admiration for the hotel staff, calling it very good, attentive and responsive, sincerely glad for the reputation of the institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tourism.karelia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General view of the hotel" class="if uuid-2639499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2639499.jpg"></div><h2>  About the disadvantages </h2><p>  Guests also point out some of the motel's shortcomings.  In particular, they report about a malfunction of the door to the bathroom in one of the rooms, about the case when, during breakfast, instead of butter, guests received margarine, about the low quality of water (this problem, as the authors of the reviews believe, should be considered territorial rather than private ) </p><p>  Tourists also report that the location of the motel is not accurately indicated in the location information, as a result of which the navigator is mistaken for about 5 km, which should be considered by motorists. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  According to travelers, the ‚ÄúVoyage‚Äù has everything that is needed for a tired traveler.  This option, according to the authors of the reviews, is the very thing to relax from the road and spend the night.  Everything here is arranged, albeit simple, the guests note, but it is quite convenient and affordable.  Many travelers plan on occasion to again use the services of the Voyage Motel. </p>
