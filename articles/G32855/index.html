    <h2>  Mastery must be in everything </h2><p>  Yes, indeed, to attach a small button to its proper place, it is worth working hard.  Someone may say that this is not difficult, but without proper dexterity and preparation, an attempt to return a lost or torn runaway to its place may end in vain. </p><p>  It is important to attach the button symmetrically in relation to the loop, it is necessary to correctly calculate the tension of the thread and make the ‚Äúleg‚Äù so that the clasp does not sag excessively, but also is not too close to the fabric.  Aesthetic components, such as accuracy, the choice of a thread that is suitable in color and thickness, and even methods for sewing buttons, are also important.  As you can see, any business, even such an elementary one as sewing buttons, must be approached responsibly and seriously. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Scary amulet </h2><p>  In our age of modern technology and the mass market, the button has ceased to be something special, people rarely order clothes from tailors, and therefore choosing a fastener is more of a task for designers in sewing enterprises.  And in these organizations, procurement managers are guided rather by the benefit and functionality of the button, but not by its beauty and style.  But a few centuries ago, it was of much greater importance to man, was a talisman, amulet, an indicator of his wealth and taste. </p><p>  The more affluent a man was, the more luxurious buttons he could afford.  This is now the predominant number of such products are made of cheap plastic, although samples from metal, bone, wood and glass are available in stores, and before buttons were real works of art.  They were encrusted with precious stones, covered with gilding and silver, engravers applied ornate patterns, images of family emblems and symbolic signs to tiny clasps.  Moreover, people knew how to sew a button on luck, prosperity, love. </p>

    <p>  The use of clasps for clothes as an amulet has a logical explanation.  Once small bells were attached to things, they had to wake up their owner if someone touched him in a dream.  Such an ‚Äúalarm‚Äù helped to avoid theft, and could even save him from death, but over time the bells were replaced by ordinary buttons, although they can still fulfill their deep roots of the amulet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Aesthetics or something more? </h2><p>  The secret of <span>how to sew a button for good luck</span> consists of several components.  People who sincerely believe in the higher powers and superpowers of the objects surrounding a person are convinced that in order to gain such a special thing with a special energy, you need to perform several fairly simple actions. </p><p>  First of all, it is important to sincerely believe in what you are doing - that is, if you are skeptical about creating the amulet, then there will definitely not be a result from this.  Secondly, the work must be done independently.  Sewing a button for good luck, or for any other purpose, you need to mentally pronounce the desired.  It is not necessary to give the conspiracy any special word-form; it must be capacious and substantial and include variations of the phrase: ‚ÄúWith a button, I sew good luck to myself, and I sew off bad luck‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  There are several other important points in turning the buttons into a real amulet.  After all, if everything was so simple, then the most ordinary jacket with buttons would give any person a cloudless sky with his head, wealth and love to the grave.  Keep in mind the following: </p><ul><li>  work should be done on those days when the moon rises; </li><li>  a button is better to get a new one; </li><li>  choosing the sample that is made of natural material and was to your liking, and the amulet needs to be attached not to the first thing that comes across, but to your beloved and often worn. </li></ul><p>  The button can be sewn from the inside, best of all from the left side - closer to the heart. </p><h2>  Simple fix </h2><p>  So, if everything became clear with the questions of high matters, then you should understand the practical side of the problem, namely, how to sew the button correctly, do it carefully and most importantly - reliably. </p><p>  First of all, you need to prepare a place for future repairs.

In this case, the button must be carefully cut, without damaging the fabric, remove the remaining threads and return to its proper place. </p>

    <p>  The classic and most reliable method of sewing is when the stitches form a cross on the front side.  In order for the work to turn out beautiful and inside out, stitches should be done not randomly, but following a simple algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Fasten the thread at the sewing position by making several stitches stacked on top of each other. </li><li>  Sew on the button, while the first puncture must be done from the wrong side, removing the needle in the upper left hole, and the seam must be completed from the opposite side - in the lower hole on the right. </li><li>  To make a cross seam, you need to mirror the previous steps - remove the needle and thread from the wrong side to the front side, only this time from the upper right, and direct it into the lower left hole. </li><li>  When sewing on a button, do not forget to make a ‚Äúleg‚Äù for it, slightly loosening the thread.  To avoid excessive tension, a paper tube inserted between the fabric and the clasp will help. </li><li>  The stitches should be repeated several times (5-10), and then fasten the thread by wrapping it around the loops on the front of the product under the button (after removing the match) and making the control stitch through the formed ‚Äúleg‚Äù. </li></ol><h2>  Beauty in the details </h2><p>  All other ways of how to sew a button with 4 holes differ only in that the sequence of stitches changes, the principle itself and the course of action remains unchanged. </p><p>  Doing this kind of work, you should pay attention to all stages of sewing.  When the button comes off, as they say, "with meat", and in its place there is no piece of fabric, the product must first be repaired and strengthened.  A very small hole can be patched up, a larger hole is better to cover with a patch on the inside.  Also, you can‚Äôt do without a patch in clothes made of leather (jackets, raincoats, sheepskin coats) or fur. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, before the repair starts, you need to arm yourself with a tool and improvised material, based on what needs to be repaired.  To work with delicate and thin silk, it is better to use a thin needle with a narrow eye, respectively, and the thread should be no thicker than No. 40. </p><p>  A less gentle jacket with buttons made of knitwear also needs a special approach.  But here the difficulties will most likely be with the choice of thread.  It is advisable to use the one from which the product is connected: both in color and in structure.  If there is no suitable piece, then you can choose a similar one from the assortment of threads for embroidery or crocheting.  Also, special plastic needles with a round tip are sold in stores, which helps to avoid ‚Äúinjury‚Äù to knitwear. </p><h2>  Which is easier? </h2><p>  Many, on a hunch, may decide that working with outerwear is easier than working with underwear.  Say, the fabric is denser, I took a stronger thread and sew.  But the difficulty of <span>how to sew a button</span> on a coat or cloak is not so much in the mechanism of work or the selection of thread and needle, but in doing it right. </p><p>  Exactly for outerwear, the presence of a ‚Äúleg‚Äù is a fundamentally important point.  Its absence is a guarantee that the button comes off quickly, the absence of even a small (1-2 mm) gap, equal to the thickness of the floor, will create discomfort when fastening and unfastening clothes, the same as a wrong loop.  A button that does not fit into the prepared eyelet, and is also too close to the fabric, will not stay on the finished product for a long time. </p>

    <p>  For large coarse buttons, it is best to use a strong thread (No. 20) made of polyester.  It is also worth considering that no matter what type of clothing you are to work on, it is best to fold a piece of thread in half.  In this case, the piece should not be very short or excessively long - the optimal length is 50 cm. If you take less, there is a risk that the cut will not be enough, and the larger piece will get confused and fold into knots. </p><h2>  Two in one </h2><p>  Another trick that is most relevant for outerwear is the use of a second button.  It is sewn from the wrong side of the product, and forms a kind of ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù from the upper and lower buttons and material.  For this purpose, special buttons have been created, sometimes they are also called "counter buttons", but the simplest flat round fasteners will also work perfectly. </p><p>  Their use immediately pursues two goals - a more reliable fixation, as well as avoiding deformation of the fabric at the place of sewing on the buttons, due to the fact that the material does not crumple, does not wrinkle, nodules and threads hide on the wrong side of the product. </p><h2>  Technique to help you </h2><p>  Buttons can be sewn not only in the traditional way - with your hands.  Sewing machine owners can use their technology in this business.  Almost all modern sewing machines, even those designed for domestic use, and not industrial ones, have a set of legs as standard, including a foot for sewing buttons.  A special plate was also selected for it to help set up the machine to create loops on the product. </p><p>  The work of sewing buttons through the machine must be done by selecting the line "zigzag" at low speed.  It is important to choose the right stitch width equal to the distance between the holes in the button to avoid chipping the eye of the needle.  To perform such work, the needle is suitable ordinary, unless otherwise required by the fabric.  The same goes for threads. </p>
