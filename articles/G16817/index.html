The product has the greatest value if it is knitted or crocheted.  It‚Äôs not difficult to independently connect a unique, beautiful bolero model.  Anyone can master <span>knitting</span> . </p><p>  Currently, for many, knitting is becoming a favorite and fascinating hobby.  On the Internet, you can quickly find the most diverse knitting bolero for beginners, as well as for more experienced knitters.  Bolero is quite diverse in both form and density, texture and complexity of the pattern.  It is worn not only in the summer, but also in the colder season.  <span>Knitted bolero</span> can be decorated with artificial or natural fur, which will give it great value.  Such models do not go out of fashion and are in constant demand.  Any of the fashionistas will happily acquire a handmade knitted bolero, knitting with knitting needles is not difficult with a certain patience.  But no one else will have such a bolero except you. </p><p>  In order to start knitting, you need to decide on the model.  In special magazines, it is easy to find knitting boleros with a description.  Separately, it should be said that knitting a bolero for beginners should choose a simpler and not very laborious.  You can choose models that fit in one fabric, so they do not require knitting of individual elements with their further assembly.  The magazines present knitting options for bolero knitting with a description for both little girls and girls or for older women. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After you have decided on the model, it is worth purchasing the threads in accordance with the description.  For those who are just starting to learn how to knit and have chosen a <span>bolero</span> for this <span>, knitting</span> will begin with the acquisition of the necessary tool: knitting needles, a darn needle and, possibly, a hook.  Information on the necessary threads and knitting needles for a particular model is in the description that accompanies the figure.  Following the description are patterns of patterns that will be associated with your model, and below is a description of the symbols used in the pattern.  Description, diagrams and decoding of symbols is designed to facilitate you understanding all the moments of the knitting process. </p><p>  After <span>you have completed</span> all the steps described above, it is worth knitting patterns of patterns.  As a rule, they knit a square with sides of 12 centimeters.  Thanks to this, you can learn how to knit a pattern.  The same knitted sample will allow you to calculate the number of rows and loops, as well as compare them with the number indicated in the description. </p><p>  We give as an example a description of the knitting of a simple bolero.  Knitting number 4 and number 6.5.  The design of the model is not only quite simple, but also very interesting.  There is no pretentious design.  In fact, you just need to connect a large rectangle. </p><p>  First you need to determine the width of the shoulders.  To this value for each sleeve you need to add 10 centimeters.  Suppose the shoulder width is 42 cm, then we will knit a bolero (rectangle) 62 cm wide. It is desirable that the elastic band has the following density: 2.5 cm - 4 loops.  It turns out that for our bolero it is enough to dial 99 loops.  However, this is far from an accurate and not <span>final calculation,</span> since you need to correlate the number of loops typed for your bolero with your chosen pattern.  If the report is 4 loops + 2 edge, then you need to dial a total of 98 loops. </p><p>  Then we decide on the length of the model.  To do this, measure the circumference of your armpit.  To the obtained length, it is necessary to add 8 cm on both sides, which will be joined during assembly. </p><p>  We knit an elastic band of 4 - 5 centimeters on knitting needles No. 4, then knit a pattern, and finish the fabric with an elastic band of 4 - 5 centimeters.  At the finished web we connect the edges for the sleeves, thus obtaining a bolero. </p><p>  As you can see - nothing complicated.  Having mastered this model, you can proceed to more interesting options. </p>
