What it is is not a secret for anyone, and some details from the history of the development of this type of building are described in thousands of articles.  We will not rewrite how this direction in construction was born, but talk about the most important: the pros and cons.  Moreover, we dwell not only on buildings, but also consider the townhouse village from the inside.

    <p>  To begin with, it’s worth clarifying such a small detail as the type of buildings.  For the British or Americans, this term has an unambiguous definition - a house in the city (literal translation).  For houses living in Russia, townhouses are not only buildings standing wall to wall in the city, saving expensive land, but also commonplace cottages for two, three or four families with a separate entrance / entrance and access to <span>a barbecue area</span> in a nearby village.  The subtleties of buildings are a matter of choice.  In any case, this direction is very actively developing and the reason is simple - demand. </p><p>  <strong>The benefits of living in homes like townhouses.</strong>  <strong>What is it and how are hopes justified?</strong> </p><p>  (Sorry for such a free reference to the term, but it combines all the improvisations on a given topic.) </p>

Due to the fact that small private developers, whose capabilities are very limited, are most often involved in construction, the development of infrastructure remains outside the scope of the construction budget.  As a result, you get comfortable housing in the "settlements" without shops, pharmacies, kindergartens and schools.  If you are not burdened by family, then the question is not very relevant, although how long will the ambulance go to you?  And if there are children in the family, then one of the parents will have to leave work to accompany the child to school, to sports sections or ballet classes in the nearby city.  You can hire a governess, a nanny or a driver, which, you see, greatly increases costs. </p>

    <p>  2. The next minus can also be attributed to the previous paragraph, but still select it as a separate paragraph.  The direction is relatively new and its development is weak.  In no case do we slander the excellent developers offering their customers and subsequent maintenance of the entire complex (village).  The price of housing in them is an order of magnitude higher, of course, that the conditions are better.  We are talking about the average market for this kind of real estate, namely, buildings for those who have changed a three-room apartment for a three-story cottage with a piece of land.  As a result, residents of banal apartments gather around, who will gladly put their garbage or a pile of rubble at the gate.  Scandals, insults and threats are becoming the norm. </p><p>  In the end, I would like to say that everyone can find out Russian townhouses: what is it and is it comfortable to live in them.  It is worth a try to make a conclusion.  Maybe it’s just for you that a beautiful house is being built where you will be happy. </p>
