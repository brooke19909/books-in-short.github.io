Queen of Monaco</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Located in the south of Europe, one of the smallest states on the mainland, almost completely surrounded by France, the Principality of Monaco can be called a model of excellent taste and liveliness.  Still, the interests here are the most high-profile: expensive yachts swaying in the azure <span>Ligurian Sea, a</span> casino with awesome rates and breathtaking Formula 1.  And the royal family is generally the most important attraction of the principality. </p><p>  All of this we will try to consider in more detail in the current article on an amazing and attractive country - Monaco.  Let's go there! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Monaco" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478427.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  A little more geography </h2><p>  To the Principality of Monaco, the map, alas, does not flatter.  On it, it is marked by only a point that drowned in the vastness of France.  And finding it to an inexperienced person can be quite difficult. </p><p>  But it is precisely this small size that is one of the most attractive features that makes tourists from all over the world look for a microstate on the map.  How many people want to get into this world of prosperity and refined taste, which, incidentally, is guarded by an army of only 82 people!  Can you imagine?  And this despite the fact that in the military orchestra of the same Monaco - 85 people.  But they are not afraid, because France has assumed responsibility for the security of the principality in the event of an attack by other states.  Like this! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And for those who are somewhat at a loss in answering the question of where Monaco is located, we will explain: where the territories of France and Italy are converging, about ten kilometers from the place of their docking on the Mediterranean coast there is a bright point that attracts wealth , good luck and success. </p><h2>  Meet the ruling family of Monaco </h2><p>  This is one of the few modern monarchies where the powers of the crowned person and the real head of state belong to the same person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="queen of monaco" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478437.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  In Monaco, the representative of the oldest dynasty in Europe, Prince Albert II, rules; he is the son of Prince Rainier II and the Hollywood star, the beautiful Grace Kelly.  Alberta‚Äôs wife, Queen of Monaco (quite in modern trends) is an athlete from South Africa, Olympic swimming champion Charlene Lynette Wittstock.  The wedding of the royal persons took place in 2011. </p><p>  Since the worthy ruler of this small state still does not have official heirs, the sister of Prince Albert, Princess Carolina Louise Margarita Grimaldi and her children are still considered such.  But the principality is waiting for the appearance of the little prince, who will lead a prosperous country in the future. </p><h2>  Where is Monaco located and how to get there? </h2><p>  We already told a little about where the principality is in the introductory part, but anyone who decides to go to this dreamland will be interested in details.  For example, how to get there? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monaco photo" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478443.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The easiest and fastest way to get to Monaco is considered to be a flight to Nice, and then a bus (it takes 45 minutes to travel) or a train (no more than half an hour).  If you have a car, then travel from Nice to Monaco is only 30 minutes away. </p><p>  In the absence of direct flights to Nice, the flight takes place to the capital of France, Paris, from where it is 950 km to the principality, and can be covered by train in a few hours. </p><p>  By the way, the station in Monaco, the photo of which we bring to your attention, is located right in the mountain.  And when leaving the car, travelers have the impression that they are in some unreal world.  Which, in fact, is not far from the truth! </p><h2>  A few words about where to apply for a visa in Monaco </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that the permanent residents of Monaco are only 20% of its population, the remaining 80% are rich people and businessmen traveling from the principality and back.  Nevertheless, getting into this miniature state is not so simple.  It should be noted that, since Monaco is a member of the European Union, a Schengen visa is required to visit here. </p><p>  Due to the fact that there is no representative office of this country in Russia, travelers have to obtain permission to enter the principality at the <span>French visa centers</span> located in Moscow (45 Bolshaya Yakimanka St.) and St. Petersburg (42 Angliyskaya Naberezhnaya).  There are similar centers in Nizhny Novgorod and Yekaterinburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monaco map" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478449.jpg" width="400"></div>

So, in July the average temperature here is about +23 ¬∞ , and in winter, in January, it does not fall below +10 ¬∞ . </p><p>  In Monaco, the months from May to September are considered the best time to visit. </p><h2>  Who lives where Monaco is located, or Features of the Principality </h2><p>  The autochthonous, that is, the initial, population of the principality is a people called Monegasques.  It makes up one fifth of all the inhabitants of Monaco and is recognized as the titular nation.  Monegasques are exempt from all taxes, and only they have the right to settle in the old part of this city-state.  It is forbidden to foreigners.  It's a pity!  It is from here, from the hill on Cape Saint-Antoine, that the most bewitching view of the sea and the surroundings opens. </p><p>  In general, in Monaco everything is arranged for the best pastime not only of the powerful of this world, the number of which exceeds all conceivable limits, but also of ordinary tourists.  Here the air is saturated with contemplation and enjoyment of life.  It is hard to <span>imagine yourself</span> miserable here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Principality of Monaco" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478442.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  And now about the sights </h2><p>  In addition to the world-famous casinos in Monte Carlo and Formula 1 (by the way, its roar is strong and not figuratively: visitors sitting in the stands are forced to plug their ears at the start so as not to lose their hearing), the country can offer a lot number of interesting places for tourists. </p><p>  Monaco is located on hills of amazing beauty, descending to the Ligurian Sea (it is part of the Mediterranean), and is the most densely populated state in Europe. </p><p>  His heart can be considered the ancient capital, located on a hilltop - Monaco-Ville.  Here are the oldest buildings and the Cathedral, which does not fit into the accepted stereotypes, was erected on the site of the ancient Catholic Church of St. Nicholas in 1875.  Inside the cathedral canvases of the famous artist Louis Brea are kept.  It is here that from the moment the princedom was founded, all members of the ruling family are buried. </p><p>  The facade of this cathedral overlooks the admirable <span>Palace Square,</span> where for the past seven centuries the residence of the princes of Monaco has been located.  It is here that official receptions and international negotiations are held.  Every day at noon, invariably since the founding of the principality, a ceremonial change of the guard of honor takes place in front of the palace, a large number of tourists are going to see it. </p><p>  The fortress of Antoine, named after the great music lover, Prince Antoine I, and which is now an open theater, is also noteworthy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monaco State" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478444.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  A little more about the wonderful places of the Principality of Monaco </h2><p>  Where the Oceanographic Museum is located, any resident of the city will tell you.  Do not forget to visit it!  It is considered to be a masterpiece of modern architecture.  The museum is located on a nearly sheer cliff and has an underground aquarium.  By the way, one of the very few where corals have taken root! </p><p>  And how beautiful the gardens of St. Martin are!  This place in tiny Monaco allows citizens to escape from the hustle and bustle of a modern city in an almost pristine world saturated with the aroma of herbs and flowers.  The garden was opened during the reign of Honore V (first half of the 19th century).  The sculptures standing along the small winding alleys that adorned the garden are a theme for a separate essay.  Be sure to visit here! </p><p>  Do not ignore the church of St. Devote, which is considered the protector of the principality.  By the way, on the day of memory of this great martyr, January 27, flowers always bloom around the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monaco is located" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478453.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Separately about museums </h2><p>  The most visited after Oceanographic in Monaco is the Museum of Old Cars, founded by Prince Rainier III, who was their fan.  For almost 30 years he has been collecting a collection of antique cars, which he presented at his museum.  There are more than 100 models. </p><p>  And the Maritime Museum owns more than two hundred and fifty exhibits related to the sea. </p><p>  The Wax Museum is a reflection of the history of the Grimaldi Dynasty.  All the figures are made in full size, and many are also dressed in old clothes, preserved from the time of the founding of the dynasty. </p><h2>  You can't say goodbye to Monaco! </h2><p>  As you can see, Monaco is a country where there are not only wealthy locals and powerful people who come to have fun, but also a huge cultural layer.  And all this is in the most amazing point on our planet.  Here there is the grace of blooming gardens, and the sound of the sea, and the excitement of games, and the delight of tourists.  And you will definitely come back here! </p>
