  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An active approach in the educational process</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern training system is based on an active approach.  But the organization of the educational process, taking into account this factor, can cause difficulties for some teachers.  Let us dwell in more detail on its main points. </p><p>  An active approach in the educational process should be based on the following provisions: </p><ul><li>  in children, it is necessary to develop a cognitive motive (a desire to learn and find out), as well as a specific educational goal (understanding what exactly needs to be mastered and found out); </li><li>  students must perform certain actions in order to acquire the missing knowledge and skills; </li><li>  students need to focus on finding and mastering methods of action that allow them to consciously apply the acquired knowledge; </li><li>  schoolchildren should develop the ability to control actions not only after completion, but also in the process of completing learning tasks; </li><li>  in the educational process, it is necessary to include solutions to vital and urgent problems. </li></ul><p>  Leontief‚Äôs proactive approach is the basis of developing education, which was continued in the system of <span>V. Davydov.</span>  In addition, this teaching should form the basis of a modern teaching kit in any subject. </p><p>  The fact is that in the learning process, the first place will then be not so much the accumulation of skills and knowledge and the formation of skills among students in a narrow field, but to a greater extent the formation of each individual, "self-construction" in educational activities.  Moreover, the most important is the child‚Äôs participation not in individual activities, but in collective, joint with others.  Because the main tasks of the learning process is the formation and formation of social consciousness and the personality of the child. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That is why the activity approach in education should become the main one.  Its basic and basic principle is that in the educational process, the child should be the subject, and not the object of manipulation of the teacher. </p><p>  It is very important to take this into account in the elementary grades, since for <span>primary school age the</span> leading type of activity is educational activity.  And its result should be, first of all, a change in the student, his <span>personal development.</span>  Therefore, the activity approach is a unique concept, in the application of which the subject of change is the child himself, that is, the subject who carries out this activity.  This concept turns the child on himself, requires compulsory reflection and self-esteem. </p><p>  Recommendations for teachers building an educational process based on an activity approach </p><p>  Firstly, the new material must be introduced in an accessible and visual way, telling and showing. </p><p>  Secondly, it is necessary to organize children's <span>research activities</span> so that students "think" themselves to solve the main problem of the lesson, and also learn to explain how to act in specific conditions. </p><p>  Thirdly, <span>the learning process</span> must necessarily be creative, contributing to the development of the personality of the child. </p><p>  Fourthly, in the educational process it is necessary to form practical actions or mental ones. </p><p>  Fifthly, the teacher is obliged to motivate students to set <span>goals and objectives on</span> their own <span>,</span> as well as find ways and means to achieve them.  Thanks to this, children will be able to optimally organize their activities.  In addition, the teacher should help everyone to build the skills of self-control and self-esteem. </p><p>  Sixth, training must necessarily be ahead of development so that the material is relevant and necessary. </p><p>  In general, the following conclusion should be made.  An active approach should become the basis of any educational process in modern institutions. </p>
