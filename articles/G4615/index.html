However, he was always in some confrontation with the mainland, so in the mid-twentieth century, Sardinia turned into autonomy. </p><p>  Until the sixties of the last century, tourism on the island was not developed at all.

    <h2>  Island beaches </h2><p>  If you want to choose the best beach of the island, then reviews of tourists about Sardinia will not help you in this difficult task.  After all, the island officially has more than three hundred and sixty beaches.  Moreover, they all have their own personality and character.  Some are formed by limestone cliffs, creating secluded coves.  Others are distinguished by dunes of the most delicate pink color, and still others are buried in greenery and stand out by gentle descents into the water.  It is impossible to list all the beach areas of Sardinia within the framework of one article, but we have identified five places that you must see with your own eyes, once on the island: </p><ul><li>  Poetto Beach </li><li>  Le Bombardt; </li><li>  Pisinas dunes; </li><li>  Spiaggia Dell Principe Bay; </li><li>  Cala Luna beach. </li></ul><p>  We will now talk about each of these amazing places. </p><h2>  The most popular beach in Cagliari </h2><p>  This beach, located in one of the most popular resorts in Sardinia, is ideal for those who like to spend time actively at sea.  Poetto beach is characterized by white sand and cleanliness.  The last factor applies to all coastal areas of the island.  The municipal, wild and private beaches of Sardinia are always surprisingly clean, which the locals are very proud of. </p><p>  Poetto is easily accessible from the city center, as public transport runs here.  And it is in this place on the weekend that the townspeople are in a hurry, which emphasizes the special status of the beach area. </p><h2>  Beach in Alghero </h2><p>  Not all tourists know about this place.  Usually, while relaxing in Alghero, they try to get to Port Side.  It is always quite noisy and there are many tourists, so those who prefer a quiet and secluded vacation away from the crowd should look for Le Bombardt beach. </p><p>  It is famous for its golden sand and the scent of coniferous forests that surround this beautiful bay.  It rarely storms, the sea has a very unusual shade, and beckons to itself.  There are never many vacationers on the beach, but there are many cafes and small restaurants on it. </p><h2>  Dunes Pisinas </h2><p>  This place is called by many "the soul of Sardinia."  In September, it is quite deserted, so this month is ideal for exploring the dunes.  The beach is located near Arbus, with your own car you can drive almost to the coast by dirt road.  And then a fantastic sight will appear before your eyes - for many kilometers around you will find a real kingdom of sand, sparkling with different shades.  Some dunes reach a height of up to fifty meters, several times a day they change their shape and size due to the wind blowing. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that this beach is considered wild and one of the cleanest on the island.  In its vicinity you can even see sea turtles and other animals. </p>

    <h2>  Spiaggia Dell Principe Bay </h2><p>  This beach is famous for its perfectly clear water.  The bay itself has the shape of a crescent and is distinguished by the smallest, slightly creaking sand.  Once this amazing place was discovered by one of the Arab princes, and since then it has been incredibly popular with locals and tourists. </p><p>  Since the water in the bay of Spiaggia Dell Principe is very clear, this place is ideal for snorkeling, diving and fishing.  It is here that the most luxurious resorts of Sardinia are located and villas of the richest people of the world are built. </p><h2>  Resort Cala Gonone </h2><p>  Cala Luna Beach is located on the east coast of the island at some distance from the resort itself.  It got its name due to the unusual snow-white sand and shining cliffs that stand out against the background of turquoise sea waves. </p><p>  The beach is not so easy to find, on all sides it is surrounded by cliffs and green thickets.  Many tourists rent a boat to get to Cala Luna by water.  You can also walk to the resort from it, however, in this case, be prepared to cover a distance of four kilometers. </p>
