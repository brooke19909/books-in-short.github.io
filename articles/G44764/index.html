    <h2>  First impression of tourists </h2><p>  When you first go to a five-star hotel, everything seems new to you.  There is practically nothing to complain about, because there is nothing to compare.  Aurora Oriental Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) belongs to the category of hotels that are considered the cheapest.  Tourists are always faced with a choice: to take a great expensive "four" or still stay in the "five", but cheaper.  Sometimes the first option is more preferable and better than the second. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first impressions of tourists are completely different.  Since the hotel is budget, there are many senior citizens from Europe.  Many are pleased that Russian-speaking tourists are quite rare, compared to other hotels. </p><p>  The hotel was opened for guests 15 years ago - in 2001.  Ten years later, it was completely restored and put in order.  But the general decay and outdated rooms make themselves felt. </p><p>  Among the reviews, there is often the opinion that the hotel staff is rather unfriendly and does not like Russians.  This factor is purely individual and cannot objectively influence the assessment of the hotel. </p><p>  But in general, apparently, the complex is good, solid and very comfortable.  I want to come back here again, because here you can have a wonderful rest. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Aurora Oriental Resort consists of the main three-story building, which houses the most rooms, and several small private villas.  The latter belong to the category of "super-luxury."  In total there are 400 rooms. </p><p>  All rooms are very spacious.  Of furniture, there is a large double bed, a table, a wardrobe, a TV.  There is always the opportunity to put an extra bed.  As tourists say, TVs are very old, but they‚Äôre not going to Egypt to watch movies, are they? </p><p>  In addition, there are other mandatory items - air conditioning, hairdryer, safe, telephone.  There is a bath and shower.  Minibar is paid.  Moreover, the prices for its contents are much higher than in local stores or cafes. </p>

    <h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  If you look through the pages of the forums, you can find different opinions about the state of the rooms in the hotel we are considering and how they are cleaned.  It seems that <span>Aurora Oriental Resort Sharm El Sheikh</span> 5 * is a two-faced hotel that shows some of its positive aspects to some tourists and only negative aspects to others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Anyone who is optimistic will find wide beds, spacious rooms, balconies overlooking the garden and will enjoy dinner in a quiet and peaceful place.  Everything suits such people - cleaning every three days, towel change, polite staff. </p><p>  Other vacationers will only look for cons.  They will definitely not like worn mattresses, mosquitoes on the street and the noise from the garden.  They will meticulously search for fungus in the bathroom and look at the floor under the bed for dust.  Of course, this is not acceptable in the rooms.  And any tourist who paid a lot of money for the "five stars" has the right to get a comfortable and safe vacation.  Such a desire is quite natural and natural.  But, again, the subjective opinion of each of the tourists who left their reviews plays a large role. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In the issue of food at the Aurora Oriental Resort Sharm El Sheikh 5 * hotel, a certain pattern is also visible.  In general, guest reviews can be divided by year. </p><p>  Those who managed to go before the beginning of 2015 were satisfied with the quality of food.  Such people write that the portions were large, or rather, you could take as much as you like, and always enough for everyone.  Abundantly on the tables stood meat and fish.  True, many did not like seafood dishes.  The free drinks in the restaurant and bar were of good quality.  Quite a few served fruits and desserts. </p><p>  Hotel guests of 2015 complain vying.  The food is poor, monotonous.  Mostly pasta and rice.  Children's menu is even poorer.  It is impossible to eat fish, meat is given in small portions.  Fruits - and those are sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvery poorly.  Drinks are completely diluted.  Juices were not given to children at all.  And some, according to reviews, were lucky to have dinner ... with one watermelon.  It seems that the Aurora Oriental Resort 5 * hotel is not going through the best of times. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  On the territory of the hotel Aurora Oriental Resort <span>5 * (Sharm El Sheikh)</span> you can freely play soccer, volleyball, table tennis.  There are three pools with one water slide.  Animation is present.  There is a paid disco. </p><p>  And now about the reviews.  Often in the comments there are complaints that the pools are poorly cleaned, as a result, you can find hair, dirt and other unpleasant things in them.  The water slide is on schedule.  A few hours in the morning and as many in the evening. </p><p>  Many complain about the animation.  There are tourists who do not notice this at all, but those who have been to other five-star hotels say that this hotel is the worst-asked question about entertainment. </p><p>  Disco on site is paid.  In addition, after analyzing the information presented in the reviews, we can conclude that it is easier to go to a local city club or to a party in a neighboring hotel.  It will come out even cheaper.  And perhaps more fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharm El Sheikh Aurora Oriental Resort" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/1088078.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are many guides on the beach offering various excursions in Egypt.  Their services are much cheaper than those purchased at the Aurora Oriental Resort 5 * hotel. </p><p>  Sports enthusiasts are offered a good gym. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  The sea and the beach area are also a separate topic for discussion.  Generally speaking, the hotel has a good beach area.  Enough space for everyone.  Sun loungers and parasols are offered free of charge. </p><p>  But here it is worth noting the features of the Nabq Bay itself in Sharm El Sheikh.  If you are going to see the rich sea world, then you are definitely not here.  There are corals, but they are not as colorful as, for example, in Hurghada.  In order to swim in the sea, you need to go on the pontoon.  And its length in some places exceeds 400 meters. </p><p>  The sea is very shallow.  Even at depth, with a great desire, you will not go further than waist-deep.  Of course, if you choose a vacation with young children, then this is just what you need.  To teach kids to swim in shallow water is a pleasure.  Moreover, the water temperature is comfortable at any time of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aurora oriental resort 5 charm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/1088079.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  From the foregoing, we can draw such conclusions about the rest at the Aurora Oriental Resort Sharm El Sheikh 5 *: </p><p>  1. This complex has a fairly large, well-groomed and comfortable area. </p><p>  2. Many rooms and even separate bungalows.  All the rooms in the buildings have been restored, but the furniture and appliances over the past few years have noticeably grown old. </p><p>  3. The hotel is ideal for those who crave a quiet relaxing holiday away from noisy parties and gatherings, but at the same time appreciate the comfort and advantages of a five-star hotel. </p><p>  4. You can come to Sharm El Sheikh at any time of the year.  It is always warm here, the water temperature is high.  This region is ideal for families with small children. </p><p>  5. You definitely won‚Äôt leave the hotel hungry, but if you are tired of the monotony (and this hotel, judging by the reviews, has sinned recently), you can always visit local restaurants.  Fortunately, the city can be easily and quickly reached by public transport. </p><p>  6. And the last.  Aurora Oriental Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) is a decent budget option of a five-star category.  Be optimistic, and then no troubles will affect the good mood during the holidays. </p>
