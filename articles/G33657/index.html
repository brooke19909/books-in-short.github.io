Without a doubt, many did so without even noticing it.  But is it possible to leave charging in the outlet?  Such a question sometimes flashes in the head, and it will not be superfluous to figure it out properly. </p><h2>  Why do they do this? </h2><p>  We have so surrounded ourselves with various electronic devices, whether it‚Äôs mobile phones (mainly class smartphones), laptops and other equipment, that we can‚Äôt imagine how you can do without them.  For us, putting the phone on charge before bedtime is akin to everyday life.  And so it remains until the morning - but the battery is fully charged, and the device is ready for use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scienceabc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I leave charging in a power outlet?" class="if uuid-2962867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2962867.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, disconnecting the device and taking it with you to work or study, the charger itself is left in the outlet (for the most part this applies to wireless charging).  What contributes to this?  There are a variety of reasons: </p><ul><li>  The elementary forgetfulness that many people suffer. </li><li>  Lack of time. </li><li>  Simple laziness. </li></ul><p>  When answering the question of whether it is possible to leave charging in a socket without a phone, one thing must be said right away: of course, leaving a charge in a socket will not bring anything dangerous.  But is everything so cloudless as it might seem at first glance?  Now let's figure it out ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Precious kilowatts </h2><p>  Any electric device connected to an outlet, even in standby mode, consumes a certain amount of electricity, and a charger for a phone, laptop and other gadgets is no exception.  A washing machine, a microwave oven, a refrigerator, a TV - all this day after day makes the counter spin, counting the consumed watts. </p><p>  At the same time, while the devices are in standby mode, the daily electricity consumption is negligible - for the year it is unlikely to reach 100 rubles.  Today you can find on sale different power sources - switching or with a step-down transformer.  But is it possible to leave wireless charging in a power outlet, and will it hit the family budget hard? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to leave wireless charging in the outlet" class="if uuid-2962868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2962868.jpg"></div><p>  The answer will be quite comforting: they all ‚Äúeat‚Äù the same way, that is, they can ‚Äúeat‚Äù no more than 1-2 watts during the day.  This minimum can be tracked using the most accurate instrument or with a multimeter. </p><p>  In other words, it will not be possible to save significantly on electricity in any case.  The bill will increase by only a few cents, and therefore, in terms of savings, you should not worry.  So maybe leave a charge in the outlet, and let it always be there ?!  It is too early to draw such conclusions ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Security measures </h2><p>  The charger, which is constantly in the outlet, although it does not consume a lot of electricity, but at the same time can cause a number of troubles.  If someone reads the instructions for many phones and other electronic devices, then he is well aware of the notes of manufacturers regarding chargers.  In particular, the point is that ordinary users do not leave them in the outlet after the phone and laptop are fully charged. </p><p>  And yet, is it possible to leave charging in the socket without a phone from an iPhone or any other expensive device?  But most importantly, what will happen if you ignore these comments?  Almost any charger has a built-in fire protection system.  And in fact - there is nothing to burn here, and therefore it seems like you can safely leave it in a power outlet, and nothing bad can happen for sure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theenergycommunity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What will result in forgetfulness" class="if uuid-2962865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2962865.jpg"></div><p>  But, again, this applies only to original chargers from eminent manufacturers of iPhone and other expensive phones.  However, many consumers buy analogues of such charges, due to the lower cost.  But it is worth remembering that they do not always meet high standards and requirements.  And the charger of dubious origin may fail after one or several months of constant presence in the outlet. </p><h2>  Certain risks </h2><p>  Considering the question of whether the charger can be left in the socket without a phone, now it is worth taking into account other risks.  The main reason why you should not leave the charger in the power outlet for a long time is the possible power surges.  And they are rare, but they happen, because our networks are still far from ideal. </p><p>  For example, in a house the lights went out for certain circumstances, and then the power supply was resumed.  In this case, the voltage can increase sharply from 220 to 380 volts.  Such jumps are not able to withstand many charges, even the most expensive. </p><p>  In addition, we should not forget that the charger must be disconnected from the outlet during a thunderstorm.  Moreover, regardless of whether the phone itself is charging or not.  Although this applies to any electrical appliances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.righto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charger Inside" class="if uuid-2962869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2962869.jpg"></div><p>  Can I leave charging in a power outlet during a thunderstorm?  If a lightning strike occurs on any device, it is unlikely that it can "survive" after such a "charge".  Fortunately, this happens quite rarely, but what the hell is not joking. </p><h2>  A small and inevitable problem </h2><p>  It is also worth considering that any electronics that are under load are subject to natural wear, which can not be avoided.  And the charger here again is no exception.  And if you provide him with a permanent residence permit at the outlet, then over a certain amount of time it loses its effectiveness. </p><p>  Like energy consumption, a drop in charging efficiency is hardly noticeable to the average consumer.  However, this is not uncommon.  If the device is of high quality, then after a year or two you can notice that the charger began to work worse than before.  Then I will recall the question: can the charger be left in the outlet?  It is likely that there will be a need for its replacement. </p><h2>  Should I be afraid of heating? </h2><p>  In some cases, a connected charger connected, for example, to a telephone, may start to heat up.  It is immediately worth noting that there is nothing wrong with this phenomenon.  This is clearly not worth being scared of, because any electric device heats up when working with electricity.  And in most cases this is the norm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to leave charging in the outlet" class="if uuid-2962864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2962864.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, there may be another case where charging began to heat up even when the device was disconnected while in the outlet.  Here it already makes sense to guard and remove the device.  In any case, this indicates a problem with the module itself or the mains.  Often this can be found in villages and summer cottages.  Therefore, the question of whether charging can be left in the socket or not is already exhausted - it‚Äôs better not to. </p><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  What ultimately do we have, and what conclusions should we draw?  The fact that the adapter consumes a tiny amount of electricity is, of course, a plus.  Worry about the overcharge is not worth it.  However, due to said wear, there is a risk of fire.  Or, as an option, the charger will simply fail. </p><p>  In any case, the final verdict can only be made by the consumer himself, because it is on him that responsibility lies.  A number of troubles that may happen have already been discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leave or not" class="if uuid-2962866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2962866.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible to leave charging in a power outlet or is it better to remove it?  By and large, it‚Äôs better to overcome your laziness.  And every time you leave your home, remove the charger from the outlet for security reasons.  It also makes sense to use only high-quality chargers, no matter how much they cost - you should definitely not save on your own safety. </p>
