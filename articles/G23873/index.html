She will help to understand what kind of payment is in front of us.  The fact is that if you do not know the true meaning of the abbreviation, then it is difficult to understand what exactly is the transfer of funds to the state treasury for.  More precisely, it is impossible.  Tax issues alone are crucial.  Especially if you don‚Äôt know what particular tax you are dealing with.  Maybe you do not need to pay it at all?  It is enough to know how to properly decrypt personal income tax in order to understand this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income decryption" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259568.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is it </h2><p>  In fact, everything is extremely easy and simple.  Personal income tax stands for <span>"personal income tax."</span>  And it turns out that this decryption just characterizes our today's payment.  Who exactly pays it?  Individuals  Why do they list it?  With income. </p><p>  Personal income tax decryption, as you see, is very simple.  And remembering it is simple, and the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãour today's payment is put off in the brain without any problems.  <span>Taxes on personal income</span> - mandatory payments from taxpayers.  Nobody will be able to hide from them.  Only in exceptional cases.  What can be said about this tax, if you specify it?  What knowledge can be useful to taxpayers? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who pays </h2><p>  So we got acquainted with the definition of the term PIT.  How to decrypt this abbreviation?  <span>Personal income tax.</span>  That is what the name of this payment sounds like.  But who is obliged to pay it? </p><p>  As already mentioned, all taxpayers.  But more precisely, only those who have taxable income.  You can say any citizens who make money.  And it does not matter how - from the delivery of real estate, or its sale, or from official employment.  If you have any kind of income, then you will pay tax on it without fail, with no exceptions. </p><p>  Personal income tax decryption may also include the definition of income tax.  This is the same.  It implies the payment of funds in a certain amount, which are listed in the form of your profit.  We can say that a working person pays personal income tax, while housewives and the unemployed do not.  There are no exceptions.  There is only a small list of cases that do not require tax payment after receiving the money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how is personal income tax decrypted" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Do not pay </h2><p>  So we figured out how personal income tax is decrypted.  But only now I would like to understand what income is not taxed by this payment.  After all, there are exceptions.  There are not many of them, but they do have a place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, income tax is not paid on gifts from close relatives.  That is, if someone gives you money / real estate or makes a gift, being close relatives, no fees are needed.  Otherwise, you will have to pay the required interest.  By the way, individuals must give 13% of their profits.  These are the interesting rules in Russia. </p><p>  In addition, inheritance from close relatives, as well as profits from the sale of property owned for more than 3 years, are not subject to income tax.  More precisely, it is a sale.  If you rent a property, you will have to pay taxes on it.  There are no more exceptions. </p><h2>  how many </h2><p>  In personal income tax decryption is extremely simple.  We are dealing with <span>personal income tax.</span>  Only there is one very interesting point - the payment thereof.  It has already been said that personal income tax is paid in the amount of 13% of the money received.  But there are exceptions.  In addition, the procedure and terms for payment are established in Russian law.  And they will have to be respected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax decryption abbreviations" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259569.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, the peculiarity of our payment today is the size thereof in certain circumstances.  In general, personal income tax is 13%.  But if it is a treasure, for example, or a gain, you will have to give the state 35%.  And the surprises do not end there. </p><p>  Foreign citizens also pay personal income tax.  They are less fortunate in this regard.  If a foreign citizen has income in the territory of the Russian Federation, he will have to pay as much as 30%.  And no less.  Pretty much if you think about it.  But such rules apply in the country.  There are no exceptions and cannot be. </p><h2>  Order and terms </h2><p>  Now we know what personal income tax is (the decoding of the abbreviation was given above).  And what is the order of payment of our today's payment?  Are there any restrictions and deadlines?  Of course, they do. </p><p>  What is it about?  Income tax is usually declared.  More precisely, you file tax returns with your tax authorities.  You need to do this before April 30th.  Moreover, the report will be for the previous year (for example, in 2013 you report for 2012).  <span>Terms of payment of personal income tax</span> also take place.  Individuals must settle the payment before July 15.  But most often they pay in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax how to decrypt" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259571.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What does it mean?  Advance payment is made along with filing a tax return - until April 30.  A very popular technique that is used by many.  You can just get rid of your debts once and sleep peacefully.  But do not rush.  If it is not possible to make an advance payment, you have the right to wait until July 15, inclusive.  Next will be credited. </p><h2>  Deductions </h2><p>  In personal income tax decryption is extremely simple.  But it cannot be said that in some cases taxpayers may receive a tax deduction.  That is, to return 13% from the transaction.  This option applies only to those who pay income tax. </p><p>  You can return the money for real estate transactions (including for a mortgage), as well as for treatment, training and the purchase of any goods.  If there are minor children, you have the right to a special deduction.  It is called "On the children."  Due to it, the tax base with which you pay personal income tax is reduced.  A very useful thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to decrypt personal income tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259567.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  All deductions are filed with the tax authorities if there is a statement, evidence of expenses, income taxed by income taxes, as well as other important documents.  These include: TIN, SNILS, certificates of marriage / divorce / birth of children, accreditation and license, certificate of ownership of something.  A declaration is also required.  So remember: if you pay personal income tax, you can in some cases apply for a tax deduction.  It‚Äôs not so difficult really! </p>
