The best option will be a high-quality mattress and the presence of sides on the walls of the cradle.  If a good mattress with orthopedic characteristics can only be purchased, then the second element of bedding is easy to sew on your own.  There are many options thanks to which you can understand how to sew the sides qualitatively and correctly.  It is worth paying attention to the selection of quality materials and the correct design of the product. </p><h2>  What are the sides in a crib for? What characteristics should they have? </h2><p>  The sides for the crib of a newborn baby is not a decoration, but a necessity.  This type of protection ensures the safety of the baby during sleep - the crumbs will not be able to hit the solid walls of furniture.  Additionally, soft bedding elements protect against drafts or hypothermia.  The decorative function is also not excluded. </p><p>  Before stitching the sides, it is worth asking about what the elements should be: </p><ul><li>  Covers should be made of high-quality fabric, which will not fade, roll or divide into fibers during operation. </li><li>  The filler must not be toxic.  Natural materials are not welcome, as they can cause allergic reactions. </li><li>  Elements should be soft, appropriate size, securely attached to the walls of the crib. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade sides with pockets" class="if uuid-3189974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3189974.jpg"></div><p>  There are other criteria for assessing the quality of the sides, determined by individual preferences and requirements.  It is worth checking that all elements are well fixed, otherwise the child will be able to tear or pull a trifle in his mouth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most popular designs of sides: from simple to complex </h2><p>  The easiest way is to decide which ones to sew the sides into the crib with your own hands, after you familiarize yourself with all possible types of products.  Each option is distinguished by a feature pattern, functionality, appearance. </p><p>  Possible types of home-made sides that have diverse designs: </p><ul><li>  Flat sides where each element covers one wall of the crib. </li><li>  Bead pillows with removable covers. </li><li>  Quilted sides that cover the walls of the crib to the very top. </li><li>  Sides in the form of rollers covering the bottom of the walls of the crib. </li></ul><p>  Each option has its own characteristics regarding the design and arrangement.  The more complicated the pattern, the more interesting and elegant the whole structure will look.  Additional decorative elements and inserts can become a relevant addition even to the simplest product design. </p><h2>  Features of the choice of material for the manufacture of the cover, the inner part and fasteners </h2><p>  The health of the crumbs depends on the quality of the raw materials, so when buying materials it is worth paying attention to some points.  As separate components, it is necessary to consider a filler, a cover for the sides and fasteners. </p><ul><li>  A good filler is foam rubber.  It keeps its shape well, does not get off during operation and washing.  But it can retain excess moisture, which can cause the development of pathogenic microflora. </li><li>  Hollofiber will be an excellent alternative to synthetic winterizer and especially cotton wool.  Soft, does not stray, is not the basis for the development of bacteria, is easy to care for.  Over time, it can stray into breasts, which will have to be separated manually. </li><li>  More expensive alternatives to holofiber are: periotek, holkon, polyester.  Each option has exceptionally positive characteristics, one of which is hypoallergenic. </li></ul><p>  Covers should be made from natural fabrics with a soft base.  You can use high-quality synthetic fiber fabrics by all criteria.  The best way to fix it is ties that connect the elements together and with the walls of the cradle.  Only after selecting good materials to do the job, you can decide how to sew the sides safe and practical in terms of use for a certain type of crib. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to start work in the manufacture of sides </h2><p>  To get started, you need to study the instructions for the manufacture of this device to limit the walls of the crib.  The algorithm for manufacturing the sides is quite simple.  You can sew the sides to the crib with your own hands, if you follow several steps: </p><ol><li>  Prepare suitable tools and materials. </li><li>  Take measurements from the crib, create a sketch sketch. </li><li>  Create patterns and pattern for the element. </li><li>  Basting, and then sew the pattern. </li><li>  If necessary, decorate. </li><li>  Wash and stroke. </li></ol><p>  Each stage takes time to complete, then the product will be neat.  Pay special attention to calculations that relate to parameters.  It is worth considering that a lot of fabric goes to the hem of the edges. </p><h2>  What materials may be needed to make the simplest sides </h2><p>  The simplest in design are flat sides.  One piece completely covers one wall of the cradle, so the production takes a minimum of time.  For the manufacture it is worth preparing the following materials: </p><ul><li>  It is preferable for this type of structure to choose foam rubber as a filler. </li><li>  The fabric from which the covers will be made.  The amount depends on the parameters of the crib. </li><li>  Tight ribbons that will become ties.  It is worth preparing about 10 meters. </li><li>  Sewing threads that match the color of the fabric covers. </li></ul><p>  It is necessary to prepare tools that are useful in the work.  This set is standard for the manufacture of any type of skirting.  You will need scissors, a sewing needle, a measuring tape, and chalk.  In addition, it is worth taking an iron and preparing a place of work, removing excess objects from the surface of the table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of the manufacture of items to soften the walls of furniture </h2><p>  When the tools and materials are prepared, the measurements are taken from the cradle and the sketch is prepared, you can begin to work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="babyben.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of flat sides for the crib with explanations" class="if uuid-3189796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3189796.jpg"></div><p>  The algorithm for how to sew the sides in the crib for newborns: </p><ol><li>  Using the measuring tape, transfer the wall parameters to the fabric.  Use the chalk to draw the borders of each element. </li><li>  Scissors cut the fabric.  Cut the same parts out of foam.  The dimensions of the filler should be 5-7 cm smaller than the tissue segments. </li><li>  Bend the edges by 2-3 cm and iron, fixing the position of the hem.  Bend the edges again by 2-3 cm and iron the edges again. </li><li>  Fasten smooth edges with a basting seam so that they do not separate during the final stitching process. </li><li>  Rate the resulting product.  You can correct irregularities or other errors. </li><li>  Prepare tapes.  Cut the material into strips 25-35 cm long, process the edges. </li><li>  Sew the sides to the crib with your own hands according to the pattern.  You can use a sewing machine.  Fix the tapes in the corners. </li></ol><p>  It is enough to wash and iron the finished product.  In the manufacturing process, it is necessary to make periodic fittings in order to understand whether the parameters of the sides correspond exactly to the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the walls. </p><h2>  What can be made cushion sides for crib </h2><p>  Bead pillows are a very relevant accessory for a baby cradle.  For the manufacture you will need the most affordable and simple materials: </p><ul><li>  Tissue matched to crib parameters.  You can take half the chintz and half the plush.  If you use colorful patches, you get an original design. </li><li>  Hollofiber or a similar type of filler.  The quantity is determined by the density of the future product.  If there is not enough filler, then the pillow blade can be sewn, forming a quilting. </li><li>  Threads in the color of the fabric. </li><li>  If necessary, you can choose textiles for surface decor. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="side pillows for prams" class="if uuid-3189975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3189975.jpg"></div><p>  After selecting the materials, you can determine how to sew the cushion sides.  When using multi-colored parts, it is advisable to consider the color scheme of the combinations. </p><h2>  Aspects of making pillow fences at home </h2><p>  Sewing the sides for a newborn‚Äôs crib with their own hands in the form of small pillows is as simple as flat products.  The principle of manufacturing pillows: </p><ol><li>  Make patterns for pillows.  Each detail should be a square.  It is necessary to make an equal number of parts from each type of fabric. </li><li>  Tighten edges and smooth.  Perform the same action again. </li><li>  Make bastings by flashing the edges. </li><li>  Cut strips from the fabric and stitch them to form ribbons.  Thanks to these elements, the pillows will be attached to the battens of the walls. </li><li>  Sew parts on three sides on a sewing machine.  Sew textile strips into the corners. </li><li>  Insert filler into the workpiece, distributing it evenly over the entire plane.  Sew the fourth side. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features of manufacturing pillows for fencing" class="if uuid-3189985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3189985.jpg"></div><p>  The product is ready to use.  You can tie each pillow to the rods, or you can fix a strip of fabric by pulling it between the corners of the walls.  All pillows will be tied to this element. </p><h2>  What can be made of original bortik toys </h2><p>  You can make the fence more interesting and functional if you make each element in the form of a volumetric toy.  For work, it is necessary to prepare a set of such materials: </p><ul><li>  Soft fabric of different colors. </li><li>  Hollofiber. </li><li>  Threads for sewing. </li><li>  Tapes. </li><li>  Yarn for knitting. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="option of pillows toys" class="if uuid-3189976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3189976.jpg"></div><p>  You can sew the sides for newborns in the form of toys using patterns of almost any shape.

Other elements can also be formed from the fabric to decorate the canvas of one element of the rim. </p><h2>  Additional functionality of different types of sides after direct use </h2><p>  Sew the sides for newborns with your own hands only if the products will be actively used in the future.  If the product will be pillows, then in the future they will be used as decorative elements for decorating a sofa, bed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="option for further use of the sides" class="if uuid-3189998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3189998.jpg"></div><p>  Flat sides can later become a warm base-laying for the floor, where the baby will play.
