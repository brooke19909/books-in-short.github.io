One of such breakthrough phenomena can be safely called a modern cell phone, which, in addition to many functions, also has a touch screen.  Almost everyone has a smartphone, respectively, and life without it is quite difficult to imagine.  Therefore, it is important to know how to care for him so that he lasts longer, but besides this, you need to understand what needs to be done so that his touch screen is in order.  And this is important insofar as the display is the basic part of any phone.  Since it provides for a touch screen, in case of any malfunctions, we can not only not see the contents of the software on our phone, but it‚Äôs unlikely that we can manage it.  This is what will be discussed in today's article. </p><h2>  Modern phone: what is it like? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern telephone" class="if uuid-2421439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2421439.jpg"></div><p>  In very rare cases, you can catch a person without your smartphone or its accessories in everyday life.  The answer to the question of why this is so is quite simple.  Because modern phones can literally all and more.  Radios, portable speakers and MP3 players, bulky cameras and cameras, massive and uncomfortable phones, ordinary desktop computers and many other equipment that a modern smartphone replaces look a gloomy past century against its background.  This miracle with a touch screen can soon replace us with real life!  So what to do if something is wrong with this screen?  Let's think together. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Touchscreens - what is it? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="randomstuffandstory.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Touch screen" class="if uuid-2421443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2421443.jpg"></div><p>  At its core, it is an input device adapted to our convenience with you.  We can say that the whole market is behind a touch-screen phone, because it is convenient, beautiful and fashionable.  Now consider the principle of its operation. </p><p>  The touch screen display gives us the opportunity to interact with any device without special buttons, but only at the expense of the sensors. </p><p>  Input of any information using such a screen is due to the special display structure, which is sensitive to touch.  Where are they used? </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  This technology is rightfully considered a real breakthrough, because it greatly simplifies all kinds of manipulations with electrical engineering.  At the moment, they find just the widest application: from telephones, as mentioned earlier, to modern televisions and terminals for making payments.  In addition to all this, the touch screen for the Samsung and iPhone, which, incidentally, occupy a leading position in the market for modern technology, has long been an inherent part. </p><h2>  Screen classification </h2><p>  Since today screens with sensors are very popular and, therefore, in demand, then, on the principle of "demand creates supply", they try to introduce them into almost every area related to technology.  As a result of this, the methods and principles of their production, as well as models, can be classified into several different types.  There are about four basic types.  If we consider the various subtypes, then this figure increases significantly.  Let's look at the types of screens: resistive;  screens based on surface acoustic waves;  infrared and capacitive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Resistive Screens </h2><p>  Just this type of screens finds its application in mobile devices, which will be discussed later.  The structure of resistive screens is quite simple.  It includes: the LCD display itself, as well as two transparent plates that will be installed above this display.  Between such plates there is a dielectric layer.  There are only two advantages to this type of screen: a rather low cost of components and, accordingly, creation (in other words, cost) and good sensitivity. </p><h2>  Screens based on surface acoustic waves </h2><p>  The principle of operation of such screens is more complex.  It is based on the phenomenon of absorption of ultrasonic waves.  The advantages of this type are that: </p><ul><li>  They are durable. </li><li>  Very transparent. </li><li>  They can determine not only the coordinates of the pressure point, but also the degree of this pressure itself.  By the way, resistive screens were not able to do this. </li></ul><p>  But there are also disadvantages of surface-acoustic screens: the presence of at least small vibrations and noises (meaning acoustic), as well as dirt, can contribute to disruptions in the screen or its complete failure. </p><p>  They are used, for example, in slot machines that have a large touch screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.casinonewsdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The use of surfactants" class="if uuid-2421451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2421451.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrared screens </h2><p>  This type of screen is based on a principle similar to the structure of surface-acoustic screens.  The only difference is that infrared radiation is taken as the basis.  The screen itself is represented by many infrared and mutually perpendicular lines.  When the user touches the screen, the integrity of the radiation is violated at the point of contact, and the device reads information about the coordinate location of this point.  Advantages: the possibility of convenient reconstruction, strength and durability.  Application: vending machines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="barrettvending.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vending machines" class="if uuid-2421466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2421466.jpg"></div><h2>  Capacitive screens </h2><p>  When you press the surface of such a screen at the touch point, a current pulse is generated, due to which the device reads information about the touch and its coordinates.  Among the advantages of capacitive screens can be called a very fast response time and high performance.  Disadvantage: close dependence on external temperature, because of which it can inadvertently stop its work.  Application: ATM terminals, Apple touch products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capacitive screens" class="if uuid-2421456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2421456.jpg"></div><h2>  The touch screen does not work.  What to do? </h2><p>  The biggest problem in this situation is the fact that most modern mobile devices display with a sensor is the only way to interact with the device.  Of course, in the event of a sensor breakdown, the entire operability of such a device goes to zero.  The question naturally arises, why does the touch screen stop working? </p><div class="photo" data-original="play.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Touch screen not working" class="if uuid-2421471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2421471.jpg"></div><p>  There can be many answers to such a question: banal breakdown, contamination of the sensor or microcircuits, and water or any other substance entering the layer between the display and the film.  But with all the variety of problems, do not despair: there is always a way out.  We‚Äôll show you some simple first aid methods for your smartphone. </p><h2>  Basic and easiest troubleshooting steps </h2><p>  The first thing you can try to do with a faulty smartphone yourself is to follow these steps: </p><ol><li>  Turn off your device. </li><li>  Remove the protective cover or film. </li><li>  Gently wipe the screen with a lint-free cloth and make sure that it is clean and dry, otherwise this will cause a malfunction. </li><li>  Reboot the device and try to use it with clean and dry hands. <div class="photo" data-original="www.af-net.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Touch Screen Troubleshooting" class="if uuid-2426140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2426140.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Important: always use only a dry or slightly damp cloth for the screen, but never take a wet one! </p><p>  This is probably the most basic screen troubleshooting tip.  If the damage to the software is not serious or the pollution is superficial, then this will be enough.  If this does not help you, do not rush to bring the smartphone to the service center and give a lot of money to fix it.  Please read the article to the end. </p><h2>  Troubleshooting Steps for Dead Screen </h2><p>  If you are sure that your screen has stopped responding to touch and movement not due to any shock (for example, falling) or water getting into it, then the following steps should help for sure: </p><ol><li>  Clean and dry your hands thoroughly. </li><li>  By disconnecting the smartphone and removing the protective devices, make sure that the screen and the protective film remain intact and clean.  Otherwise, you will have to remove all dirt and liquids from the surface of the screen and the protective film with a dry, lint-free cloth. </li><li>  Remove all peripheral devices (SIM cards, USB cable, various adapters, and so on). </li><li>  If the screen is completely insensitive, you will have to go to the forced reboot step of the device.  For an Android device, it will look like this: at the same time we hold down the "Power" keys (usually located on the side panel on the right) and "Volume Down" for 7-10 seconds.  For users of Apple products will have to use a slightly different instruction, depending on the version of their device.  For iPhone 6 users: hold down the "Power" and "Home" keys until the "apple" appears on the screen.  For users of iPhone version 7 and above, this instruction may be suitable: hold down the "Power" and "Volume Down" keys also until the logo appears. </li><li>  After a successful reboot of the device, you should check the functionality of its sensors. </li></ol><p>  What to do if the phone has fallen on a hard and / or wet surface?  In this case, the screen of your device stops responding due to an internal malfunction.  However, even in this case, you can try to bring him to his senses and make him work again without the help of service centers.  Of course, this is possible when the damage is not very serious and you are sure of what you are doing.  If you are afraid to do something wrong, it is better to leave this business to professionals, without resorting to any of the above steps.  So let's get started. </p><p>  When the touch screen stops functioning after the phone falls, the reason for this may be a violation in the connection of the device that digitizes external signals.  In this case, you can gently tap on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach corner of the phone, which can lead to reconnecting the connection. </p><p>  If the phone does not fall on a hard surface, but in a liquid (usually water), then in order to return it to operation, the following steps must be urgently performed: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the phone and remove the battery. </li><li>  Wipe the water with a dry cloth from the pile. </li><li>  Try to remove water from the phone's connectors (microphone, speaker, headphone jack and charging). </li><li>  Put the phone, surrounding it with a drying agent. </li><li>  Leave your smartphone for a long time (at least 48 hours). </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that often people use rice as a drying agent, although it is not.  Silica gel, for example, is perfect for this. </p><p>  You should understand that to solve the problem of a non-working screen at home is possible only in cases where the problem is not so serious that the need for specialist help is visible to the naked eye.  If none of our methods have helped in solving the problem, this means that the damage to the screen or software is very serious.  As a rule, it is quite difficult to understand and fix such serious problems themselves, but you cannot do without the help of a professional, because you may need to change the touch screen.  In this case, the advice can be only one: contact the service center. </p>
