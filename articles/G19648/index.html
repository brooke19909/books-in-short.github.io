It so happened that this state, which has two capitals, and tourists who first came to a young country, are wondering about its main center. </p><h2>  The capital of Montenegro: Cetinje or Podgorica? </h2><p>  The main city of the modern state is Podgorica, which in the last century became the official <span>capital of Montenegro.</span>  This is where important government agencies, the government and parliament are located.  However, Cetinje, the cultural and spiritual center of the country, has been considered the historical capital since ancient times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cetinje city Montenegro" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1502321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The residences of the president and the metropolitan are located in a small village.  According to local residents, to visit a beautiful country, reverently related to its cultural origins, and not to see the city-museum, which will be discussed in our article, is a real tourist crime. </p><h2>  History of the glorious city </h2><p>  The appearance of Cetinje (Montenegro) is associated with Ivan Chernoevich, a bold ruler oppressed by the Turks.  In 1482, the valiant prince with his subjects took refuge at the foot of <span>Mount Eagle,</span> where he founded a monastery, which became a symbol of the independence of the state, and Cetinje appeared near him, who gained the title of cradle of Serbian Orthodoxy.  Residents of the city heroically fought with the Turks, who destroyed the local monastery.  However, in 1701 it was rebuilt, and it was in this form that the religious landmark reached the descendants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the history of the city there were periods of decline, it was robbed by the Turks and Venetians, and the palace of the rulers of the Chernoevich dynasty was destroyed.  The heyday of Cetinje (Montenegro) is associated with the name of King Nicola Negosh, who ordered the construction of magnificent palaces and administrative buildings.  After the independence of the state, Cetinje becomes its full capital, and during this period the large-scale construction of the royal residence and foreign embassies, which now houses museums, begins.  In 1910, the Government House appeared - a symbol of state power, and at that time it was the smallest capital with a population not exceeding five thousand people. </p><p>  After the First and Second World Wars, the capital functions of Cetinje disappear, but to this day it is considered the main spiritual center of Montenegro.  Now 15 thousand inhabitants live here. </p><h2>  Tourist center of the country </h2><p>  The government is doing everything to develop tourism infrastructure, because for a long time foreign visitors neglected this area, and the city developed exclusively as an industrial center.  However, with the collapse of the socialist economy, all plants closed.  The modern city offers its guests to get acquainted with a large number of historical sights and amazing nature, the beauty of which not a single photograph can convey. </p><h2>  Weather and climate of the cultural capital </h2><p>  The charming Cetinje (Montenegro) is located east of the Lovcen mountain range towering above the city, on the slopes of which groves are green, which makes the panorama of the country's cultural center simply amazing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cetinje Montenegro" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1502273.jpg" width="600"></div>

Autumn is replete with frequent rainfall, and the most comfortable time to visit the heart of Montenegro is from July to September, when the heat drops and there is no rain. </p><h2>  King Nikola's Palace </h2><p>  A small village, consisting of several blocks, has a rich history, although by the standards of other cities of the state it is still quite young.  Cultural and historical monuments created several centuries ago are of great interest to the guests. </p><p>  The Royal Palace is one of the main attractions that the ancient capital of Montenegro boasts.  Cetinje is proud of the cultural and historical monument, bearing the name "Finger" in the common people.  Built from 1863 to 1867  the king‚Äôs palace impressed the inhabitants with its luxury and even caused gossip of the European nobility, which discussed wealth.  The Art Nouveau building is replete with decorative details and original forms, and each of its rooms is made in an individual style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cetinje Monastery in Montenegro" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1502292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  King Nikola's Palace is an old building that has undergone several renovations, but the interiors and antique furniture have remained the same and will delight even many tourists who have seen their wealth.  Now a state museum is open here, its unique collections will tell about the history and culture of Montenegro from the Middle Ages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cetinje monastery </h2><p>  In the small city of Cetinje (Montenegro), in which it is impossible to get lost, Orthodox believers come from different parts of the planet to see Christian relics stored in temples.  Of course, his main treasure is the very monastery erected by the Grand Duke Ivan Chernoyevich.  There was a printing yard in it, and the first book that appeared in the Balkans was written in Cyrillic.  Now a real rarity can be seen in the local museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of montenegro cetinje" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1502300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For more than 500 years, the ancient monastery has been the main residence of the Montenegrin metropolitans located in the historical part of the city.  It is not for nothing that Cetinje in Montenegro is called the spiritual center of the state, because this religious monument is considered the heart and symbol of the Orthodox country.  Here are the shrines that cause a particular awe among Christians - a part of the cross from Calvary, on which Jesus was crucified, and the hand of St. John the Baptist. </p><h2>  Religious complex </h2><p>  Once the monastery resembled a defensive structure with loopholes, along the perimeter of which protective ditches were dug.  And now it is a cozy place with a large number of Orthodox buildings.  True, in order to visit him, it is necessary to close his head, shoulders and legs, and before entering the monastery, the ministers give additional instructions on how to behave inside him.  Desperate people come here and on their knees beg for something they cannot live without. </p><p>  Above the main attraction of the city, on the top of the mountain, is the mausoleum of Lord Daniel in the form of a small chapel.  A curious museum is opened at the monastery, which stores the robes of the metropolitans, the oldest printed and manuscript books. </p><p>  And in the very center of the religious complex is the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which also has another name - Vlashka. </p><h2>  Vlah church </h2><p>  The historical monument appeared in 1450 and is considered the most ancient building of Cetinje (Montenegro).  This is a church that was built by shepherds.  Initially, it was a primitive hut of branches covered with earth.  Later, the temple was significantly strengthened, and the building, which appears before the eyes of tourists, acquired the final version in 1864.  When they built the fence of the church, they used weapons thrown by the Turks.  It is known that more than fifteen hundred captured trunks are walled up in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of Montenegro is Cetinje or Podgorica" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1502315.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <p>  In the restored temple, unique Greek frescoes, perfectly preserved to our times, are of particular interest.  Near the holy place is a cemetery, where many famous personalities of the state have found rest.  In 1939, a sculpture ‚ÄúSoul of Lovcen‚Äù was installed opposite the church, symbolizing the inhabitants of Montenegro, who tried to emigrate to America during the First World War, but drowned in the sea off the coast of Albania. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Quiet Cetinje <span>(Montenegro),</span> whose <span>attractions</span> reflect its rich past, has been an important tourist center of the state for several decades, because there is everything for a relaxing holiday.
