Active tourists who plan not only to improve their health, but also to expand their horizons, will certainly be interested in the sights of Karlovy Vary.  It is about them that we want to talk about in our article.  Such a beautiful city has a lot of interesting places that you need to see with your own eyes. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.2318521" data-lng="12.871961599999963" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/3/0/2830.png"></div><h2>  Colonnades of the city </h2><p>  I would like to start the story about the sights of Karlovy Vary with its healing sources.  After all, they glorified the city.  In total, the resort has 13 healing springs that are led to five colonnades: Geysernaya, Zamkova, Mill, Market and Sadovaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.continentaltravel.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Republic Karlovy Vary attractions" class="if uuid-2442910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442910.jpg"></div><p>  The mill colonnade is the most aristocratic and elegant among the rest.  It includes sources: Prince Wenceslas, Libushe, Mermaid, Mill, Rock.  It was built in 1881.  The author of the project was the architect Joseph Ziteka.  The building was built so that European aristocrats could visit healing springs in any weather.  The colonnade was made in the style of the Neo-Renaissance.  In length, it reaches 130 meters.  The white building impresses with its monumentality and allegorical sculptures that adorn the facade of the building, as well as a sophisticated balustrade and columns that lead to the orchestra pit.  In the daytime, Mill Colonnade is of interest as a historical landmark of Karlovy Vary.  And in the evenings, amazing lighting is lit on it and an orchestra plays.  Source water is useful for diseases of the intestines, stomach, diabetes and metabolic disorders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Market colonnade </h2><p>  The most beautiful and famous colonnade is the Market.  It rises above the springs of Charles IV and Market.  The building was built in 1882 by architects Fellner and Gelmer.  The construction was temporary.  They wanted to replace it with a stone structure in a few years.  But the snow-white openwork gallery, built of wood, with sophisticated columns, was not only incredibly beautiful, but also durable.  Therefore, they decided to leave her.  Currently, the building is equipped with comfortable tables for guests to sit at.  Mineral water of two sources is indicated for people with musculoskeletal problems. </p><h2>  Geyser colonnade </h2><p>  Another attraction of Karlovy Vary is the Geyser Colonnade, which has several sources, the temperature of which ranges from 30-72 degrees.  In many ways, the effect of mineral water on the body depends on its temperature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travellingbazaar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karlovy Vary attractions reviews" class="if uuid-2442915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442915.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, you can drink it only after consulting a doctor, depending on what effect you want to achieve.  The sources are so healing that it‚Äôs very useful to even breathe air around the geyser, because it is filled with trace elements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Castle colonnade </h2><p>  Castle Colonnade was erected at the beginning of the last century.  The construction site was a small hill from which the whole city is visible.  The project was developed by the architect Johann Friedrich Oman.  As planned, one colonnade was supposed to combine two sources, which was achieved.  Water from the lower source helps people to strengthen cartilage and bone tissue, and from the upper one it is prescribed for caries and periodontal disease. </p><h2>  Garden colonnade </h2><p>  Another attraction of Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) is rightfully considered the Garden Colonnade, which is located in one of the most beautiful places in the city.  Nearby are the gardens of Dvorak and the famous Hotel Termal.  It is next to the colonnade that is the gathering place for most of the bus and walking tours.  Her project was developed in 1880 by the same two architects - Gelner and Fellner.  Not so long ago, in 2002, the openwork structure was restored according to old projects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karlovy Vary attractions tourist reviews" class="if uuid-2442919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442919.jpg"></div><p>  Now the colonnade looks as attractive as in the late nineteenth century.  She combined three sources: Serpentine, Garden, and Liberty.  They all differ from each other in temperature and properties.  Water from the Garden Spring helps with kidney and liver diseases.  But Snake is the coldest spring in the city.  The temperature of its water is only 30 degrees.  It has a healing effect in dermatological problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  City Theater </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort town is only 59 km2, and its population is about 50 thousand people.  But at the same time, sights in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) are found literally at every step.  There are many places where you can have fun - museums, theaters and more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvcard.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Karlovy Vary and surroundings" class="if uuid-2442921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442921.jpg"></div><p>  On Theater Square near the embankment, you will see the sophisticated neo-baroque city theater building.  His project was developed by Viennese specialists Fellner and Helmer.  And the Klimtov brothers and Franz Matsch worked on internal decorations.  The theater is very beautiful inside and out; even its hand-painted curtain is a great artistic value.  The facades of the building and the lobby are decorated with stunning sculptures.  The theater is guarded by mythical griffins and muses.  No less beautiful is the staircase of the building, which was decorated with a composition of lamps made in the Rococo style.  Due to its beauty, the theater is the center and the pearl of the resort.  Tourists can see the ‚ÄúFigaro Wedding‚Äù, as well as other classical and modern operas and ballet.  Symphony concerts, music festivals, organ music concerts and more are held within the walls of the theater. </p><p>  According to reviews of tourists about the sights of Karlovy Vary, the theater is considered the heart of the cultural life of the city.  All guests who are connoisseurs of art seek to visit it.  The luxurious decoration of the building inside and out is worthy of being admired.  The theater is located at: Theater Square, 21. </p><h2>  Art gallery </h2><p>  A very popular attraction of Karlovy Vary is the art gallery, which has a rich collection of works of art from the end of the nineteenth century to the present.  Here you can see paintings of different directions (expressionism, cubism, surrealism and others).  More than 150 paintings are exhibited in the halls on an ongoing basis.  All other works are periodically changed depending on thematic exhibitions. </p><p>  The art gallery was laid in the early twentieth century.  Its building is made in the style of neoclassicism and Art Nouveau designed by Rudolf Mimler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.karlovy-vary.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karlovy Vary sights with addresses" class="if uuid-2442923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442923.jpg"></div><p>  The gallery is located at: Goethova stezka, 1215/6.  It is worth knowing that the art gallery also has several branches.  But the most interesting you can see in the halls of the central building. </p><h2>  Church of St. Mary Magdalene </h2><p>  It is difficult to see the most important sights of Karlovy Vary in one day.  A closer look will take much longer.  If you have only one day at your disposal, then experienced tourists recommend spending it on exploring the historic center.  This will allow you to appreciate the beauty of the city and its architectural style. </p><p>  Many tourists know Karlovy Vary as a resort, but are completely unaware of how interesting its history is.  A little dip into it will allow inspection of the main churches and churches of the city.  One of the oldest temples is the church of St.  Mary Magdalene.  It is located in the heart of the resort town.  Its beautiful light walls framed by the greenish peaks of the towers invariably attract the eyes of all tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zh.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karlovy Vary sights in one day" class="if uuid-2442927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442927.jpg"></div><p>  The cathedral has a long history.  The first temple, made in the Gothic style, was built in the 14th century.  According to historical chronicles, the founder was one of the orders of chivalry.  But time passed, and architectural tastes changed.  It was the time of the Renaissance, so many beautiful works of Gothic began to rebuild.  The <span>temple of Mary Magdalene</span> underwent similar changes <span>.</span>  Its reconstruction began in the 16th century.  The elements of external decoration were changed, a garden and a cemetery appeared near the cathedral.  After another hundred years, the building was badly damaged during the fire.  But the forces of the townspeople quickly restored it.  In the seventeenth century, the famous Thirty Years War began, during which the temple was destroyed more than once, and then rebuilt.  By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the building was already in poor condition.  It was then that they decided to completely rebuild the temple in order to erect a new building that will be able to accommodate all parishioners. </p><p>  The construction was not easy, since there were sources nearby.  Nevertheless, in 1734, the first Mass was held in the new church.  In less than 25 years, the church burned down.  And again, the inhabitants restored it.  Since then, the appearance of the temple has not changed.  Currently, the church has received the status of a historical monument.  It is located at: nam.  Svobody, 1. </p><h2>  Goethe Tower </h2><p>  Not all historical sites are located in the city itself.  Tourists will be interested in some of the sights near Karlovy Vary.  These include the Goethe Tower.  Getting to her is better as part of a sightseeing tour of the resort.  Tourists are brought to the tower by bus.  If you decide to get there yourself, you need to take the bus at number 8, which goes to the village of Gurki, and then you have to go on foot to the destination.  This is not the easiest way.  The Goethe Tower is located at Karlovy Vary, Goethova vyhlidka, 244/2. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions near Karlovy Vary" class="if uuid-2442932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442932.jpg"></div><p>  The building serves as a viewing platform.  It offers a picturesque view of the city and its immediate surroundings.  The Goethe Tower is the very first and oldest building of this kind in Karlovy Vary.  It was built in 1889.  It is surrounded by a beautiful forest in which centenary trees grow.  The tower was named after the German poet, who often visited it. </p><h2>  Beƒçov nad Teplou Castle </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Karlovy Vary and its environs, it is worth paying attention to the old town and the castle of Beƒçov nad Teplou, which is located in the town of the same name, 25 kilometers from the resort.  The architectural complex includes an ancient fortress and a romantic castle.  It is a very valuable historical monument, for the sake of which tourists travel to the town in droves.  The exact date of the construction of the fortress is unknown.  Specialists speak of the first half of the fourteenth century.  According to research, at this place there were already buildings that began to reconstruct and build new ones in 1352.  So there was a tower and a chapel, in which the remains of unique wall paintings are still preserved (frescoes date from 1360).  In the second half of the 14th century, a dungeon with residential quarters was erected.  For several centuries, buildings expanded, and the fortress itself passed from the hands of some owners to other owners.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, they tried to remake the residence, but to no avail.  Some of the fortifications were blown up, after which the fortress began to serve as a granary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carmensluxurytravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular sights of Karlovy Vary" class="if uuid-2442942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2442942.jpg"></div><p>  The complex was restored only in the 60s of the twentieth century.  On its territory now is the relic of St. Moor, which is of great value on a global scale. </p><h2>  Sights of Karlovy Vary: reviews </h2><p>  Karlovy Vary is a stunningly beautiful resort, about which tourists leave only rave reviews.
