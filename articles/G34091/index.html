    <h2>  Historical background of the first microscope </h2><p>  Obviously, a microscope is an unusual device.  And what is even more surprising is the fact that it was invented in the Middle Ages.  His father is considered Anthony van Levenguk.  But, without detracting from the merits of the scientist, it should be said that the first microscopic device was developed either by Galileo (1609), or by Hans and Zachary Jansen (1590).  However, there is very little information about the latter, as well as about the form of their invention. </p><p>  For this reason, the development of Hans and Zakharia Jansen is not taken seriously as the first microscope.  And the merits of the developer of the device belong to Galileo Galilei.  His device was a combined installation with a simple eyepiece and two lenses.  This microscope is called composite light.  Cornelius Drebbel (1620) later developed this invention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Apparently, the development of Galileo would have been the only one if Anthony van Levenguk had not published a work on microscopy in 1665.  In it, he described living organisms, which he saw with his simple-lens single-lens microscope.  This development is both brilliantly simple and incredibly complex at the same time. </p><h2>  Levenguk's microscope, ahead of its time </h2><p>  Anthony van Levenguk's microscope is a product consisting of a bronze plate with a lens attached to it and fasteners.  The device easily fit on your hand, but hid extreme power: it allowed you to increase objects by 275-500 times.  This was achieved by installing a small convex flat-convex lens.  And interestingly, until 1970, leading physicists could not figure out how Levenguk created such magnifiers. </p>

    <p>  Previously, it was assumed that the lens for the microscope was ground on a machine.  However, this would require remarkable perseverance and extreme jewelry accuracy.  In 1970, the hypothesis was proposed that Levenguk smelted lenses from a glass thread.  He heated it, and then polished the area by which a glass drop was attached.  This is already much simpler and faster, although it has not yet been possible to prove it: the owners of the remaining Levenguk microscopes did not give consent to the experiments.  However, in this way it is possible to assemble a Levenhuk microscope even at home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The principle of using the Levenguk microscope </h2><p>  The structure of the product is extremely simple, which indicates the ease of use.  In fact, it was extremely difficult to use because of the unknown <span>focal length of the</span> lens.  Therefore, before considering it, we had to bring the device closer and further away from the studied section for a long time.  Moreover, the cut itself was located between a lighted candle and a lens, which allowed to maximize the microstructure.  And they became visible to the human eye. </p><h2>  Characteristics of the Levenguk microscope </h2><p>  According to the results of the experiments, the increase in the Levenguk microscope was astounding, at least it increased by 275 times.  Many researchers believe that the leading microscope of the Middle Ages created a device that allowed to increase 500 times.  Science fiction figures indicate the number 1500, although this is not possible without the use of <span>immersion oils.</span>  They simply did not exist then. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, Levenguk set the tone for the development of many sciences and realized that not everyone sees the eye.  There is a microcosm invisible to us.  And there is still a lot of fascinating.  From the height of centuries, it should be noted that the researcher was prophetically right.  And today, the Levenguk microscope, whose photo is located below, is considered one of the engines of science. </p><h2>  Some hypotheses about the development of a microscope </h2><p>  Many scientists today believe that the Levenguk microscope was not created from scratch.  Naturally, the scientist knew some facts about the existence of Galileo optics.  However, with the invention of the Italian, he has no similarities.  Other historians believe that Levenguk took as a basis the development of Hans and Zakharia Yansenov.  By the way, almost nothing is known about the microscope of the latter. </p><p>  Since Hans and his son Zachary worked on the production of glasses, their development was more like the invention of Galileo Galilei.  The Levenguk microscope is a much more powerful device, since it allowed to increase by 275-500 times.  Composite light microscopes of both Yansenov and Galileo did not have such power.  Moreover, due to the presence of two lenses, they had twice as many errors.  It took about 150 years for the composite microscope to catch up with the Levenguk microscope in terms of image quality and magnification power. </p><h2>  Hypothesis on the origin of the lens of the Levenhuk microscope </h2><p>  Historical sources allow us to summarize the activities of the scientist.  According to the Royal Scientific Society of England, Levenguk collected about 25 microscopes.  He also managed to manufacture nearly 500 lenses.  It is not known why he did not create so many microscopes, apparently, these lenses did not give a proper increase or were defective.  Only 9 Levenguk microscopes have reached the present. </p>

    <p>  There is an interesting hypothesis that the Levenguk microscope was created on the basis of natural lenses of volcanic origin.  Many scientists believe that he simply smelted a drop of glass for their manufacture.  Others agree that he managed to melt a glass thread and make lenses in this way.  But the fact that out of 500 lenses, the scientist managed to create only 25 microscopes, says a lot. </p><p>  In particular, it indirectly confirms all three hypotheses of the origin of lenses.  Apparently, the final answer is unlikely to be obtained without experimentation.  But to believe that without the presence of high-precision <span>measuring instruments</span> and <span>grinding machines</span> he managed to create powerful lenses is quite difficult. </p><h2>  Creating a Levenguk microscope at home </h2><p>  Many people, trying to test some hypotheses about the origin of the lenses, have successfully fabricated a Levenguk microscope at home.  To do this, on a simple <span>alcohol burner,</span> you need to melt a thin glass thread until a drop appears on it.  It must cool down, after which it must be sanded from one side (opposite to the spherical surface). </p>

    <p>  Grinding allows you to create a flat-convex lens that meets the requirements of microscopy.  It will give an increase of about 200-275 times.  After that, you just need to fix it on a solid tripod and consider objects of interest.  However, there is one problem: the lens itself with a convex end must be turned to the substance under study.  The researcher while looking at the flat surface of the lens.  This is the only way to use a microscope.  Levenguk, the reviews of the Royal Scientific Society about which at one time provided him with a glorious reputation, most likely created and applied his invention in this way. </p>
