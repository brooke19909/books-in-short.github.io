    <p>  If you live in the central or southern part of Russia and choose Mayak (Novosibirsk) from all Siberian vacation spots, a beach that meets European standards, take care of your own place of residence.  The city is the third in the country in terms of population, finding housing here will be quite simple - even at the stations on duty offering to rent an apartment for a long time. </p><p>  One and a half million city is the largest infrastructure facility in Siberia, the cultural and sports sphere is widely developed here, great attention is paid to environmental protection.  The banks of the local river are periodically cleaned of garbage, thanks to which the water from it, after a little filtration, can even be used for drinking. </p><h2>  "Lighthouse" </h2>

    <p>  Mayak Beach (Novosibirsk), whose photo resembles photographs of typical recreational areas of Europe, was built in the mid-2000s next to the yacht club of the same name.  Initially, many residents of the city accepted the construction with hostility, since this area was considered unfavorable for swimming.  However, after a thorough cleaning of the beach and the nearby water area, its image has significantly improved in the eyes of the local population. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beach is fenced off from visiting, thanks to this it is possible to achieve its preservation almost in its original form.  Garbage is cleaned daily, and litter bins are everywhere.  The owners of the beach are doing everything to relax on it was as comfortable as possible.  Boat, yacht and catamaran rentals work, in winter the beach is closed, but the yacht club itself is actively functioning. </p><h2>  Yacht Club </h2>

    <p>  Mayak Beach (Novosibirsk), whose address is ul.  The dam, 1/1, works only in the summer.  If you go there by car, you first need to get to the dam of the <span>Novosibirsk hydroelectric station,</span> from it to the beach - just a stone's throw.  It is from here that the Novosibirsk Reservoir begins, the expanses of which can be conquered by renting a yacht nearby. </p><p>  The beach and the yacht club of the same name are in the jurisdiction of the Sovetsky district of the city, so for all service issues it will be necessary to contact the appropriate regulatory authorities.  On the other side of the Bolshaya Strait is the federal highway ‚ÄúM52‚Äù, which you can also use as a guide. </p><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  If you are planning to visit Mayak Beach (Novosibirsk), the most important question is how to get there.  If you have your own car, it will not be difficult, but if there is none, you will have to use public transport or a taxi, however, the latter option can cost a pretty penny.  Please note that taxi drivers do not always know where this beach is, so there is a chance that you will have to direct them. </p><p>  You can use buses and minibuses, you need to get to the stop "Concrete Plant / Plotinnaya Street", and then walk about a kilometer.  Bus lines No. 23, 48, 141 and a fixed-route taxi No. 43 run through this stop.  You can also take the intercity route number 327, which connects Novosibirsk and Berdsk, but the fare will be much higher on it.  Current fares can be checked at the box office ticket offices. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2>

    <p>  The private beach "Mayak" (Novosibirsk) is very popular among local residents and visitors.  Vacationers note that on the beach there is a range of all necessary services at relatively low prices, which is very convenient.  Many are very pleased that the recreation area is located near the entrance to the city, some even get there on foot, without using public transport. </p><p>  As negative aspects, visitors to the beach note a system of paid access to its territory, many would like to be able to visit it for free.  In turn, the leadership of the <span>recreation area</span> notes that the money received for entering the beach is sent to clean it, due to which guests can hope that their vacation will be as comfortable as possible.  The beach management does not plan to change their plans and make entrance free.  Also negative for the guests is the too small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe recreation area, which can accommodate no more than 300 people. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Mayak (Novosibirsk) is a beach where you can not only relax lying on the clean sand and enjoy the surrounding views, but also make friends.  On the territory of the recreation area, animators work who periodically hold contests with prize drawing among vacationers.  Safety is controlled by lifeguards who are on duty throughout the beach and in its waters.  Please note that young children are not recommended to be without adults in this recreation area. </p><p>  About 15 thousand people visit this beach every year, in winter it closes.  However, if you arrived there in cold weather, you can use the services of a yacht club located next door.  Before visiting the yacht club, be sure to contact the on-duty administrators, specify the number of available seats, as well as the cost of accommodation.  Have a nice rest! </p>
