    <h2>  Favorable location </h2><p>  This, it must be said, is an important aspect.  As a matter of fact, therefore the first thing that will be discussed is about him.  Visitors who decide to stay in a particular hotel, it is important to know that they can quickly reach the nearby city center at any time, go shopping, go to the beach, or to entertainment establishments.  In general, it is important that the complex is close to all worldly pleasures.  And Makadi Garden Azur Resort has succeeded in this regard.  The hotel is located very close to Hurghada.  And this city is, as you know, the tourist center of all of Egypt.  Hurghada is popular with tourists from all over the world and Europe, as it is famous for its unusual atmosphere, accessibility and democracy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Activities near the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, it should be noted that in the immediate vicinity of this modern hotel complex is a spacious sandy beach and the purest azure sea.  Perhaps this is the main thing for visitors, since the vast majority come to these places to swim and sunbathe.  By the way, there is a great opportunity to start diving.  Shallow coral gardens are very beautiful, and it is worth seeing this natural wonder with your own eyes.  Given that the beach is next to the hotel, it‚Äôs a sin not to take advantage of this - reefs are everywhere, one of the most popular is located directly opposite the main beach.  And if there is no such desire, then you can just take a walk. </p>

    <p>  Makadi Bay, where the Makadi Garden Azur Resort is located, is a place representing a bay (after all, the word "bay" is translated into Russian), and it‚Äôs very picturesque.  Because evening walks along the spacious beaches will remain in your memory for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gifts from the hotel </h2><p>  Not all hotel complexes can boast such a pleasant service as a compliment.  But Makadi Garden Azur Resort is just such a case.  For example, if a guest has a birthday, the administration will congratulate his guest on a birthday cake.  Special attention should be paid to the compliment from the hotel for honeymooners.  In honor of such a significant event as a wedding, the hotel will arrange a real holiday in the apartment: the staff will decorate the room with rose petals, <span>scented candles,</span> balls, and put in a fruit basket.  Only when booking it will be necessary to make a note of Honeymooners - so that the hotel knows that a newly made husband and wife are coming to them.  And, of course, the administration will not disregard its loyal guests, who always receive discounts upon arrival, as well as a special regular guest card. </p><h2>  Rest in the complex </h2><p>  Guests of the Makadi Garden Azur Resort have the opportunity to relax on the terrace by the outdoor swimming pool, sunbathe or swim.  Also, if you wish, you can just relax in the shady picturesque garden.  By the way, it is worth noting that in public places there is absolutely free Internet access (wireless).  It is very important to constantly stay in touch, follow the news that takes place in the homeland.  So you can safely come with a laptop and not worry about where to look for a Wi-Fi access point later. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel impression </h2><p>  They say that the first impression is the most striking, and this applies to everything.  Well, perhaps this is true.  Most of the guests after a first look at the Makadi Garden Azur Resort, photos of which fully show the originality of this complex, only have positive impressions.  This is enthusiasm mixed with interest.  The hotel is made in the traditional Egyptian style - due to the sandy color of the buildings there is a feeling that the hotel is made of sand.  But despite the external traditional, ethnic design, everything inside is made in a modern style.  The rooms, hall, restaurant appear before guests in a rather simple, but rich design. </p>
