  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Commercial housing: concept, design features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Initially established gradation: all real estate is divided into residential and commercial.  But today, everything is somewhat different.  There is such a category as commercial housing.  Another name is apartments.  What it is?  What are the pros and cons of buying such premises?  How is this regarded in terms of legislation?  The answers to these and other important questions are in the article. </p><h2>  What is commercial property? </h2><p>  Let's start with the most important definition.  Commercial real estate is considered to be various constructions, land plots, buildings that are used by their owners, employers to carry out entrepreneurial activities.  The purpose of the latter is to obtain constant profits, periodic capital gains, and rental income.  This is one of the options for investing. </p><p>  Here are the most common objects that can be called commercial real estate: </p><ul><li>  Agricultural enterprises. </li><li>  Industrial facilities. </li><li>  Hotels, hostels. </li><li>  Warehouses, garages. </li><li>  Office structures. </li><li>  Shopping centers and shops. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="prithvilandproject.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home sale" class="if uuid-3112227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112227.jpg"></div><h2>  What else is commercial real estate? </h2><p>  Commercial real estate can also be called the following: </p><ul><li>  Land and other natural lands. </li><li>  Certain sections of the underground. </li><li>  Delimited water bodies. </li><li>  Forest plots. </li><li>  Perennial plantings. </li><li>  Other types of property attached to the ground or firmly connected with it.  As a rule, these are various buildings, structures. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget that the rights to it also apply to real estate.  Also, it can be called space objects that are subject to state registration, water and aircraft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Real estate is considered commercial only if it is intended for commercial use.  One in which it becomes a source of constant profit. </p><h2>  Categories </h2><p>  Now - a gradation of commercial real estate: </p><ul><li>  Free buildings.  Sports and fitness centers, hotels, hotels, restaurants, cafes. </li><li>  Retail premises.  Shops and shopping centers. </li><li>  Office property.  From business centers to individual classrooms and office spaces. </li><li>  Industrial facilities.  Production facilities, structures of industrial enterprises, warehouse complexes. </li><li>  Social facilities.  Medical centers, entertainment complexes (bowling, swimming pools, disco-halls and others), commercial airports and so on. </li><li>  Commercial housing.  The so-called apartments in apartment buildings, premises for short-term rental for the purpose of living. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, only the first four categories are considered to be truly commercial real estate.  The last two occupy a more borderline position - between the social and commercial, between the residential and commercial type.  They will bring profit to their owners, tenants only when used for certain purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="happycastle.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commercial housing fee" class="if uuid-3112241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112241.jpg"></div><h2>  Can commercial real estate be residential? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that initially real estate was divided into commercial and residential, the concept of "commercial housing" today also takes place.  But what is it? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This implies absolutely any residential property, the use of which allows you to make a profit. </p><h2>  Commercial housing example </h2><p>  The most common example of such housing is a typical multi-storey apartment building.  But each apartment in it acts as a private living space.  In fact, the construction of apartment buildings appears to be an investment project in the field of commercial real estate.  Indeed, the design, architectural planning and further construction of the building is an investment investment, the purpose of which is quite clear - making a profit. </p><p>  But at the same time, every apartment in such a house is a residential property.  After the apartments are sold out in such a house, it already ceases to be a commercial project.  From now on, it will refer only to residential private property. </p><p>  Commercial housing.  What is it in Belarus?  Such an example is implied.  But in addition to this, you need to know about commercial housing in the Moscow Region and other large cities of Russia, which is better known to the public under the name "apartments". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edmontonjewishnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commercial housing public housing" class="if uuid-3112229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112229.jpg"></div><h2>  Prevalence of the phenomenon </h2><p>  According to statistics, more than a quarter of real estate in the primary housing market in Moscow is apartments.  Why are they so common?  It's all about the low price, which is a huge plus for the sale of housing in the metropolitan region of the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But buyers do not pay attention to a big drawback - the legal status of such premises is not yet clearly registered.  Formally, these apartments are non-residential real estate.  Despite the fact that they are fully suitable for people to live, they are actively included in the plans and projects of administrative centers, hotel complexes. </p><p>  The share of apartments in the same Moscow accounts for about 26-28% of all proposals for the sale of housing.  The largest implementers here are such large companies as Tushino 2018, Symbol, ZilArt and so on. </p><p>  How much is commercial housing?  If we compare apartments with new buildings in typical residential high-rise buildings, they will be 20-25% lower in cost.  Moreover, the characteristics of the premises will be similar. </p><h2>  Who is the offer for? </h2><p>  How to buy commercial housing?  Just contact the sales department of the developer you are interested in.  There are no problems with buying apartments in Russia today. </p><p>  Initially, this type of construction began to develop in the capital of the Russian Federation due to a shortage of sites for the construction of traditional housing.  The apartments were part of business centers.  Further more.  Former factories today are turning into apartment complexes. </p><p>  Who are they for?  Initially, the apartments were premises for temporary comfortable living of successful businessmen.  A business person could buy such housing in the city, where he often appears on a business trip, with the aim of meetings, negotiations, so as not to stay at a hotel or hotel. </p><p>  Then apartments began to acquire another category of citizens.  Not for living, but for investing your money in real estate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kemptoncarr.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to privatize commercial housing" class="if uuid-3112234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112234.jpg"></div><h2>  Who are the apartments interesting for today? </h2><p>  Today, apartments are also of interest to citizens who are far from big business and investment.  Those who wish only to acquire comfortable housing at an affordable price for permanent residence in it. </p><p>  But you should not rush with such a purchase.  Attracted by lower cost, the new settlers at first do not pay attention to the many pitfalls, which then turn into big problems for them. </p><p>  First of all, the terms "commercial housing", "apartments" are not generally fixed at the legislative level - neither at the regional nor at the federal level.  In essence, apartments are residential real estate.  But they are legally regulated as commercial.  By this principle, taxes are paid. </p><p>  As for commercial housing in public housing, this is not even a related concept.  This refers to housing rented under commercial lease agreements, not apartments. </p><h2>  Registration Issue </h2><p>  Commercial housing for military personnel - there are no apartments.  These are apartments provided under commercial rental agreements. </p><p>  The second significant minus of the apartments is that by law they are not intended for permanent residence.  Therefore, even being their owner and living there all the time, it is impossible to register in such a room.  There is only one exception: registration in the apartments is possible if they are part of a hotel complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.commonfloor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much is commercial housing" class="if uuid-3112233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112233.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is it possible to register? </h2><p>  By law, registration in non-residential premises is possible when they fall within the purview of specialized institutions - hotels, hotels, hospitals, and holiday homes.  The responsibility of registering residents here is assigned to the administration of such an organization. </p><p>  If the apartments are part of a business center or a former factory, it is impossible to make them a place of registration.  But in the permitted case, not everything is smooth.  Even here, apartment owners receive non-permanent registration.  They are required to renew their registration every 5 years.  But she will give them the same rights as those registered in standard apartments.  That is, they will be fixed in the local clinic, can apply for a place for a child in a kindergarten or a school by registration.  Therefore, often apartments become the choice of family buyers. </p><h2>  Features of taxation </h2><p>  With the tax on commercial housing, not everything is going smoothly either.  Since the apartments do not in fact belong to the housing stock, it is impossible to get a tax deduction of 13%. </p><p>  But at the same time, property taxes themselves are levied at high rates, because by law it is commercial.  Therefore, the owner of the apartment, in comparison with the owner of an ordinary apartment, overpays in the field of taxes 20-25%.  Moreover, annually. </p><p>  When determining the tax base (based on the cadastral value), the minimum rate for apartments is 0.5%, the maximum is 2% (subparagraph 2, paragraph 2 of article 406 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation).  As for standard residential real estate, the rate of 0.1% applies to it (subparagraph 1, paragraph 2, article 406 of the Tax Code). </p><p>  The most disadvantageous from a tax point of view are apartments located in an office, shopping center, in a building intended for catering establishments.  The rate here is 1-2%.  The most economical are hotel apartments.  The maximum rate is 0.5%. </p><p>  Is it possible to privatize commercial housing?  Here, too, their "troubles."  Sometimes new settlers are offered contracts where they are not the owners of the apartment, but some share in the common property. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloomingsky.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to buy commercial housing" class="if uuid-3112235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112235.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  As for the tariffs for utilities, apartments are again difficult.  They will not be presented with the requirements of the LCD, mandatory for the residential sector in relation to the management of common property. </p><p>  So, the owners of the apartments can not affect the value of the tariffs that the management company exposes for the operation of the building, the adjacent territory, the infrastructure in general.  Therefore, utility bills are definitely higher when compared with ordinary apartments.  On average, 15%. </p><h2>  Unregulated infrastructure </h2><p>  Another alarming minus that you need to pay attention to before buying an apartment.  The developer does not have an obligation to improve the territory adjacent to commercial real estate.  That is, a green zone, lawns, playgrounds, places for temporary car parking and pedestrian paths may never appear near your home. </p><p>  Pay attention to the neighbors.  If the apartments are located in a business center, then your house will have a wide variety of visitors, couriers.  Under the windows can be a smoking area or car parking for office workers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brickunderground.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commercial housing for military personnel" class="if uuid-3112239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/3112239.jpg"></div><h2>  Norms SanPiNa </h2><p>  In conclusion, we add that commercial housing is not subject to sanitary standards, which must strictly comply with construction companies building standard housing.  By the level of illumination, sound insulation, insolation. </p><p>  This is especially alarming for apartments furnished in old industrial complexes that went through reconstruction.  That is, former factories, factories, warehouses.  Many are attracted to so-called lofts, but how safe will you be there? </p><p>  If the enterprise previously located there, one way or another, was associated with the chemical industry, harmful waste, then living in such a room is simply dangerous.  Since the decay time of such substances is tens or even hundreds of years. </p><p>  Commercial housing - the so-called apartments.  Previously, they attracted only businessmen and investors.  Today - ordinary citizens interested in affordable personal housing.  But in fact, the lower cost of the apartment translates into a number of disadvantages that cannot even justify it. </p>
