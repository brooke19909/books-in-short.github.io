This island is located in the Mediterranean Sea and has a hot climate, natural mountain landscapes, as well as a rich heritage of ancient culture.  If desired, tourists can always find inexpensive hotels for recreation that offer quite acceptable conditions for living.  For example, in Ayia Napa there is an inexpensive resort complex Pierre Anne Beach Hotel 3 *.  But is it worth saving on vacation?  Let us consider in more detail what rooms this hotel offers, as well as its infrastructure, food concepts and entertainment.  And, of course, we‚Äôll tell you about the reviews of other tourists about the rest here, so as not to miscalculate with the choice of a place for vacation. </p><h2>  Holidays in Ayia Napa </h2><p>  Hotel Pierre Anne 3 * is located in Ayia Napa - a large resort city in the southeast of Cyprus.  Tourists come here in search of a clean coast with soft, almost velvet sand.  He gained his popularity back in the 80s, and not only among tourists, but also among believers.  It is believed that the Byzantine icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary was found in the forests of Ayia Napa.  In its place a monastery was built, which has been perfectly preserved to this day.  This resort is considered one of the best on the island, moreover, the Cypriots themselves rest here.  It is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts, youth companies, as many bars and nightclubs are open here.  But families with children and older couples can easily find something to do. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What attracts tourists to the resort of Ayia Napa?  First of all, with its beaches.  Many of them here received the Blue Flag - an award that is given only to the cleanest sections of the coast.  In addition, the beaches are well developed tourist infrastructure.  Travelers can go diving, ride a motor boat, catamaran, water ski or surf.  The coast is fully equipped - showers, toilets, changing rooms are installed everywhere.  The entrance to the sea here is very convenient, flat and gentle, therefore safe for swimming with young children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mouzenidis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel pool" class="if uuid-2283700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2283700.jpg"></div><p>  Ayia Napa is perfect for gastronomic tourism.  Restaurants and cafes are open throughout the city, serving delicious international and local cuisine.  If desired, you can visit a luxurious restaurant or limited to a budget tavern.  Those who like to study the culture and historical heritage of the host country can be advised to visit the ancient monastery mentioned above, as well as the tombs of the ancient period.  The Museum of the Sea is also open in the city, where you can get acquainted with the inhabitants of coastal waters and the history of shipbuilding in Cyprus.  Tourists with young children can visit the water park or an amusement park with carousels, a ferris wheel and trampolines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  Thus, tourists coming to Ayia Napa will definitely not get bored.  It is important to choose a hotel with a convenient location to quickly get to the beach and the city center without losing precious time.

Only a small pedestrian road separates it from the coast.  Therefore, you can walk to the beach in just 5 minutes.  At the same time, the hotel is removed from the central part of the resort, where nightclubs are located.  Consequently, the nights at Pierre Anne 3 * are quite quiet.  The distance to the center is 500 meters, so to get there, you can walk along the picturesque streets of the city. </p><p>  Another advantage of the location of the hotel is its small distance from the airport.

If desired, guests can also pay for a paid transfer, and then the hotel will take care of picking you up from the airport and delivering you to the place of rest as comfortably as possible.  The famous Ayia Napa Monastery is 500 meters away.
