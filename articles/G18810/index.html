This is an excellent solution, since this month the United Arab Emirates come to life and turn into one of the “hottest” places in terms of tourism.  It was at the beginning of winter that a huge number of tourists from all over the world came here. </p><p>  <span>The United Arab Emirates</span> is a country of striking beauty and grandeur of skyscrapers, rich sheikhs, sandy beaches and luxurious hotels with high quality services. </p><p>  A trip to Dubai in December is a unique opportunity to hide from the Russian cold and plunge into the summer atmosphere, where the sun reigns, parties and many exciting excursions. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  The first winter month in this country is characterized by rare rains, but short heavy rains.  Otherwise, the weather is warm and almost dry. </p><p>  If you chose a trip to Dubai in December, then get ready for the fact that all the delights of a beach holiday will await you, which means that your body will receive a beautiful and even tan.  This month, visibility under water is striking in its cleanliness, so the demand for diving is increasing several times. </p>

    <p>  But there is only one discomfort that can “give” Dubai.  The weather in December is famous for its sandstorms and hurricanes, which start unexpectedly and can last about two days.  Accordingly, during this period, visibility deteriorates significantly, it is difficult to breathe, since the air is filled with dust. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The temperature in Dubai in December </h2><p>  In the daytime, it is held at +25 ° C, at night it drops to +17 ° C. Therefore, for evening walks, do not forget to bring a warm top and closed shoes with you. </p><p>  As for the water temperature, it is quite comfortable on the Persian Gulf coast, although it all depends on the terrain.  For example, in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, the mark reaches +24 ° C, and off the coast of Fujairah (Ottoman Bay), t never rises above +20 ° C. However, judging by the reviews of tourists, this temperature is quite comfortable for swimming. </p><h2>  Weather in autumn </h2><p>  According to tourists, a trip <span>to Dubai in November</span> will be no less interesting and festive than in December.  Particularly pleased with the daytime +30 <sup>o</sup> C lovers of attractions and excursions.  You can safely go for a walk at any time of the day, because in the morning and during the day it is not hot here, and at night it is not cold.  However, with the onset of twilight, the temperature may drop to +18 ° C. Therefore, clothes with long sleeves will not be superfluous. </p><p>  Dubai will also delight fans of beach vacations in November.  According to our fellow tourists, the water temperature at this time is the most comfortable for swimming and is kept at +25 ° C. The end of autumn is not a reason to forget about the safety of your skin, so do not forget to take sunscreen with you on the beach. </p><p>  As for precipitation, in November they are unlikely, but still expected.  You should not be afraid - you won’t get wet, so you can safely leave the umbrella at home. </p><h2>  Family resort </h2><p>  Another bonus for those who decided to go to Dubai in December with their children.  With the opening of this resort, family travel has acquired a new status: families with children have become interesting to their parents.  Believe me, there is no place for boredom in the vast territory of Dubai Parks and Resorts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For example, with kids you can ride on various attractions, and then go on a delicious dinner or listen to live music.  In general, here are 4 reasons to visit a city like Dubai: </p><ol><li>  The weather in December, as mentioned earlier, is quite warm, which means that the first month of winter is the time to go with the children to Legoland!  All rides, swings, carousels and slides are made of famous designer bricks.  However, in addition to this, you can visit the water park adjacent to the Legoland: here, children can swim in the pool, frolic on 20 different slides, build their own boat and ride it on a real river. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai holidays in December" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34480/1470235.jpg" width="460"></div></li><li>  The theme park for movie fans of all ages - Motiongate Dubai - is divided into several zones, where each imitates a specific Hollywood studio.  If the kids will have lively communication with the characters of their favorite cartoons, then the adults will be amazed by the impressive multimedia performance. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai vouchers" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34480/1470239.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Riverland Dubai - a place for those who dreamed of a time machine.  Here in just a few minutes you can be from America of the 50s to be in India, and from there go to a French village or any European city of the 19th century. </li><li>  Active recreation is able to exhaust even an adult, to say nothing of children.  And after a busy program, I want to relax a bit.  Therefore, it's time to book a room at the stylish Lapita Hotel Dubai.  While little guests will be in the safe hands of animators, adults will be able to enjoy relaxation procedures in the SPA salon. </li></ol><h2>  For a holiday in Dubai: tours and offers from tour operators </h2><p>  The Arab East attracts with its mystery, and judging by the reviews on the forums, some of our compatriots come here more than once a year.  First of all, the Emirates attract tourists with their fabulous wealth. </p><p>  What determines the cost of a tour to Dubai?  Vacations can be found both expensive and budget, but the price is added according to the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  flight + fuel surcharge; </li><li>  residence; </li><li>  insurance; </li><li>  transfer; </li><li>  services of guides, translators and guides. </li></ul><p>  The most budget option involves a charter flight, accommodation in a 3-star hotel (without breakfast) and independent study of attractions </p><p>  An expensive trip will give you the opportunity to enjoy a luxurious business class flight, plus everything, you are supposed to meet at the airport and "deliver" to the doors of a five-star hotel, and then - excursions to clubs, attractions and other interesting places. </p><p>  For example, the cost of a 10-day tour in Dubai with accommodation in a two-star hotel will cost about 35,000 rubles. </p><h2>  UAE National Day </h2><p>  Holidays in Dubai in December is a unique opportunity to mark a date important for the indigenous population.  It was on this day that 7 emirates declared themselves independent of Great Britain.  The celebration begins in the early morning and ends in the late evening of the next day. </p><p>  The streets are full of state flags.  Information for statistics lovers: at least 5000 state symbols are bought up annually by the national day and this figure is growing every year.  Parades are held in all cities of the Emirates, music is played, and concerts are held in open areas. </p>
