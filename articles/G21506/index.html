    <p>  The corporation was founded on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, <span>Steve Wozniak</span> and Ronald Wayne.  Apple has become one of the most famous manufacturers of software, laptops, tablets, telephones, personal computers, audio players, etc. </p><p>  The main center of the company is located in Cupertino, California. </p><p>  Apple's annual market capitalization for several years remains the highest in the world.  The founders of the company created such practical and aesthetically attractive devices that a certain cult of consumers was built around Yabloko. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until 2007, the name Computer included the word Computer.  This was because the first thirty years, Apple focused on the development of personal computers and suitable software.  However, over time, Apple began to devote more time to more mobile devices: iPhones, iPads and iPods. </p><h2>  What is an iPad? </h2><p>  One of Apple‚Äôs most sought after gadgets is the iPad. </p><p>  Lightweight and convenient tablet provides uninterrupted access to the World Wide Web and successfully performs the basic functions of a personal computer. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, he will not be able to completely replace a PC or laptop: the need for recharging and a small amount of memory will not allow you to work autonomously for days.  Due to the specific operating system, it is not possible to install programs on the tablet that require specific software. </p>

    <p>  Among the main differences from conventional tablets are: </p><ul><li>  Great battery for a longer battery life. </li><li>  Touch screen with high sensitivity. </li><li>  An operating system that responds quickly to requests. </li><li>  Easy installation of programs. </li></ul><p>  But the gadget is not without drawbacks: </p><ul><li>  A closed file system that prevents developers from changing it like Linux. </li><li>  Lack of built-in USB ports. </li><li>  The lack of a standard flash player from Adobe. </li></ul><h2>  How is an iPhone different from a smartphone? </h2><p>  If everything is clear with tablets, then how does an iPhone differ from thousands of other smartphones? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Owners of "apple" smartphones note that the main plus of the iPhone is the operating system.  Unlike Android, whose updates are installed on phones of any brand, iOS is designed specifically for Apple.  Thus, random ‚Äúlags‚Äù of the system are practically excluded. </p><p>  Applications downloaded through a special store are suitable for each smartphone.  iOS is less susceptible to viruses than other operating systems.  The elegant shape and body of the devices are not only beautiful, but also durable. </p><h2>  A bit about batteries </h2><p>  Before answering the question of whether it is possible to charge an iPhone by charging from an iPad, you need to learn a little more about the properties of the battery in these devices.  From the time of the first phones, the material from which the batteries for smartphones and tablets are made has changed.  Batteries have become lighter and more practical. </p><p>  The Apple devices listed above use lithium-ion polymer batteries.  Due to the fact that lithium is one of the lightest metals, the battery is lightweight but practical. </p>

    <p>  Their main difference from nickel batteries is the ability to charge the battery at any time.  Also, owners of gadgets can not worry that incomplete charging can damage the battery and reduce its battery life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For the correct operation of the iPhone or iPad, the developers recommend once a month to fully charge the battery, and then completely discharge it.  This will help keep the electrons in motion. </p><h2>  Is it possible to charge an iPhone by charging from an iPad? </h2><p>  Owners of "apple" gadgets often lose the charger from a smartphone or tablet.  After that, by all means, they try to find out whether it is possible to charge an iPhone by charging from an iPad, and vice versa. </p><p>  Someone believes that if you <span>charge the iPad with charging</span> from an iPhone, you can ruin the battery.  Someone sincerely believes that the <span>charger of</span> one gadget does not fit the parameters of others. </p><p>  It's time to dispel myths and find out the truth. </p><h2>  Pros of the solution </h2><p>  Owners of smartphones note that it is easy to charge an iPhone by charging from an iPad.  Original accessories and devices are perfectly matched to each other, and there are simply no problems connecting. </p>

    <p>  The main advantage of this method, how to charge an iPhone from another ‚Äúapple‚Äù charge, is time saving.  In the charger, which is standard on the iPhone, a maximum of one ampere is output.  On charging from the iPad - two amperes.  Thus, the time to fully charge the battery will be reduced by half. </p><p>  Also, if you <span>charge the iPhone with charging</span> from the iPad, there will be no need to carry several chargers with you.  This plus will be appreciated by those who need to constantly carry a smartphone, tablet and laptop.  In the bag are several cables that are always confused. </p><p>  However, is it possible to <span>charge an iPad by charging an</span> iPhone, since this is a more powerful device?  Of course, it is possible, but it is worth noting that then the time of a full charge of the battery will increase significantly. </p><p>  Owners of smartphones do not need to worry that a more powerful iPad charger will harm the iPhone.  The maximum current specified in the application does not play a big role, since smartphones have built-in controllers that do not allow more power to pass through than the gadget requires. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  But are there any disadvantages to this charging method?  Users did not notice any special deviations in the autonomous operation of phones or tablets. </p>

    <p>  Most of the information on how to charge the iPhone and not violate the properties of the battery comes from the fact that in almost all modern smartphones, batteries do not differ in durability.  Owners by all means try to save them. </p><p>  So, there was information that if you charge the phone with charging from a tablet, then after a year the smartphone‚Äôs battery will become almost unusable.  However, they forget to mention that, one way or another, most of the owners of "apple" smartphones change batteries after a year. </p><p>  Thus, significant disadvantages from such a charge is not observed. </p><h2>  Information from official sources </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, only the manufacturer will give the most complete information about whether it is possible to charge an iPhone by charging from an iPad. </p><p>  The support service on the official website reported that a charger with a USB interface usually comes with iPads.  The same adapter is great for iPhone and iPod. </p>

    <p>  Apple employees did not add anything about the disadvantages of this kind of charging. </p><h2>  Are other <span>devices suitable for charging</span> gadgets? </h2><p>  Many owners of mobile devices at some point ask: ‚ÄúIs it possible to charge an iPhone by charging from an iPad, as well as from a computer through a cable?‚Äù </p><p>  You can charge the gadgets of this company through USB, connected to a computer or laptop.  But first you need to figure out which ports were built into the PC.  Modern personal computers are equipped with three types of USB-ports: 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. </p><p>  The maximum current in the first two forms reaches a value of five hundred milliamps or two and a half watts.  Ports of the latest generation give up to nine hundred milliamps or five watts.  The charging time for iPhones and iPads will vary depending on the battery size and type of port. </p>

    <p>  USB ports of the first and second generation give out almost two times less power, which means that the charging time will be almost two times longer than when using the third generation ports. </p><p>  Distinguishing a third-generation port from the rest is very simple - it is blue. </p><p>  Charging the "apple" gadgets, it turns out, is very simple.  You can use both original accessories and a standard USB cable connected to a personal computer. </p>
