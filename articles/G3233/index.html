But the birth of a baby makes adjustments to the usual way of life.  In the summer I want to pack my backpacks, take a tent, fill the tank of a car to the eyeballs, and give up somewhere to rest.  In the same Crimea, for example.  But how to go to the sea in a car with a crumb, which has not yet turned a year old?  Let's not forget that most fears and stereotypes are born in the heads of people who haven‚Äôt traveled anywhere.  Of course, there are also some nuances that you need to know in order to plan your route and take everything you need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="At sea by car with a child" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/253376.jpg" width="400"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  So, the first stereotype: a trip to the sea by car will completely violate the routine, which will negatively affect the health of the baby.  Say, you can‚Äôt sleep in the child seat, and the child will also be anxious in the new place.  Of course, you need to provide some corrections to the normal routine of the day.  You should not take the child in the car at night.  But for a tired driver, night driving can end sadly.  It‚Äôs better to trace your route and outline night stops in it.  When traveling with a child, it is better to reserve not hotels (which are often expensive with us), but apartments.  There you will have the opportunity to not only redeem the baby, but also prepare him hot food. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The stereotype of the second: when traveling by car with a child at sea, you expose him to the risk of disease due to a sharp change in climatic zones.  This fear has ground.  Departing "to the south", provide for sun curtains in the car, stock up on reliable baby tanning cream, and also take panamos and warm clothes with you.  But communication with nature has a much more positive effect on a fragile organism than sitting in a city apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Go to the sea by car" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/253378.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The third stereotype: viruses, bacteria and unsanitary conditions, inevitable on a long journey.  If you run the risk of traveling to the city center in a crowded subway car or minibus, you can safely go to the sea by car with a child.  The hygiene problem can be solved by a small canister of water, which you wisely put in the trunk, and several packs of antibacterial wipes.  Of course, do not forget to take the first-aid kit, in which there will be tablets against motion sickness. </p>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Travel to the sea by car" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/253380.jpg" width="467"></div>  The fourth stereotype: unusual food can provoke indigestion in the crumbs.  On a trip to the sea by car with a child, you need to take the food that the baby loves.  However, these should not be perishable products.  The routes to the Crimea or the Caucasus do not go through deserted places - there is always the opportunity to stop and buy something fresh.  Eating in roadside taverns is also not always something terrible.  In the evening, when you reach the apartment or spend the night in a tent, you can cook his usual food for the little traveler.  Fresh air fuels your appetite.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Fifth stereotype: the child will have nothing to do, and he will become capricious.  Yes, young children want to run, they do not see anything interesting in flickering trees outside the window.  Then, going to the sea by car with a child, you need to take some of his favorite toys on the road, as well as buy new ones, but for the time being do not show them.  Pull out one at a time and enjoy the ride, while the child will consider new fun, disassemble it, etc.  To prevent the child from boredom playing with the handles on the passenger door, provide the baby control mode in the car. </p>
