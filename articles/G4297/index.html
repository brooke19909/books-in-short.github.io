Undoubtedly, in the twentieth century Adolf Hitler ‚Äúdistinguished himself‚Äù the most, who involved dozens of countries in a world-wide war and killed millions of people.  But there was another man whose cruelty could be compared with the ruthlessness of the Fuhrer.  His name was Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

    <p>  Every person who is at least a little interested in history knows that the secretary general has taken a pseudonym to appear even more formidable.  And what is Stalin's real name?  To do this, you need to turn to biographers and classified works of the Kremlin archivers. </p><p>  In December 1878, or in the last month of 1879, a man was born who radically changed history.  The real name of Stalin, born in the Georgian town of Gori, is Dzhugashvili.  The greatest tyrant in the world came from a poor family of ordinary people.  The boy's father was a shoemaker, and his mother worked as a cleaner for the count.  It is possible that the Russified Pole Nikolai Mikhailovich Przhevalsky - a famous explorer and traveler - was the real father of the future Secretary General. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Comrade Generalissimo (the highest military rank, which he personally appropriated to himself) had several pseudonyms.  The most famous is Koba, who denoted the famous robber, the idol of young Soso.  But he went down in history under a different name.  Some researchers believe that Stalin's real name - Dzhugashvili - served as the basis for a new pseudonym.  After all, the word "juga" from the ancient Georgian language is translated as "steel". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the real surname of Stalin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/242845.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <p>  So, what is the last name of Stalin, found out.  It remains only to slightly open the veil over his biography and many white spots in it.  Little Soso‚Äôs childhood was difficult: his father drank and often beat his wife and child.  The boy had severe physical injuries that could cause him <span>an inferiority complex.</span>  Having matured, Stalin entered the theological seminary in Tiflis (that is, in Tbilisi).  However, he <span>did not finish it,</span> because he became interested in revolutionary ideas and began to take an active part in the affairs of the Bolshevik party. </p>

    <p>  After the death of the leader of the proletariat of Lenin, it was Stalin who began to lead the new big country.  It was he who, having eliminated the main rivals, introduced the Soviet Union into a new era - the era of brutal terror, genocide and famine.  He carried out regular purges in the party apparatus, strengthened the power of the Cheka, intended to divide the territory of Poland with Germany (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact).  However, a war began, which again changed the map of Europe. </p><p>  The father of all nations, as they called Joseph Dzhugashvili (Stalin's real name), was quite callous, according to the recollections of his childhood friends.  He was vindictive, vindictive, envious of those who had a higher position in society.  His death is also shrouded in riddles, but many historians agree that Stalin was killed by his comrades-in-arms.  Some believe that for a long time the Soviet people were doubles of the leader, of whom he had several. </p><p>  The real name of Stalin today is no secret to anyone.  This man left behind so many tears that they could drown the whole earth. </p>
