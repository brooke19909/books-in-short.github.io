People used to dry clothes on the street or on the balcony.  I had to choose a sunny day, constantly make sure that it did not rain.  And with the advent of such units, you no longer have to worry about where to dry your clothes.  A clever technique will do all the manipulations itself, so the owner will only have to iron and put on clean things. </p><p>  The drying function, as a rule, is built-in, but if it is not available, you can purchase a separate machine from the same company.  Its direct purpose is to dry wet laundry up to 10 kg.  In some models of washing machines, there is a cooling option that does not allow things to wrinkle strongly. </p><p>  You should pay attention to what material the drum is made of.  In order to prevent corrosion, manufacturers make this part from stainless steel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washer dryer" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1086934.jpg" width="436"></div>

    <h2>  Famous models of machines with dryer from LG </h2><p>  At the moment, the most famous washing machine is LG F1496AD3.  Along with this model, LG F1480RDS and LG F12A8CDP are among the leaders.  Their average cost is about 1-2 thousand dollars. </p><h2>  How to choose a car from LG </h2><p>  Before you go to the immediate choice, you need to decide on the maximum capacity.  If the family is large, then 8 kg will be enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second question that needs to be paid attention is which method of loading laundry is preferable: frontal or vertical.  Both have their advantages.  If the LG washing machine is installed in the kitchen, it is logical that the hostess will use its upper part as a work surface.  In this case, it is necessary to choose a model with a window (front type).  For those rooms that do not have a large amount of free space, a machine with a vertical loading method is suitable.  As a rule, such models are small in size. </p><p>  When the time comes to consider the functionality, you need to pay attention to the option "Smoothing".  When it exists, clothes during drying and washing themselves are not deformed and will not rumple.  In principle, it is not necessary to include this program, but if any thing can stretch out or it will then be difficult to look like an iron, it is recommended to use this function nevertheless.  If the family has children, you can pay attention to models that have the option "ironing baby clothes." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine lg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1086939.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about typewriters LG </h2><p>  The LG washer-dryer is appreciated by customers for its advanced functionality, careful features and low power consumption.  There are more budget options for the device.  If you look correctly, you can find those that cost no more than 700 dollars.  Moreover, judging by the comments, their functions do not differ from models for 1 thousand.  The washing quality is impressive.  All modes work properly and do not require special attention - to understand everything easily.  For half an hour, a washing machine with dryer is able to do its job in quick mode.  In the usual - an hour and a half.  The device breaks quite rarely, and if there is a need for this, it will be inexpensive to purchase components.  Repair in the service center will also not require a lot of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine samsung" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1086945.jpg" width="500"></div>

Samsung Yukon is made in red, which cannot but surprise.  The forms of the device also attract the eye - they are smooth and charismatic.  But the Samsung washing machine deserves respect not only for its modern appearance. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the <span>inverter motor is</span> installed in the device <span>,</span> which is characterized by durability and efficient operation.  And this is not a joke, because the manufacturer officially gives a guarantee for 10 years.  In addition, the Koreans decided to improve the systems of the unit, adding to it an automatic balancing system.  Thanks to her, the Samsung washing machine does not make too much noise and vibration.  Another technology of the developers allows you to create air bubbles, which subsequently penetrate the tissue faster and evenly distributed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indesit washing machine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1086932.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Cars from Indesit and Zanussi </h2><p>  The two companies represented are not interconnected, but both are of Italian origin.  They are united by many things.  For example, both manufacturers do not inflate prices, which means that the line has a lot of budget models.  The Indesit washing machine does not have a display, only mechanical buttons.  However, the functionality of the technique is very diverse;  Several rotary controls are installed.  A competitor company has a slightly better appearance - there is a screen, but it was deprived of its size.  Some buttons are backlit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine bosh" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1086941.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Indesit IWDC 6105 </h2><p>  In more detail, you should consider the good budget option Indesit IWDC 6105. You should not pay attention to the plain appearance - the functionality pays for everything.  The Indesit washing machine is capable of washing in several modes, has the option of drying and surprisingly mute provides clothes after the washing process.  Not all even expensive appliances have a snooze timer.  He is at IWDC.  It is possible to set the wash after 3, 6 or 9 hours from the start of the program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vertical washing machine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1086943.jpg" width="365"></div>

    <h2>  Bosch WVD24460OE </h2><p>  This model is a Bosch washing machine, which is recognized as one of the best from this manufacturer.  Outwardly, it is no different from standard appliances: stylishly, strictly and ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù expressively.  In fact, this option is made in a minimalist design.  The display is relatively small, has touch buttons silver.  Anyone who has never dealt with such an option can be transported for a long time with a click.  The buttons look classically, however, being touch-sensitive, they do not tolerate rude treatment of themselves - they do not respond to touch.  It should take some time to get used to the gentle pressing.  The text on the screen is backlit.  This is what brings to life the boring and monotonous interior of the car. </p><p>  The washing quality is top notch.  It may seem strange that she does not weigh and diagnose the received laundry, but immediately starts working.  The software embedded in the appliance has great functionality, so there will be no problems with choosing a washing mode.  An amazing option seems to be ‚ÄúNight Mode‚Äù.  When the function is on, the technician will not consume a lot of electricity, and will not make too much noise, including the sound notification being turned off.  The drum has modern technology, with the help of which laundry gets wet faster and is better washed. </p><h2>  Narrow vertical washing machine </h2><p>  Unfortunately, a vertical washing machine with dryer is now so rare that it is almost impossible to find.  Ariston company is releasing such an option stably.  Her models cannot determine the weight of the laundry, so she will have to arm herself with weights so as not to outweigh the permissible size.  The device is able to wash ordinary wool and silk items perfectly, it will wash children's clothes until the trace of powder disappears.  There is no ironing function, but this technique may not crumple them.  The functionality of the machine is rather stingy, but if you compare it with many options without drying from well-known companies, models from Ariston win the competition.  This is becoming clear from the reviews of people.  Many people like that the device does not require large electrical costs.  And for those who are not particularly moody about washing, Ariston models are ideal.  The main advantage is the compactness of technology.  The washing machines are quite narrow, which is why they are perfect for small bathrooms.  During spinning and drying, the equipment does not make excessive noise and does not jump on the floor, which is very good.  Not all expensive options boast perfect washing resistance. </p>
