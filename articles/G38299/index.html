Its total area is about sixty hectares.  Its creation was timed to the centennial of the founder of the Soviet state, and the park was called accordingly.  In 1991, it ceased to be a Lenin Park and has since bears its current name.  This place on the outskirts of the city in former times was very swampy, and in order to create a park zone in this territory, a large amount of reclamation work had to be done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south seaside park" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/295455.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  <strong>What is the South Seaside Park at present?</strong> </p><p>  St. Petersburg, rich in landscape gardening ensembles, has extensive experience in architectural and planning work in this area.  According to the original plan of its <span>creators, South Primorsky Park</span> was to organically combine different stylistic traditions of landscape design in its composition.  In the southern part of the massif, the layout was supposed to have a regular, more geometric character.  And in the northern part, where there was recently a swamp, the landscape was supposed to be stylized in the style of an English natural park.  The basis of the park is made up of deciduous trees - lindens, oaks, elms, chestnuts, <span>weeping willows.</span>  However, fir and spruce are found in considerable numbers.  The water component was included in the landscape as a significant component.  These are two small ponds with islands, they are interconnected by a canal.  In general, the designers thought up the entire landscape complex that makes up the South Seaside Park.  Photographs taken from great heights make sure the layout is organic.  The unity of the overall composition was to be ensured by the central alley going towards the Gulf of Finland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south seaside park photo" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/295454.jpg" width="492"></div>  The initial plan was not fully implemented.  This is due to the intensive growth of the city.  Plots of land overlooking the water surface of the Gulf of Finland have become highly quoted in the housing market.  Therefore, the further direction of development of this territory remains in question.  What will be the South Seaside Park in the near future is still unclear.  Currently, the administration of Krasnoselsky district is considering several options for using the free space of this citywide <span>recreational zone.</span>  Unfortunately, it should be noted that none of them portends anything good for the park territory that has already been formed over the past half century.  These projects are mainly aimed at making a profit.  The public of the <span>Krasnoselsky district is</span> trying to object to the intentions of the administration. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south seaside park how to get there" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/295453.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <p>  <strong>South Seaside Park: how to get there</strong> </p><p>  The transport connection with this, already ceased to be suburban, district of the city is quite stable.  There are several ways to get to the park.  From the Kirovsky Zavod metro station, you can get here in 20 minutes by bus 111 of the route.  With the same success, this can be done on trams 36, 41, 60, or on a minibus 87 and 142, which depart in the direction of the park from the Leninsky Prospekt metro station. </p>
