  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mozhaysk. Mozhaisk Reservoir</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mozhaysk is a small city of the Russian Federation located in the Moscow region.  It is home to a little more than 30 thousand people.  The city was first mentioned in 1231, then it was the capital of the specific principality. </p><p>  Mozhaysk is located in the Gzhat depression of the Moscow Upland, on the very bank of the Moscow river.  To the center of the capital of Russia - 106 kilometers, and to the Moscow Ring Road - 90 km.  Not far from the city (4 km) is the Mozhaisk reservoir. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The reservoir is artificial and the largest in the entire Moscow region.  The reservoir was completely flooded in 1962, located slightly above the city of Mozhaisk.  The reservoir includes a hydroelectric power station and a dam with a length of 900 meters. </p><p>  The reservoir was formed due to the closure of the Moscow River by a dam in the vicinity of the village of Marfin Brod.  It is a channel body of water.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water area is 3.4 thousand hectares.  The average depth varies from 5 to 10 meters, however, in the vicinity of the dam, the depth of the Mozhaisk reservoir is 30 meters. </p><p>  In the upper part, the reservoir narrows and the water there is covered with vegetation. </p><p>  Ice appears in mid-November and melts in April.  Due to height differences (from 4 to 8 meters) and the presence of stretches in the reservoir, a large dispersal of the wave is often observed. </p><p>  To date, the reservoir is not used for shipping, although previously in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Marfin Brod was carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greenga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reservoir shore" class="if uuid-2363865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2363865.jpg"></div><h2>  Ichthyofauna </h2><p>  The fishermen of Mozhaisk and the surrounding settlements are well aware of the Mozhaisk reservoir and love it for the opportunity to return home with a good catch.  Shores are represented by multiple bays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the reservoir, fish species prevail, characteristic of all ponds near Moscow, namely: </p><ul><li>  bream; </li><li>  acne; </li><li>  chub; </li><li>  pike; </li><li>  roach; </li><li>  ide; </li><li>  bleak; </li><li>  asp; </li><li>  perch; </li><li>  dace, only about 30 species. </li></ul><p>  The catch is regularly monitored on the territory of the reservoir.  On a regular basis, the lake is replenished with fry, mainly zander and pike.  The <span>fish shop</span> (Glazovo), which belongs to the <span>fish</span> inspection, is engaged in stocking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="idlersquest.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big bream" class="if uuid-2363869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2363869.jpg"></div><h2>  Surrounding infrastructure </h2><p>  Even before its full filling, the Mozhaisk reservoir was assigned to the society of fishers and hunters (Moscow).  Today, recreational and sport fishing is carried out on the lake.  Several bases have been created that are also involved in stocking and infrastructure development. </p><ul><li>  "Krasnovidovo."  The base is located 1 kilometer from the village of the same name, on a promontory protruding into the waters of the lake, surrounded by a birch grove.  There is a hotel here, ready to receive 80 guests at a time.  Available 150 boats.  You can get here from Moscow by train, from the Belorussky railway station to the city of Mozhaysk.  Then transfer to the bus and get to the Krasnovidovo stop.  And then only on foot, about 1.5 kilometers. </li><li>  Glazovo.  This is a small sports and fishing base on the Mozhaisk reservoir (left bank).  There are only 12 places to relax and 30 boats.  Get the same as in Krasnovidovo, but get off at the Glazovo stop, then walk about 500 meters. </li><li>  Myshkino.  The base also has 12 berths and 30 boats.  The route is the same as the previous two bases, but you need to get off at the Myshkino stop, to the base about 1,000 meters on foot. </li><li>  "Trinity".  The base is located on the right bank of the lake.  Only 10 lounges and 15 boats are available.  From the city of Mozhaysk you need to take a bus, next to the village of Bobynino, get off at the Trinity stop. </li></ul><p>  It should be remembered that all these bases during the period from November to December are exclusively hunters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the Mozhaisk Reservoir, the base at the TsOMO and the "Athlete Fisherman" (the village of Staroe Selo) also operate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.simfisch.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fish perch" class="if uuid-2363854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2363854.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishing in winter </h2><p>  Mozhaisk reservoir even in the cold season attracts fishermen.  In winter, you can catch white fish and predatory species.  Pike perch appears in places where bream passes - both in summer and in winter.  Here you can catch a burbot, but not very large.  In winter, it is better to catch pike perch on artificial baits, it can be a balancer or a vertical bait. </p><p>  To catch pike you will need a ventilator.  It is recommended to bring tents with you to catch the bream at night.  To catch this fish, you can use an ordinary winter fishing rod, a hook (dark color) with a dozen moths and a weight. </p><p>  Between the village of Ilyinskoye and Myshkino in winter you can catch a fairly large amount of roach.  It is better to come to Myshkino when the last ice begins, then in these places there is a huge amount of large bream. </p><p>  According to experienced reviews, in these places they rarely check trips, but when fishing without documents, the fisherman acts completely at his own peril and risk. </p><p>  In the Krasnovidovo district in winter you can catch a good perch, up to 1.5 kilograms.  Pike and bream go well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="christianregency.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter fishing" class="if uuid-2363857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2363857.jpg"></div><p>  The main thing is not to forget that fishing on the lake is possible only with a ticket purchased at fishing bases or in a specialized store in the city of Mozhaysk. </p><h2>  Summer rest </h2><p>  When the heat and the local beaches are full in the capital, you can go to the reservoir, where there are conditions not only for fishermen and hunters, but also for lovers of relaxation in beautiful nature.  On the shores of the lake there are many hotel complexes where you can spend a weekend and even a whole vacation without leaving far from the capital. </p><h2>  The best recreation centers </h2><p>  The recreation center "Calypso" (Mozhaisk).
