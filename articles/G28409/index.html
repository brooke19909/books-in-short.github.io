It was built back in 1974, but reconstruction was carried out in 2007, so the hotel is modern and original.  It is notable for its art deco style, which also used Italian elements.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In Electra Palace Rhodes 5 * (Rhodes) there are three magnificent restaurants that treat their guests with delicious and fresh dishes.  All the people who have been here assure: the food is really excellent.  There are Greek, Chinese and Italian restaurants. </p><p>  Guests say that everything is very diverse.  They serve seafood, mussels, shell snails, meat, fish, poultry, delicious desserts and even a <span>milk pig.</span>  There are goat cheeses, natural yogurts, juicy fruits.  For breakfast, hot omelettes, fried eggs, pancakes are always served (all this is cooked directly by visitors).  If you do not want this, you can taste fried bacon, cottage cheese, potatoes or cereal with milk, washed down with delicious juice.  They also serve stewed and fresh vegetables (but already for lunch), delicious rice, salads.  You can taste grilled dishes, barbecue, shrimp and even octopus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also soups.  Baking, cakes, desserts - all this is offered in large quantities.  And a lot of delicious ice cream.  The only caveat - coffee with tea is served only for breakfast.  But it is in a restaurant.  In bars, these drinks are served throughout the day.  By the way, even in unlimited quantities, guests can drink red and white wine, as well as beer.

    <h2>  Classic economist </h2><p>  This is the first category of rooms that I would like to touch upon.  In Electra Palace Rhodes Resort 5 * they are quite popular.  Largely due to its relatively low price. </p><p>  The room is 25 square meters.  There are two single beds next to each other.  There is a plasma TV with satellite channels, a balcony, and also such trifles as a radio, telephone, air conditioning, safe.  It is possible to connect heating.  The spacious, clean and bright bathroom has a bathtub with shower, hairdryer, bathrobes with slippers for each guest, as well as small hygiene kits with French cosmetics: shower gels, body lotions, shampoos, razors, and liquid soap.  There is also a fridge and an electric kettle. </p><p>  A week of living in such apartments for two will cost about 35-38 thousand rubles (with half board).  However, prices often differ.  Depending on the season.  Sometimes you can save 20-30%.  It is worth knowing about it. </p><p>  By the way, apartments with sea views will cost about 47 thousand rubles.  These rooms besides the landscape opening from a balcony can brag of even more magnificent interior. </p>

    <h2>  For three </h2><p>  The hotel also has different 2-bed apartments (superior, with different views, etc.), but it‚Äôs better to talk in more detail about those rooms that are designed for three people.  Their area is slightly larger - 28 square meters.  In addition to two single beds, folding sofas are also installed in the rooms.  The conditions are the same as in the above apartments.  But for three people the room will cost 70,000 rubles (half board included).  This is the price of apartments with a pool visible from the balcony.  For an option with a sea view, you will need to overpay about 5,000 rubles. </p><p>  By the way, when creating a reservation request, you should definitely indicate in the additional wishes section information about what exactly the guests want to watch from their window.  Even if guests initially reserve a room with a sea view.  Better to clarify. </p><h2>  Junior Suites </h2><p>  This category of apartments in Electra Palace Rhodes (Greece) is also popular.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese rooms is 35 square meters.  m. Inside there are two single beds and the same number of folding sofas.  The space, by the way, is divided into living and sleeping areas.  There are coffee and tea making facilities, a DVD player, a plasma, a bathroom, and bathrobes with slippers for all guests.  Otherwise, everything is the same as in other apartments. </p><p>  About 108,000 rubles will have to be paid to four guests per week of stay (with half board).  But this is if you want a room with a view of the garden.  Apartments with a balcony overlooking the pool and the sea are 5,000 more expensive. </p>

    <h2>  Suites </h2><p>  Hotel Electra Palace Rhodes received extremely positive reviews.  And the comments left by people who were here, prompt many others to visit this place.  Many go on vacation with large companies.  Spacious suites are created for such guests. </p><p>  Their area is 38 square meters.  m. Four sleeping places, a bathroom - all the same as in the previously mentioned rooms.  Here are just two apartments in the apartment, separated by doors.  This creates a certain privacy.  Convenient, especially for companies that travel in pairs.  The cost of apartments with garden views is 120,000 rubles for four per week (half board is included). </p><p>  Lastly, a few words about the so-called deluxe suites.  These are numbers located near the sea.  Their area is 55 square meters.  m. And they cost 150 thousand rubles a week.  However, living in such apartments is a real pleasure.  And as you know, you have to pay for it. </p>

    <h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  People who have already been to the Electra Palace Rhodes 5 * leave reviews mostly positive.  As the guests say, this is an ideal hotel for youth recreation.  Here you can do water sports, see interesting sights, take a walk.  The sea is exciting, the winds are strong, therefore people with children should not go here.  But on the beach there are free umbrellas with sun loungers, which is quite convenient. </p><p>  They note the level of staff training.  All are polite, courteous, and there are also Russian-speaking workers who are always ready to help or suggest something. </p><p>  The area is very clean.  It‚Äôs nice to stay at the hotel, I don‚Äôt even want to leave - as many say.  Most recommend a hotel for people who want to get the most out of their vacation and enjoy a high level of service.  They assure: there is no need to regret the choice. </p>
