    <h2>  More Swedish than Finnish </h2><p>  Although this may seem strange to many people, Finland (√Öland Islands) has its own special culture.  As well as Swedish dialects, flag and postage stamps.  Travelers are very surprised why there is more Swedish speech than Finnish. </p><h2>  Finland, Aland Islands: climate and popularity </h2><p>  The climate of these islands is quite mild.  It is ideal for escape from the hot summer.  The reviews of many visitors to the archipelago prove the surprisingness, originality and unusualness of the islands.  They cannot be confused with other similar places in the world. </p><p>  The √Öland Islands became more popular after a group of divers found a treasure here in the summer of 2010: 160 bottles of the best champagne on a bicentennial ship.  Believe it or not, the champagne bottles turned out to be drinkable and were sold at a huge price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to stay for a holiday in the √Öland Islands </h2><p>  Do not worry about where to stay when you arrive in the √Öland Islands (Finland).

    <h2>  Fishing on the √Öland Islands in Finland </h2><p>  Want to visit Aland Islands, Finland?  Fishing is unforgettable here, but a hobby is not for everyone.  And not at all because of the long road or the high cost of such leisure.  It‚Äôs just that the nature is rather harsh, and even the continental Finns call the locals a little peculiar.  Only those who truly love sport fishing will appreciate the islands of the archipelago. </p><p>  On the √Öland Islands it is forbidden to fish using nets; you cannot fish on the track yourself.  It‚Äôs better not to mention such barbaric methods as dynamite!  Only sport spinning is allowed.  By the way, with this method, there are great chances to get a real trophy - a huge <span>pike</span> or salmon.  Locals call the pike here ‚Äúthe √Öland crocodile‚Äù, which concerns not only the size, but also the nature of the fish in Aland. </p><h2>  Fishing restrictions </h2><p>  For those who want to engage in fishing with the help of a track (trolling), it is necessary to use the services of a local guide, as only residents of √Öland can get the necessary license for such fishing.  There are also some limitations. </p><p>  For example, it is forbidden to fish from the coast during the nesting period of birds, so as not to destroy the nests and not disturb the chicks.  This period begins in mid-April and ends in mid-June.  In addition, during <span>spawning of pike perch</span> (in June) and pike (from May to June), fishing of these species of fish on the √Öland Islands is prohibited. </p><p>  There are a number of restrictions on the size of the fish: in case of a smaller catch, you will have to send it back to the sea.  So, it is allowed to catch pike from 55 cm long, salmon from 50 cm, and pike perch from 37 cm. </p><p>  On the √Öland Islands, there are restrictions not only in size, but also in the total number of fish caught.  By the way, these rules vary in each of the municipalities of √Öland, so such information should be obtained from the owner of the cottage or hotel. </p><h2>  Family fishing in the √Öland Islands </h2><p>  Of course, unsurpassed nature leads to fishing with entire families, sometimes with small children.  In the case of traveling with the latter, you need to carefully select your accommodation, and all because a lot of cottages are located on sharp rocks, and on the Alands there are cliffs.  Naturally, a special and convenient descent is equipped to the shore, but for small children this can be problematic, and even dangerous.  Therefore, when booking a particular housing option, this factor must be taken into account.  Be sure to indicate the presence of children and their age. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aland Islands, Finland, attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/991510.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restaurants and Cuisine of the √Öland Islands </h2><p>  Reviews from experienced travelers talk about the amazing local cuisine in the √Öland Islands.  Therefore, when you return home, one of the first things that you decide to tell your friends about is the culinary experience. </p><p>  On the islands there are a lot of fabulous restaurants with Swedish and <span>Finnish cuisine,</span> as well as international dishes.  Although it is quite difficult to imagine a person who would prefer something else when there are tasty and mouth-watering Scandinavian dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aland Islands, Finland, reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/991507.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pleasant parting words </h2><p>  Here you need to enjoy every moment, because it is unlikely that in the busy atmosphere of a crowded city there is such fresh air and breathtaking landscapes.  An extreme trip through the forest and meadows, cycling along winding paths, surfing the waves, a children's kayak or diving to the ships well-preserved after the crash is what you need, isn't it? </p><p>  And a little secret especially for you: in the middle of summer, the sun rises here at 3:30 in the morning and does not leave the island until 10 in the evening.  Catch this fabulous moment, catch your sun, catch your "white nights" on the √Öland Islands! </p>
