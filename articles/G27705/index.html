One of the most famous in the capital is Venice Square.  The Romans do not really love her due to the fact that she is overloaded with a large number of monuments, but from here the most fascinating excursions around the city begin. </p><h2>  Venetian Square - a historical monument of the city </h2><p>  Venice Square in Rome, a photo of which can often be seen on tour booklets, can be considered the heart of the capital.  It is located near Capitol Hill and the Roman Forum and has been around for centuries.  During this time, it was rebuilt several times, and took on its current appearance in the 20th century.  The square got its name thanks to the Palace of Venice, built in the middle of the 15th century by decree of Cardinal Pietro Barbo, elected after 6 years by Pope Paul II. </p>

    <p>  Tourists are attracted by Venice Square in Rome.  Attractions have been preserved here since the time of the <span>Roman Empire.</span>  There is an observation deck on the square.  It offers a panorama of the Eternal City.  The buildings are museums with unique exhibits telling about the history of Rome.  In addition to sightseeing in the square, you can ride on an elegant horse-drawn carriage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  St. Mark's Basilica - Ancient Landmark of Rome </h2><p>  The fame of Venice in Rome is due not only to the beautiful panorama of the capital.  In 2009, during the construction of the metro on Piazza Venezia, the walls of the ancient Athenium, an educational institution in Ancient Rome, built in the II century, which were later destroyed, were discovered.  According to reports, the apostle Mark spent several nights in this building.  It was here that he wrote his famous gospel. </p>

    <p>  In 336, a basilica was built on the site of the destroyed building, which was named Saint Mark in honor of the apostle.  Since the city lacked building material, bricks from the ruins of the Colosseum were used to erect the building, and later they were replaced with marble.  For centuries, the building suffered from fires and earthquakes and was rebuilt several times. </p><p>  It took the modern look of <span>St.</span> Mark <span>'s</span> Basilica in the 15th century during the construction of the Venice Palace.  To fit into the architectural ensemble of the palace, its facade was rebuilt in the Renaissance style.  The ceiling of the three-nave church is decorated with a coffered ceiling with the coat of arms of Paul II.  Inside there is a mosaic depicting Jesus.  The basilica houses the relics of Pope Mark, and one of the columns is decorated with a bowl for holy water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Altar of the Fatherland, or Vittoriano </h2><p>  Venice Square in Rome suffered many reconstructions.  The last large-scale restructuring began at the end of the XIX and ended at the beginning of the XX century.  Old buildings were demolished, and instead a monument dedicated to Victor Emmanuel II (Vittoriano), which united the country into one state, was erected.  The construction of the monument lasted 26 years and was completed in 1911.  After 16 years, a <span>monument to the Unknown Soldier who</span> died in the First World War was attached to him.  Later, some bronze details were added to the monument, after which its final opening took place in 1935.  The composition was called "Altar of the Fatherland". </p>

    <p>  In the center of the monument is a 20-meter statue of <span>Victor Emmanuel II.</span>  A gallery of columns in the neoclassical style was built at the back, they are covered with a magnificent architrave from above - a system of beams and beams resting on the columns.  There are porticoes on the sides of the gallery, and sculptures of the goddess Nika on a chariot are installed on their roof.  Below are two fountains built, symbolizing the seas that wash the shores of Italy.  The first fountain is decorated with a statue of a lion - a symbol of the Apostle Mark, on the second there is a statue of a siren - a symbol of the city of Naples.  You can climb to the monument along a wide staircase decorated with bas-reliefs. </p><h2>  History of the Venetian Palace </h2><p>  Palace in Venice Square in Rome <strong> </strong>  built in the XV century.  Its history is connected with the Apostle Mark, who was the patron saint of Venice.  When the decision was made to create a palace complex, the Basilica of St. Mark was to enter it. </p><p>  The Venetian palace is built of dark brick in the style of the early Renaissance.  The building of strict architectural form is decorated with forked battlements along the roof and windows made of white marble.  A feature of the building is the asymmetrical position of the windows.  The different distances are explained by the fact that in the Middle Ages they were so protected from evil spirits that penetrated symmetrically through window openings. </p>
