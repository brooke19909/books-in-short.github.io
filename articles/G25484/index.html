Recently, capital investments in defense have been made, the salary of the military has been increasing, and the attractiveness of the service has grown significantly.  The surge in patriotic unrest was also caused by the events in Ukraine that unfolded in 2014. </p>

    <p>  Our army is armed quite well, given the fact that Russia has the most weapons of mass destruction in the world, including nuclear weapons.  Such maintenance requires a lot of expenses, which grow by 1.2-2% every year.  About a third of the total national budget goes to general military needs.  So what figures calculate the current level of salaries of military personnel? </p><h2>  What does a salary consist of? </h2><p>  The military salary consists of a salary and various bonuses, and there are a number of indicators that affect the minimum level of monetary allowance: </p><ul><li>  occupied military position; </li><li>  personal achievements and merits; </li><li>  length of service; </li><li>  duration and conditions of military service; </li><li>  place and time of passage (peace time, "hot spot"); </li><li>  qualifications and tasks; </li><li>  available military ranks. </li></ul><p>  In many post-Soviet states, it is precisely the list of these main factors that affects the size of the military salary.  Additional monetary compensation may be accrued for knowledge of foreign languages, a high level of physical fitness, the presence of a higher education, absence or competent exit from emergency situations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  By the way, the welfare of people in uniform today is at a decent level.  The average salary of the military of the Russian Federation last year amounted to 62,000 rubles, which is 2 times more than the <span>average monthly income of a</span> Russian. </p><p>  You can conditionally understand the monetary allowance using the table below.  Conditionally, because the earnings of each soldier are affected by several indicators. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  Salary table for military rank and position </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Military rank, position </td><td>  Salary according to military position </td><td>  Salary according to military rank </td><td>  Average monthly charge including all surcharges </td></tr><tr><td>  Lieutenant (platoon commander) </td><td>  7000 </td><td>  12,442 </td><td>  50,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Captain (company commander) </td><td>  7 900 </td><td>  13 970 </td><td>  52,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Major (deputy battalion commander) </td><td>  8 490 </td><td>  14,760 </td><td>  55,600 </td></tr><tr><td>  Lieutenant Colonel (battalion commander) </td><td>  9 100 </td><td>  15,529 </td><td>  60,281 </td></tr><tr><td>  Colonel (regiment commander) </td><td>  9670 </td><td>  17,500 </td><td>  70 320 </td></tr><tr><td>  Major General (Brigade Commander) </td><td>  10 896 </td><td>  18 630 </td><td>  74,000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Lieutenant General (Army Commander) </td><td>  11 500 </td><td>  29 354 </td><td>  117,000 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  According to the new law, the lieutenant’s salary without additional charges should be 50,000 rubles, with allowances — 80,000 rubles.  For many, these figures seem modest enough for people with such a responsibility on their shoulders - to defend their homeland.  But if we take into account that until 2012 the average salary of a lieutenant was 14,000, then you can notice a significant improvement in the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What awaits in the future? </h2><p>  Each state understands the importance of having a well-equipped and motivated army, increasing its combat effectiveness and the level of professionalism of employees, as well as the importance of creating good conditions for them.  All efforts and resources are urgently invested in the development of the production of defense equipment in order to replace previously delivered supplies from other states that have applied sanctions to Russia. </p>

    <p>  Due to the economic situation that has arisen, there is no need to talk about the prospects that the military will increase its salaries, but, despite this, indexation is carried out annually on the level of inflation for soldiers, officers and general staff. </p><h2>  What salaries do the military receive in Russia and other countries? </h2><p>  In the United States, the average monthly income of a general is 1.3 million rubles.  The maximum salary of a Russian colleague is 200,000 rubles.  It turns out that Russia spends up to 140 million rubles a month on its generals, which is 8.5 times less than in America.  An American private per month receives 120,000 rubles, taking into account all the premiums.  German soldier - 141,000 rubles, English - 125,000 rubles. </p><p>  In the CIS countries, things are even sadder than in Russia.  So, in Belarus, a lieutenant receives 6,550 rubles a month in Russian money, and a Ukrainian colleague - 15,000. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Military fees.  Salary </h2><p>  Participants in <span>military training</span> receive not only a monetary reward, according to the <span>military rank,</span> but also full food and clothing support.  All income (wages, scholarships, allowances, etc.) that could be received during the passage of fees are compensated. </p><p>  The fees relate to those who are in reserve and have already completed military service.  The participants in the training are also adult citizens who have been trained at the military department. </p><h2>  Bonuses and Additional Payments </h2><p>  Initially, it may seem that the military salary in Russia is completely nonexistent, but this is without allowances.  And these are quite serious additional payments, which may result in 50% of the salary.  Monthly financiers "plus" the monetary allowance of people in uniform of allowances, which can seriously differ from each other in amount.  For example, an ordinary <span>contract service</span> will receive a bonus in the amount of 100 rubles for the qualification, and the commander of an underwater missile carrier on the order of the Moscow Region No. 400 - 200,000 rubles. </p><p>  An employee in the army receives good housing bonuses, in the case of conscientious service, the contractor is given the right to purchase permanent housing with the help of a funded mortgage system.  If after 7-10 years a situation arises that you have to <span>quit military service, the</span> state will fully pay the balance of mortgage lending. </p><h2>  Military by contract.  Salary </h2><p>  Service in the ranks of the Russian army on a contract basis is a fairly popular phenomenon.  Contractors are voluntary members of the Armed Forces that carry out their activities on the basis of an agreement.  The main conditions are age restriction and conscientious performance of official duties.  The first contract is concluded under conditions if the citizen is at least 18 and no more than 40 years old.  It is expected that from 2017, soldiers under the age of 30 will be employed. </p><p>  In 2016, the amount of monetary allowance for contractors was established in accordance with two laws: </p><ol><li>  <span>Federal Law</span> of 07.11.2011 N 306- dated 04/06/2015 "On the monetary allowance of military personnel and the provision of separate payments to them." </li><li>  Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of 05.12.2011 N 992 (dated 08/06/2015) "On the establishment of salaries for the maintenance of military personnel under the contract." </li></ol><p>  According to these legislative documents, the salary of the military is made up of a salary for a military post and a salary for a military rank.  The total amount is supplemented by allowances and additional material assistance, paid annually for good service. </p><h2>  The average size of DD (cash allowance) </h2><ul><li>  Ordinary contractor - 30,000 rubles. </li><li>  Sergeant and foreman - 40,000 rubles. </li><li>  lieutenant - 55 000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Upon admission to military service under a contract, a soldier’s salary is: </p><ul><li>  in the ground forces - from 19,000 rubles; </li><li>  in the navy - from 22,000 rubles; </li><li>  in the military air services - from 20,000 rubles; </li><li>  in the navy on submarines - from 40,000 rubles. </li></ul>

By 2017, it is planned to double the number. </p><p>  Regardless of the size of the salary and position held, contract workers receive paid leave every year, taking into account <span>length of service</span> of 30 days or more. </p><h2>  Profession: Military Aviation Pilot </h2><p>  The work of a military pilot is very difficult and dangerous.  Moreover, as a rule, during military conflicts, the pilots are not captured, but destroyed.  The profession is considered unhealthy due to emotional overload.  Military aviation in Russia is given special attention, including material support and housing.  Fast career advancement and the same fast retirement. </p>

    <p>  The salary of a military pilot is not less than 100,000 rubles, this is in peacetime.  In addition, employees are provided with food, and the first are on the list for housing.  According to the latest data, the average pension for military pilots is 1.7 times that of civilians.  Pension payments are accrued in the amount of 55%, but not more than 80%. </p><h2>  Cash allowance for medical staff </h2><p>  There is such a profession as a military <span>doctor.</span>  <span>The salary</span> of doctors is seriously different from other specialists.  A military doctor is one of the most respected professions of the <span>Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.</span>  This person is exclusively with a higher medical education.  Only a junior officer can become a doctor in the army, warrant officers go in paramedics, privates in medics, sergeants in instructors.  But, unfortunately, this respect is not traced in the salary of military doctors. </p>

    <p>  Colonels, heads of departments, receive from 20,000 rubles.  The average allowance of lieutenants is 10,000 rubles a month. </p><h2>  Should salary increases be expected in 2017? </h2><p>  Will the military increase salaries and will indexing be carried out?  Federal Law No. 306 of 2011 states the need for annual indexation of wages, bonus payments, and cash allowances.  Indexing is expected to occur in February in February, based on price increases in 2016.  But it’s too early to talk about raising salaries, even despite the current law, especially in conditions of economic instability. </p><h2>  Indexing and Crisis </h2><p>  The crisis in our country today is really serious, every Russian citizen felt this.  This could not but affect the income of the population, which fell by 20%.  The increase in military salaries depends, as already mentioned, on the service life, current position, and military rank. </p><p>  Not so long ago, all those who were called up without fail were paid insignificant amounts of 500 rubles, today the figure has increased to 2000. Given that the soldiers are provided with food and housing, we can say that for a start the amount is quite reasonable.  An increase in cash allowance can be made only during indexation. </p><p>  Indexing for employees in the Armed Forces is scheduled for 2017 due to increased inflation.  Today, the average salary of the military is 30,000 rubles, but the government believes that it should grow to at least 50,000 rubles.  In 2016, indexation was also expected, but was never carried out. </p><h2>  Military pension </h2><p>  Military personnel tend to retire early.  Already at 40, you can count on retirement benefits, but on condition that the military continues to serve further.  To date, a bill has already been prepared to increase payments to pensioners by 7%.  This indicates the desire of the state to strengthen its army.  It is extremely important for Russia to have a powerful Armed Structure. </p>

    <p>  It is also planned to index pension payments by 3% to employees on vacation. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The annual increase in military salaries and the improvement of conditions are connected with the fact that recently Russia needs to strengthen its fighting positions.  And, as you know, for a long time, service in the ranks of the Russian army was unpromising and completely un prestigious.  In order to attract people, the size of the monthly salary is also increased, and questions about improving housing conditions are being addressed. </p><p>  The main task of the state in the military sector is to replenish officers in the army. </p><p>  In general, the salary of the military in the country today is decent, especially in comparison with civilian incomes.  Although it’s quite difficult to earn money on your own housing.  For many conscripts living in the outback, the prospects of working in the Russian Air Force are very tempting, given the conditions of the current crisis and complete unemployment in the countryside.  High patriotic feelings - this, of course, is good, but whether or not to serve under the contract, everyone decides for himself. </p><p>  Work, albeit monetary, but difficult, harmful, sometimes ungrateful and dangerous, and the risk to life is already inherent in the salary.  Military service allows you to receive a stable income now and confidence in a secure future. </p>
