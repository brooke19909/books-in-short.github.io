  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silver carp</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Silver carp feeds mainly on plankton, i.e.  is <span>a water purifier.</span>  Earlier fishing for silver carp was carried out on such nozzles as bundles of algae, reed leaves, cucumber and so on.  However, it was very difficult to catch this fish on such bait. </p><p>  The modern theory of <span>how to catch a silver carp is</span> based on the fact that lure is created by lure, while the fish, while sucking water and filtering plankton, also sucks the hook. </p><p>  Of course, the secret of this fishing lies in what to catch a silver carp.  First of all, these are the components that make up complementary foods: they should create more turbidity.  To this end, it is good to use cornmeal, milk powder, bran. </p><p>  <span>Carp fishing</span> is rarely carried out on a <span>float fishing rod</span> .  Although it very often happens, along the way, when catching a carp with such a fishing rod, another fish is also caught. </p><p>  It is much better to <span>catch a silver carp</span> when combining a hook and feeding. </p><p>  The silver carp should be caught in places that meet the following requirements: clay or rocky bottom of the reservoir, shallow depth (2 meters), headwind.  Another trick of this fishing is that it is caught on a very strong hook, because  he has a fairly thick lip. </p><p>  Being a schooling <span>fish, a silver carp is</span> most often caught on equipment such as <span>bottom gear</span> or fishing rods with a reel, and it should be strong enough, because  a silver carp often quickly jumps out of the water and at the same time it is very strong. </p><p>  Experienced fishermen know what to catch silver carp.  First of all, these are all nozzles that are of plant origin.  The most catching nozzle is young peas, canned or boiled.  The hook, disguised as slices of algae, the silver carp takes from the bottom along with the bait and swallows.  It turns out that the fish itself is hooked.  However, if the hook is not sharp enough, the silver carp, having felt a slight injection in the lip, immediately spits out the hook and the nozzle, and the school of fish instantly moves to a safer place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often, during fishing, the fishing line stretches, then weakens.  Fishermen know what needs to be hooked in the first second, when the fishing line is pulled.  Otherwise, the actions of the fisherman will not make sense, everything will depend on the further behavior of the fish.  And if luck smiles, the fish will self-cut for the second time. </p><p>  In any case, the first signal for the fisherman is the first pull.  The hooked fish is very strongly resisting, doing some dizzying stunts, and if she manages to hide in the water thickets, it will be difficult to get it out of there. </p><p>  Because of the turbidity created by complementary foods, a school of fish gathers at the site of complementary foods.  The most important thing in this is to make sure that the lure does not have time to settle to the bottom. </p><p>  To do this, it‚Äôs nice to use foam balls. </p><p>  In the spring, even before the beginning of rapid flowering, the food of silver carp is detritus - the surface silt layer with the remains of organic matter.  In this case, the silver carp itself raises turbidity around itself, trying to separate something tasty from the silt.  From this it follows that in cold waters, silver carp is best caught on a muddy bottom. </p><p>  And in the summer, when the water is full of phytoplankton, silver carp is caught in any muddy, ‚Äúflowering‚Äù water. </p><p>  If the fisherman‚Äôs equipment contains binoculars, he can easily see circles on the surface of a flowering reservoir - this silver carp feeds on surface plankton.  And finding fish is half the battle when fishing for silver carp.  Further already - a matter of technology.  In this case, the bait is served shallow, at a depth of ten centimeters. </p><p>  Silver carp are very impressive in size, which should also be taken into account when fishing.  Sometimes an individual can weigh about fifty kilograms, and sometimes heavier ... </p><p>  So good bite! </p>
