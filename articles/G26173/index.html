It seems that it is woven from contradictions.  Greeks, Arabs, Spaniards left here many outstanding monuments, which must be seen by the guests of the country. </p><h2>  Where is Sicily located? </h2><p>  The island of Sicily is located south of mainland Italy, between Europe and Africa.  In the north, the Apennine Peninsula adjoins it.  To the south of the island is Malta.  Tunisia and Egypt are located a little further south.  In the north-west direction is another island of Italy - Sardinia.  Sicily's eastern neighbor is Greece, from which the Ionian Sea separates the island.  In addition, Sicily is washed by the Tyrrhenian (in the north) and the Mediterranean (in the south and west) seas.  For lovers of accurate numbers, we inform you that the geographical coordinates of Sicily are 37 ° 45 '0 "N and 14 ° 15' 0" in.  d. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.5999938" data-lng="14.015355699999986" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="6"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/2/3/2/4232.png"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Today we offer you to take a small virtual tour to one of the ancient cities of Sicily - Agrigento, but before we get acquainted with some historical facts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At different periods of its history, this city had different names.  The ancient Greeks called him Akragas, the Romans, who built their mighty empire, renamed it Agrigento.  Centuries later, the Arabs named it Kerkent Germenta.  The name Girgenti was given to the city by the Norman rulers.  The current name was officially adopted in the middle of the 20th century, when the fascist regime ruled in Sicily. </p><p>  The first mention of the settlement, located on the lands where the city of Agrigento is now located in Sicily, dates back to the VI century BC.  During this period, Rhodes and Cretan seafarers mastered the local shores and founded the city of Aragragas on the island.  Very soon, he became an important colony of the Greeks, along with Syracuse, which are located to the south. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Agrigento" class="if uuid-2537240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2537240.jpg"></div><p>  After several decades, the city occupied an area of ​​five hundred hectares.  Residential and administrative buildings were surrounded by strong walls, which initially had nine gates.  It was a fairly large city for its time.  Aragragas was inhabited by more than three hundred thousand inhabitants.  They included citizens of other colonies and Greek metropolises, and descendants of the first colonists, as well as slaves. </p><p>  The heyday of the city, historians consider the V century BC.  e., when he ruled the mighty Theron.  He was able to constantly expand the zone of influence of the city.  The Greek Temple of Zeus, which was surrounded by other religious buildings, can be considered a real breakthrough of the architects of that time.  Some of these buildings have been preserved in the Valley of the Temples to the present day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the Western Roman Empire fell, the Byzantines came to power in Agrigento in Sicily, and then the Norman conquerors.
