This is actually not the case.  By and large, along with stocks, it is as if acquired the ‚Äúopinion‚Äù of traders on the position of this company at the moment and the ‚Äúhope‚Äù of other investors for its stability. </p><p>  During a single exchange transaction, traders, the so-called <span>blue-collar workers,</span> can earn or, conversely, lose twenty to thirty thousand dollars or more.  Thanks to the opening of new information and consulting centers, such as the Center for Exchange Technologies (Odessa) and the like, specializing in financial education and exchange investment technologies, students enjoy access to world-class educational programs of a high-quality level.  They have the potential to start their own successful career in finance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  The all-Ukrainian network of information and consultation centers is the focus through which people get acquainted with the technology of the trading exchange.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A Brief Overview of Learning Trading Strategies </h2><p>  This center examines the work on the market for various trading strategies that teach competent, disciplined trading.  Such information is provided by the Center for Exchange Technologies (Kharkov). </p><p>  Various course programs include the theory and practice of using a variety of trading strategies, for example: </p><ul><li>  the Cornflower strategy focused on currency pair trading; </li><li>  PAR + Moving Averages + ADX strategy based on indicators; </li><li>  ‚ÄúStriving for excellence‚Äù strategy, which makes an analysis of false market movements. </li><li>  The Puria Method strategy, which allows you to set maximum take-profit values. </li></ul><h2>  Tools used in the work of the exchange </h2><p>  The name of the service comes from the historical concept of ‚Äúleverage of Archimedes‚Äù.  For example, a potential buyer has one million rubles, then purely at his own expense he is able to acquire only 22 tons of the volume of raw materials sold.  With a leverage equal to 1/7 of the cost, such a buyer would be able to purchase 153 tons of raw materials from a professional exchange broker at once.  This seventh part of the price is paid by the buyer himself immediately in advance, as it is a security payment for the transaction.  Such a mechanism is used to manage the risks and earnings of exchange employees. </p><p>  It is difficult to imagine a trader planning to come to the market in order to lose his hard-earned money there.  However, this is exactly what happens - having failed to cope with the information volume of the exchange, out of ten new traders, literally in a year nine leave the market trade.  Is trading a kind of business?  and he needs to be taken very seriously.  It is necessary to draw up a clear business plan and strictly follow it in a disciplined manner.  With a skillful approach, this business is close to an ideal example, because it has the following worthy qualities: </p><ul><li>  self-sufficiency; </li><li>  mobility; </li><li>  reliability; </li><li>  scalability. </li></ul><p>  The trading market has existed for more than one hundred years and will still exist for a long time.  Trading is a game of probabilities, and the correct result can be obtained only with a statistically significant number of transactions.  Any trade transaction takes place either at a premium or at a discount. </p><p>  Any force majeure circumstances, any threats to traditional business in the speculative market, on the contrary, are sources of trading opportunities.  All this, on the contrary, becomes a new opportunity to make money. </p><p>  This business does not require a separate office, additional staff, meetings with firefighters, sanitary-epidemiological and other public services. </p><p>  Trading is a very isolated ‚Äúlonely‚Äù profession, but at the same time it is the most democratic profession.  There is even such a saying that any person who came to the Wall Street place of work in an expensive fashionable Rolls-Royce can easily ask for advice from someone who got to work on the subway. </p><h2>  Basic concepts of the financial market </h2><p>  One of the basic concepts in the currency market is a quote, which is the exchange rate of one currency against another, expressed in its units.  For example: eur - the original base currency, they plan to sell or buy it;  usd - the quoted currency for which they intend to sell or buy the base currency, then the current rate (quotation) is the ratio eur / usd = 1.3327, with the last, fourth, digit in the lower order is called the item and is indicated by pip. </p><p>  The term "figure" in the stock trading market, currency pairs is called the movement of price changes by one hundred points.  For example, if the quotation of the eur / usd currency pair was (1.3276), and then adjusted to (1.3376), then this change corresponds to one ‚Äúfigure‚Äù. </p><p>  Tick ‚Äã‚Äãmeans a one-time change in the price up or down.  The concepts of BID, ASK, spread are widely used in exchange trading. </p><p>  These and similar concepts, technological techniques, tools and mechanisms are studied and promoted in courses provided by the Center for Exchange Technologies (Kiev). </p><h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  According to official statistics, about three hundred people employed similar <span>centers of Ukraine</span> .  New employees have great prospects for future career growth. </p>
