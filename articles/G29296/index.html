    <h2>  Power forecasts </h2><p>  Initially, they planned to commission the object in 2010.  Subsequently, the date of recent work was constantly rescheduled.  The work was partially suspended due to the unstable economic situation and the crisis.  The financial situation did not prevent to finish the job.  Now authorities say that all high-rise buildings will be completed in the last months of 2016.  Nevertheless, the lack of funds in the treasury led to the fact that the development of transport infrastructure was postponed until 2020.  Although it is likely that these dates will also be carried forward for several years. </p><p>  The large-scale project actually consists of three completely different sections.  Each of them is planned by a separate group of specialists.  All these areas are included in the Baltic Pearl residential complex.  However, there is a significant difference between them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Business center </h2><p>  The first part is called the Duderhof Club.  This modern mini-block has been created and designed specifically for people engaged in business.  There is a low-rise club-type housing.  Made parking.  It should be noted that this territory is protected.  A shopping and entertainment center is just a short walk away. </p><p>  Apartments in this area will appeal to those who love luxury and space.  The developer offers to equip and remodel the house to your taste.  Residents of this part of the city prefer large kitchens and halls, spacious dressing rooms, open terraces or glazed loggias.  16 duplexes overlook the Gulf of Finland, each for two families. </p><p>  Another plus that this part of the Baltic Pearl quarter can offer is excellent <span>sound insulation in apartments, a</span> modern ventilation system and noiseless elevators.

Most of the apartments in this part of the quarter have already found their owners.  Now the construction of the latest high-rise buildings in this area is underway. </p><h2>  Family corner </h2><p>  The third residential quarter was almost completely populated.  But there were non-standard houses that are waiting for their creative owners.  This territory received the beautiful and romantic name ‚ÄúPearl Symphony‚Äù.  In this part, high-rise buildings and low houses are connected.  The highlight of the plot is the large courtyards where the children will have fun.  There are small fields for sports games and peculiar recreation areas.  Around are small gardens and parks. </p>

    <p>  The first floors are shops and other enterprises.  In each apartment, all meters are already installed.  There are freight and passenger elevators.  The halls are especially lavishly decorated.  You can buy a house with one or more rooms.  There are spacious kitchens and niches for a wardrobe. </p><p>  This is the safest area.  Baltic Pearl takes care of the life of its customers.  High-rise buildings are equipped with intercoms, fire alarms and video cameras. </p><h2>  Incomparable landscapes </h2><p>  People who have already settled in new apartments especially like the location.  The complex stands on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland.  Alleys and paths were laid along the canals.  Such a walk, say the residents of the area, gives strength and energy. </p><p>  Every day you can observe the magical and unique landscapes that nature creates.  Also in this part of a peculiar small town are dozens of cafeterias and restaurants with open verandas.  The service sector focuses on romantic and family vacations.  Residents of the town leave positive feedback on the work of these institutions.  From the comments you can find out that the prices are affordable, and the service is excellent. </p><p>  This part of St. Petersburg is far from industrial zones.  Therefore, those who bought apartments in the ‚ÄúBaltic Pearl‚Äù can be sure that their housing is safe.  The fact that the next few years factories and factories will not be built on this territory, which pollutes the air and the environment, also raises the price of houses.  But very close to the quarter are objects that cleanse nature.  In addition, there are several large parks and green spaces around the area.  Many positive reviews are left by young parents.  They like that their children grow up in an environmentally friendly environment. </p><h2>  Mini country </h2><p>  The first thing the developers took care of was the comfort of the residents of the quarter.  All that is needed must be at hand. </p><p>  The infrastructure in the new complex ‚ÄúBaltic Pearl‚Äù is maximally developed.  A cinema, gyms, bank branches - everything is here.  There are also fitness clubs, hairdressers and bank branches.  People who use these services say the service is top notch. </p><p>  In the yards set gazebos and benches.  Each high-rise building has an underground or semi-underground parking, which is guarded around the clock.  It should be noted that these rooms are warming up, so car owners can not be afraid of crackling frosts.  This fact is especially pleasing to motorists. </p><p>  Little residents of the area were also taken care of.  All yards are equipped with playgrounds with fields for games, sandboxes, a variety of carousels and sports corners. </p><p>  Each school in the ‚ÄúBaltic Pearl‚Äù, and 4 were planned to open them, will specialize in individual sciences.  Also will earn 7 kindergartens. </p>

    <h2>  Housing prices </h2><p>  Some institutions will have a swimming pool, gymnasium and games rooms.  All rooms have underfloor heating.  Schools will have modern gyms and fields for games. </p><p>  The project includes an adult and a children's clinic.  Also, very soon the police station should start working. </p><p>  You can buy an apartment by installments (1% per month).  For everyone who gives the entire amount for housing at once, the company offers a discount of 5%.  For those who buy property in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDuderhof Club, the savings are up to 10%.  It should be noted that a meter in this part of the city is estimated at about 100 thousand rubles.  "Symphony" - the second part of the complex, has other numbers. </p><p>  The cost of a meter on this site is 85 thousand.  Frigate is the cheapest area.  The price here is about 70 thousand rubles.  ‚ÄúBaltic Pearl‚Äù is a quarter in which everyone can find affordable housing.

    <h2>  Disadvantage number 1 </h2><p>  Residents of the district complain that transport is one of the main problems.  You need to get to the center of Petersburg along the Peterhof highway, which is characterized by constant traffic jams.  The nearest metro station is Leninsky Prospekt, located 6 km from the residential quarter.  There are a lot of minibuses and buses.  However, the residents of the town say that the accumulation of cars on the roads again hinders the delivery of passengers quickly and without problems. </p><p>  Now, when the transport connection has not yet been established, people complain that getting to the city center is expensive and uncomfortable. </p><p>  The quarter has its own shopping and entertainment complex, which is called the ‚ÄúBaltic Pearl‚Äù.  The prices in it, as residents have noted, are the same as in other similar structures of the city.  Varieties of fun are almost inferior to analogues.  In general, there are enough enterprises servicing the residents of the quarter.  There are luxurious bars, restaurants that can host a banquet for hundreds of guests, family cafes.  In the area there are car repair shops, beauty salons and gyms. </p>
