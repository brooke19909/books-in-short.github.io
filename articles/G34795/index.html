Of course, in verbal everyday communication this phraseological unit is rarely used.  But the meaning and history of its occurrence are quite interesting. </p><p>  What is a Procrustean bed?  In order to find out, it is necessary to turn to ancient history, and more precisely, to the myths of Ancient Greece. </p><p>  <strong>Procrustean bed - a bit of history</strong> </p><p>  At one time, Procruste was considered one of the most famous robbers of Greece.  The cruelty of his atrocities was literally amazing.  By the way, in the works of various historians and art historians this character is mentioned under different names.  In history, he is known as Damast and Polypemnon.  The very name Procruste, translated from the <span>ancient Greek language,</span> means "stretching." </p><p>  This robber lived in Attica and hunted people on the road between Athens and Megara.  To begin with, Procrustes lured lonely travelers to his home.  Here he offered them a hearty dinner and a warm bed. </p><p>  But in return for what he promised, he laid his guest on a bed.  His further atrocities depended on the victim himself.  If a short man, for whom the bed was too big, became his prey, then they tied him, and then beat him with a huge hammer, breaking bones and stretching joints until the person‚Äôs growth began to harmonize with the size of the bed. </p><p>  With tall people, for whom the Procrustean bed was too small, the robber treated in a completely different way.  He cut off all the spilling parts until the person fit in the bed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Procrustes ended his life as well as his victims.  The hero of ancient Greek myths Theseus laid him on the bed and chopped off his head. </p><p>  In fact, ancient Greek myths are not entirely accurate in this regard.  There is another legend.  Some sources say that Procrustus had a son from Silea, who was named Sinis.  He also grew up a cruel man who attacked people in the forest, on the territory of the Isthmus of Corinth. </p><p>  Sinis bent two trees and tied the limbs of a person to them, and then let go.  Thus, his victims simply burst.  It is believed that Sinis was also killed by Theseus, and he died in the same way as he killed his victims. </p><p>  To date, it is not known for sure whether Sinis was the son of Procrustes, or whether he is one and the same person.  Be that as it may, but the robber died at the hands of Theseus - in this regard, all sources are unambiguous.  But the expression "Procrustean bed" remains to this day </p><p>  <strong>Procrustean bed: the meaning of winged expression</strong> </p><p>  So, we figured out how the expression itself arose.  But what does it mean?  Procrustean bed - phraseological unit with very deep roots.  It denotes a kind of measure, under which they try to adjust or adapt something by force. </p><p>  This popular expression is used if they want to emphasize the desire to forcefully fit something into a tight framework, while sacrificing something really important and significant. </p><p>  Quite often, <span>this winged expression is</span> used in art.  Thus, the artists tried to emphasize that it is simply impossible to adapt the irrational nature of creativity to some limited concepts.  Violent attempts to do this will only lead to misunderstanding or loss of original meaning.  Creative people quite reasonably believe that it is impossible to fit or adjust all the endless phenomena to some previously prepared conservative theories. </p><p>  The Procrustean bed just marks these very boundaries, the limitations of the system, too rigid templates and artificially invented standards. </p><p>  Of course, in everyday communication this expression should not be used too often.  It is not always appropriate, and not every person can understand its true meaning. </p>
