Kulikovo battle</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Events of such a scale as the Battle of Kulikovo in the history of Russia are very few.  It is on a par with such battles as the Poltava, Borodino and Stalingrad battles.  Here are four great battles in Russian history.  These are battles in which the fate of the country and its future were decided.  Of course, they are different in scale, different in the technique used, but for their time their meaning is quite comparable. </p><h2>  Prince of Moscow </h2><p>  Prince Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy (1350‚Äì1389) after the death of his father from the age of nine began to reign in Moscow.  At this time, feudal strife began in the Horde, and it began to weaken.  But the power of Mamaia still extended to Russia.  In addition, Lithuania created an alliance with the Horde, directed against Russia and its principalities, and occupied Tver.  Moscow at this time rebuilt a new white stone fortress.  The economic struggle with the Horde continued, and thanks to the efforts of Moscow, tribute was reduced and a dynastic marriage was concluded between Serpukhov Prince Vladimir and the daughter of the Lithuanian Prince Olgerd.  What is famous for Dmitry Donskoy?  Diplomatic abilities in the first place. </p><h2>  Legendary figure </h2><p>  Prince Dmitry Donskoy is an iconic figure.  He long ago became a symbol of the great commander.  Dmitry Donskoy, who came from the depths of time, was overgrown with myths, but this is the case when myth and reality coincide.  He really corresponds to the concept of a great commander. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what was famous for Dmitry donskoy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039370.jpg" width="399"></div>  Dmitry Donskoy, the years of rule showed this, he was really an outstanding, unusual figure of his time.  He was a man who possessed great confidence in himself, in his special mission.  Not in myself, not in self-confidence, but that from above the Lord gave him a special task, a special goal among people.  Dmitry Donskoy felt like God's chosen one.  The Lord set before him the task of liberating Russia, and he must do this at all costs.  When Dmitry rebelled against the Golden Horde, he felt it as a mission that was given to him from above.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Suspicious adventure </h2><p>  But for others it looked a little different.  Many believed that the uprising against the Golden Horde was a gamble, that Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy raised this uprising at his own peril and risk, and now a huge black cloud is walking along the steppes - these are the warriors of Mamaia.  And now let him deal with them himself.  He brewed this porridge, let it dissipate it.  That was the attitude.  And therefore, in the summer of 1380, when Dmitry learned from his intelligence that the Tatars had gone on a campaign and that they had a huge army, Dmitry Donskoy sent messengers to all his Russian princes, who all once gathered with him and said that it was necessary to raise insurrection. </p><p>  And so he sends messengers to them and writes: come, this very hour has come when we must rise together to this holy war.  And suddenly he begins to receive strange answers.  One writes that he cannot, his horses are ill, the horses are completely hungry, the other has left somewhere at this time, and it is impossible to find him.  The third one has some other reasons.  The Russian commander was almost alone.  The Nizhny Novgorod prince, his father-in-law, Dmitry Konstantinovich, did not come, the Tver prince, Mikhail Alexandrovich, did not come, the Novgorodians did not come.  Only some princes came: Belozersky, Rostov - small in number of squads.  And in this situation Dmitry understands that only one thing can save him - the people's militia. </p><h2>  Militia collection </h2><p>  It is necessary to convince ordinary people to go to war - townspeople, peasants, who actually never fought, this is not their business.  Fought professionals, combatants.  People‚Äôs militia was extremely rare.  For some extraordinary cases, when the question was not just about the war between Prince, say, Ivan, and Prince Konstantin, but the question was about the fate of our faith, about Orthodoxy, that is, this war with Mamaia had to be posed as a holy war, a war for faith.  To do this, Dmitry needed to get a blessing from some activist.  So that a person whom the people trust, whom he considers truly holy, bless the war with Mamaia and raise it to the height of a holy war, a war for faith. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sergius of Radonezh </h2><p>  At that time in Northeastern Russia there lived only one person whom people certainly trusted, whom people considered a living saint, because his life was such that he lived perfectly.  It was the Monk Sergius of Radonezh.  Rev. Sergius of Radonezh, founder of the monastery 70 km northeast of Moscow, hegumen of this monastery.  This, of course, is a great man for our church.  But, in addition, the Monk Sergius in his daily life embodied the Christian ideal of monasticism: a monk is a person who is absolutely not kindless, disinterested, ready to give everyone some help, to support everyone, to give good advice to everyone.  And the fame of St. Sergius spread very widely.  But, of course, Sergius did not intervene in politics.  And so Dmitry had the last chance to turn to the Monk Sergius.  Rev. Sergius did not like the war with the Horde, because the risk was very great. </p><h2>  To bow </h2><p>  But when the Russian commander came to him at the Trinity Monastery on August 16, 1380 and said: ‚ÄúHoly Father, bless,‚Äù Sergius rose above personal relationships, over vain considerations, and gave him not only his blessing, but also his two monks, Peresvet and slaughter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Dmitry Don" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039374.jpg" width="600"></div>  Why did he give his monks?  It would seem a strange solution.  Why is he sending monks to fight?  This was generally a violation of <span>monastic rules,</span> because a monk must sit in a monastery.  The warrior must fight, and the monk must pray, everyone has his own business.  And then suddenly the Monk Sergius sends two monks to battle.  The fact is that they were visible evidence that this is the blessing of St. Sergius.  After all, the world was small then.  People knew each other by sight, like in a village.  And everyone knew that in the past Peresvet and Oslyabya were respected Moscow governors, noble people, but then they went to the monastery.  And everyone understood that if they were traveling next to Dmitry, then the campaign was blessed by the reverend.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Holy war for faith </h2><p>  And since <span>this is the blessing of the</span> saint, then this is not just a princely fight, and this is not just some kind of adventure, but this is a holy war for faith.  And this means that everyone who dies in this war will receive the crown of a martyr, and angels await him in heaven, and he who does not go to this war is a traitor to the faith, an apostate.  That is why St. Sergius blessed his monks on this campaign.  What is famous for Dmitry Donskoy?  He managed to collect the people's militia. </p><h2>  The balance of power - the thoughts of the prince </h2><p>  He did not wait until the Tatars besieged Moscow, although he already had a decent stone fortress, and some advised him to stay in it.  And so Dmitry led the troops to <span>Kulikovo Field.</span>  The people's militia went with him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039379.jpg" width="425"></div>  And then he acts as a magnificent commander who accurately calculates everything.  He went to meet the enemy, in the steppe.  This was an unusual military technique.  But that was the right decision.

    <h2>  Decisive battle </h2><p>  Then he came to the Kulikovo field and ordered his troops to cross the Don.  At first glance, they stood in a completely unfavorable position.  On the one hand - Don, on the other hand in a deep ravine the Nepryadva River.  That is, nowhere to run.  If the army falters and runs, it will disappear when crossing the river.  Tatars will kill them all.  But that was right at that moment.  Each warrior had to be given the following thought: either to win, or to perish.  There will be no escape in flight.  Need to fight.  It was a bet on victory.  So the Kulikovo battle of Dmitry Donskoy was thought out. </p><h2>  Night meditations </h2><p>  On the night of September 7-8, 1380, Dmitry understood one very important thing: when the battle begins, the large thousands of regiments of militiamen that he brought in may not be able to withstand it.  And Dmitry imagined what the Horde attack was: with a hoot, screaming, screaming, and howling the black Horde cavalry was rushing.  She rushes to a large regiment where there are untrained militias.  And at the sight of this avalanche their nerves can‚Äôt stand it, they will run.  It will be an irrational fear that will seize everyone.  How to save the militias?  How to take the first blow?  And Dmitry makes the only right decision.  He puts forward a well-trained guard regiment, which consisted of selected combatants, chained in iron.  Those people who could hold off this avalanche for some time were about an hour.  And Dmitry himself goes to this advanced regiment.  It was clear that this regiment was doomed to death.  So the Kulikovo battle of Dmitry Donskoy was conceived.  But these soldiers will stop for some time the avalanche of cavalry, and during this time the militia will have time to recover, have time to overcome fear.  And so it happened. </p><h2>  On the Kulikovo Field </h2><p>  The next morning, Dmitry set up shelves.  He himself went to the frontier guard regiment.  An avalanche of Tatar cavalry from the top of Red Hill went to the Russian army.  The entire regiment in front was destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kulikovo battle of Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039388.jpg" width="399"></div>  But while the Horde fought with him, maybe half an hour, maybe an hour, and the militias came to their senses.  They saw that the Tatars could be stopped.  That the energy of the avalanche is not the same, it is already stopped.  And therefore, when the Tatars reached a large regiment, he stood to his death and did not run anywhere.

    <h2>  Ambush </h2><p>  And, of course, there was a great decision - to set up an ambush regiment under the command of Vladimir Andreyevich Serpukhovsky in an oak grove.  And this ambush regiment, unexpectedly striking the flank of the Tatar cavalry that had not expected anything, already in the middle of the battle decided the outcome of the battle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039377.jpg" width="600"></div>  Tatars faltered and began to retreat.  As soon as this happened, Dmitry threw up reserves on this flank, and a counterattack began.  That is, everything was thought out.  Up to his own role.  So the battle of Dmitry Donskoy took place.  Indeed, at that time, rulers usually stood in the rear.  And Dmitry went ahead, past the regiments, so that everyone could see that he was going to fight in the forefront, that he was ready to give his own life for victory, that he would not abandon them, would not run away.  What is famous for Dmitry Donskoy?  A feat of self-sacrifice.

    <h2>  Hard victory </h2><p>  After the battle, do not pray to find him for a long time.  He was badly injured.  Vladimir Andreevich Serpukhovskaya sent soldiers to look for him.  Severely wounded in this battle, Dmitry barely survived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039411.jpg" width="600"></div>  He was found and brought to consciousness, he mounted his horse and together with his brother they went to inspect the battlefield.  They saw that the field was littered with corpses.  Victory came at a heavy price.  The military potential of Moscow was undermined.

    <p>  After the battle, the prince‚Äôs army first arrived in Kolomna, and then in Moscow.  Now, a monument to Dmitry Donskoy is installed on the Kremlin tower in Kolomna. </p><h2>  Meaning of battle </h2><p>  The historical <span>significance of the Battle of Kulikovo</span> is that it finally defined the role of Moscow as the center of the unification of Russia.  Moscow at Kulikovo Field has proven that it can free the country.  She can achieve independence.  We must help her, we must support her.  What is famous for Dmitry Donskoy?  He showed not by words but by deeds that he was ready to fight for freedom.  Therefore, Vasily Osipovich Klyuchevsky well formulated this, saying that the Moscow state was born in the vast Kulikov field.  This is a metaphor, but it accurately expresses the essence of the matter.  A magnificent monument to Dmitry Donskoy reflects before his descendants his great deed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battle of Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1039413.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The last <span>years of Dmitry Donskoy‚Äôs life</span> were difficult.  He felt pressure from all sides.  Lithuania intensified, the Horde demanded more tribute.  And maybe these adversities shortened his life.  He died at the age of 38 in May 1389. </p><p>  Here is such a relatively short and heroic life.  This man, <span>Grand Duke</span> Dmitry Donskoy, rightfully occupies a prominent place in our history.  He deserves it. </p>
