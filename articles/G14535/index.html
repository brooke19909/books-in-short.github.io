    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  "Villa Fellini" (Sudak), the description of which is given in the article - this is only one side of the perception of the resort.  Often the decisive role in the choice is played by reviews of experienced travelers. </p><p>  Holidays on the Black Sea for Russians are usually associated with Anapa, Gelendzhik and Sochi.  Sudak Valley is a relatively new tourist destination.  The seaside town was initially known for its wine production.  The main advantage of the area is its majestic nature, but now the expansion of tourist infrastructure makes it an attractive resort. </p><p>  One of the pioneers of local service is considered "Villa Fellini" (Sudak).  Reviews of tourists often describe the tedious road among unfinished hotels.  After getting into a comfortable hotel, the opinion drastically changes to a positive one.  And this is not surprising!  The four-star category provides coziness, comfort, carefree and long-awaited relaxation of guests.  But tourists are different, so you should get acquainted with diverse opinions to see for sure whether to visit this hotel. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="villa fellini pike perch hotel description" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1403093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  An undoubted advantage is the hospitality and friendliness of the staff.  Guests are always warmly welcomed and quickly accommodated in comfortable rooms. </li><li>  Some tourists praise the rooms with a kitchen.  This is especially true for couples with children.  In these suites you can warm up your meals and indulge in the goodies of your own cooking.  It creates a feeling of homely atmosphere and relaxation. </li><li>  Sympathy aesthetically pleasing and comfortable furniture, in particular beds and sofas.  For pets, specially equipped baskets are provided. </li><li>  Gourmets celebrate the hotel's signature cuisine.  Culinary diversity, freshness of products, coupled with the original presentation of dishes conquer even fastidious tourists. </li><li>  Fans of water procedures liked the pool and sauna, which offers "Villa Fellini" (Sudak).  A review of them in advertising brochures is entirely true.  Crystal clear water and moderate temperatures, additional service snacks and drinks are a related fact. </li><li>  The area around is well-groomed, decorated with flower beds of colorful flowers, neat paths lined with decorative stone.  The original architecture of the hotel building complements all this natural beauty.  In the evenings, it is aesthetically lit, which gives mystery and magic.  Villa Fellini is widely believed to be an ideal place for couples in love with their honeymoon or family vacation. </li><li>  The rooms are cleaned daily, uninterrupted Internet connection and air conditioning are included in the calculation of room rates.  The hotel also has a paid safe, where you can leave your documents and valuables.  Although no cases of theft were recorded, and each room has reliable locks. </li><li>  Observing tourists appreciated the pleasant things that provided "Villa Fellini" (Sudak).  Reviews indicate the presence of dishes, sponges and rags for washing, clothes dryers and clothespins. </li><li>  Another significant advantage of the hotel is that its staff is fluent in Russian and English.  So, it is open not only to Russians, but also to foreign citizens. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="villa fellini pike perch photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1403085.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Nevertheless, there were skeptics who did not find the four-star hotel ideal for themselves.  By cons, they attributed: </p><ul><li>  Cramped rooms, the decor of which exquisite furniture fetters the space and free movement of guests in it.  For some tourists, the area around the hotel seemed small. </li><li>  Not liked the bathrooms, which, according to reviews, have modern plumbing.  At the same time, tourists indicate that the hotel is new.  So its appearance does not quite correspond to the internal content. </li><li>  A common negative point is the far distance from the sea.  500 meters are easily overcome by young people, but for people with certain health problems or age peculiarities they are difficult.  The situation is complicated by the lack of asphalt or pavers throughout the route, as well as a busy highway.  But it is worth considering the fact that Sudak is only equipped for tourists. </li><li>  The beach is urban, and therefore it is rarely cleaned.  <span>This chagrin is</span> offset only by a good entry into the water and the presence of all the necessities on the beach (sun loungers, umbrellas, changing rooms, etc.). </li><li>  Replacing towels and cleaning the rooms also caused discontent among guests and disappointment at the Villa Fellini Hotel (Sudak).  Reviews say that according to the rules, these services should be provided daily.  But in reality, everything happens less often and at an uncomfortable time. </li><li>  In general, the hotel staff was not very well appreciated by picky tourists.  For example, they took for unfriendliness the fact that employees do not greet guests at a meeting and act strictly according to the schedule created by the administration.  So, at 10.00 the breakfast is considered finished, and therefore the staff silently removes everything from the tables and closes the buffet.  Perhaps this is a minus for the hotel, but everything has its own rules.  In this case, and rest. </li><li>  And finally, they didn‚Äôt arrange room prices.  But here it is a matter of individual capabilities of a tourist wallet. </li></ul>
