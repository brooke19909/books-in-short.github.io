The Frankish Western Empire included more than vast territories: these are modern France, Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, large parts of Germany and Spain.  But he fought his whole life not only for the sake of territories: everywhere where his army marched, Christianity triumphed.  The pagans of Europe were baptized by force: both fire and sword.

    <h2>  Bridge to the present </h2><p>  Slavic civilization very keenly felt the power of the formation of the West, faced with a terrible enemy, strong, cunning and even vile, if the circumstances required.  Karl won not only with the sword, but also with money, and lies, and betrayal.  Separating, he ruled.  Slavic tribes generously shed each other's blood. </p><p>  For centuries, these wars dragged on, provoked by the already dead Karl.  He destroyed the most passionate part of the Slavs, some went east, many assimilated and gradually became Austrians, Danes, Germans, the rest changed the "code" and passed under the Roman arm.  So, for example, the Poles adopted the Western form of Christianity and became sworn enemies of Slavic Rus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everyone will certainly admire the iron will and ingenious mind of Emperor Karl, but when studying the Frankish civilization it suddenly becomes clear where Europe‚Äôs onslaught to the East originates from.  The process is still in progress.  That's because what achievements the empire of Charlemagne was famous for (the 6th grade will certainly not be able to perceive such relationships if the teacher does not push the imagination)! </p>

    <h2>  Historical background </h2><p>  The foundation of the Franks empire was formed even before the birth of Charlemagne by the forces of three remarkable rulers who replaced the Merovingian dynasty that had faded away in laziness.  Clovis instilled statehood in alliance with the papal church;  <span>Karl Martell</span> created a real, almost professional army and formed a feudal system based on beneficiaries (noble nests), and the invasion of Europe by Islam was stopped by the <span>battle of Poitiers</span> ;  Pepin Korotky became the first official king of the Carolingian dynasty, sending the last representatives of the lazy Merovingians to the monasteries.  Thanks Pipin Rome reoriented from the East (Byzantium) to the West. </p><p>  So the foundation was laid for a European civilization - Romano-Germanic.  And this also answers the question of what achievements the empire of Charlemagne became famous for, since the very formation of European civilization took place precisely during the reign of Charles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Two kings </h2><p>  Karl‚Äôs father, Pipin Korotky, early taught his son to do state affairs, noting obvious <span>analytical abilities</span> and willingness to do things.  Young Karl was active in court meetings, willingly and witily completed diplomatic affairs, participated in aquitain campaigns.  When Pipin Korotky died, his twenty-six-year-old son was already sufficiently prepared for independent government.  What achievements have Charlemagne's empire been best known for?  Proper education of the heirs, timely, albeit very early, training of everyone and everything that is needed to manage the state. </p><p>  Pipin‚Äôs son was not alone.  And the possessions were divided approximately equally: Karl got Nuanion, and Karloman - Soissons.  Both are full and equal kings of the Franks.  As usual, relations were not fraternal.  For simple agreement the greatest work was required, and for the collision the smallest occasion was enough. </p><p>  For enemies of the newborn civilization of the Franks, this became an expanse: the just conquered Aquitans raised their heads, the Saxons and Britons crushed both from the east and from the west, and from the territories of modern Italy a real threat came - the king of the Lombards, Desiderius, who had already united most of the peninsula.  So he had a real army and huge resources.  First of all, the papal lands that had been conquered by Pepin and donated to Rome suffered.  Plus, Desiderius made close friends and made friends with the neighboring dukes, who also did not like the development of Frankish statehood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Carl, all this time, pretended not to notice the threat.  He carefully studied his country, traveled, hunted, gifted monasteries, and feasted.  Between these matters, the Aquitaine revolt was easily suppressed.  He called his brother on a campaign in Gascony and in Aquitaine, but he categorically refused.  Carl did it himself. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Desiderius was taking away from the Pope region after region.  Stephen III tearfully asked for help from both brothers - and Karloman, and Karl.  But did not receive it.  Karloman did not want to fight, and Karl was already married a second time.  His mother - Bertrad - forced her son to abandon the former wife of Himiltrude, since she brought the pledge of peace from the south - the daughter of Desiderius, Desiderata.  The positions of the Franks in Italy quickly collapsed, the influence was melting. </p>

    <h2>  Single power </h2><p>  Karl did not endure this situation for very long.  Sent to his father Dezoderat, almost completely broke off his relationship with his brother and began to prepare for war.  However, Karloman suddenly and unexpectedly died for everyone.  Karl took possession of the inheritance and became the only full-fledged king of the Franks. <br><br>  And right away, from 772, the great war began for life: a campaign, invasion, siege, pacification of neighbors, war - in a vicious circle.  Every year in May a <span>military gathering</span> was going to take place where the operation was planned.  Sometimes in a year, not one trip was arranged, but two. </p><p>  Karl quickly became a commander and a great strategist.  Most often, the threat came from different directions, many were tormented by a sense of chaos and defeat.  However, all nodes were untangled, and the results were excellent.  Karl on the fly understood the essence of the situation and immediately made decisions. </p><p>  His one appearance in the army served as the guarantee of victory and instilled confidence: Karl - under two meters tall, handsome athlete, powerful and calm - confidently led even not very brave warriors.  What achievements made the empire of Charlemagne famous in the end, even difficult to list. </p>

    <h2>  Army creation </h2><p>  Karl constantly fought, and this required significant human and financial resources.  With resources it was better - huge territories gave everything and even more.  But they had to be kept.  The traditions of the predecessors - both father and grandfather - were continued in the form of military reform. </p><p>  The feudal lords for their regular service increased their land holdings (beneficiaries), plus the existing conscription system.  By order of every year, all the major landowners - counts and bishops - came with their horse and foot people to the gathering place, already armed and equipped. </p><p>  Failure to appear in time promised a huge fine, and evasion - a much more serious penalty.  Mobilization was rarely universal, most often those areas were fought, the borders of which were threatened by neighbors.  It was a very effective system, and the state of the Franks expanded and strengthened.  So what were the achievements of Charlemagne's empire?  Grade 6 will answer: by creating a real army with a mobilization system. </p><h2>  Lombard War </h2><p>  Desiderius was deeply offended and very angry: he cleaned out all of Karl‚Äôs supporters in his country, received the fleeing relatives of Karloman, and demanded from the Pope to crown one of the sons of the deceased king on the Frankish throne. </p><p>  However, Papa has already changed.  Instead of the supple and soft Stephen, he was met by the strong-willed Adrian.  And met with restraint, demanding guarantees.  Instead, Desiderius again began to devastate the papal regions.  Adrian closed in Rome and sent news to Charles about the threat of the Holy Roman Church. </p><p>  This time Carl was ready.  To completely clear his conscience, he twice tried to negotiate with Desiderius, but did not succeed.  Yes, and did not want, probably.  Negotiations failed.  Alpine passes were closed and tightly fortified.  Karl, along unknown mountain paths, turned the whole army around and went behind enemy lines, besieged Pavia, where Desiderius hid, and took Verona, the second capital of the Lombard kingdom. </p><p>  Karl entered Rome as a triumphant.  He promised (and deceived!) Adrian new possessions.  Meanwhile, the siege of Pavia ended successfully.  Desiderius and his relatives were tonsured to the monasteries.  Karl became the king of the Lombards and united both kingdoms into one - the Frankish.  The Lombardy ceased to exist.  What achievements did Charlemagne's empire become famous for?  It is difficult to give a short answer.  No matter how bad imperialism is, the petty feudal fragmentation is yesterday's round of European history.  And this is also in the treasury of facts about what achievements the empire of Charlemagne was famous for. </p><h2>  Order in Italy </h2><p>  However, the war by defeating Desiderius did not end.  The newly-made Roman patrician Carl was forced to repeatedly pacify the riots and uncover conspiracies. </p><p>  Having finally made peace in Saxony, he brought to Rome his little son Pepin, who was anointed to reign in the former Lombardia.  The old laws were respected, the local nobility left some privileges and government posts. </p><p>  But, of course, not a single decision passed without the consent of Charles - already the Great, because in both Northern and Central Italy he gained absolute power.  Now it‚Äôs clear what other achievements the empire of Charlemagne became famous for.  The short answer is wise politics. </p><h2>  Bavarian passions </h2><p>  The defeat of neighboring Lombardy greatly damaged the position of Bavaria - both military and political.  Duke Tassilon III was smart and flexible: not so long ago he created a coalition of Bavaria and Lombardia, and now he tried not to annoy the great Frankish king.  He even renewed the oath given to Karl‚Äôs father.  But he did not intend to give up autocracy and did not bring troops to the May training camp.  And in secret he entered into a conspiracy with Byzantium, with all Italian opponents of Charles, even with the Danube Avars - against Charlemagne. </p><p>  Karl did not endure all this for so long.  Ending the war in Saxony, he led troops to the borders of Bavaria.  Tassilon began to seek protection from the Pope, who agreed to mediate in the search for peace.  Karl suggested signing a specific set of documents, but Tassilon's ambassadors secretly left the city so as not to give any promises.  Dad was angry and blessed Karl for war. </p><p>  The Bavarians, unlike Tassilon, did not hate the Franks, rather they were afraid.  And so the Bavarian king was left with a suddenly thinning army.  There is nothing to do - he brought gifts to Karl, an oath of allegiance and left the hostages - even his son. </p><p>  Tassilon was convicted by the Sejm for treason and sentenced to death.  Karl pardoned him, forever imprisoned in a monastery.  The wife of Tassilon and all his children suffered the same fate. <br><br>  The autonomy of Bavaria was abolished.  The governor counts were directly subordinate to Karl.  Together with Bavaria, the Franks also received Slavic lands - Krajina and Carinthia, that is, access to the Balkans.  So the territory was replenished.  These are the achievements that made Charlemagne's empire famous (History, Grade 6, consonant with modernity). </p>

    <h2>  Empire crowning </h2><p>  So the first thirty years of Karl‚Äôs reign passed - in constant wars, intrigues and numerous victories, which brought such a huge number of countries - large and small, peoples - militant and not very that it became difficult to manage all this economy, maintaining the same title.  The king of the Franks was thinking about the imperial crown. </p><p>  What achievements did Charlemagne's empire become famous for?  The answers may be different, but one of them is this: reconciliation and the merging of various elements in the form of Saxon, Franks, Lombard, Frieze, Alaman, Bavarian tribes - that is, the old Germanic tribal flood - with Slavic, Romanesque and many other components of the empire .  A neutral new title was necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãthis authority is undeniable among all absolutely subjects, regardless of their origin, language, even faith. </p><p>  Only Rome could solve this difficult question.  The case helped.  Pope Leo III, the successor of Hadrian, got into an ugly history and asked Karl for help as a great patrician who resolves state issues.  There was a conspiracy and attempted murder against the Pope.  Probably, the reason was too secular orders established in the papal court, which shocked the noble relatives of the deceased Adrian.  Leo III escaped from intruders and crossed the Alps, hiding behind Charles. </p><p>  Karl gathered the army and immediately moved to Italy to establish the highest arbitration power there.  A trial took place during which Pope Leo III cleared an oath, and his prosecutors could not prove anything.  Of course, the bishops liked this action a little, but contemplating the troops of Charlemagne under the walls, few people were able to object at all.  What achievements did Charlemagne's empire become famous for?  A brief answer is: the conquest of world domination. </p><p>  The famous coronation act took place on Christmas Day 800 in St. Peter's Basilica.  After the Pope laid the magnificent crown, the Frankish king was proclaimed God crowned by the great and peace-loving (!) <span>Emperor of Rome,</span> Charles Augustus.  These words were repeated three times by all those present in the temple. </p><p>  And the formula itself, and the course of the matter, and the meeting in the church of the highest representatives of society tell us that the program was drawn up in advance and carefully, no matter how the Pope and Karl himself entrusted everyone.  An oath of allegiance was immediately brought - also by all those present, beginning with the Pope.  What other achievements made Charlemagne's empire famous! </p>
