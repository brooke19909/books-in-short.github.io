    <h2>  Museum exposition </h2><p>  In the reviews of the Experimentarium Museum in Moscow, it was noted that all of its exhibits are interactive.  That is, children and persons accompanying them can interact with absolutely all exhibits, without exception.  Moreover, small visitors freely pull them, twist, throw them up and even shout in the process of acquaintance with the exposition.  What other museum in the world is allowed to have so much fun? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Experimentarium is divided into eight halls, in which there are a large number of exhibits.  Each of them is devoted to certain areas of science.  Briefly, the exposure can be represented as follows: </p><ul><li>  <em>Hall of acoustics.</em>  He will tell visitors about the sound and everything related to it.  Guests of the exhibition will learn all about the physics of this phenomenon, for a while they will become members of a rock band, they will figure out how musical instruments work, and even see the sound with their own eyes.  And this is not the whole list of miracles of this exposition! </li><li>  <em>Hall of Optics.</em>  Many children are interested in how the organs of vision work, what light consists of, and why the shadow is always black.  These and many other questions they ask their parents, and in the Experimentarium they will give the most detailed answers.  In addition, visitors will plunge into the world of optical illusions, which does not want to leave at all. </li><li>  <em>Magnetism.</em>  This room is especially loved by kids, because it is literally filled with magic.  And how else to perceive bizarre patterns of metal chips obeying the movement of hands, or suddenly appearing magnetic clouds ?! </li><li>  <em>Electricity.</em>  At the exposition, revealing all the secrets of electrical energy, you can often meet many adults.  After all, even they are surprised by the fact that a light bulb, for example, can be easily lit with a finger or ear.  Thanks to well-chosen exhibits and stands with clear explanations, even the smallest visitors receive the necessary knowledge about electricity. </li><li>  <em>Hall of water.</em>  This exhibition is rightfully considered unique, because nowhere else in Russia there are museums with water installations.  Guests who have looked into this room will learn about the laws of hydrodynamics and get acquainted with the work of most mechanisms working with water.  In addition, the secrets of the seas and oceans are revealed to visitors. </li><li>  <em>Puzzles</em>  Here you can spend several hours, because fascinating and funny puzzles are interesting not only for kids, but also for adults. </li><li>  <em>Hall of mechanical inventions.</em>  It's hard for kids to imagine how much easier our mechanics make our lives.  Its laws are applied in many areas of everyday life and the exposition is described in detail and in detail about this. </li><li>  <em>Space</em> .  This room was opened not so long ago.  It houses unique exhibits and photographs, and small guests can learn a lot about astrophysics and astronautics. </li></ul><p>  From our description and numerous reviews of the Experimentarium, it is easy to imagine how interesting the halls of the museum are.  Even in visitors' photos, they look funny and unusual, but in reality they seem truly unique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  History of the emergence of science museums </h2><p>  The public interest in science and all kinds of scientific experiments arose in the seventeenth century in Europe.  It was then that the first museums began to emerge, designed to popularize scientific thought and prove that it is precisely behind it that the future of mankind.  The very first public institution of this kind appeared in France at the end of the seventeenth century, and in the USSR it was created only in the thirties of the twentieth century. </p><p>  Nowadays, scientific and educational museums are available in almost every country in the world.  In Russia, they exist in several cities.  For example, opened its "Experimentarium" in Tver.  Reviews about it can be found on the official website of the museum and on special Internet platforms.  It should be noted that most of them contain enthusiastic comments. </p><p>  Also very praised in the reviews "Experimentarium" in Ryazan.  This site has been operating for two years and offers young visitors to get acquainted with hundreds of exhibits.  The museum‚Äôs planetarium is also in great demand among visitors. </p><p>  In Moscow, the Experimentarium (reviews about this museum always sparkle with positive) was opened six years ago.  Many call it a scientific and entertainment center, the main purpose of which is to arouse the interest in science among the younger generation. </p><p>  The first four years the museum was located in a two-story building on Butyrskaya Street, but after moving, managed to significantly expand its exposure, which visitors regularly note in their reviews.  The Experimentarium at Sokol is currently divided into two parts.  We have already described the first in detail, but the second is located in the former museum building and deserves close attention. </p><h2>  "Bio-experimentalarium": reviews and description </h2><p>  This museum is fully dedicated to the structure of the human body.  Here you can also touch absolutely all exhibits and even disassemble some of them. </p><p>  More than one hundred exhibits located in nine halls are presented to the attention of young visitors in the ‚ÄúExperimentarium‚Äù on ‚ÄúSavelovskaya‚Äù (there are very many reviews about this place on the Internet).  They reveal the secrets of the human body, and the names of the expositions speak for themselves: </p><ul><li>  The reproductive system. </li><li>  "Evolution". </li><li>  "Perception" and so on. </li></ul><p>  There is also another room separately, where each visitor can imagine how difficult it is for people with disabilities in everyday life.  For some, this becomes a real discovery. </p><p>  In addition, children can see themselves through the eyes of different animals, catch microbes in the human body, and even ‚Äúwork‚Äù with their hearts.  And this is not the whole list of fascinating activities that await small visitors within the walls of the museum. </p><p>  Visitors to this unusual science center describe the time spent in it with great enthusiasm.  Moreover, they practically do not find any disadvantages in the museum.  In rare comments, you can find information that guests of the Bioexperimentarium do not like a large number of people on weekdays and holidays.  However, this indicates the popularity of the museum. </p>

    <h2>  Schedule "Bioexperimentarium" </h2><p>  The museum‚Äôs working hours and ticket prices are absolutely identical to those described for the Sokol metro station.  There are uniform rules of conduct and there is also a service for the holidays. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  If we analyze the reviews of visitors to the museums described by us, it becomes clear how much modern kids need them.  Each child leaves such scientific and educational centers, filled with new knowledge and incredible admiration for science.  And his burning eyes are definitely the main award to the organizers of the Experimentarium. </p>
