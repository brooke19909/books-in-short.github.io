    <h2>  Was there a card? </h2><p>  If you play ‚ÄúFlip‚Äù, then this method, how to cheat in ‚ÄúFool‚Äù, will be a real find.  During the game, ‚Äútoss‚Äù to a person any card that he didn‚Äôt fight and that nobody played.  So you can get rid of unnecessary cards and make your opponent lose. </p><p>  They recommend using the method if the opponent is inexperienced or playing cards with a child.  It is best to turn such actions in the middle of the game, the opponent is more relaxed and thinks about the next move.  Cards in this case are thrown similar (if the game has a figure of eight - you can throw a nine, a jack - a queen) or larger in value compared to the previous ones.  After all, if there are dozens in the game, and toss a seven, the opponent will probably begin to consider the cards, comparing and evaluating the moves made with his own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The same scam can be used at a time when you yourself fight back, often it works.  Yet in the second case, closer attention to the game - and the attempt can be disclosed. </p><h2>  And there are more trump cards, but fewer cards </h2><p>  The main secret is that the ‚Äúlast post‚Äù cards (those that are no longer in the game) are close.  At a time when everyone is passionate about the game, you can discard an unnecessary card trifle or pull out trump cards.  Almost no one remembers the <span>cards</span> that have left the <span>game</span> .  To fold cards, try to hold them with both hands.  In the palm of your hand, discreetly hide those that need to be discarded by first moving them to the end of the fan.  With this hand, cover the cards played on the table, which are retracted, discreetly dropping their own to them.  This is done only when there are still enough cards in the game.  If there are few of them, then the actions are more noticeable.  After all, if you went in and fought off with one card, then resetting yours will not work, and questions will arise about extra cards on the playing field.  Distract the players with an easily interesting story or a funny incident about one of those present.  A bit of acting, knowledge of how to cheat in "Fool" - and victory in your pocket. </p><p>  Failed to throw off?  It does not matter, you can hide the cards in your pocket or sleeve.  And in the next installment to include in a new game. </p><p>  The main condition is that we only hide the cards in pairs, if this is not done, then the unpaired amount is immediately evident to the opponents, and the deck can be counted.  After all, if the last cards are dealt, and the opponent and you did not have the same number, this is more than strange. </p>

    <h2>  Two more fun </h2><p>  How to cheat on cards in "Fool"?  Pretty simple and easy if the person is not alone.  For the game you need an accomplice who will not give out.  You need to sit next to each other's cards.  And further only a matter of technology.  Together, it‚Äôs easier to deal with the rest of the players.  While one will fight back, the second will distract everyone.  You can cheat by breaking a card similar, for example, tambourine worms.  But the chance that they will not notice is small, and it is not worth practicing with serious rivals. </p><h2>  And the cards are "speckled" </h2><p>  This method is the easiest.  All cards are marked, they can be in the form of punctures, notches or scuffs.  This will help determine the right cards in the first cases of cheating.  Try to distinguish labels by suits, so as not to get confused yourself.  For example, in aces, bend the corners a bit.  Doing this is not strong, otherwise the rest will notice the marks.  If the deck is alien, the marks will not be difficult to apply during the game.  Additionally, sixes are tagged with a fingernail.  And when they surrender to themselves they are not put, they become noticeable. </p>

    <h2>  More cards - a chance to win </h2><p>  I wonder how quietly cheating in "Fool"?  The odds at the beginning of the game will give a few additional cards when dealing.  In this case, you can make the opponent take the cards and increase the number of trump cards at home.  But only at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the game the extra cards will become a useless balance and the advantages will pass to the opponent.  This is done imperceptibly from the rest: to captivate those who are in the room with conversation or to puzzle with some question.  Cards hide like this: unfold the remaining six with a fan, and place the additional ones in the palm of your hand parallel to it. </p>
