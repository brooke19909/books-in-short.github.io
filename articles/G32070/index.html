This island is so small that it is depicted only on the topographic plans of the city of Kas.  The size of this piece of land is just miserable - only four and a half square kilometers.  At the same time, it is one of the most visited islands of Turkey by tourists.  What attracts them so much?  This will tell our article.  We will tell you many secrets: how to get to Kekova, where to stay and what to see.  But in order to see what follows, you need to know the history of this place.  Without this, the island will remain in your memory as a rock dried by the sun and salt spray, like other uninhabited <span>islands of the Mediterranean Sea.</span>  We will tell you the story of Kekova, which ended in the seventh century of our era, a tragedy.  But it was the earthquake that destroyed the ancient city (and markedly "corrupted" the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island) that gave archaeologists such rich material for research. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Kekova </h2><p>  Many yacht tours in Turkey (reviews are unanimous in this matter) include visits to this island in their program.  And a lone traveler is better off joining one of them.  It is better that the tour was not on an ordinary yacht or boat, but on a boat with a transparent bottom.  Go here from Kemer.  From other resorts of the Mediterranean Riviera of Turkey, ships also depart for Kekova.  Sometimes travel is dedicated only to this island.  But more often the excursion is called "Demre - Mira - Kekova" and provides for alternate visits to all these places.  The cost depends on the point of departure.  For example, from Goynuk it costs about $ 25.  But reviews claim that a boat trip is worth the money.  This price includes lunch and rental equipment for snorkeling.  Separately, you need to pay extra for entering the Church of St. Nicholas in the World.  The island is administratively owned by the Turkish city of Kash.  From May to October, there are ferries to the island.  Travel time is an hour, the cost is 85 lira for a round trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  On the map of Turkey there is also no city of Dolichist.  Officially, the island is considered uninhabited.  However, in the summertime (or rather, while the ferry runs), small family-run guest houses with gorgeous views from the windows work on Kekovo.  They are very expensive and mainly serve divers.  Scuba diving in the waters of the island of Kekova has been prohibited since 1990, when the ruins of the ancient sunken city were recognized as state-protected territory.  But now this ban is partially lifted.  Swimming, and even more scuba diving, is impossible only directly in the ruins of a sunken city.  But in the vicinity of the island there are many other no less interesting dive sites.  In addition to the ancient cities, you can sail here on the decks and cabins of the Iberian Coast ship, which sank in 2003. </p><h2>  Kekova Island (Turkey): history </h2><p>  What happened here, why did the residents of the city, taking only the most necessary things, leave the island in such a hurry?  To do this, you need to know the history of these places.  On the north side of the island was the city of Dolichist, laid down by the Lycians.  It was a developed civilization.  In the city there were two- and even three-story houses, baths, tanks for collecting water, sewage.  During the time of Alexander the Great, the inhabitants of Dolichist supported the young king.  Archaeologists have established that at first only military men lived on the island and in the city.  After all, Dolichist was a fortified port.  The garrison families lived on a neighboring island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But after the campaigns of Alexander the Great, Dolichist turned into a full-fledged city.  Beautiful, mosaic-decorated buildings began to be built.  The first cataclysm happened in the second century AD.  The city was significantly damaged, and part of the island went under water.  But life here did not stop.  Although the heyday is over.  Christianity even came to the city.  At the southern end of the island of Kekova you can see the preserved abscess of the Romanesque basilica.  But in the seventh century the city came to an end.  A new earthquake, even more powerful, completely destroyed Dolichist.  Residents in fear fled and did not return to their homes. </p>

    <h2>  Further history of Dolichist </h2><p>  For some time, the deserted island was inhabited by Hermits - Christian hermits.  The island officially belonged to Byzantium.  But between the first and second earthquakes, the city has already lost its former significance.  In addition, these lands became the object of attack by the Arabs. </p><p>  And in the XIII century the island was conquered by the Turks.  They called him Caravola.  But no one populated the ruins of a half-submerged city.  This was another gift to archaeologists.  Indeed, when new houses are erected on antique ruins (often from old building materials), then it is difficult to determine how it all looked in antiquity.  And then a small piece of land passed along with the mainland coast from one state to another, but at the same time, no side of the military conflicts really used it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After World War I, Kekova Island and the sunken city on it became the subject of disputes between Turkey and Italy.  According to the 1932 Convention, this territory was ceded to the first state. </p>

    <h2>  The modern island of Kekova </h2><p>  Strange, but archaeologists have not yet studied enough of these places.  Excavations were carried out, but somehow sporadically.  To protect these priceless artifacts from the "black archaeologists", the Turkish government banned swimming and diving there.  But this restriction applies only to a small area.  However, the sunken city of Dolichist cannot be called such in the full sense of the word.  Some part of it, although insignificant, rises above the surface of the water.  The island after the earthquake is a narrow strip of land, stretching for seven kilometers.  The highest point is 188 meters above sea level.  But many attractions turned out to be under water. </p>

    <h2>  What can be seen today </h2><p>  Some cities are very ancient.  But you will not notice this under the asphalt of the new boulevards.  Is it worth going somewhere to see the sign ‚ÄúThere was a medieval rampart‚Äù or a modern reconstruction of an ancient gate?  But this is not the island of Kekova!  The sunken city appears before the eyes of amazed tourists in all its ancient splendor. </p><p>  Dolichist occupied a small mountain.  Therefore, its upper part has not sunk, but still rises above the surface of the water.  The streets, stairs steps go into the depths.  The sea here is so transparent that you can see all the artifacts resting at the bottom.  And the depth from the earthquake was decent - seven meters off the coast of the island.  A ship with a transparent bottom floats above the main street of the city.  She once walked along a hillside.  You can see the terms with washing cabins, the ruins of houses and even tiled fragments of amphoras, in which residents stored olive oil and wine.  Very close to the coast, at a shallow depth, you can see the port.  From the storms, the harbor was once protected by a stone breakwater in the form of the letter L. Sailing over the city, you can see statues, sidewalks, embankments. </p>

    <h2>  Diving </h2><p>  We mentioned that diving near Dolichist is strictly prohibited.  But this is not the whole island of Kekova (Turkey).  The earthquakes formed interesting underwater caves.  There are some interesting dive sites here. </p><p>  When Yves Cousteau was filming his famous series, then near Kekova he found the remains of an ancient ship that plowed the waters of the Mediterranean Sea in the XIV century BC.  A priceless artifact was lifted from the bottom. </p><p>  But divers have a new object for research - a ship sank in 2003, a length of 72 meters.  In the dive site The Wall you can, in addition to interesting marine life, see almost whole antique amphorae. </p><p>  Antrum has many cliffs and caves.  The most interesting of them is Blue <span>Cave.</span>  <span>The cave</span> with many transitions and halls is filled with marvelous blue color. </p><p>  If you move away from the island of Kekova (Turkey), then you will get to the site for divers Lighthouse ("Bright House").  Here you can also see many amphorae, anchors, other artifacts from antiquity.  Colorful fish, crabs, octopuses and turtles can be viewed on sites at the southern tip of the island. </p>

    <h2>  Antique heritage </h2><p>  The sunken city on Kekova is not the only historical attraction of these parts.  On the coast of the mainland, not so far from Dolichist, there were other ancient cities: Simena (now the village of Kalekoy), Teymussa (Uchayz) and Aperlai.  They survived the earthquake, but from large cities turned into small villages. </p><p>  Scientists give a cripple seven thousand years.  The Lycian necropolis has only partially sunk, and you can see the tombs of the ancient Simena protruding above the water.  The Roman amphitheater in this city was carved right in the rock.  The ruins of a pagan temple have also been preserved.  And on the top of the hill rises the Byzantine fortress. </p><p>  Lycian sarcophagi can be seen for free in Uchaiz.  To do this, go from the village an incomplete kilometer to the east. </p><p>  In the gulf of the city of Kas is another ancient city - the once powerful Aperlai.  From that time, the ruins of a fortress, walls, columns and sarcophagi decorated with inscriptions and bas-reliefs reached us.  The Byzantine Empire left its mark here in the form of the ruins of a church and three square watchtowers. </p><h2>  Tour reviews </h2><p>  A trip to the island of Kekova - a sunken city, sailing on a yacht with a glass bottom, walking along the ruins of ancient cities - tourists usually like it.  The excursion program also includes swimming in the surrounding waters (but not in the area where artifacts are located) and lunch on board the ship. </p>
