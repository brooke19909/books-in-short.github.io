  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Set-top boxes for TVs: device features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The TV set-top box has long established itself as a device that provides high-quality and comfortable viewing of programs.  But before, the use of these devices was not an obligatory attribute of relaxation on a television screen.  A TV user could choose between watching analog broadcasts and broadcasting in a new, digital format.  Now, set-top boxes for the TV have become much more important.  Analog TV in our country is living out its last days.  And very soon, namely from the summer of this year, viewing channels in the old format will be impossible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.qoo10.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="set top box" class="if uuid-3167537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167537.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, everyone who cannot imagine their life without spending evenings in an armchair in front of a blue screen will have to think about purchasing a tuner (it is also a receiver, set-top box or digital television receiver). </p><h2>  Who doesn‚Äôt need it? </h2><p>  Those who have a liquid-crystal or plasma TV in the house should look into its instructions, as they are often available with built-in digital receivers.  If you have such a characteristic, you can not buy a separate set-top box for the TV. </p><h2>  note </h2><p>  But even if there is an indication in the instructions or on the packaging from the equipment that it is capable of broadcasting digital television, one should not be prematurely happy.  It is necessary that the tuner was designed specifically for receiving a signal in the DVB-T2 format.  Such broadcasting is currently operating throughout Russia.  Currently, two multiplexes are being displayed, that is, sets of several channels.  In total, free digital television broadcasting in our country currently provides the opportunity to watch two dozen programs.  In addition, three TV stations can ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a TV set-top box: Mayak, Radio of Russia, and Vesti FM in digital format. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="rainbowflag.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tv antenna" class="if uuid-3167543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167543.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that there are very few models of radios designed to listen to digital broadcasts.  Therefore, the TV set-top box for the TV remains the only device for this purpose, which can be purchased at any hardware store.  Recently, a news broadcast announced the possible launch of another television channel called Victory this spring specializing in films and programs about the Great Patriotic War.  Its creation is dedicated to the upcoming 75th anniversary of the Great Victory. </p><h2>  Irreplaceable assistant </h2><p>  <span>TV set-top boxes for TV</span> help to make leisure time interesting due to the presence of some of them with a number of useful functions. </p><p>  For example, they can be used to record TV shows.  Therefore, if your favorite show goes at an uncomfortable time for you, you still won‚Äôt have to skip it.  It is only necessary to connect an external information storage device (or, in a simple "flash drive") to the tuner and set the recording timer at the right time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makemoneyoline3.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash card" class="if uuid-3167547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167547.jpg"></div><p>  Now in the hours of leisure you do not need to constantly switch channels in search of something interesting, but you can watch an interesting program stored on the memory card.  Television shows are often not broadcast live.  Therefore, there is not much difference between watching them on the air or from a flash drive.  It is only necessary to always have at hand a drive of sufficient volume. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Set-top box for the TV.  Device Reviews </h2><p>  After examining the comments about the quality of certain models of digital tuners, we can conclude that the most popular receivers are currently Lumax, BBK, REMO.  A brief overview of the products of these three firms will be presented below.  Lumax receivers in many ratings rank first in popularity among television digital receivers.  The price of these set-top boxes for the TV can not be called the lowest.  But users often write that its value is worth it.  Among the most expensive models of this company, among other convenient options, there is the possibility of connecting to the World Wide Web.  What is it for?  Firstly, a Wi-Fi connection allows you to watch videos from the You Tube website.  And here, as you know, you can find a lot of interesting things.  Secondly, buyers of such models get free access to the Lumax branded cinema.  Watching movies from this resource also requires a Wi-Fi connection. </p><p>  TV sets manufactured under the brand of REMO have their own unique feature.  Some models of such devices are sold complete with a room TV antenna.  This allows you not to worry about its compatibility with a <span>digital television receiver.</span>  In addition, manufacturers promise that their products are highly resistant to warm and cold temperature conditions.  Set-top boxes for BBK TV - also have several advantages.  They have a set of useful features, such as time shift, recording, and so on.  The price of the set-top box for the TV of this manufacturer is not very high. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prefix connectors" class="if uuid-3167531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167531.jpg"></div><p>  A set-top box can be bought at the nearest hardware store.  Or order it on one of the specialized sites, of which there are a huge number on the World Wide Web. </p>
