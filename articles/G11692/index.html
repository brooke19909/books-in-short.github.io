The sites offer many accommodation options - luxury hotels and budget capsule hotels, houses and apartments.  Let's try to figure out which hotels the city in the kingdom of Thailand - Pattaya offers travelers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya - view from the observation deck" class="if uuid-2747787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101172/2747787.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattaya - a resort on the shore of the Gulf of Thailand </h2><p>  On the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand is one of the most popular and most visited resorts in Thailand - the city of Pattaya.  More recently, this seaside town did not have the best fame, and mostly single men and male companies traveled here in search of adventure. </p><p>  But in the new century, the government of the kingdom was seriously concerned about the destruction of such an unpleasant image of Pattaya and its transformation into a family resort.  Here adults and children, men and women, single people and companies will find what to do.  And they will all enjoy their stay in one of the best parts of the world. </p><h2>  Where is Pattaya located </h2><p>  The resort is located 150 km southeast of Bangkok.  The journey from the country's main airport to the hotel takes about an hour and a half.  So, living in Pattaya, you can make an excursion to the capital of the kingdom and visit the sights in just one day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near the city is the island of Koh Lan, a boat trip which takes 40 minutes by public ferry.  And here you are waiting for beaches with white sand and clear water. </p><p>  In hotels in Pattaya you will find excellent service, a large selection of rooms, green areas, pools and beaches, children's clubs and delicious breakfasts. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.9235557" data-lng="100.88245510000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/0/0/1/8001.png"></div><h2>  How to choose a hotel </h2><p>  Travelers have different needs and requirements, so before choosing a hotel, decide on the criteria. </p><p>  If you are a lonely young man, traveling in the company of the same young friends and want to have a budget vacation in Thailand, take a look at hostels, inexpensive 2-3 star hotels or apartments in a condominium for short term rent. </p><p>  For a couple, a hotel in a secluded place with a green area and cozy restaurants in the neighborhood will be a good choice.  Evening walks along the promenade or the beach will become unforgettable memories in the future and the opportunity to once again be together, enjoying an exotic vacation. </p><p>  Families with children will find hotels in Pattaya with children's clubs, swimming pools, zoos and even a free water park.  You can stay in a family suite or rent a villa by the sea.  And the breakfasts provided by the hotels will satisfy the most fastidious kid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelbaraquda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel room" class="if uuid-2747782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101172/2747782.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose a hotel room </h2><p>  Resort hotels offer rooms for single tourists, couples, families with children and companies.  If you are traveling with a child, pay attention to the availability and cost of a berth for the baby.  As elsewhere in Thailand, Pattaya hotels often receive small visitors for free, or for an extra charge, they are accommodated in an extra bed. </p><p>  When you check in with a baby up to two years old, you do not need to pay for it if he sleeps with his parents.  A special bed for the baby can be ordered.  It is necessary to say this to the tour operator or directly at the hotel.  This can be done when checking in or ordering through the site.  It is better to clarify in advance whether this service is paid, since often hotels by default provide cradles for travelers with children, without requiring money. </p><p>  A child older than 12 years old or a third adult is allowed to be placed on an additionally installed or existing bed.  This usually costs less than the main place for another adult. </p><p>  A group of tourists - a large company or a family - can choose a room with one or more bedrooms, a bungalow or a villa, which will comfortably accommodate all travelers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another important criterion when choosing a room in a Pattaya hotel will be the view from the window.  It can both decorate your vacation and spoil it.  Many hotels offer the same type of room with a view of the garden or the sea, city or mountains.  The cost of rooms also depends on what you see in the hotel window. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tommyooi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Holiday Inn" class="if uuid-2747784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101172/2747784.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional services in hotels </h2><p>  Attracting tourists, hotels offer additional services for residents.  For a fee, you will receive half board or three meals a day in the hotel restaurant.  This is a great opportunity for those who do not want to think about where to eat or feed their family during the whole vacation, as well as for hotels remote from civilization. </p><p>  Free use of the kids club, pool towels, water slides and the hotel's beach.  Having paid a little, you can hire a nanny for the baby, order flowers or fruits in your room.  Hotels provide airport transfers and boat transfers to a hotel located on the island. </p><p>  Many hotels make pleasant surprises for their guests on the occasion of their birthday or wedding.  It can be flowers, fruits or sweets. </p><p>  Often at the hotel you can book an excursion, rent a motorbike or bicycles, visit the fitness center or treat yourself to spa treatments.  Employees invite to master classes for children and adults, organize entertainment events and parties and do everything to make tourists relax comfortable and enjoyable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalgardenhotelmilano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breakfast in the hotel room" class="if uuid-2747788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101172/2747788.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Rating </h2><p>  The <span>rating of the best hotels in Pattaya</span> below is compiled according to the TripAdvisor Travel Resource.
