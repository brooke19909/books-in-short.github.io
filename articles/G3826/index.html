Trading platform for "Forex" MetaTrader 4</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Indicators of trading sessions for MT4 in trading is one of the most important parameters.  Each time period has its own characteristics, characteristics, market liquidity and volatility.  The future profitability or loss for the currency speculator also depends on all these parameters.  Therefore, traders and experts have specially developed tools for certain market phases and trading sessions. </p><h2>  Types and working hours of trading sessions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fxdayjob.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="trading session indicator" class="if uuid-3209262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3209262.jpg"></div><p>  When making money in the financial markets, as in any other business, it is imperative to take into account a variety of external factors in order to understand how to trade Forex correctly.  The trader devotes the greatest time to developing and testing the trading technique with which he plans to earn in the future.  In his strategy, he takes into account a variety of parameters ranging from market phases (consolidation, trend, accumulation, impulse movement, flat) and ending with the time period for which his technique is created. </p><p>  All traders know that depending on the market condition, a certain strategy is chosen, which necessarily takes into account in which trading session the market is currently located.  The greatest movement, according to traders, occurs during the London and American sessions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Opening hours of trading sessions (Moscow time +3 GTM): </p><ol><li>  Asia - from 03:00 - 11:00. </li><li>  Europe - from 09:00 - 17:00. </li><li>  America - from 16:00 - 24:00. </li><li>  Oceania - from 01:00 - 09:00. </li></ol><p>  This is a winter time schedule, for the summer period you need to add plus 1 hour.  As you can see from the schedule on the "Forex" there are 4 trading sessions. </p><h2>  Features of trading periods </h2><p>  The beginning of each trading day in the financial market is the Asian session.  It is she who opens the auction.  Asia is characterized by reduced volatility and the market is at that time in a calm state.  During the Asian session, there are never strong impulses or big trends.  During this period of time, the movement in many currencies is quite predictable, they are traded in the lateral range, thus forming a flat. </p><p>  Europe and America are the main engines of the market.  It is during the European session that there is a strong movement and big trends, often which go into the long term.  If the trader has determined the right direction of quotes, then he can get the maximum daily profit (for the short-term) and further increase in profit in the long term. </p><p>  The trading day ends with an Ocean session, which is also characterized by low volatility and predictability of market movements. </p><h2>  Session Indicators </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to trade forex" class="if uuid-3209210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3209210.jpg"></div><p>  Quite often, traders are so keen on trading that they forget to control sessions.  In trading, the opening and closing of a period is a very important parameter, since many techniques are designed for certain market phases.  Experts, developers, or simply experienced traders specially create tools that allow you to remember about trading sessions.  And that means, in time to open or fix positions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most often, trading session indicators for MT4 are created, as MetaTrader is one of the most popular trading platforms.
