    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  <span>Villa Danica</span> is located in a quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Budva, which has long been considered the real tourist capital of Montenegro.  This mini-hotel is located away from the city center, so here you will not be disturbed by the noise of night bars and discos, which are regularly complained by guests who prefer to stay in hotels closer to the main attractions.  You can quite easily walk to the Old City in 25-30 minutes.  If you wish, you can take a taxi.  The distance from the villa to the beach is about 700 meters.  On the way you will find many shops and bakeries where you can buy fresh berries and fruits, as well as magnificent and fragrant pastries and, if necessary, drinks and ice cream. </p><p>  As for the distance from the airports, it should be said that Montenegro is a small country, so everything is pretty close here.  So, the nearest airport to Budva is in Tivat, 15 km away.  Most tourists in the summer are in this airborne harbor.  There is another airport located in the capital of Montenegro - Podgorica.  The distance to it from Budva is about 40 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="villa danica cat c" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/805133.jpg" width="600"></div>

All rooms have the necessary furniture, a private bathroom, a TV with Russian-language channels.  Wi-Fi is available in public areas.  Each apartment also has a small fully equipped kitchen.  Please note that <span>beach towels</span> are not provided here.

    <h2>  Infrastructure and entertainment </h2><p>  Since Villa Danica is a very small institution, it does not provide any entertainment for its guests.  However, it was not without reason that Budva was called the queen of tourism, because here every traveler will find something to do.  So, in this city there are many nightclubs and discos, a variety of restaurants and cafes.  In the Old Town there is a fortress with a museum where tourists like to roam.  In addition, in numerous tour agencies you can book a trip to any part of the country.  As for the beaches of Budva, here you will also find a lot of water activities for every taste. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Danica Montenegro" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/805131.jpg" width="600"></div>

Especially demanding guests to come here, according to tourists, is not worth it.  After all, living here is quite inexpensive, so you should not hope for luxury apartments and high-class service. </p><p>  In general, the rooms, although not large, are pretty comfortable.  There is everything you need, even a small kitchen with utensils.  Experienced travelers recommend staying in apartments on the second floor, if possible, as they have separate balconies.  Some guests were embarrassed by the presence in the bathroom not of a full-fledged shower or bath, but of a tray with a curtain.  However, this feature is characteristic of many economy-class hotels both in Montenegro and in other European countries. </p><p>  Now we find out what the guests think about the location of Villa Danica (Cat. C).  Budva is a small town, so by and large the location of the hotel does not really matter here.  As for the villa in question, its location is considered by many to be very advantageous.  So, tourists say that it took them no more than 10 minutes to get to the beach, and you could walk to the city center in a quarter of an hour with a quick step. </p>
