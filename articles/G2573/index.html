Among all the local resorts I want to highlight Nha Trang, and among the dozens of its hotels - Luxury Nha Trang 3 *?  According to the numerous reviews of tourists who have already visited it, this budget hotel can easily be assigned four stars, as it offers comfortable rooms and impeccable living conditions.  We add that Nha Trang stands out among similar Vietnamese resorts for the most favorable climate, therefore, choosing a tour here, you really will give yourself a unique trip. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Luxury Nha Trang 3 * is located in a wonderful place.  The geography of Vietnam is not so well known to our compatriots, as, for example, the geography of Turkey.  But this is one of the main issues that determine whether a vacation is successful or not.  Recall that the territory of Vietnam with a narrow strip 1700 km long borders the eastern end of <span>the Indochina peninsula,</span> washed by the South China Sea.  Such a significant length from north to south is ‚Äúguilty‚Äù of the fact that the climatic conditions in the country's resorts are very different.  We invite you to the most comfortable resort, where the weather is created not only by the sea, but also by a mountain range that protects the area from adverse air masses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Luxury Nha Trang 3" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1540764.jpg" width="500"></div>  It is called Nha Trang, or in Vietnamese Nha Trang.  By local standards, this is a fairly large city, which is the capital of Khanh Hoa province.  If you mentally divide Vietnam into two equal parts, approximately in the middle of the south, Khanh Hoa will be located, and almost in its very center, on the banks of a beautiful bay, Nha Trang is located.  Opposite the city, separated by narrow stripes of the sea, are picturesque islands, the most famous of which is Winperl.

Across the road is a hypermarket where everything that the soul wants is sold.  Not far from  D. Station and the main market, which in 5 minutes takes any taxi.  Bars, cafes and entertainment centers are located near the hotel, as well as in the center of Nha Trang.  All this diversifies the rest and makes it acceptable in all seasons. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is most convenient to fly from Russia to Kamran Airport, located in the town of the same name, which is 36 km from Nha Trang.  There used to be a military base here, but since 2009 it has been operating as a peaceful international airport, receiving flights from dozens of Russian cities in the season.  From the airport you can drive to the hotel by transfer of the meeting party or by taxi on your own, which will cost 18 y.  e. On a minibus, the cost of the trip will cost about 6.5.  e. Travel time takes almost an hour by transfer and half an hour by taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamran Airport" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1540753.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Luxury <span>Nha Trang</span> Hotel 3 * belongs to the urban category, so there is no large territory with a tropical plant garden and developed infrastructure.  The hotel was built in 2011, so for now everything is new and working fine in it.  There are two buildings on the territory (5 floors each).  These buildings are called "A" and "B".  Outwardly, both of them are quite stylish and modern, but the internal arrangement varies greatly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Case "A" is more expensive, and therefore more comfortable.  Its rooms offer sea views.  Case "B" is a budget.  The rooms in it are more modest, and the views from the windows to the neighboring school, the roofs of houses and the city block.  Relocation from ‚ÄúB‚Äù to ‚ÄúA‚Äù costs from 150 y.  e. </p><p>  In addition to buildings that occupy the lion's share of the hotel, it has a medium-sized pool.  It is surrounded by tropical palm trees and other vegetation, "living" in pots.  This greenery creates a cheerful look and feel of being in an overseas resort.  Near the hotel there is a busy road without traffic lights, separating it from the beach.  In front of the main entrance there is a parking spot for motorbikes and cars. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Luxury Nha Trang 3 * due to its low stardom cannot boast a rich infrastructure.  In the beautifully decorated lobby, decorated with Vietnamese flavor, the reception is located.  They speak Vietnamese and a little English.  Only the representatives of travel agencies working with Russian tourists know the Russian language.  At the reception you can exchange currency, buy a tour, call a taxi, leave luggage for storage, arrange for washing personal items, rent a motobike or bicycle.  Prices for this service are the same as in the city. </p><p>  The hotel offers a conference room with the necessary equipment for work for a business price.

    <h2>  Adult Service </h2><p>  Since the hotel is located in an excellent location, namely in the center of the resort life of Nha Trang, Luxury Nha Trang 3 * and for adults does not seek to offer a wide range of services.  Mostly guests go to have fun in the city.  The hotel can spend leisure time in the pool, which is especially true when there is a storm at sea.  Around the pool there are always a lot of free sun loungers and umbrellas, but you have to rent or buy towels.  In addition, the hotel has a pretty good spa, where quality massage is performed.  There is also a fitness room.  Animation at the hotel is not provided. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Vietnam is a country of the subtropical zone, so it is always summer here.  But there is also a change of seasons on the coast of the South China Sea, which is fundamentally important to consider when planning a trip to Luxury Nha Trang Hotel 3 *.  Nha Trang is famous for its beautiful beaches, one of which lies across the busy road from the hotel.  There are no traffic lights on it, but drivers, as a rule, allow pedestrians to cross it.  The beach is clean, sandy with large shells and crabs near the coast, spacious, why quite calm.  Sunbeds and umbrellas on it are paid, but they are rented for the whole day, so you can leave the beach, for example, for lunch, and return to your sunbed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Luxury Nha Trang Hotel 3 Nha Trang" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1540758.jpg" width="508"></div>  The sea here is turquoise blue, the water is warm (even in January it is +22 ¬∞ C, and in summer it is + 28 ¬∞ C).
