The offices of this institution are located in different cities of the country, so its customers are residents of various regions.  Citizens often face disrespect from the organization‚Äôs employees, overpriced prices and poor quality of services.  Initially, in such events, a complaint should be made to Rostelecom, and if the management of this institution does not take any action, then complaints can be sent to different state bodies. </p><h2>  Reasons for making a claim </h2><p>  Claims to Rostelecom may be made by citizens for various reasons.  Most often complaints are formed for the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  poor quality of the Internet provided, for example, low speed or regular network outages; </li><li>  poor quality home telephone service; </li><li>  television operation with constant failures; </li><li>  inflated prices for various services; </li><li>  unauthorized connection by employees of Rostelecom of various additional and paid services; </li><li>  changing the terms of the contract unilaterally, which usually leads to an increase in the cost of the services provided; </li><li>  boorish attitude on the part of company employees; </li><li>  lack of response to applications left due to interruptions in the operation of television, the Internet or a home telephone; </li><li>  refusal to disconnect from the network after the customer left the application. </li></ul><p>  In the above situations, people can leave a complaint, expecting that there will be a positive reaction from the management of the organization.  A complaint to Rostelecom can be filed in print or in manuscript.  Additionally, you can make an electronic appeal, which is considered in a short period of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to write a claim in Rostelecom" class="if uuid-3248671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3248671.jpg"></div><h2>  Drawing up an electronic complaint </h2><p>  You can make a complaint to Rostelecom in a different way, but it‚Äôs most important to use a special electronic form.  To do this, it is enough to follow simple steps: </p><ul><li>  Initially, you need to go to the official website of Rostelecom. </li><li>  At the bottom of the main page there is an item called ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù. </li><li>  You need to click on it, as a result of which a new page opens with the claim form. </li><li>  Information about the applicant and the identified problem are entered into this form. </li><li>  If any important information is missing, then the institution may refuse to consider such a complaint. </li><li>  The reason for making the statement is given, and various facts related to poor-quality services, poor service or other problems are stated. </li><li>  After filling in all the fields, a request is sent for consideration to specialists of the institution. </li></ul><p>  Such an application is not considered an official complaint, since it is presented only by a regular request, on the basis of which the client of the institution asks for help from Rostelecom employees.  But in this way, each person can express their negative emotions regarding the services provided and the service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How can I file a complaint? </h2><p>  If a person wants to write a claim, which will be given an official response, then it should be compiled in a standard way.  The document is generated in the name of the head of this organization. </p><p>  How to file a claim with Rostelecom?  You can perform this process in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  personal visit to the office of the institution with two copies of the claim; </li><li>  sending a complaint by mail, but for this you need to use a registered letter and a notification of delivery. </li></ul><p>  Each option has its own characteristics, and most often people prefer to contact Rostelecom branches on their own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravodoc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostelecom equipment" class="if uuid-3248661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3248661.jpg"></div><h2>  How to personally submit a complaint to a manager? </h2><p>  Initially, you need to take the claim form ‚ÄúRostelecom‚Äù, which is freely available in the office of the institution.  Additionally, such a complaint can be made in any form.  The following actions are performed: </p><ul><li>  a suitable department of the institution is selected; </li><li>  the schedule of work of this organization is being specified; </li><li>  you need to come to the department and wait for your turn; </li><li>  an application is prepared on the basis of the sample; </li><li>  the complaint is handed over to the employee of Rostelecom or the direct manager of the organization; </li><li>  you need to have two copies with you, as one document is handed over to the specialist, and the second one is marked with acceptance. </li></ul><p>  Practice shows that employees of Rostelecom promptly respond to official complaints, therefore they contact the applicant within a few days.  By law, a response to a complaint to Rostelecom is given within 30 days.  The procedure is carried out in writing, so the response is sent to the address of the client. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A sample claim with Rostelecom can be studied below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rostelecomguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="claim to Rostelecom for recalculation" class="if uuid-3248660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3248660.jpg"></div><h2>  Service Complaint </h2><p>  There are no standards on the basis of which it is necessary to make a claim for poor quality of service.  Therefore, many people use an arbitrary form.  In order for such a claim to be officially considered by Rostelecom, several rules should be taken into account: </p><ul><li>  data is provided on the direct organization to which this application is sent; </li><li>  information about the subscriber is indicated; </li><li>  competently describes the problem that arose in the process of customer service by company employees; </li><li>  customer requirements that are usually associated with the elimination of the identified problem are given; </li><li>  date and signature are put. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to additionally leave links to regulations governing the interaction of citizens with different companies that provide related services. </p><h2>  What to do if the terms of the agreement are changed unilaterally? </h2><p>  Rostelecom tariffs change quite often, but customers of this organization do not always perceive innovations positively.  Therefore, often the specialists of the institution unilaterally change the provisions of the agreement drawn up with the client.  This is a significant violation of the law, as it leads to the fact that a citizen has to use the new tariff at an inflated price. </p><p>  Under such conditions, a claim is first filed with Rostelecom for recalculation.  If the organization‚Äôs specialists do not respond to this complaint, you will have to apply to various state bodies. </p><p>  Such complaints are considered by representatives of the Federal Antimonopoly Service and Rospotrebnadzor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stac.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="claim to Rostelecom sample" class="if uuid-3248665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3248665.jpg"></div><h2>  Application Rules </h2><p>  The claim to Rostelecom for imposed services, disgusting services or recalculation is made according to one algorithm.  Only the reasons for its formation change.  The complaint must be correctly formulated in order to receive a timely and detailed answer.  Therefore, it necessarily includes information about the organization that violated the terms of the contract.  Clearly identified violations and customer requirements. </p><p>  If a person can prove his case with the help of specific documents, then they are necessarily attached to the claim in Rostelecom. </p><h2>  How to find out about the solution? </h2><p>  Complaints to Rostelecom should be considered within a maximum of 30 days, but in practice, such applications are recorded for a rather long time.  If the application is submitted in electronic form, then a specific number is assigned to it.  Using this number, you can ask the operator of the organization at what stage the complaint is being considered. </p><p>  The response to the complaint arrives at the email address indicated in the application.  If a document was sent to Rostelecom by mail or by personal transfer of the document to an employee of this institution, the answer will be sent in writing to the applicant‚Äôs address. </p><p>  It is advisable to indicate the citizen's phone number during the preparation of the claim.  In this case, the organization‚Äôs employees will send an SMS message containing information that a response has been given to the application. </p><p>  The following is a sample claim with Rostelecom.  Subscribers often have problems with the Internet, and they are also frustrated by additional paid services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ziz17.as-kt.ru.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostelecom claim" class="if uuid-3248659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3248659.jpg"></div><h2>  What if there is no answer? </h2><p>  People using the services of this organization often face various problems and violations on the part of the company's employees.

For example, if a person was forcibly and unilaterally transferred to a more expensive tariff, then you can request the cancellation of such a decision. </p><p>  But if Rostelecom does not respond to the claim, then you will have to seek help from various state bodies.  These include the Federal Antimonopoly Service, the prosecutor's office or the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare. </p><p>  If the equipment of Rostelecom does not work, then first you need to call an employee of this institution to check the operability of the equipment.  If the reason is improper handling, then the citizen will have to pay for repairs himself. </p><h2>  Appeal to the FAS </h2><p>  If Rostelecom‚Äôs tariffs are unilaterally changed, then this is a violation of the client‚Äôs rights, so he may ask for help from representatives of various government bodies.  Initially, it is recommended to make a complaint to the head of the organization.  If the answer is negative or completely absent, then it is advisable to contact the Federal Antimonopoly Service. </p><p>  This organization specializes in protecting competition in Russia.

This government agency considers applications that indicate really gross violations of clients' rights.  Since a person pays for the services of a provider, he can expect to receive quality service.
