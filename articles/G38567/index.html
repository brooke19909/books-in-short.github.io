Voronezh is popularly called the city of students.  However, not only a large number of universities is famous for this settlement, built in the sixteenth century on the banks of the river with the original name Raven.  Industry is quite developed here, so many entrepreneurs and business travelers come to the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Don Voronezh" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/786635.jpg" width="500"></div>  There are many tourists in Voronezh who are interested in seeing the many attractions of the region.

    <h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  For those who have sufficient funds to rent a hotel room in the center of Voronezh, there is no problem.  There are several upscale hotels that offer not only comfortable apartments, but also developed infrastructure.  For several years, many large <span>hotels</span> were built <span>in Voronezh.</span>  The prices for them, according to experts, are quite high, so this cost significantly reduces the number of customers who can afford to rent such apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, a room in the Vetryakov boutique hotel (for one night per person) will cost five thousand rubles.  There are also five-star hotels, the prices of which are somewhat lower.  For example, the art hotel Voronezh offers to pay four thousand three hundred rubles a day for accommodation in a suite (without meals). </p><h2>  3 star hotels </h2><p>  But for managers or middle-class visitors, this price level is not affordable.  Therefore, many of them prefer low-cost hotels in Voronezh or hostels, where you can not only spend the night at a low cost, but also get at least the minimum, but standardly necessary set of services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in the center of Voronezh" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/786634.jpg" width="227"></div>

    <p>  Cheap hotels in the city offer guests an √† la carte dining in their own dining room or cafe, some of which include breakfast.  As a rule, for the most part they offer standard hotel services, such as parking, internet access, a tour and ticket service, including for various events, and also provide ironing facilities.  3 or <span>4 star</span> hotels also have laundry facilities.  Sometimes, despite the fairly affordable cost of living, in such hotels there are additional services, for example, a sauna or a swimming pool, a massage room, a gym, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Budget hotels </h2><p>  The city has a huge number of apartments for rent.  There is also such an option as hostels, in which for <span>five hundred rubles</span> you can get a place in the room.  Those who wish can cook in the shared guest kitchen at some of the mini-hotels.  Depending on the state of the contents of the wallet and preferences in terms of comfort and infrastructure, each guest of the city will be able to find a suitable option for himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Ukraine Voronezh" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/786633.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  Some budget hotels belonging to the economy class, for example, the Don Hotel (Voronezh), offer accommodation in both separate double and multi-bed rooms.  However, not everyone, and especially this applies to those who come to this Russian hinterland for business, want to tolerate the presence of a neighbor.  Such people prefer inexpensive Voronezh hotels that have single rooms.  There are few such options in the city, but nevertheless they are. </p><p>  For example, for those who come on business or on a business trip to Voronezh, the Rossiya hotel will suit this criterion.  As the very first in its class in the city, it offers three room categories. </p><h2>  Hotel "Russia" </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the historical center of Voronezh, close to many architectural monuments.  The proximity of <span>large business centers</span> and administrative institutions, the convenience of transport, within walking distance of a theater, museum and other cultural institutions made it extremely popular among guests of the capital.  The cost of rooms depends on their category.  For a single standard you need to pay two thousand seven hundred rubles per night with breakfast, for a junior suite - three six hundred, and for a suite - five eight hundred. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap hotels of Voronezh" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/786632.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  But not only for those who come on a business trip to Voronezh, the Rossiya Hotel is the best place to stay.  Many tourists who need a room just to spend the night also prefer to stay in it.  This category of residents does not require special chic in the rooms, preferring an inexpensive and modest atmosphere and infrastructure. </p><h2>  Hotel "Ukraine" </h2><p>  Voronezh is a city with a lot of hotels.  Some of them are located directly in its historical center.  The cozy hotel "Ukraine" (Voronezh) was built in such a place at the intersection of Sacco and Vanzetti and Razin streets.  The train station is a ten minute walk.  The hotel offers an excellent urban panorama.  It has stylish rooms, new furniture, air conditioning and heating system.
