He attracts tourists not only with interesting places and sights for history, but also with the natural beauty of the city.  Not every modern urbanized capital in our country can afford this wealth (and be proud of it). </p><h2>  Parks and squares in Cheboksary </h2><p>  On 250 square kilometers of Cheboksary there are several dozen large green parks, small but beautiful squares, beautiful alleys, gardens and even several natural groves.  All this pleases the gaze of local residents and surprises guests of the capital.  Parks and squares are special places for recreation, walks and pastime in the fresh air.  They remind of proximity to nature and allow you to feel this natural connection.  Today we will talk about one of the parks of the capital, which was created in honor of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Cheboksary" class="if" height="146" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1444417.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Park named after the 500th anniversary of Cheboksary </h2><p>  In 1969, when the capital celebrated its 500th anniversary of the appearance on the pages of history, on the Volga coast, next to the Chernyshevsky ravine, the laying of a new park began.  However, its discovery dragged on for almost a decade. </p><h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  Initially, it was planned to allocate a territory of two hundred hectares to the park of the 500th anniversary (Cheboksary) with the aim of placing here a movie hall, a pavilion for exhibitions, a separate reading place, a green theater, a pop stage, a dance area, several sports and playgrounds, a summer restaurant, a cafe and rides.  Only five years after the laying of the park began, in 1974, the executive city committee approved the final plan for this place.  According to this project, the park was territorially halved, and according to the plan, it began to have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly ninety hectares.  Conceived by the approved project took on real forms in the next four years.  The long-awaited opening of the park marked the beginning of 1978.  Then (only in 1981), the Chuvashgrazhdanproekt proposed a well-developed project for the development of this attraction.  The park of the 500th anniversary (Cheboksary) was supposed to be conditionally divided into thematic zones: entrance, cultural and exhibition, a zone for children, sports and recreation, for attractions, as well as for a corner of ethnography. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Park named after the 500th anniversary of Cheboksary as a branch of the Lakreevsky forest </h2><p>  All this time, the park of the 500th anniversary (Cheboksary) belonged to another, large and oldest Cheboksary park of the Lakreevsky forest.  His story is no less interesting.  And since for 19 years the park of the 500th anniversary was under the ‚ÄúLakreevsky‚Äù principle, then mentioning it will be quite appropriate. </p><p>  In 1957, the Lakreevsky Forest park was created on the basis of a real natural oak grove, but it was called differently - the City Park named after the Great October Fortieth.  However, very soon it began to be called as it was before, simply - Lakreevsky forest.  The fact is that earlier (in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), on the site of the modern forest, a huge oak forest stretched far.  All these possessions belonged to one landowner - Fedor Andreevich Lakreev-Panov.  That's where the name came from.  In the future, from this rich oak forest there was only a small massif, on the basis of which the eponymous park appeared. <strong></strong></p><p>  The park of the 500th anniversary (Cheboksary) was under the ‚ÄúLakreevsky‚Äù beginning until 1987, after which it switched to independent maintenance. </p><h2>  Generation Avenue </h2><p>  In 2004, in honor of the 80th anniversary of the Cheboksary authorities, they formed the Generation Avenue in the park‚Äôs possessions.  She was planted with twenty Christmas trees.  This place is recognized as significant in Cheboksary.  Planting these trees in 2004 introduced the tradition of transmitting information about each Christmas tree from one generation to the next, since each tree is a registered tree (in honor of those who planted). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Road to Moscow" </h2><p>  In 2005, a wooden sculpture ‚ÄúRoad to Moscow‚Äù was placed (moved from another place) in the park.  This monument is dedicated to the entry of the Chuvash and <span>mountain Mari</span> by good will into Russia in 1551. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park 500 anniversary of cheboksary" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1444419.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <h2>  The Rose of the World (2008) </h2><p>  An unusual architectural composition with meaning was established in the park in 2008.  This is the "Rose of the world."  It is dedicated to the unity of peoples and cultures.  This is a huge monument, at the bottom of which, at the bottom, is an octahedron with carved sayings about peace, love, kindness and friendship.  In the center of the monument are female figures, they raise a bowl to heaven in the form of a beautiful flower, the petals of which represent multiple denominations, there are more than a dozen of them in Chuvashia, according to official figures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park 500 anniversary cheboksary paintball" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1444416.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Park Improvement </h2><p>  The park now has 13 attractions.  It should be noted that he thought out the entertainment program well enough for its visitors and guests to the park of the 500th anniversary (Cheboksary).  Paintball, shooting at a shooting range, carriage of a horse drawn carriage or sleigh, roller-skating and ice-skating (seasonally), go-karts, motorbikes and others.  Also on the territory there is a separate field for football games and training of sports teams.  Cheboksars and guests of the capital love to come to the park of the 500th anniversary (Cheboksary).  Pergolas and benches for gatherings, and pavilions for trade - everything is ennobled and made for the convenience and comfort of people. </p><h2>  Future plans </h2>

It is assumed that on the basis of this green zone there will be an ethnocomplex called "Amazonia".  According to one of the projects, this complex includes a water park, an aquarium, the Smesharik Land entertainment center, a sports complex and a yacht club.  Plans for the future are quite grandiose, as many are difficult to achieve for a number of reasons.  It is worth noting once again that the plan project is still under consideration and under development.  Whatever the fate of the park, I would like it to perform not only (or even not so much) entertaining functions, but also not lose its natural connection with nature.
