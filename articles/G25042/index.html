After all, benefits for buying an apartment are available only to some people.  Only the state will help them acquire housing.  Who are we talking about, what are the conditions for obtaining benefits, and where to apply if they are nevertheless laid down?  First things first. </p><h2>  Who can take advantage of the benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="prolgoty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Social benefits" class="if uuid-2550322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550322.jpg"></div><p>  Only these categories of citizens have benefits for the purchase of housing.  It: </p><ul><li>  young families; </li><li>  large families; </li><li>  young scientists; </li><li>  young teachers; </li><li>  young workers in the village; </li><li>  military personnel. </li></ul><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth understanding the conditions under which the benefits are granted. </p><h2>  Young families </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vlc.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Government program" class="if uuid-2550320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550320.jpg"></div><p>  A young family means people who have entered into a marriage and not one of the spouses is older than 35 years.  According to the program, families that do not have children can receive a subsidy of thirty percent of the amount of housing.  If there are children in the family (single mothers, single fathers are also considered), then the subsidy increases to thirty-five percent.  But there are nuances: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  At least one spouse must have Russian citizenship. </li><li>  There should be documentary evidence that the spouses do not own housing. </li><li>  The couple should have a marriage certificate in their hands. </li><li>  Spouses must confirm income.  It must be official and allow a mortgage. </li></ol><p>  The subsidy is calculated as follows: </p><ul><li>  for childless families or single-parent families, 42 square meters is considered the norm for life; </li><li>  for families with children, eighteen square meters per person is considered the norm. </li></ul><p>  Next, the required number of square meters is multiplied with the average price in the region and thirty or thirty-five percent are calculated from the result. </p><p>  Do not forget that the benefits of buying an apartment for young families vary in their conditions.  For example, in Moscow, spouses can participate in the program only if one has lived in the city for at least ten years.  For this reason, conditions must be specified in each specific region. </p><p>  A package of documents is submitted to the bank for a mortgage after a certificate of payment has been received.  It has its own validity period.  It is equal to nine months.  You also need to remember that you can receive state aid only once in a lifetime. </p><p>  As with any program, funds are distributed alternately.  Preference is given to large families or those with children with disabilities.  Couples who do not have children are the last to expect to receive benefits when buying an apartment. </p><h2>  Large families </h2><p>  After the birth or adoption of a third child, the family is considered to be large.  For these families, the law "On State Support to Large Families" applies.  This law allows families to apply for a mortgage without a down payment for a period of thirty years.  But that's not all.  A seventy-five percent monthly mortgage payment will be paid by the state.  In the case of the birth of a fourth child, the loan is forgiven. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But benefits for large families when buying an apartment are issued on certain conditions: </p><ul><li>  the family should need housing; </li><li>  the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpurchased housing should be in accordance with the norm; </li><li>  documentary evidence is needed that the family is low-income. </li></ul><p>  There is another option for receiving money for this program when buying an apartment.  You can issue a housing certificate that allows you to pay 90% of the housing.  With this money you can already build a house or buy it, regardless of the number of meters per person. </p><p>  This program also has a queue and the waiting period is approximately a year. </p><p>  Some regions put forward additional conditions for obtaining state aid.  For example, a family must register no later than 2005. </p><h2>  Young scientists </h2><p>  If children and family are somewhere in the future, and all their free time is occupied by science, then we can also count on help in buying an apartment.  Of course, the benefits for buying an apartment for a young family are much larger, but the state also helps scientists. </p><p>  A candidate of science who has not yet crossed the thirty-five year boundary, and a doctor of science who has not reached the age of forty, may well count on benefits.  In addition to the scientific title, it is also necessary to have seniority in an organization engaged in science.  The minimum term is five years.  It would seem that all, but it is not.  The direct employer of the young scientist must confirm that the latter needs housing.  If the scientist has property, then he will have to forget about the subsidy. </p><p>  The payment amount is calculated from the average housing price in the real estate market of the region where the scientist works.  From the full cost, the price of thirty-three square meters is calculated and assistance is paid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The lists of applicants are first approved by the Academy of Sciences, after which the applications are reviewed by the Ministry of Regional Development until January 20th annually.  If the state decided to help the young scientist, he is awarded a certificate that is valid for two months.  During this period it is necessary to apply for a mortgage at any accredited bank. </p><p>  Who issues the certificates: </p><ol><li>  Russian scientific academy. </li><li>  Far Eastern Branch of the Academy of Sciences. </li><li>  Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences. </li><li>  Ural branch of the Academy of Sciences. </li><li>  Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. </li></ol><p>  An important point is that after receiving state aid, a young scientist must work in the same place for another five years.  Upon dismissal under the article, the entire amount of the subsidy is returned. </p><h2>  Young teachers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="prigorodlife.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage for state employees" class="if uuid-2550324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550324.jpg"></div><p>  Another category of those who can count on the state.  The conditions for obtaining are similar to the benefits for buying an apartment for a young family.  The teacher should not be older than thirty-five years old, he should need to improve housing.  In addition, the teacher must also have a working experience of at least three years in a public school.  Only if all the conditions are met can you get a subsidy for an initial mortgage payment.  It will not exceed twenty percent of the price of housing. </p><p>  The program will be available only if the region provides a mortgage with soft loans, which does not rise above nine percent. </p><h2>  Young village workers </h2><p>  People who have not reached the age of thirty-five and who are deliberately going to work in the villages, can count on this help.  What privileges for buying an apartment for a young family are provided by the state, the village workers will receive the same money, only on slightly different conditions. </p><p>  First of all, a signed labor contract is required for a period of at least five years.  If all conditions are met, the employee can receive up to thirty percent of the market price of real estate.  But in case of non-compliance with the employment contract and dismissal, the money is returned back. </p><h2>  Military personnel </h2><p>  This category of citizens has special conditions.  What are the benefits of buying an apartment?  The first thing to note is that the amount of assistance depends on the length of time they serve. </p><p>  You can apply for a subsidy: </p><ol><li>  Military personnel who signed a contract before January 1, 1998, or their families, but need to document the need to improve housing.  This does not include military students or any other educational institutions. </li><li>  Retired military personnel were dismissed for health reasons or reduced.  The term of their service at the time of dismissal should not be less than ten years.  The former military family also has the right to apply for housing improvements. </li><li>  Military personnel whose service experience is not less than twenty years and they live in the office building. </li><li>  Dismissed ten years later due to health conditions, retirement or reduction of military personnel who live in the office space. </li></ol><p>  A subsidy certificate can be used with other government assistance. </p><h2>  Benefits for Senior Citizens </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sudpristav.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax deduction" class="if uuid-2550318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550318.jpg"></div><p>  There are also benefits to pensioners when buying an apartment.  What are they?  This is a tax deduction return.  But for two categories a different system of actions. </p><p>  Working retirees receive <span>tax benefits,</span> like other working citizens.  What does it mean?  Working pensioners, along with other working citizens, pay thirteen percent of the state wages.  Any person who bought a living space can return up to a quarter of a million rubles.  This means that pensioners who have not stopped working can exercise this right in the first year after buying a home.  But such benefits for pensioners when buying an apartment will be available only in the case of official work. </p><p>  Non-working pensioners receive only a pension from which tax is not deductible.  For this reason, until 2012, these people could not claim compensation.  But after the twelfth year, everything changed.  Now non-working pensioners can also receive personal income tax benefits when buying an apartment. </p><p>  Thus, a non-working pensioner can receive a benefit no earlier than in the last three years of payments from the moment of purchasing a home.  But a pensioner will be able to receive this payment only if he has had some kind of official income for the entire time of payments.  For example, if an employee applied for a pension at the end of 2013, and bought real estate in 2014, then he can receive a deduction for the thirteenth, twelfth and eleventh years.  If retirement was earlier than 2012, then the income tax benefit when buying an apartment will be paid only for the eleventh and twelfth years. </p><p>  All these payments have a name - transferring the balance of unused benefits to another time.  When a pensioner ceases to receive official income not from the beginning of the year, he can receive payments only for this year. </p><h2>  How to get income tax benefits </h2><p>  To get an income tax benefit when buying an apartment, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to transfer a 3-NDFL certificate to the tax office located at the place of residence.  It should indicate all sources of income, tax paid and the price of housing.  Along with the certificate, it is necessary to provide an application in the accepted form, a photocopy of the passport, documents on the living space, confirming the property, a certificate of income 2-NDFL during the use of the discount. </li><li>  The tax service documents are carefully checked for several months.  If everything is in order, the tax will transfer the declared amount to the current account. </li><li>  If any inaccuracies or incorrect data are found, an official request is made for more detailed information or a package of documents. </li></ol><h2>  Disability benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroyki-oren.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subsidy for the purchase of an apartment" class="if uuid-2550317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550317.jpg"></div><p>  Privileges for the purchase of an apartment by a disabled person are provided if a person is registered before 2005.  Subsidies are provided by local governments out of turn.  If a disabled person is registered after 2005, then he will be waiting for his turn to benefit. </p><p>  Material assistance is provided to people who have housing problems.  Who belongs to this category: </p><ol><li>  People living in emergency homes. </li><li>  Those who have less than the standard living space. </li><li>  Living with infectious patients. </li><li>  People living in adjacent squares and not related. </li><li>  Those who rent public housing for a long time. </li></ol><p>  Only some diseases allow you to get housing out of turn.  Material assistance is calculated as 18 square meters per person.  The price of the area that is granted to a disabled person is calculated from the average market price.  Relatives of persons with disabilities are not entitled to a separate living space.  If there is more than one disabled person in the family, then the prescribed subsidy is given to everyone. </p><h2>  Benefits for disabled children </h2><p>  Unlike income benefits when buying an apartment, benefits for children with disabilities are prescribed in the Housing Code of our country.  Families with children with disabilities receive housing first.  When the calculated meters are calculated, all family members are taken into account. </p><p>  According to the law, a disabled child must have a separate room, which is not considered an excess area.  Also, such families have the right to receive land for the construction of a private house. </p><p>  In 2014, the category of disabled people was canceled from childhood, it was replaced by a disabled child for those who are not eighteen, and a disabled person for adults.  Those children who entered the category of persons with disabilities from childhood until 2014 enjoy the same rights as children with disabilities. </p><h2>  Fringe benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vsluh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maternal capital" class="if uuid-2550326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550326.jpg"></div><p>  In addition <span>to tax benefits</span> when buying an apartment, benefits to state employees or young families, there are also subsidies that you can get.  These include: </p><ol><li>  Maternal capital.  You can buy a house or pay off your existing mortgage on maternity capital.  It is slightly less than half a million rubles and is provided for the birth of a second child.  If the family decided to pay off the mortgage loan with the help of maternity capital, then they do not need to wait for the third anniversary of the youngest child.  It is important to remember that you cannot buy land on maternity capital, but you can build a house at the expense of maternity capital.  And it‚Äôs not necessary to use the entire amount.  Everything that remains on the account will be there and stored until needed. </li><li>  <span>Benefit to combatants.</span>  All those who have visited the war or in hot spots can get a free apartment.  This also applies to close relatives of the dead, disabled and veterans of the Great Patriotic War.  To obtain housing does not affect the availability of other real estate and financial status.  But there is a caveat: to get free housing out of turn, you must register no later than January 1, 2005. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.cherlock.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benefits for Veterans" class="if uuid-2550321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2550321.jpg"></div><h2>  Nuances of benefits </h2><p>  Each state program has its own nuances.  So, for example, benefits when buying an apartment on a mortgage can be obtained only if the housing costs no more than two million rubles.  In some regions, it rises to three million rubles.  The privilege can be obtained only after a full package of documents confirming the ownership of the living space is provided. </p><h2>  What documents will be needed? </h2><p>  Whatever privileges are provided for buying an apartment, it is important to correctly collect documents.  The standard package includes: </p><ol><li>  Passports, birth certificates or other documents that confirm identity.  Copies and originals of documents of each family member must be provided. </li><li>  Photocopies of work books with stamps of each member of the family. </li><li>  Documents that confirm the right to receive benefits, disability, stay in hot spots. </li><li>  Certificate from the place of registration for the last five years. </li><li>  Marriage or divorce certificate.  For single parents, a document confirming their status. </li><li>  Documents that will be required additionally. </li></ol><h2>  Where to go? </h2><p>  With all the documents collected, a person needs to go to the district administration.  The administration checks the documents and queues for registration.  Then the person writes a statement to receive material support from the state for the purchase of housing.  When the line for the subsidy is suitable, the administration will issue a certificate of financial assistance from the state to a personal account.  After the assistance is provided, the recipient has six months to purchase housing, otherwise the money will have to be returned. </p>
