However, not only athletes come here, but for the most part lovers of a relaxing beach holiday.  Space at the resort is enough for everyone.  Phan Thiet stretched for more than forty kilometers along the coast of the South China Sea.  So, the city has taken over the surrounding villages, among which the most famous is Mui Ne. </p><p>  It annually hosts international surfing competitions.  Every tour operator will say that daredevils who ride on the crest of a wave on the boards, and lovers to soak up the sand and swim in the calm sea, in principle, do not meet in one resort.  But Phan Thiet is unique in that it provides all categories of tourists with a quality (in their understanding) rest.  In this article we will consider the hotel Phu Hai Resort 4 *.  Where it is located, what are its rooms, infrastructure and service - read below.  Our description was built on the reviews of tourists recently vacationing in a hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dulich24.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Phu Hai Resort 4 *" class="if uuid-3226342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226342.jpg"></div><h2>  When to go to Phan Thiet </h2><p>  This resort is located in <span>South Vietnam,</span> and therefore its climate is tropical.  But do not indiscriminately argue that the high tourist season in Phan Thiet falls in the winter months, and showers take place in the summer.  Rather, all this is so.  But a clear sky does not always coincide with the concept of "a good time for a beach holiday."  For example, in February the weather in Phan Thiet is clear and dry.  For the whole month, not a single rain passes, and days with variable cloud cover a maximum of seven.  What is not a good season for beach people?  But there is a nuance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you plan to swim exclusively in the pool, then the winter in Phan Thiet is completely suitable for you.  For it is then that strong winds blow here.  On the one hand, they disperse the terrible heat and reduce air humidity.  But on the other hand, serious waves surge the winds.  These are the same regular shafts that made the capital of surfing the resort.  The weather in Phan Thiet in February is the windiest in the year.  But in the rainy season the sea is completely calm. </p><p>  Of course, going to the tropics in the summer is like playing Russian roulette: it can be a completely clear week with one night rain, or it can pour all the time without stopping.  Experienced travelers are advised to come to Phan Thiet in the off-season: the end of March, April, October and November are the best periods for a beach holiday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dulich24.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Phan Thiet in February" class="if uuid-3226341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226341.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Although the ‚Äúhome port‚Äù of the Phu Hai Resort 4 * hotel is Phan Thiet (Vietnam), it is located closer to the village of Mui Ne.  To the last settlement - only three kilometers, and to the city - as much as 8 km (ten minutes by taxi).  Thus, it can be stated that the rest in the hotel will appeal to those who seek solitude and silence in the bosom of tropical bucolic. </p><p>  Nearby are the same quiet hotels for families with children, couples and senior citizens: Aroma Beach Resort, Amaryllis, Lotus, White Sand, Romana and Victoria.  You can easily get to Mui Ne by taxi, and on a rickshaw, and even if you wish, on foot, along the seashore.  In this village there are a lot of cafes with affordable prices, shops, evening entertainment.  From the city of Ho Chi Minh City with the international airport to the hotel go about 200 kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="10.9401893" data-lng="108.16397460000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/7/5/17675.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Phu Hai Resort 4 * (Phan Thiet, Vietnam) was built in 2001, the last renovation took place in 2017.  By the way, repairs at the hotel take place regularly, and a new one is planned for the rainy season (summer of 2019).  The territory of the hotel is huge - 30 thousand square meters.  Closer to the road is a reception, restaurant and other similar establishments.  At the end, away from the sea, there are four 2-4-story buildings.  They are mainly rooms of a lower price category, but there are also suites. </p><p>  Closer to the sea, among the coconut palms and tropical trees, 38 one-storey villas are scattered.  The buildings are built in the style of European Art Nouveau.  But the bungalows on the exterior resemble traditional Vietnamese huts.  But only outwardly!  Inside they impress with modern comfort.  If the hotel is not 100 percent full, it is possible to upgrade the rooms in the building to the villa.  The territory is very beautiful, it is carefully cleaned.  At certain times, the bushes are treated for insects, so there are no mosquitoes in the hotel. </p><h2>  Phu Hai Resort 4 *: description of rooms in the buildings </h2><p>  The cheapest room category at Phu High Resort is called deluxe rooms.  These rooms are located in two old buildings, and the balcony (or terrace, if this is the first floor) opens onto the garden.  The deluxe suites have everything you need for a quality stay: air conditioning, TV, minibar, hairdryer, electric kettle with daily replenished bags of drinks.  After a day, the maids bring a fruit basket, and they clean there every day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Premium rooms have a large area and a safe.  Studio is a luxurious and spacious apartment with a living area in the bedroom.  Grand deluxe rooms are located in the new building.  Depending on the landscape that opens from the balconies, they are divided into garden view and rooms with ocean views. </p><p>  Most Russian tour operators focus on the lower price segment, selling trips to Vietnam.  The price of this tour starts from 51 thousand rubles in a four-star hotel with breakfast in Mui Ne or Phan Thiet for 8 nights with a flight.  Many tourists mention that they tried to upgrade the villa at the hotel on the spot.  But not everyone succeeded, because bungalows are very popular and are reserved in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phu Hai Resort 4 *: room description" class="if uuid-3226337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226337.jpg"></div><h2>  Villa Overview </h2><p>  One- and two-story bungalows stand apart from each other, creating the illusion of privacy.  They are completely surrounded by greenery.  Those houses that are further away from the sea have balconies and terraces overlooking the garden.  They consist of a bedroom and a separate living room, and the bathroom is partially open-air.  The larger bungalow has a room with two bedrooms, a living room and 2 bathrooms.  A huge terrace with sun loungers adjoins them. </p><p>  The hotel Phu Hai Resort 4 * (Phan Thiet, Vietnam) has bungalows standing right on the edge of the beach.  Valued such rooms are more expensive.  They are also designed to accommodate two, three (with one bedroom) or four guests (with two).  The situation in these villas is more chic than in the rooms.  There are televisions with a large and flat screen, and instead of air conditioning, a split system works.  Guests are offered bathrobes and slippers, cosmetics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phu Hai Resort 4 * - villas" class="if uuid-3226338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226338.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Russian tour operators sell tickets to this hotel, they warn that the price includes only breakfast.  The lion's share of travelers was content with this.  Although you can book half or full board on your own in the restaurant of the Phu Hai Resort 4 * hotel (Phan Thiet, Vietnam) or pay extra for lunches and dinners on site. </p><p>  Tourists have the most pleasant memories of breakfast.  On a morning meal at the hotel you can even eat an unusually delicious Vietnamese pho soup with various additives to your liking.  Also for breakfast, many other hearty dishes are served, which we usually have for lunch: meat and fish with a side dish, stewed vegetables and so on.  Coffee, although from the apparatus, is very tasty, according to the guests. </p><p>  Some tourists ordered dinner at the restaurant at the hotel, because they serve tables right on the beach, in a very romantic setting, under the light of torches.  In order to have lunch outside the walls of the hotel, you don‚Äôt need to go to Fantiet or Mui Ne.  Right outside the gate is a small restaurant serving Vietnamese cuisine: everything is clean, the portions are large, and the prices are lower than in Mui Ne.  There is also a grocery store nearby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kayak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phu Hai Resort 4 * - restaurant" class="if uuid-3226343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226343.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Phu Nai Resort Hotel is located on the first line.  It has its own sandy beach.  Tourists claim that they clean it very carefully, so that you can fearlessly walk barefoot.  Bathing also does not require special shoes, since entering the sea is free from corals.  There is a sandbank on this beach, so the kids have one expanse.  According to tourists vacationing in the summer months, the water in the sea is cloudy and you can‚Äôt swim in the sea with a mask.  And in the high season (for surfers), it‚Äôs scary to approach the water element. </p><p>  In April it is good to swim in the morning and evening, and in the afternoon the wind rises.  The beach in this place is almost deserted, because, apart from a few hotels, there is nothing here.  Loungers enough for everyone.  There are enough of them both on the beach and by the pool.  The swimming tank has a curved lagoon shape and is filled with clean water.  Next to it is the Nautilus Bar.  In the reviews, tourists note that the pool can be used in the evening, when it is beautifully highlighted.  Also there is an artificial waterfall.  As a drawback, tourists say that the hotel does not give out beach towels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phuhairesort.com-muine.website" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Phu Hai Resort 4 * - pool" class="if uuid-3226339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226339.jpg"></div><h2>  The infrastructure of the hotel Phu Hai Resort 4 * </h2><p>  On the vast territory of the hotel there is a tennis court.  Guests can take racquets and balls for the game for free.  For money, only lighting the court in the evening is carried out.  On the outside of the main administrative building there is a secure parking for cars, scooters and bicycles.  You can leave your vehicle there for free.  Also at the hotel there are: </p><ul><li>  laundry, </li><li>  library, </li><li>  SPA-center, </li><li>  gallery of shops </li><li>  currency exchange, </li><li>  ATM, </li><li>  gym, </li><li>  car rental </li></ul><p>  In all rooms - that in the buildings, that in the most remote villas, as well as by the pool and even on the beach, there is free and very fast Wi-Fi for Vietnam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phu Hai Resort 4 * - hotel infrastructure" class="if uuid-3226336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3226336.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  All tourists agree that the service at Phu Hai Resort 4 * is at its best.  Newly arrived guests are welcomed with a welcome cocktail and dessert.  Free services include transfers to Phan Thiet and Mui Ne.  The bus runs four times a day.  Your child can have fun in the playground or in the playroom.  The fitness center has modern fitness equipment. </p><p>  Values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be left in the safe at the reception, which operates around the clock.  There is also a luggage storage room.  The list of paid services is even more extensive.  You will be taken to the airport, at any time delivered to the center of Fantiet.  24 hour room service is available.  Tourists recommend visiting the spa, which has several types of massage and bath treatments. </p><h2>  General reviews </h2><p>  Most of the guests enjoyed their stay at Phu Hai Resort 4 *.  Reviews are full of such expressions as "luxury hotel", "fabulous vacation."  The audience at the hotel is international.  There are only a few Russian tourists, but Chinese groups come here.  No cases of theft in reviews are reported.  Cleaned in a hotel for a solid five.  All staff are smiling and friendly.  But no one speaks Russian.  Although basic knowledge of English will be enough to communicate with the staff. </p>
