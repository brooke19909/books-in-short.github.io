    <p>  Guests are pleased with the prices for accommodation in this hotel, as well as the friendly staff.  But the number of rooms of the "Castle" is not a very pleasant experience for vacationers.  Many write that there are no air conditioners, and the proposed fans are also not available in all rooms.  Plumbing is a bit old and clearly needs replacing.  Guests also note the presence of a large number of insects in the rooms and not very high-quality cleaning, or even its absence. </p>
