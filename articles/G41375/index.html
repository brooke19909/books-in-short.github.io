As a result, the model debuted on the market in a few months.  Indicators such as a four-inch capacitive touchscreen display and a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1 GHz, which the device received, at the time of its release were very impressive.  In this regard, the novelty quickly appeared a large number of fans.  <span>A review of the Sony Xperia</span> P is presented later in this article. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The model is quite comfortable and ergonomic and does not slip out even with a long conversation.  The weight of the device is 120 grams.  As for the dimensions of the smartphone, they can be called optimal, since control is easily carried out with one hand.  The body of the device is made of metal.  At the same time, the build quality of Sony Xperia P is also at a high level. User reviews are further confirmation of this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia P review" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/633811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The front side of the model is almost completely occupied by a liquid crystal display.  On top are a <span>front camera</span> measuring 0.3 megapixels, distance and light sensors, a speaker for conversations, as well as a company logo of the manufacturer.  Due to the fact that the side ends together with the rear panel are a single aluminum sheet, the cover is not so easy to remove.  On the left side of the Sony Xperia P, the developers placed microSIM, microHDMI, and microUSB connectors.  On the opposite side you can see the <span>volume control,</span> power button, speaker grill and direct-start camera keys.  There is a headphone jack on the top and a microphone on the bottom.  The 8 megapixel main camera is located on the back cover. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the technical characteristics, the model is equipped with a dual-core processor, operating at a frequency of 1 GHz.  The amount of stationary memory is 16 GB (of which 4.5 GB is required to ensure the device‚Äôs own needs).  An optional memory card cannot be inserted. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The <span>Sony Xperia</span> P is equipped with a TFT touch screen with a diagonal size of 4 inches.  Its resolution is 960x540 pixels.  The screen is based on proprietary technology WhiteMagic, operates using four subpixels, and not three, as in previous versions.  Due to this, the picture on the display looks pretty bright and high quality.  The device is capable of displaying up to 16 million colors.  <span>Tempered glass is</span> used to protect the screen <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia P reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/633812.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As noted above, the main camera is located on the rear panel of the Sony Xperia P. The characteristics of this device as a whole can be called quite acceptable.  It is equipped with auto focus and flash.  When shooting objects, especially at close range, the picture is very natural.  At the same time, the flashes from which previous smartphones from this manufacturer company suffered, equipped with similar 8-megapixel cameras, are not typical for the received photos.  The most significant drawback was the tendency of the auto focus to ‚Äúmiss‚Äù over long distances.  As for video recording, the maximum resolution at which it is made is FullHD.  The stabilizer here is not ideal, but it is significantly better compared to previous versions.  It should be noted that such an interesting feature of the device, as the button to directly launch the camera, with which you can create pictures even in the locked state of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia P Specifications" class="if" height="139" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/633814.jpg" width="600"></div>

The settings of the device are quite standard for models from its segment.  The smartphone has many pre-installed applications and services not only from the manufacturer itself, but also from Google.  It should be noted a very convenient paging of programs that the user can independently sort by frequency of use, alphabet or installation time. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The model received a removable lithium battery with a capacity of 1305 mAh.  This is enough to work without recharging in standby mode - up to 475 hours, talk - up to 5 hours, continuous video playback - up to 4 hours.  At the same time, to compensate for the not so impressive indicator, the developers provided for the device an energy saving mode, which, when activated, automatically adjusts the brightness of the display and the functioning of the wireless modules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia P" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/633813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the smartphone Sony Xperia P after its official debut was a real hit and was in great demand.  And this is not surprising, since the model received everything you need, starting with a stylish metal case with optimal dimensions and ending with high performance.  Numerous reviews by the owners of the device indicate the absence of any serious complaints.  As for the shortcomings, they can be attributed to perhaps not very high autonomy. </p>
