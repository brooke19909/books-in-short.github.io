In this country there is the village of Pskhu, which, at first glance, does not have anything special.  But in fact, this settlement is a great attraction.  Being practically cut off from the outside world, it has preserved the way and way of life of past generations.  You can read more about the village of Pskhu in Abkhazia and how to get to it in this article. </p><h2>  Pskhu - a new type of tourism </h2><p>  Initially, Abkhazians lived in the region of Pskhu, who founded a mountain community there.  But during the war with the Caucasus, they were forced to leave their homes, and soon hermit monks came in their place.  Over time, Russian peasants settled in the village of Pskhu in Abkhazia and created a new community.  During the Second World War, the Germans captured the village, and this became one of the few territories occupied by the Nazis in Abkhazia. </p><p>  The name of the village initially sets in a high, poetic mood.  Translated, it means "soul in the mountains."  Indeed, those who managed to visit this place, note the special atmosphere of the settlement and magnificent landscapes.  The village is located in the Sukhumi region, and only 150 people live in it.  For the most part, these are people whose ancestors lived here for many generations.  There is practically no connection with civilization in the village: the road to it is difficult and long, so travelers prefer to get to Pskhu by plane.  Near the village there is a small airfield, on which small aircraft land, connecting between Sukhumi and Pskhu.  In winter, the only road falls asleep, and residents find themselves in complete isolation: they can only be reached by helicopter.  Therefore, tourist routes are possible only in summer or autumn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.386204" data-lng="40.810333000000014" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/6/4/7/9647.png"></div><h2>  Pshu and history </h2><p>  No wonder the locals say that all the events that have ever occurred in Abkhazia or the Caucasus are reflected here.  In the old days, several thousand Abkhaz lived here, who often raided neighboring Caucasian settlements.  Due to the furious disposition of the Pskhunts in 1864, they were forced to relocate to Turkey by force.  Many ancient and eminent families of Abkhazia began in the village of Pskhu, and still their descendants come here to meet with their native places.  After the eviction of the Abkhazians, Pskhu was settled by the Greeks.  But during the war with Turkey, they also left the village and fled.  After them, Russians began to be attracted to Abkhazia.  For resettlement in Pskhu, they offered land and preferential money, so there were many who wanted it.  The monks also lived in Pskhu for some time, until now some of them can be found in the vicinity of the village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maximum16.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pshu abkhazia photo" class="if uuid-2872096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872096.jpg"></div><h2>  What is interesting in Pshu </h2><p>  It is worth going to the village of Pskhu in Abkhazia for several reasons: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  beautiful nature; </li><li>  tasty and inexpensive food; </li><li>  hospitable population; </li><li>  low prices; </li><li>  lack of language barriers. </li></ul><p>  However, not everyone will like a trip to such a remote place in Abkhazia.  You should not expect comfort from a trip, but originality and impressions after this trip will be enough for you for a long time.  If you came to Pshu in the summer, then you will be greeted by a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãgreenery.  The village is located in a valley, which is almost completely surrounded by a mountain range.  At the same time, <span>the Bzyb River</span> passes through the valley <span>,</span> and its low location above sea level gives local residents the opportunity to enjoy a mild climate and the absence of strong winds.  Winters here are quite severe: up to 3 meters of snow can fall in a few months.  It is the isolation and identity of the village that so attracts some people.  Arriving in Pskhu, you seem to be on another planet with a measured and calm rhythm.  Despite the fact that there are no sightseeing attractions in the village, it is still a place with a rich history, which is reflected in some buildings and structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bikepost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The builder of the temple in psu Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2872089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872089.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the village yourself? </h2><p>  How to get to the village of Pskhu in Abkhazia?  There are only two ways: by plane or by car.  At the same time, it is unlikely that you will be able to overcome the pass in an ordinary passenger car, therefore tourists are brought on off-road vehicles.  Hiking trails to Pshu are very dangerous, and you can use them only in the summer.  You can get through the air either by helicopter, or by An-2, which is a regular "corn truck".  This route is the shortest: only 45 kilometers from Sukhum.  The cost of the flight is 3000 rubles, and the schedule is floating.  The plane takes off as you collect passengers.  The flight usually takes place back and forth on the same day, so travelers have very limited time to explore the village.  However, if you wish, you can stay overnight with local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Road by car </h2><p>  How to get to Pskhu in Abkhazia by car?  You can hire an SUV that will take you to your destination for 2500 rubles per person.  If you decide to go on your own, then you need to thoroughly prepare for such a trip.  The easiest way is through the Ancho Pass.  First you need to get to the resort of Avadhara, and already from it turn to Pshu.  The distance from Avadhara to Pskhu is 38 kilometers, and they will have to be overcome not on a smooth highway.  After you reach the Ancho Pass, you will only have to drive 28 kilometers.  At the same time, the pass offers stunning views of the entire valley, and the further road passes through a picturesque fir forest.  On the way there are small passes, which are convenient to stop for a snack.  If you look at least a few photos of Pskhu (Abkhazia), then you will surely pay attention to the Bavu river along which the road goes.  If you move along the coast, the river takes travelers to Mount Inal-Cuba, at the foot of which once were the shrines of the indigenous inhabitants.  Starting from here, you can shorten the path by going along the trail in a southerly direction.  Pskhu is a border zone, so in some places you can find warning signs about it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="privetsochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pshu village Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2872087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872087.jpg"></div><h2>  Trekking </h2><p>  For hiking enthusiasts, there is another way to get to the village of Pshu: go camping.  But this option is considered one of the most dangerous.  In the spring, snow still interferes, and in summer, rains that blur the road.  However, with an experienced guide and subject to good weather, it is quite possible to achieve the goal of travel.  Usually, the walking route starts at Psou checkpoint and passes through the peak of Ancho and the Agura Arihua ridge, where picturesque lakes are located.  If you are planning a trip like this, you should not count on a quick return: the journey takes from 7 to 9 days.  It is better to go on a trip in large groups, in no case should you go to the mountains alone.  According to experienced travelers, it is most preferable to go on a trip to Pskhu in Abkhazia in May, but the summer months and September are also considered favorable.  In the fall, when climbing, the tourist opens up the stunning slopes of the mountains, strewn with colorful trees. </p><p>  The cost of a walking tour is 13 thousand rubles.  This amount includes transfers and transfers, guide escort, food and camping equipment.  The service is popular, and many people prefer it to a standard car trip. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to choose a route yourself and look for guides, you can use the services of local residents, as well as guides living in Sukhumi.  Prices for an excursion to Pskhu in Abkhazia start from 3-4 thousand rubles.  Guides will help you organize your trip and explore everything in one day.  It is even more interesting to hear the history of the village from the residents themselves, who often meet tourists already by the plane.  In addition to interesting stories, they will treat you with honey and cheese of their own production. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yarovikov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia psu march in may" class="if uuid-2872093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872093.jpg"></div><h2>  Mountain of seven sanctuaries </h2><p>  If you are going to Pshu, be prepared for alpine landscapes and magnificent mountains.  A photo from Pskhu in Abkhazia fascinates any lover of nature.  At the foot of one of these mountains is the largest Abkhaz sanctuary: Inal-Kuba.  In this place, according to legend, Prince Inal was buried, who united the tribes of the Abkhaz and Circassians and expelled the enemy troops from these lands.  You can get to the sanctuary from the village of Pskhu, but you need to prepare for the fact that the road will take a lot of time.  On foot you need to walk about 5 kilometers, and the fastest way to do this is by car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vmulder.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inal-cuba in Pshu" class="if uuid-2872400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2872400.jpg"></div><p>  Once in a sacred place, you must follow certain rules.  On the territory of the Inal-cube it is impossible to hunt, drink, speak loudly and break trees.  A legend goes about disobeying the ban in the village: they say that they are being punished by the spirits of this place.  Often on the slopes you can find wild animals that are almost not afraid of people.  At the foot of the mountain, a stone altar for sacrifices is still preserved.  A little further by the river a font was made in which you can plunge.  But the water in it rarely gets warmer than 3-4 degrees due to sources spouting from the ground. </p><h2>  Temple </h2><p>  One of the most notable sights of the village is a beautiful wooden church with a blue roof.  This is the church of John the Baptist.  Inside it is decorated with a wooden carved altar and painted on the ceiling.  The temple was built for more than 10 years, and a beautiful legend is also associated with it.  Jonah lived in Odessa and was the spiritual father of the headman of the temple in Pskhu.  At that time, the church was located in a small house, where all parishioners could barely fit.  One day, Jonah gave one of his parishioners his mandate - to build a new church in Pshu.  The matter was not easy, given the remoteness of the village and its inaccessibility.  The construction of a new church required significant material investment and effort.  But the construction that had begun gradually continued: all the spiritual children of the elder and local residents helped the cause.  Many people became the builders of the temple in Pskhu in Abkhazia, and Natalia Gerzhova led the project, which Jonah himself blessed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputnik-abkhazia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskhu village Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2872095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872095.jpg"></div><p>  Not without miracles.  They say that builders have repeatedly heard singing in an empty temple, which could not be explained using logic.  September 22, 2016 the long-awaited consecration of the temple took place, which was completed nine years later.  Despite its remote location, the church has a particle of the relics of John the Baptist, and this attracts hundreds of tourists every year from around the world. </p><h2>  Pskhu-Gumistinsky reserve </h2><p>  Abkhazia is famous for its nature, and many reserves are located on its territory.  One of the most famous is considered Pskhu-Gumistinsky, which covers the upper reaches of the Bzybi River, the left bank at the mouth of the Kodor River and the forest zone of the Eastern Gumista basin.  Pskhu Square is only a small part of this reserve, because it occupies only 40 thousand hectares.  At the entrance to the reserve there is a checkpoint, and it is forbidden to hunt and cut down trees on the territory.  Here you can find many species of trees and plants, including rare ones.  For example, boxwood, Caucasian hornbeam and black alder are listed as protected objects.  Forests were preserved here, which the human hand did not touch: due to inaccessibility, trees were never cut down here.  Therefore, those who are interested in flora should also come to Pskhu: the village is almost buried in the forest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskhu-Gumistinsky reserve" class="if uuid-2872412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2872412.jpg"></div><h2>  The ruins of the fortress </h2><p>  Near the village there is another attraction - the collapse of the old fortress.  No one knows for sure who built it and when.  Some say that this is the work of the Byzantines, others - that they did this Abkhaz in the 8th century.  One way or another, the fortress is very ancient, and little is left of it.  If you come closer, you can see that the foundation of the fortress sank a bit.  Locals say that somewhere under the ground there is a secret passage, but they could not find it. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Life away from civilization in Pskhu (Abkhazia) left a certain imprint on the village.  It has only one store with the most necessary products and a school.  New families rarely move here, and residents have to travel 45 kilometers to the hospital.  There is electricity, but there is no mobile connection and the Internet.  Therefore, smartphones are mainly used as toys.  They promise to hold water supply in the near future.  Previously, Pskhu residents were engaged in animal husbandry, and there were also coal deposits in the village that were developed for hydroelectric power plants.  But now the locals are mainly engaged in households, leading a calm and measured life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vmulder.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pshu abkhazia excursion" class="if uuid-2872091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872091.jpg"></div><p>  In order to visit the village of Pskhu, Russians do not need a visa if their stay in Abkhazia takes less than 90 days.  It is better to get health insurance in case of illness or injury.  If you drive your car, you will need a "green card", which will be a pass to the territory of the country.  If you travel on your own, then at the entrance to Abkhazia you will need to pay a resort fee of 30 rubles.  The easiest way to get to Sukhumi is through Adler, and from there you can easily reach Pshu. </p><p>  There is only one hotel that accepts guests.  But if you want to plunge into the local atmosphere as deep as possible and get to know the life and culture of local residents closer, it is better to stay in a house in the private sector.  The cost of a hotel room is 500 rubles, and the cost of accommodation in a private house is 300 rubles.  It‚Äôs better to take a slow cooker and a snack with you, because there are no cafes in Pskhu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abhazia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pshu abkhazia how to get there by car" class="if uuid-2872098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2872098.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Despite the small number of attractions, people who visited Pshu village in Abkhazia are very pleased with their trip.  Perhaps the reason lies in the beautiful landscapes, and perhaps in the village‚Äôs identity.  Despite the fact that residents have been using all the benefits of civilization for a long time, the atmosphere that reigned there both 100 and 200 years ago was still preserved in Pskhu.  The inhabitants were not touched by the frantic rhythm of modern life and the crazy race in an effort to catch everything.  They still shoe horses, look after cattle and harvest.  People say that during a trip to Pskhu miracles begin already at the entrances to the village.  If you are traveling by car, the eyes will open a picturesque fir forest and rivers running along the road.  But the most beautiful landscapes can be seen from the plane.  During the flight you will see all the greatness of the mountains of Abkhazia, and land on a small chamomile field in Pskhu.  In the village, they will sell you delicious honey and cheese, which residents make themselves. </p><p>  But there are those who are not satisfied with their trip.  Some tourists are not happy with the inconvenience and the hard way to the village. </p><p>  It is worth going to Pskhu in order to enjoy beautiful landscapes and to see with your own eyes the life of people who have not changed a bit over the past hundred years.  If you are more used to hotels and beach vacations, you better choose a different direction for tourism. </p>
