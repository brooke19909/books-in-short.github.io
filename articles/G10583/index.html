Buda Castle is the most visited monument in the city.  It has a centuries-old history of ups, downs and total destruction, but today anyone can touch its almost 800-year history. </p><h2>  Budapest History </h2><p>  Even before Budapest was first mentioned in the chronicles of the 13th century, there were settlements of Celts and Romans on these lands, and Hungarians first came here at the end of the 9th century.  Having each its own development path, three separate settlements, known by 1148 as Buda, Pest and Obuda, subsequently formed the historical part of the city. </p><p>  All 3 towns were destroyed by the Mongol-Tatars in 1241, and after their restoration a year later Buda became the capital.  By 1350, Buda received the status of the residence of the kings of Hungary for almost 200 years.  After Buda, Pest and Obuda were first ruled by the Turks, then by the Habsburgs, only in 1867 did Budapest become the <span>capital of Hungary,</span> becoming part of the Austro-Hungarian crown.  The final unification of the three cities occurred in 1873. </p>

    <p>  The city became a major metropolis in Europe in 1950 after the accession of 7 nearby cities and 16 villages.  Today in Budapest there are 23 districts, most of which are in Pest, located on the flat part of the Danube.  Buda is located on the hills of the opposite shore. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Arriving in this city, you can get acquainted with the history of each district, but the most interesting among tourists is Buda Castle - a Buda castle of the 13th century.  On the territory of the castle are museums, palaces, a church and a cathedral, which themselves are of great historical interest. </p><h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  Founded initially as a <span>fortress,</span> Buda <span>Castle</span> subsequently became the residence of Hungarian kings.  This was facilitated by the formation of a special architectural ensemble, which included the Royal Palace, which belonged to King Zhigmand. </p><p>  The modest building, which became the first residence of Hungarian kings, was rebuilt into a real palace in the 15th century by order of Sigismund of Luxembourg.  They were invited to the European architects and artists known at that time for their skill.  This was the beginning of construction, but he became a real "pearl" and the best palace in Europe under King Matthias. </p>

    <p>  Italian masters ‚Äúturned‚Äù the residence of Hungarian kings into the best example of the Renaissance style.  The interior of the halls and chambers indicates the power and wealth of the King of Hungary, but this greatness did not last long.  In 1541, the country was captured by the Turks for a long century and a half. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During this time, the palace was looted and partially destroyed.  Only in the 19th century did its restoration begin, which was also short-lived, since at the very end of World War II, Buda Castle (Budapest) was completely destroyed. </p><p>  The restoration of the Royal Palace was already possible in the 20th century thanks to the preserved drawings and sketches.  Today its facade is a magnificent example of the Baroque style, while its back is represented by partially preserved buildings from the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  St.  Matthias </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful architectural monuments that Buda Castle presents for tourists is the Cathedral of St.  Matthias. </p><p>  Its construction dragged on for almost 200 years, but thanks to this, a so beautiful Gothic cathedral was built that even the Turks did not destroy it, for which Christian shrines did not mean anything.  They simply painted murals and for the long 150 years made it the main mosque of the city. </p><p>  It was this cathedral that largely contributed to the liberation of Hungary from the Turkish yoke.  During the shelling in 1686, a wall collapsed near the building, presenting a statue of the Virgin Mary to the Turks praying in it.  This event shocked the <span>Turkish soldiers</span> and undermined the spirit, turning them into flight. </p>

    <p>  The next restoration of the cathedral took place at the end of the 19th century.  The reconstruction work was supervised by Frides Shulek, a famous architect at that time.  It was thanks to his efforts that the Cathedral of St.  Matthias was returned to the 13th century Gothic look. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Buda Castle partially retained the features inherent in it during the years of construction.  The columns of 1260, miraculously survived for so many centuries, are proof of this. </p><h2>  National Picture Gallery </h2><p>  As many as 3 wings of the Royal Palace are occupied by the Hungarian Art Gallery, which opened its doors to visitors in 1957. </p><p>  The collection consists of paintings, sculptures, works of folk artists, provided both by private individuals and museums in other cities of Hungary.  In total, there are more than 100,000 copies of the works of Hungarian painters, sculptors and woodcarvers, from Gothic times to 19th century realism. </p>

The name is due to the fact that the fishing guild was responsible for this section of the tower with powerful walls in the Middle Ages. </p>

    <p>  The bastion has 7 towers - according to the number of leaders who united their tribes, creating a single Hungarian people at the end of the 9th century.
