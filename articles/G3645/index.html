    <h2>  What is zorbing? </h2><p>  This is the attraction called when a person is placed in a transparent sphere located in another, larger ball.  This design is called "zorb".  She gave a name to the attraction.  Both spheres are fastened together with special cords.  The person inside is fixed with a suspension system.  The ball is set on top of the track and lowered down.  It's easy to imagine how a person feels inside a zorb!  But since it is securely fixed, and its capsule is inside a larger sphere, the skater does not receive any injuries.  The air gap between the balls reliably absorbs all shocks and bumps.  Water zorbing is just one area.  A person does not fasten in it.  He can walk freely and even run inside the ball.  But try to stand on your feet!  After all, the ball beneath you is constantly swaying!  But there are pros who manage to run in such areas and even play the ball. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is zorbing photo" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1792251.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Zorbing is a new type of outdoor activity.  He appeared in 1973, designed the first such ball by Gilles Ebersol.  At first, the zorb was a simple inflated sphere, which was launched into the water, often in an artificial pond, pool, or in the shallow water of a lake.  By the way, the world learned about a new form of entertainment from the video for the Getcha Back song of the American rock band Beach Boys.  Then there was a desire to make this entertainment even more exciting.  In the 1990s, Andrew Akers and Dwayne Van Der Sluys from New Zealand significantly improved the zorb.  Now these devices are manufactured in European countries, Argentina and, of course, in China.  Quality zorbas are made from polyvinyl chloride or polyurethane.  Two spheres are connected by slings of polypropylene or kapron cords.  The standard zorb is designed for one passenger.  But recently, large spheres for two people began to be manufactured.  The diameter of the inner capsule of such a zorb is almost two meters, and the outer sphere is 3.2 m. There are zorb with LED slings or fluorescent cords.  The water type of entertainment is simpler.  In this case, the zorb represents only one sphere of sealed material.  Inside this <span>balloon, a</span> person can move freely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zorbing is a sport" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1792256.jpg" width="600"></div>

But it depends on how to use the device.  Now zorbing is a sport that not everyone can master.  Especially when the ball is lowered from the slope.  Despite the arrangement of the route, the sphere rolls as she pleases, and the person inside cannot control its movement.  And therefore, the adrenaline flow into the blood is provided to you.  Is it possible to get injured while in a zorb?  If you do not repeat the ‚Äúfeat‚Äù of two Russians in Dombay (Karavaevo-Cherkessia), who in January 2013 decided to go down the mountain in such an original way and flew into the abyss as a result, then this attraction is quite safe.  But you can not stay inside the capsule for too long.  After all, it is tight, and after ten minutes a person begins to feel a lack of oxygen.  In water, you cannot let zorb down rivers, especially mountain ones.  Indeed, in case of damage to the capsule, you will not be able to get out of it and drown. </p><h2>  Types of Zorbing </h2><p>  From the moment that La Balloule (a sphere with a cradle) by Gilles Ebersol was born, in which a person could safely descend from a hill, a lot of water flowed.  And therefore, the zorb, which received the name from z-orbit (unknown orbit), has changed a lot.  There are a lot of varieties of the device.  Many people like that zorbing is uncontrollability of the ball.  These people experience an adrenaline rush precisely because of torsion, spinning and somersaults.  Others do not like it.  Therefore, designs appeared when a seat on hinges is inserted inside the capsule, which holds the passenger in an upright position.  There are hydro-zorbing.  This is when some water is poured inside.  This medium also provides the balance of the zorbonaut.  Abroad, mainly in the USA, competitions are held in running in balls on flat terrain and even from hills.  The winner is the participant who gets to the finish line, never falling.  Hotheads come up with many ways to use zorb.  For example, the sphere is tied to a motor boat or put it inside a special device for training parachutists, which pumps a powerful stream of air up.  Such entertainment is called aero-zorbing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zorbing in Moscow in winter" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1792258.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where can I try an attraction in Moscow </h2><p>  Do you think that in order to ride in a ball, you need to go to the mountains or rivers?  Not necessary.  Of course, it would be better if during the descent the wonderful nature of the Moscow Region spun before my eyes.  But in this case, you need to go three kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road in the vicinity of the city of Dzerzhinsky or to the village of Shukolovo in the Dmitrov region, where such a route operates on the basis of the ski club.  Zorbing in <span>Moscow in winter</span> and summer can be tried without leaving the capital.  Write down the addresses soon: </p><ul><li>  "Lata-track", st.  Krylatsky Hills, 1; </li><li>  base of the Moscow Federation of Paintball, p. North Butovo, st.  Theodosian, 1. </li></ul><p>  On weekends in a ball you can go down the track in Kolomensky Park and in Tsaritsyno. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zorbing reviews" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1792254.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Zorbing: reviews </h2><p>  It really is breathtaking - so say everyone who at least once in a lifetime has gone down in a ball.  In the conditions of the Russian <span>winter, the attraction</span> takes on new nuances.  Try snow zorbing - slide inside a sphere from a snowy hill.  Unforgettable feelings!  This ride is absolutely safe.  However, there are limitations.  You should not test your nerves for pregnant women, people with a heart condition, hyper- and hypotension, with osteochondrosis.  It should be remembered that the higher the weight of the zorbonaut, the greater the acceleration the sphere gains on the descent and the better it bounces on all the unevenness of the relief.  But even if you were allowed inside the capsule, you should take your own precautions.  Empty all the pockets.  If you don‚Äôt want to get your own slippers in the nose, take off your shoes.  Shoes should fit tightly and firmly on their feet. </p>
