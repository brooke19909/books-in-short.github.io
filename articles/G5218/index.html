Here they found the remains of the long mounds in which the Slavs lived during the Great Migration in the 5th century AD.  Today, the lake is a <span>water protection zone</span> in which numerous springs and rare plants for the Tver region are preserved. </p><h2>  About the lake </h2><p>  In the center of the <span>Valdai Upland,</span> at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level, lies Lake Shlino.  Its shape resembles an oval, elongated to the south.  The reservoir area is 34 square kilometers, and the depth exceeds the mark of 4 meters.  The location of the lake is interesting: the upper third (from the village of Kamenka to the confluence of the Troshkovsky stream into it) belongs to the Novgorod region, Valdai district.  The lower part of the lake is the Tver region, Firovsky district.  The structure of the lake is complicated due to the abundance of backwaters and bays, satellite lakes and the different size of the islands.  There are villages on the southern coast of the reservoir, but the southwestern part is wild, inaccessible and has not yet been studied. </p>

    <p>  Sandy beaches on Lake Shlino are a rarity: if spring and summer are rainy, then the rising water level will not allow you to enjoy a vacation on the beach.  The bottom of the lake is clean, sandy, sometimes pebbles come across.  The water is clean and cool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shlina River </h2><p>  From the Shlino lake, the Shlina River is born, famous for kayaking.

If you move even further, you can see how the lake spills into a full body of water, in which there are many water lilies.  After the lake there is a sharp overgrowing of the river bed and with a low water level, passage through this section is difficult to access. </li></ul>

And the moments give the impression that the river crosses itself. </li><li>  <em>The fourth is the last.</em>  The beauty of the river is left behind.  Monotonous shores, overgrown with willow, began.  There are fewer parking spaces. </li></ul><h2>  Holidays on Lake Shlino: Private Sector </h2><p>  In the villages located on the south coast, the “natives” will gladly rent holiday homes in season.  The untouched ecology on Lake Shlino surpasses most popular places. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Shlino Lake: fishing and hunting </h2><p>  Arriving in the spring on Shlino, vacationers rejoice at the first spring mushrooms - morels, and in the fall they are already solid porcini mushrooms.  There are a lot of birds, so game lovers will be interested.  Great expanse for hunters and fishermen: in the forest there are wild boar, roe deer, elk, bear.  There are different fish in the lake.  And if you go down to the small streams that flow into the lake in abundance and find deep pools, you will catch river trout or a rare fish - grayling. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  In addition to hunting or fishing, tourists can choose a water tour from the recreation center "Uzmen".  The program of your choice: in one, two days or for any period of time at the request of guests.  The program includes rafting on the Shline river, entertainment and sports events, delicious food cooked at the stake. </p><p>  Driving along the route is equally safe for group rafting or for family rafting with children.  The places where the group floats are picturesque and beautiful, uninhabited moments.  The river descent is carried out on reefs and expedition boats with a capacity of 2, 6 and 8 places.  The maximum number of people in a group is 20. </p>

Instructors, based on the tiredness of tourists, make the first halt, at which the group has breakfast, drinks tea, and rests.  Set off again.  At the second, already equipped halt, travelers get a full dinner cooked at the stake.  They relax, bathe, some, if desired, go on a short fishing trip.  Then the group again sets sail to get off at the third and last halt, where everyone is resting and swimming.  Sail the last stretch of the road to the parking lot on Lake Glybi.  For an overnight stay they suggest going to a recreation center or to an island, to a tent city.  This is a program for one day water tour. </p>

    <p>  Those who choose a two-day program, go to breakfast the next day in the morning, then continue along the route with parking in prepared places. </p><p>  The instructor has the right to prevent guests intoxicated by the river. </p><p>  Rafting prices are affordable: for a company of three people in a one-day tour, you must pay 3 thousand rubles each, for 4 people - 2 thousand rubles.  For a group of more than five people, the descent will cost 1,500 thousand rubles from each.  The participation of children under 12 years old is paid at 1 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Guest houses and camp sites on the lake Shlino </h2><p>  Not far from the village of Krasilovo is a hotel on Lake Shlino.  It belongs to the military hunting society, the barracks type and accommodates up to 50 guests.  The hotel rents motor or rowing boats for fishing on the lake.  At this place, Shlino Lake is famous for its deep pikes.  Experienced anglers are advised to bring an echo sounder with them, although old-timers say that no one leaves the lake without a catch.  In addition to pike, crucian carp, roach, perch, ruff, bream, rudd and pike perch are caught here. </p><p>  And what walks here!  Mixed forests of deep green color, forest trails, with paw prints of animals, anthills.  The air is so clean that I want to breathe for the future. </p>

    <p>  Another recreation center is Uzmen, Firovsky district, Tver region.  But the location of the base is far from Lake Shlino, so vacationers are offered out fishing.  Tourists stay mainly with local residents or on their own in tents - "savages." </p><h2>  Legends of the lake </h2><p>  On the western side of the lake, 200 meters from the shore, a small lake with black water and shores covered with moss spilled in the pines.  Local residents know that the forest monster lives there.  Nobody ever looked at him well, but everyone knows that it lives there. </p><p>  In a beautiful place with a lot of blueberries, there is a lake, so both locals and guests come here.  But the main thing is that travelers who have come here should not make noise!  He does not like the monster of loud screams, running around.  You should not swim in the lake, let alone throw stones and garbage at it.  Of course, the monster will not jump out of the lake and will not drag unlucky tourists into the depths of Lake Shlino.  But on the way back to the house, the weather will change: a squally wind will rain with rain, capable of turning into a storm.  This is an angry monster whose peace has been disturbed. </p><p>  Or lives on the island of Splendor, peering out from Lake Shlino, the spirit of a black fisherman.  He also has a hut.  Only no one knows who built it and lived there.  In the dark stormy nights, the spirit of a black fisherman appears to help those who were caught in the water by bad weather.  It protects travelers, helping those lost to swim to their shore, or hospitably offers to find refuge in their hut. </p>

    <p>  As eyewitnesses say, while relaxing on Lake Shlino, you can’t sing all songs in a row.  Under the strictest ban on rain compositions.  It is worth singing, as the weather spoils after a while.  And if suddenly someone is drawn to perform a series of “wet” songs, then it will become gloomy at all: a long rainfall is provided.  True, inveterate tourists learned to circumvent this omen - it is possible to sing a song while in a skiff on the water, and by order of the rowers.  But it’s better not to abuse it, otherwise everything is possible. </p><p>  Not far from Lake Shlino, in a forest in a swamp, sometimes a white haze appears.  Marevo gradually takes on the shape of a female figure.  On foggy evenings, she travels along paths without touching the ground.  Rumor has it that sometimes it comes close to camps of tourists, sadly looking from the dark forest to the living ... </p><p>  Who is she?  How was it in the swamp?  Why is it locked here: unhappy love that forever ruined an immortal soul or a different kind of longing?  Beginners at first are afraid, but gradually get used to it.  The natives claim that this is the spirit of the Eagles, keeping peace and silence of this place. </p><p>  People do not come to Lake Shlino by chance, because there are no nearby paved and railways.  This is a conscious choice.  And, having come here once, you will come back again, enchanted by the silence and beauty of the lake. </p>
