Many people associate it with love, high fashion, exquisite taste, great artists and architects, as well as with chocolate, cappuccino and croissants.  For many tourists, vacation in France is a dream.  It is simply impossible to find out all its splendor in one trip, because France is not only Paris, but also its many provinces, castles, vineyards. </p><p>  Most often, tourists for their first trip to this country still choose exactly its capital.  Here is the symbol of France - the Eiffel Tower, created in 1789.  Having risen on it you can enjoy the most beautiful panorama of the city, and then have lunch at the Jules Vern restaurant, located on the second level of the tower.  Every year thousands of lovers and newlyweds come to the Eiffel Tower.  It is impossible to imagine a holiday in France without a picnic at its foot.  Be sure to visit the <span>Notre Dame Cathedral,</span> about which Victor Hugo wrote in his novel.  This is an amazingly beautiful architectural monument, striking the imagination with its fundamental nature. </p><p>  For children, you can‚Äôt imagine a vacation in France without visiting Disneyland.  Every child knows about this amusement park.  Here live the heroes of his favorite cartoons, a huge number of attractions based on Disney works.  Big singing cups from Beauty and the Beast, a train flying through the tunnel, Peter Pan, Mickey Mouse, Scrooge McDuck - all these heroes are known not only by children, but also by their parents.  There are several cafes in the territory of the amusement park where you can have a tasty lunch with the whole family.  One day is not enough to go around the entire park.  Disneyland is one of the largest known amusement parks in the world.  After visiting it, you can stroll along the Champs Elysees, walk along the banks of the Seine.  The <span>Champs Elysees</span> has a huge number of boutiques that attract fashionistas from around the world.  The presented assortment in French stores differs from other countries in its uniqueness.  It is difficult to find things for daily wear.  Each model is unique and conveys the perception of the world of the designer.  For fashionistas, holidays in France are associated with walks in numerous boutiques, where models of world famous designers are presented. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this country, they are very sensitive to cooking, so <span>French cuisine</span> is considered one of the most delicious on earth.  It is worth noting that it is very specific in taste and for many tourists, truly <span>French dishes</span> will be very unusual.  For each treat, the French pick up their wine.  Winemaking is one of the main industries of this country.  Climate and soil make it possible to grow grapes in the provinces, from which almost all alcoholic beverages are then made.  Legends have been circulating about French wines, cognacs and champagne for a long time.  It does not matter in advance whether the tourist purchased a ticket or it was last-minute <span>tours to France,</span> but in order to understand the country he must definitely try her wine and the finest cheese. </p><p>  Holidays in this country are far from cheap pleasure and not every traveler can afford it.  At the same time, every euro spent on a trip is worth it to personally see all this splendor, to taste France, to touch romantic medieval history.  For those who do not want to give up their dreams and still want to spend a week here, many tour operators offer last-minute trips to France at an attractive price.  This will significantly save on travel and see the country with your own eyes.  France is that place on earth, coming to where it is a sin to spend time in the walls of a hotel when every corner of the country is ready to share its story, when everything here is saturated with tenderness and love.  Enjoy your stay in the heart of the world in France! </p>
