  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selling Apartments: How not to Rope?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Selling an apartment is a very serious and troublesome business.  Everyone wants the process to be complete without hassle and dirty tricks, with benefits for both parties, therefore a serious approach is important in this matter.  What can be recommended to owners who are putting up housing for sale? </p><p>  First, study the market and decide on the amount you want to receive for the apartment.  To assess the market value, it is best to invite a specialist - a professional realtor who will be able to inform you about the pricing policy in the real estate market in your area today.  Do not rush and break into the first office you come across, ask friends who have ever sold or bought housing, let them advise you which real estate agency is best to contact.  After choosing an agent, consult with him, it may be better to make cosmetic repairs in the apartment being sold, so if you spend a little money on materials, you can increase the price.  Try not to overstate the cost, but to listen to a realtor, this will increase the likelihood of finding real buyers.  If potential customers ask you to slightly reduce the price by an insignificant amount, do not refuse, bidding in such transactions is quite appropriate. </p><p>  Showing the apartment, try not to praise it intrusively, because the buyer will already see if the layout suits him, the condition of the housing and other parameters or not.  It is very rare that the first people who come to the inspection agree to purchase, so tune in to the fact that there will be many possible future owners to see your possessions.  Even if you have verbally agreed with one of them to sell, you should not stop showing, and even more so, transfer documents to someone to the apartment until a deposit has been paid and the transaction has been executed by a notary public. </p><p>  When the buyer is found, discuss with him the form of payment: cash or bank transfer.  The safest option is to transfer funds to your bank account.  Then it will not be necessary to recount and verify the money, and verification of authenticity in banking institutions, by the way, is paid.  If you still decide on cash, be sure to insist that the entire amount be tested on <noindex>  <span>currency detector</span> </noindex>  You may be able to negotiate with the buyer what to pay for this procedure in half.  The transaction must take place in the presence of a realtor, it will be better if you also will be accompanied by a person you trust, in order to avoid cases of fraud. </p></div></article>
