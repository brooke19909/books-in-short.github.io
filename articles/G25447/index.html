They could not even imagine that over time, technology will provide an opportunity to control their location.  And spy gadgets have nothing to do with it, it is enough to have a simple smartphone, GPS enabled and a special application.  Today, owners of gadgets on Android and IOS do not face the problem of how to track the location of a child through the phone.  Modern technologies provide new simple ways to take care of children without unnecessary time and energy costs, saving your time and nerves. </p><h2>  Varieties of services for monitoring children </h2><p>  Parental control requires at least two devices ‚Äî one for you, the other for your child.  Today, for owners of gadgets on Android and IOS, there are many ways aimed at how to track a child‚Äôs phone: </p><ol><li>  Mobile applications - in the AppStore, GooglePlay and other resources there is a huge catalog of similar software.  It is installed on a PC, smartphone or tablet and configured with the necessary parameters.  After installation, the program begins to collect information about the whereabouts and actions of the child and send notifications to parents.  Developers often provide an emergency communication function through the app, so that children can instantly give an alarm.  In some cases, a fee for additional traffic consumption and a premium version of the service will be charged. </li><li>  Through the services of mobile providers - in this case, the installation of third-party software is not required.  Among the advantages of this tracking method can be called the accuracy of determining the geolocation and the data transfer rate, which is ensured thanks to the mobile communication towers.  Such services will be valuable to people who do not use modern gadgets.  The disadvantage of this method may be its price, which depends on the operator and tariff. </li></ol><p>  Great competition among providers and developers has provided users with a dozen alternative ways to track their little ones' activities.  A comparative review will help you choose the best option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Family GPS Tracker KidControl </h2><p>  KidControl program allows the whole family to keep abreast, solving the problem of how to track a child‚Äôs phone on Android.  The platform has the following features: </p><ul><li>  Displaying the locations of your family in real time on the map.  Accurate data allows fathers and mothers to verify that the child is safe and sound.  Saving your travel history and push notifications will not let you miss important events. </li><li>  Battery charge control.  Teenagers often dismiss communication with their parents, justifying themselves with a battery in the phone.  Believe it or not is a personal matter, but it‚Äôs not for nothing that people say ‚Äútrust, but verify‚Äù.  Through your device you can see the state of charge of someone else‚Äôs device, and the statistics of the battery will show when it was charged, when it was disconnected from the power supply and how intensively it was used.  This will help both to track the child‚Äôs phone, and better learn about his activity and detect possible suspicious actions (for example, too active use of the device at night). </li><li>  Geofences.  In KidControl, you can outline the territory where the child is allowed to move.  When crossing the established border, a notification is sent to the devices of the relatives.  Such a function will come in handy both for protection purposes and for discipline control. </li><li>  SOS signal.  Today it is difficult to imagine how to track a child without a telephone as quickly and efficiently as possible.  There are times when it is impossible to write a message or call, but you must report an emergency.  When the built-in alarm button is pressed, all registered family members will receive a corresponding signal. </li></ul><p>  You can also watch children's phones from a desktop computer, while having the application installed on your smartphone.  To enter, just use the login and password from the KidControl application. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  FindMyKids </h2><div class="photo" data-original="findmykids.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child‚Äôs phone" class="if uuid-2990811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990811.jpg"></div><p>  The application is similar to KidControl: through it you can also track a child‚Äôs phone, and set zones on a map, send SOS signals and view the activity history.  But there are important noticeable differences, for example: </p><ul><li>  The application is downloaded for free, but after three trial days of its use, you will have to pay. </li><li>  The sound around is the hallmark of the service.  The parent can listen to and record environmental sounds through the phone of his offspring without his knowledge.  Children may not like this, but parents will be convinced that the children are not affected by evil influence. </li><li>  Different modes: parent and child. </li><li>  Turning on a loud signal - helps to hear the phone if it is difficult to find.  Also, no one can ignore such a signal. </li></ul><h2>  Lighthouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="aboutandroid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child without a phone" class="if uuid-2990816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990816.jpg"></div><p>  The feature of the application is its user interface.  Its design is modern and refined.  It combines almost all the functionality of the above platforms, but at the same time requires costs from the wallet (about 169-219 rubles).  In addition to smartphones, the application supports the connection of various accessories, for example, on fitness bracelets and smart watches.  It also has an analogue to the wiretap function from FindMyKids called ‚ÄúSilent Ringing‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Mom knows" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="macuser.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child via phone" class="if uuid-2990819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990819.jpg"></div><p>  The service has a pleasant minimalistic interface and convenient navigation.  It has no unique features, it attracts users with its simplicity and other advantages: </p><ul><li>  Cross-platform - it works not only on iPhones and Android smartphones, but also on Windows. </li><li>  <span>Save Internet traffic</span> and power consumption. </li></ul><p>  For full functioning you need to download 2 applications: ‚ÄúMom knows‚Äù for parents and ‚ÄúMom knows: GPS-beacon‚Äù for children. </p><h2>  Life360 - Family Locator </h2><div class="photo" data-original="says.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child on a cell phone" class="if uuid-2990824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990824.jpg"></div><p>  Service is considered to be the leader among analogues.  The number of installations on GooglePlay and AppStore has exceeded the bar of 10 million users.  The founders of this resource position themselves more as a social network for communication between family and friends or an ‚Äúonline office‚Äù for the family, rather than an espionage device.  These products are world famous and offer such original features: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúAlready at home‚Äù - a family locator notifies users of the return of one of the household members home, which allows them to prepare for a cordial meeting. </li><li>  Life360 users can unite in a "family circle".  Only members of the circle have access to the data of such participants.  Information leakage excluded.  You can also create circles for colleagues and friends. </li><li>  Search for a lost or stolen phone. </li><li>  ‚ÄúPanic‚Äù is an emergency message with one feature: to send it, it is not necessary to have money on the balance sheet. </li><li>  Display of the nearest places of emergency care (hospitals, police stations). </li><li>  Family channel - for group conversations between relatives, users can create special conferences.  Thus, the application can replace instant messengers. </li></ul><p>  Life360 is distributed under the Freemium model - a shareware format.  Installation and use are free, and those who need additional features have to pay $ 5 per month.  It is worth noting that most paid features are not available outside the United States, so subscribing will not be the best solution. </p><h2>  How to track a child by phone number: mobile operators </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.moirebenok.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child by phone number" class="if uuid-2990828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990828.jpg"></div><p>  The value of mobile operators today is invaluable.  The rapid development of Internet technologies today allows both to track a child by mobile phone and to use the services of mobile operators for this purpose: </p><ul><li>  MTS: ‚ÄúA child under supervision.‚Äù  Information when tracking comes via SMS notifications or directly to PC and other gadgets.  The cost of a monthly subscription is 100 rubles, there is a two-week trial version. </li><li>  Tele2: Geopoisk.  Notifications are received via USSD requests or when installing a proprietary application.  Price - 3 rubles per day with three trial days. </li><li>  Megaphone: "Radar."  Movement messages can be viewed on a special website or in SMS.  For the service you need to pay 3 rubles daily.  You can connect additional phones, for each new number, 1 ruble is added to the main payment. </li><li>  Beeline: "Coordinates."  The service will cost 1.7 rubles per day, the first 7 days are free.  Information about the movement can be obtained by sending a message to the number 4770. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, not only applications that allow you to determine the location of the child are an effective tool for monitoring and ensuring safety. </p><h2>  Via iCloud </h2><p>  In the settings you need to find the Apple ID category, then select the iCloud section and turn on the Find iPhone and Last Geolocation features.  Through the basic settings, you can prohibit changes that would allow the child to disconnect from surveillance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphone4apple.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track your child‚Äôs location via phone" class="if uuid-2990832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990832.jpg"></div><p>  Having entered the account through the browser, you can see the location of interest.  Before that, you need to click the ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù icon on the phone‚Äôs main screen. </p><h2>  Via google account </h2><div class="photo" data-original="romanchueshov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to track a child‚Äôs phone on android" class="if uuid-2990834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2990834.jpg"></div><p>  In the search bar of the Play Market, you must enter the phrase "Find a device."  There is an application from Google that you need to download.  In the program, you need to enter the account information of the child and enable geolocation in the settings menu.  On the device‚Äôs search site from Google, the location on the map is displayed. </p><p>  Each parent can cope with how to track a child through the phone.  And there are plenty of ways to do this.  Which one to choose, everyone decides for himself.  The main thing is to always be in touch with loved ones in order to be calm for their safety. </p>
