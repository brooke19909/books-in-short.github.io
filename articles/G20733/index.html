And do it at an affordable cost.  Is it possible to find the best combination of price and quality in the Russian capital?  The answer can only be in the affirmative: mini-hotels of Moscow.  However, do not flatter yourself, not all options that seem excellent at first glance are really those.  A list of the most popular mini-hotels in Moscow will help you figure out such a difficult question. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/bulgakov.ru.html?aid=356980;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-ru-bulgakov-unspec-ru-com-L%3Aru-O%3AosSx-B%3Asafari-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=71f9b9e71c6bf0fa6ee70dd9be24f0bb;dist=0&amp;group_adults=1&amp;group_children=0&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;sb_"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-hotel &amp; quot; Bulgakov &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2335539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335539.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-hotel "Bulgakov" </h2><p>  The hotel, rated according to different options from 1 to 2 stars, is not located anywhere, but in the heart of the city - on the Arbat.  In addition to a great place for walking and a sonorous name in honor of the ingenious Russian prose writer, the hotel offers you such amenities as an en suite bathroom (which is not always possible in the case of one or two stars in the hotel business), a reading room with the proposed assortment from several interesting books, as well as a coffee machine with a kettle and a ceiling fan.  Recently, the hotel has been overhauled.  In addition, each guest will be able to have breakfast at the Bulgakov Mini-Hotel.  Moscow generally offers many places of leisure, so if you suddenly do not like hotel dishes, you can always eat in a cozy restaurant on the good old Arbat.  The hotel offers a wonderful opportunity to book a transfer from and to the airports and railway stations, respectively.  The reception is open around the clock. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reviews about "Bulgakov" </h2><p>  However, tourists who have ever spent their Moscow vacations at Bulgakov do not crumble in raptures.  Many argue that, having penetrated Arbat, they could not find the entrance to the mini-hotel in the strange old building of one of the courtyards.  The rooms in which the guests were accommodated did not differ in cleanliness either.  And of course, tourists are not attracted by prices for accommodation in Bulgakov.  For one night, the hotel administration requires from 4 thousand 50 rubles for two adults, and for the possibility of free cancellation of the reservation you need to pay 4.5 thousand rubles for the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel &quot;Orange&quot;" class="if uuid-2335542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335542.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-Hotel "Orange" </h2><p>  A whole network of succulent mini-hotels in <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>Hotels</span> with the bright name "Orange" cannot but attract a flow of tourists from the most different corners of Russia and the world.  It is worth noting that the hotel fully complies with its ‚Äúmini‚Äù format: the number of rooms in one building does not exceed fifteen.  Hotels are scattered in different parts of the Russian capital and are located at the Kuntsevskaya, Akademicheskaya, Tula and Vystavochnaya metro stations, there is also a building at the Yugo-Zapadnaya metro station, 6 kilometers from Bitsa Park.  Frankly speaking, this place is not the best, but many tourists are happy to use the opportunity to enjoy nature without burdening their heads with unnecessary thoughts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The mini-hotel has the opportunity to choose the number corresponding to the claims and the wallet of each.  The minimum cost is 1700 rubles per night, but it allows you to stay in rooms with shared bathroom facilities.  If you want to provide yourself with all the necessary amenities you will have to spend a little more. </p><p>  The hotel also provides a shuttle service (with an additional order), the staff, in addition to Russian, speaks German and English.  On the territory of most buildings there is a small cafe in which a delicious breakfast is served for guests in the morning.  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the Orange Mini-Hotel.  Moscow, as you know, opens the door to all tourists.  The hotel provides visa support to foreign guests.  However, you should always remember: the hotel is private and at any time can refuse to book you without explanation, returning, of course, the full amount of the prepayment. </p><h2>  Mini-Hotel "On Belorusskaya" </h2><p>  "On Belorusskaya" is a <span>mini-hotel in Moscow</span> with a fairly good reputation.  The convenient location of the hotel contributes to the constant influx of tourists: the mini-hotel is located near the Belorusskaya metro station, and, accordingly, close to one of the most important transport hubs of the city - Belorussky Station.  The prices are reasonable - 2200 rubles for a single room. </p><p>  Of the obvious disadvantages of the hotel, reviews highlight the lack of breakfast, as well as a shared bathroom.  At the same time, the hotel has a kitchen where you can easily cook your favorite food.  The room has air conditioning, TV and free internet.  Accommodation for children under seven years of age is absolutely free. </p><h2>  Mini-Hotel "Bastion" </h2><p>  Hotels with the name "Bastion" can be found in various parts of our country.  So, for example, the three-star option is very popular for spending your holidays on a hot Crimean beach.  That is why when describing this hotel it is worth mentioning that this mini-hotel "Bastion" is located in Moscow. </p><p>  In fact, the hotel name for such places is too high.  Bastion is the most ordinary hostel.  It is rated as an economy class hotel.  The location, by the way, is not so convenient - near the Prague metro station (25-30 minutes drive to the center of the capital).  Interestingly, the hostel is currently looking for reception staff.  Experience is not required, for nonresident place of residence is provided.  So, if suddenly you ever wanted to try yourself in the <span>hotel industry,</span> welcome! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-Hotel &quot;Aristocrat&quot;" class="if uuid-2335544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335544.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-Hotel "Aristocrat" </h2><p>  The main and perhaps the only advantage is the location of the Aristocrat mini-hotel.  Moscow is notable for Red Square.  You will have to spend some ten minutes to see the majestic Kremlin, St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral, the History Museum, the Alexander Garden and much, much more. </p><p>  In principle, a mini-hotel is not bad for those who like silence or walk a lot.  It has only eight rooms with a shared bathroom.  Of course, there are no safes in the rooms: cells for storing valuables are provided individually at the reception.  You can use the washing machine, hairdryer - only on request.  At the same time, you can use the washing machine, and if necessary, free Wi-Fi.  It is important to note that upon arrival only cash is accepted for settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roomguru.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.roomguru.ru/Hotel/Mini_Hotel_Atmosphere.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-Hotel &amp; quot; Atmosphere &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2335546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335546.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-Hotel "Atmosphere" </h2><p>  Another option for relaxing in the very center of the capital.  With the Atmosphere mini-hotel, Moscow will open even deeper to you.  Guests note that the rooms are clean and tidy.  All rooms have air conditioning, desk, kettle, coffee maker.  Free Wi-Fi, bathrobe, slippers are provided.  However, the <span>bathroom is shared,</span> which, in principle, is not surprising at a fairly low price for a mini-hotel in the very center of the capital of Russia.  There is one common relaxation room where you can chat with temporary neighbors, watch TV or read.  Another indisputable advantage of the reviews is the location of the hotel at a close distance from one of the main transport hubs of the city - Belorussky Train Station.  Also, you can always walk in the early morning along the <span>embankment of the Moscow River,</span> feeling the charm of the moment on yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-Hotel Chistoprudny" class="if uuid-2335547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335547.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-Hotel Chistoprudny </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that Chistoprudny is located near the metro station Chistye Prudy.  On foot you can reach it in 6 minutes, and after 20 - you will find yourself on the territory of the main place of Russia - Red Square.  In just 2 minutes you can reach Chistoprudny Boulevard. </p><p>  Basmanny, where the hotel is located, is an ideal place for a true theater-goer.  In walking distance - as many as three venues for cultural activities, including the famous "Contemporary" and "Oleg Tabakov Theater".  Unfortunately, breakfast is not provided for guests, however there is a cozy kitchen.  Therefore, you can always cook something on the territory of the Chistoprudny mini-hotel.  Moscow is a place where it is generally difficult to die from a lack of food.  "Chistoprudny" is surrounded by many cozy cafes and restaurants, as well as small "eateries" such as "Burger King". </p><p>  The hotel has a small fund of rooms in the amount of only 18 rooms.  At the same time, each is equipped with a private bathroom, a TV and even a safe.  It features free Wi-Fi.  And all this at an affordable price from 2200 rubles per day for a single room. </p><p>  Of the obvious minuses, tourists note wooden windows and paid slippers.  However, for picky holidaymakers this may seem like a mere trifle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-hotel &quot;Flamingo&quot;" class="if uuid-2335548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335548.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-hotel "Flamingo" </h2><p>  Flamingo is a whole hotel chain in the center of Moscow.  You can fully enjoy life in the center of the capital: on the Old and New Arbat, Basmannaya and Tula.  The simplest and cheapest accommodation option for one person for one night costs about 2.5 thousand rubles.  If you want to feel as comfortable as possible, say, with personal shower facilities, you will have to pay about 4000 rubles per day.  In this regard, Flamingo positions itself as an alternative to expensive Moscow hotels, suitable for all vacationers: from ordinary average Russian families and students to athletes and businessmen. </p><p>  The hotel provides free Wi-Fi, rooms are equipped with refrigerators.  There is a shared kitchen where you can prepare your own dinner.  However, it is worth noting that if you suddenly decided to lose weight on vacation, this option is not for you.  Is it possible to pass by the legendary "Varenichnaya No. 1" or the traditional "Chocolate Girl" on the Arbat? </p><h2>  Reviews about hotel "Flamingo" </h2><p>  Guests celebrate the special cosiness and homely atmosphere of a mini-hotel.  Many people have the feeling that they have rushed to visit old friends.  By the way, when booking a room for a long time, the Flamingo administration provides discounts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.flickr.com/photos/appaloosa/6238832962"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arbat, Moscow" class="if uuid-2335549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72978/2335549.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-hotels of Moscow.  Addresses </h2><p>  For your convenience, we offer a separate list of addresses of all hotels described in the article: </p><p>  1. Mini-hotel "Bulgakov": metro station "Smolenskaya", st.

"Tula", 6th Roshchinsky passage, 1. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  <span>Mini-hotels of Moscow</span> are a great alternative to expensive metropolitan tourist accommodation options.  For many vacationers, you do not need to spend a large amount of money on an elite hotel.  It seems much more reasonable to them to visit as many interesting places as possible: theaters, museums, parks, sports.  To come to the hotel while relaxing in the capital is only for the night, and even then there will be catastrophically little time for sleep.  That is why we advise you to carefully study all budget accommodation options and find the one that is right for you! </p>
