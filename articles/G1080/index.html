  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The learning process is an important component of human life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is a proverb: "Live and learn."  And even someone who is trying in every possible way to refute this opinion, not wanting to comprehend everything new, perfectly understands that it is training that helps to strengthen in this world, to achieve goals and heights. </p><p>  The learning process is a system that is studied by a special science - didactics.  Among its main tasks is to consolidate the data already obtained about this process, as well as further study of its nature and <span>driving forces.</span>  The learning process as an integrated system is a combination of several interrelated, complementary stages.  Professor of the University of Canada Ryerson, Peter Urs Bender, studying the learning process, identified the following, most important stages: </p><ol><li>  Desire and Intention.  Any training always begins with an internal impulse to learn new things.  If a person wants and wants to discover something new for himself, it is easier for him to comprehend.  The more his desire, the more he can learn. </li><li>  Awareness is also part of the learning process.  To think, to really evaluate what is happening around, to observe the movement of people around you, to hear and consciously perceive what they are talking about.  Awareness is a sense of direction that helps to understand what you want or what you still haven’t been able to learn, what other people may need from you, as a person. </li><li>  Information.  Thanks to awareness, a person receives a wide variety of information. </li><li>  Act.  To well understand the information received, it is not enough just to hear, read it.  It is important to act - to teach, apply the gained experience in practice and never forget about it. </li><li>  The final results.  After going through all the stages of training, in the end, a person gets the following: satisfaction from the studied, the embodiment of the studied into reality, desire and willingness to share the knowledge with others. </li></ol><p>  The learning process begins from the moment when a person is born.  At first, it is based on sensations and sounds, and then it gradually becomes more complex, allowing a small child to gradually grow up, moving on to the next step in life.  Throughout his life, a person has been in an ongoing search for new information, new interesting facts and discoveries.  Interest in everything around allows you to occupy a certain social unit, find your calling and pass on your life experience to those to whom it may be useful. </p><p>  Factors affecting the learning process are very diverse.  They are not only social, but also political, economic in nature.  Education of children begins in the family, and the further formation and development of a person depends on how it will be related to this.  The school learning process is the most important, on how it will be properly organized, the students' perception of the surrounding world, the study of sciences and the application of the experience gained in life depend on.  School - this is exactly the important stage of life that gives a person basic skills that allow her to decide on a profession and <span>find an incentive</span> for her future life.  If we talk about political and economic factors, the learning process largely depends on how much attention the state pays to this process, and also to what extent it is engaged in its financing.  Also, the learning process largely depends on what kind of health a person has.  As a rule, in sick people, the motivation for learning decreases sharply, while there are disturbances in the work of such indicators as memory, attention, concentration.  And finally, an important factor influencing the learning process is one’s own mood of a person, because, according to Ryerson, Peter Urs Bender, only desire and desire can give impetus to knowledge. </p>
