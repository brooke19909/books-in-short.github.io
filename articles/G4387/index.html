Even today, it surprises with its magnificence and scale.  His project was developed by world-famous Soviet mechanical scientist and engineer <span>Yevgeny Oskarovich Paton,</span> in whose honor he received his name.  The author proved the possibility of using welding in bridge building, although earlier this was considered unrealistic. </p><h2>  Thought, guessed, and finally built </h2><p>  Paton Bridge, whose history begins at the beginning of the twentieth century, is unique in its construction technology.  Looking a little ahead, we can say that it was the first of its kind and served as a prototype for other similar buildings around the world.  But back to the background. </p>

Since the alley could not be built, the only way out was to create <span>an underground passage.</span>  Professor Evgeny Paton was invited to the development of the project.  However, he was shocked by the beauty of the panorama, which opened in front of him with a view of the left bank of Kiev, so the idea came up to create an exquisite bridge.

    <p>  After Eugene headed the design department at the KPI, his project was implemented, and after a few years the two parks connected.  Today it is the well-known bridge of lovers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After some time, the professor created a welding laboratory and an electric welding committee, which served as the basis for the creation of the world-famous Paton Electric Welding Institute. </p><p>  The construction of supports for the new bridge, which connected the left bank and the right bank of Kiev, began.  However, all affairs were stopped by the war.  After it, the creation of the capital bridge, which was called Kiev Bridge, resumed.  There was an offer from Eugene Paton to use welding when the installation of the runs will be done. </p><p>  An innovation that no one has ever tried, colleagues and superiors did not approve.  However, Paton was very convincing, and Khrushchev gave a green light to the realization of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwelding. </p><p>  A unique building was completed in the mid-50s. </p><p>  It turns out that in the project documents of Yevgeny Oskarovich, the bridge was recorded as the Kiev city.  And in the end, he became one of the largest structures in Europe, he also managed to combine two complex concepts: welding and bridge building. </p>

    <h2>  Some facts </h2><p>  Surprisingly, in Kiev there is a masterpiece that is longer than Khreshchatyk, and this is the Paton Bridge.  Its length is 1543 meters.  The carriageway reaches a width of 21 m, and the sidewalks are about 3 meters.  The metal structures of the bridge weigh almost 11 thousand tons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to ensure safe movement, a special decorative and artistic fence along the entire length was created.  For almost 50 years, a tram drove across the bridge. </p><h2>  How can I get to </h2><p>  For the first time in the capital of Ukraine, a three-level roundabout in the form of a ring was built.  By European standards, it is customary to call it ‚Äúturbine‚Äù.  The creators of the project counted on the fact that cars will not collide with each other, which will facilitate the task for drivers.  In fact, the Paton Bridge interchange scheme is very complex.  It turns out that it is not so easy to understand this "turbine". </p>

Anyone traveling to the Peoples' Friendship station needs to turn to the second right-hand exit and then get into a <span>roundabout.</span>  Calling on the ring from the first right turn will not work.

    <h2>  Tram across the Dnieper </h2><p>  Before the reconstruction was carried out, one of the most important tram lines passing through Paton Bridge connected the left-bank system of the Kiev tram with the right-bank.  However, the tracks were dismantled, and a trolleybus line was laid in their place.  As time has shown, the new transport could not cope with the passenger flow.  All due to the fact that the Kiev tram system was divided into two branches: one was on the left bank, and the second on the right. </p><p>  Over time, the plans included the dismantling of the route line on Naberezhnoye Shosse, which would make it impossible to restore the tram system of the left and right banks.  At the moment, the question remains open. </p><h2>  In fact </h2><p>  It was when it was necessary to demolish the fastenings from the previous structure, which was located on the site of the Paton Bridge, one interesting case occurred.  Under the water, where the supports were, it was necessary to lower the explosives.  At that time, plastic bags have not yet been invented.  And to isolate explosives from water, it took more than 4 thousand condoms. </p>

    <h2>  About sore today </h2><p>  Paton Bridge, a photo of which is presented in the article, is the union of the avenue on the left with the boulevard on the right bank.  Residents can easily get to the desired metro station if there are no traffic jams.  However, recently it has become a sore problem in the capital of Ukraine.  Every day, traffic jams more and more. </p><p>  The most important problem today is high accident rate.  Traffic policemen already consider Paton‚Äôs welded bridge almost bewitched, for which they considered it necessary to consecrate it.  There are tips on the Internet on how to effectively solve the problem of numerous traffic accidents.  One of them is the proposal to close the reverse strip and exchange it for a chipper, which will separate cars moving in different directions. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting </h2><p>  <span>The capital of Ukraine</span> became the birthplace of a new method of construction, and soon it spread throughout the world.  Today, most of the bridges across the water are created exactly according to the same project, according to which the masterpiece of Paton was erected. </p><p>  After the war ended, Khrushchev ordered that Eugene Paton be provided with a car from America for official use.  It was on it that the creator solemnly left the first on the new bridge on the day of its opening. </p>

The project planned the strength of the bridge about 11 thousand cars per day.  However, after a while, after checking, the result of the power pleasantly surprised and pleased.  The stock was simply incredible, it amounted to just over 60 thousand cars per day.

    <p>  At the moment, a project for another reconstruction of the Paton Bridge has already been developed, while it is being considered.  It is planned to expand the carriageway to 38 meters, which, in principle, is realistic only if the reinforced concrete slabs are replaced with those that will be made of steel.  Still in the project there is a proposal to combat corrosion of all bridge structures made of metal, which will contribute to safer operation in the future. </p>
