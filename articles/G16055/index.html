After signing the documents, a PIN code and information on the amount of the approved amount are received on the holder‚Äôs phone.  Customers are interested in how to activate the Tinkoff card.  Few are aware of the possibilities that this procedure provides.  It is worth noting that it is simple and does not require special knowledge. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Before considering the procedure for activating a plastic card from Tinkoff Bank, we‚Äôll tell you how it differs fundamentally from similar banking products of competitors: </p><ul><li>  The bank provides a loyal bonus system for various types of plastic cards. </li><li>  There are monthly statements in electronic and paper formats. </li><li>  An algorithm for providing all types of services online is provided. </li><li>  The bank does not require the presence of guarantors for obtaining a credit card. </li></ul><h2>  What is required </h2><div class="photo" data-original="creditbery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff credit card" class="if uuid-3198985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3198985.jpg"></div><p>  To activate a credit card, the owner will need: </p><ul><li>  Mobile phone number indicated in the loan application. </li><li>  Plastic card delivered by courier. </li><li>  Date of approval. </li><li>  Passport data. </li></ul><p>  If the data specified in your account is incorrect, the client will not be able to complete activation.  In this case, you need to call the hotline number and fix them.  Check the data before sending it several times to avoid errors in personal information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Activation methods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bankonomika.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="activate tinkoff credit card online" class="if uuid-3199000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3199000.jpg"></div><p>  Activation does not require going to the bank branch.  It is very convenient, saves time, as it takes only a few minutes.  It can be carried out using the Internet.  There are two ways to activate a Tinkoff credit card: </p><ul><li>  Through the Internet. </li><li>  By phone. </li></ul><p>  Let's consider each method separately. </p><h2>  Through the Internet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tinkoffbankk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate a tinkoff platinum credit card" class="if uuid-3198970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3198970.jpg"></div><p>  We‚Äôll tell you how to activate a Tinkoff credit card via the Internet: </p><ul><li>  Log in to your personal online banking account. </li><li>  Click on the "credit card" tab. </li><li>  Now you need to select "Tinkoff Platinum" (usually the menu is located at the top of the screen). </li><li>  Click on the activation menu. </li><li>  The next step on how to activate a Tinkoff Platinum credit card is to drive in a personal number and expiration date.  After that, click on the button next to it. </li><li>  The system will ask you to enter the code date set at the time of credit card approval. </li><li>  If the data are entered correctly, the procedure for generating a unique pin code will go through.  The user will see two digits on the monitor screen, and two will come in an SMS message.  The received data is driven into the field by the holder. </li></ul><p>  This is a way to activate a Tinkoff credit card remotely.  Let's move on to the second method. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  By phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ideyaforbiznes-online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank activate credit card" class="if uuid-3198957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3198957.jpg"></div><p>  The second way to activate a Tinkoff bank credit card is by phone.  The holder needs to call 8-800-555-77-71 and provide the following data: </p><ul><li>  Card number. </li><li>  Date of approval. </li><li>  Passport data. </li></ul><p>  If everything is named correctly, the bank manager will dictate a PIN code to be remembered.  The code will also come to the client‚Äôs phone. </p><p>  There is an additional option to send the code to an email address.  We recommend using it. </p><h2>  What is activation for? </h2><p>  Some users wonder not only how to activate a Tinkoff credit card, but also why.  The procedure is required not by the bank employees, as is commonly thought, but by the holder himself.  This is a bank security measure that helps protect customers from scams.  Activation allows you to withdraw cash and pay directly with a card.  Another measure is the client‚Äôs signature on the back of the plastic, without which the credit card is considered invalid. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ideyaforbiznes-online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to activate a tinkoff credit card" class="if uuid-3198937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46164/3198937.jpg"></div><p>  Like any product or service, a Tinkoff bank credit card has its pros and cons.  Some users enthusiastically talk about its capabilities, while others focus on the cons.  Among the advantages we note: </p><ul><li>  Customers like the quick examination of the application and the possibility of delivering a credit card to their home or office: the bank manager specifies where to bring the credit card, at what time.  A few hours before arrival, a reminder comes to the customer‚Äôs phone. </li><li>  According to reviews, cards are accepted in all stores. </li><li>  The bank has more than three hundred partners and allows you to cash money through them. </li><li>  Balance replenishment is carried out without commission. </li><li>  You can order additional cards, attach them to your account and receive bonuses. </li><li>  Each credit card has a grace period. </li><li>  Customers rated the convenience of online banking. </li><li>  The credit limit is renewable and may be increased. </li><li>  It is possible to use contactless payments. </li><li>  The presence of cashback. </li><li>  Efficiency of bank managers. </li></ul><p>  Among the minuses of using a credit card, customers call: </p><ul><li>  Unfavorable conditions for cashing out funds. </li><li>  Difficulties in case of delay. </li><li>  Large amounts required for maintenance. </li><li>  The initial size of the loan limit differs from the declared one in a smaller direction, it rises gradually. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the answer to the question of how to activate a Tinkoff credit card is quite simple.  Activation is designed in the interests of the client and is carried out in several steps.  To use the product or not, each of the customers decides on their own.  The most important thing is to correctly assess your financial capabilities, as the bank has tough measures regarding debtors and late payments.  We recommend that you indicate the real income when applying for a loan.  Based on the information provided, a monthly payment that is comfortable for the borrower will be calculated, which will avoid delay and damage to the credit history. </p><p>  So, we examined what a Tinkoff credit card is, reviews and whether to activate it. </p>
