    <h2>  Team members </h2><p>  Circus of Kiev "Kobzov" exists thanks to a close-knit team of professionals in their field.  These selfless people spend most of their lives in a big top.  The opportunity to see relatives is extremely rare.  It is not at all surprising that many are looking for a mate within the team, and not in the "big world". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting that artists have to face a variety of difficulties in the process of moving to their next destination.  Already on the spot, they should install everything, prepare the big top for the arrival of the audience, conduct exhausting hours of training and give people a holiday, despite the enormous fatigue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev circus address" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/469213.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Circus of Kiev "Kobzov" has an excellent troupe.  It is formed including from world stars.  Among them, Tatyana Belova - a balancer, who has repeatedly received prizes at international festivals, Vladislav Chernysh - two-time champion of Ukraine in cycling trials, as well as many others. </p><p>  The circus tent (Kiev) described completely changes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãclowns.  Everyone is used to seeing them in about the following way: a wig with red curls, a whistle in the mouth, and a red ball on the nose.  Clown duo "Smile" is designed to destroy established stereotypes.  Cheerful and stylish guys will not let you get bored! </p><h2>  Senior Pet </h2><p>  Emmanuel Farina is the jewel of the Vivat program.  This Italian trainer gained worldwide fame not only because he became a multiple winner of various festivals.  Farina gave the <span>Pope</span> an unusual gift - a lion cub.  <span>Benedict XVI, of</span> course, accepted the gift, blessed the animal and asked the circus artists to look after him properly.  Since then, the miracle beast has been the talisman of Kobzov. </p><p>  The performances of the charismatic Italian are particularly popular.  Emmanuel does not get tired of promoting love for animals.  Each of his numbers is unpredictable, because the artist loves improvisation. </p><h2>  Something for adults </h2><p>  Madness is a provocative show representing a new trend in circus art.  It makes one wonder, be enthusiastic and recharge with genuine emotions.  Madness Circus is a show that delights in the soul and horror in the eyes. </p><p>  The project is based on the deepest meaning: humanity has become indifferent, lowered its hands and lost its spirituality.  In a constant pursuit of material values, natural wealth gradually and irrevocably disappears.  Today we do not find time to consider the world around us.  Thanks to the artists, beasts, magicians and show ballet, the audience is involved in a unique atmosphere of passion, crazy energy and happiness. </p>
