This refers to some secret organization leading world processes.  In contrast to this control center, in 1987 an initiative group created the USSR predictor (internal).  Despite the collapse of the country, they decided not to change the name.  What tasks does the predictor of the USSR (internal) solve, who are these people and what are their goals?  Let's take a quick look. </p>

    <h2>  USSR internal predictor: composition </h2><p>  These people call themselves the team of authors.  When they were just starting their activity, it was decided that their work would be signed by an internal predictor (VP).  Surnames will remain behind the scenes.  This was repeatedly said by representatives of the initiative group, leading lecture activities, promoting knowledge. </p><p>  The most popular are Vladimir Mikhailovich Zaznobin and Valery Viktorovich Pyakin.  The videos with their performances gain a huge amount of views.  But each of these people clarifies that he is only part of the team of authors, but does not lead it.  They do not disclose the names of their work colleagues.  Thus, the entire team remains unknown to the general public.  But people are given the opportunity to get acquainted with books and articles created by the initiative group. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Work objectives </h2><p>  Why did the activists undertake rather hard work to comprehend the political and civilizational processes taking place in the world?  The USSR predictor (internal) set himself a number of global tasks.  These people saw that civilization under the control of the "world government" is going to perish.  Therefore, it was necessary to find a way out, a different path of development, and for this to create a different science, culture and even the logic of social behavior.  As you know, the work of the team was more analytical.  This they did, without forcing events.  Articles, references were written, some were published.  The internal predictor of the USSR, whose books were gradually gaining popularity, was thinking about the formation of its own political force.  According to the initiative group, it was necessary: </p><ol><li>  Involve as many people as possible. </li><li>  Disseminate accumulated knowledge. </li></ol>

The aim of the work was and is now the creation of a knowledge system that allows each person to understand what is happening around and influence the progressive development of society.  As a result, the Concept of Public Safety was created.  This is not a separate work, but a whole "library", the author of which is the USSR's internal predictor. </p><p>  Dead Water is the first book recommended to be read.  However, serious difficulties arose with this work.  The book was included in the list of extremist literature.  The initiative group tried in a judicial proceeding to annul the unfair, in their opinion, decision.  As a result, part of the chapters had to be rewritten. </p><p>  BER is a knowledge system that helps to look at the world from a conceptual point of view, that is, to see the true causes of events, to understand how to influence them.  It is not possible to list all the works of the authors in the framework of a short review.  But here are some of the most interesting for beginners fascinating journey into the world of conceptuality: </p><ul><li>  "Fundamentals of sociology."  Here the theme of the relationship between the individual and society, methods of influence on social systems is deeply revealed. </li><li>  "House in Kolomna" shows the essence of the work of A. S. Pushkin as a prophet of the Russian world. </li><li>  "Signs of the time."  The book analyzes the methods for achieving goals used by the global management center. </li></ul>

    <h2>  USSR internal predictor: on the current moment </h2><p>  The team of authors regularly informs the public about what is happening in the world.  Articles are published and distributed, the title of which is almost always the same: ‚ÄúOn the Current Moment‚Äù.  The USSR predictor (internal) in the work considers conceptual trends and directions of development of social processes.  It should be noted: in order to understand the articles, it is necessary to begin to master BER.  They are written in simple Russian, but the authors operate on concepts that are outlined in the concept. </p><p>  The team of authors is constantly expanding.  This happens on personal contacts.  Zaznobin V.M. is working to expand the audience of the VP.  He speaks at international conferences, organizes the translation of BER into other languages.  The authors themselves argue that their worldview system is not a closed school, like a Masonic school.  The USSR VP is interested in the greatest possible number of inhabitants of the planet mastering their system and beginning to ‚Äúthink and act conceptually‚Äù.  And you, dear reader, may well become one of the authors.  But for this you will have to start working on yourself and study a new knowledge system.  Ready? </p>
