    <h2>  Monk Zosima </h2><p>  Zosimova Desert - a women's monastery.  It was founded by a monk, a descendant of a Russian noble family.  In the world he was known as Zachary Verkhovsky.  This man was born in 1768.  He received a home education, at the age of 18 he entered the military service.  After the death of his father, Zachary became the heir to two villages. </p><p>  In 1788, Verkhovsky retired, sold the estate, and tonsured monks.  In 1922 he founded a convent, in which he spent only a few years.  Soon, a conflict occurred between some novices and Zosima.  The nuns accused him of embezzlement and schism.  Zosima left, his spiritual daughters followed.  Together they founded the monastery, which today is known as the Zosimova Deserts. </p><h2>  The foundation of the monastery </h2><p>  In 1826, near Moscow, Zosima founded a women's community.  He lived here until his death.  Zosima gave his last strength to this monastery.  For many years he was looking for benefactors.  It is worth saying that this man, even among the monks, was famous for his unusual craving for solitude.  Last years he spent three miles from the monastery, where he arranged for himself a small cell.  He lived in it for five days.  And Saturday and Sunday spent in the monastery.  Zosima died in 1833. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the monastery </h2><p>  There is an opinion that the old man who founded the monastery is a prototype of the character from the novel ‚ÄúThe Brothers Karamazov‚Äù.  But this is a fallacy.  The colorful hero of Dostoevsky has nothing to do with the monastery in the Moscow region - the Zosimov desert.  Although the character from the book of the Russian classic, just like a real person, was once a military man, he retired with the rank of lieutenant. </p><p>  Like other monasteries and temples, Zosimova deserts and in 1918 was closed.  On the territory of more than eight years, an agricultural artel was operating. </p><p>  In the early thirties, the monastery was converted into a club.  The crosses were demolished, the windows were laid with bricks, and the arches were blocked with a false ceiling.  There was a hospital here during the war.  It is worth saying that the offensive of the enemy of the Red Army was stopped quite near the monastery.  In Naro-Fominsk, as you know, there were fierce battles.  But the Germans failed to approach the holy places. </p><p>  In the sixties, a pioneer camp was opened on the territory of the monastery, where the children of employees of the metro metropolitan rested.  Around this period, the north-west tower and the north-east were destroyed.  Only a fifth remained of the monastery wall.  Here was built a swimming pool, sports complex, carousels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The revival of the monastery took place in 1999.  The first months after the opening, he was the courtyard of the famous Novodevichy Convent, located in Moscow.  And only in March 2002 received the status of an independent monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Zosimova deserts and is located in the village of the same name, which today belongs to <span>New Moscow.</span>  It‚Äôs easy to get here - trains run regularly.  You can get to the station "Bekasovo Center", but, according to reviews, it is more convenient to exit on the platform "Zosimova Pustyn". </p><p>  In June 2000, the founder of the monastery was venerated.  On the territory of the monastery is a monument to Zosim made of white marble.  Overhaul has been carried out in recent years, but construction work is still ongoing.  Although, according to the reviews of people who visited the deserts, an amazing spirit of antiquity reigns here.  And the buildings, which clearly require restoration, do not spoil the overall picture. </p>

    <h2>  Source of Rev. Zosima </h2><p>  Just two kilometers from the monastery is an old well, the water in which, according to legend, is able to heal.  To get to it, you should go along the road past the village of Arkhangelsk.  Turn right at the lake.  Then cross the bridge to the other side, cross the railway line, exit onto the asphalt road.  At the entrance to the forest there is a sign that leads to the source of the Monk Zosima - the second name of the well with healing water.  Not far from it is a ruined chapel. </p><p>  Perhaps in the near future both the well and some buildings located on the territory of the monastery will be restored to proper condition.  Although today, despite some destruction, these places are visited by both believers and simply curious people who are interested in the history of Orthodox churches. </p>
