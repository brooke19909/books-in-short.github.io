  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Salzburg hotels: overview, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Austria is a country in the central part of the European continent that has gained worldwide fame thanks to the great opportunities for the development of both traditional and green tourism, which has gained special popularity in recent years.  The tourism industry in the Austrian economy accounts for almost 9% of Austria's total gross domestic product. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.80949" data-lng="13.055010000000038" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/7/0/17770.png"></div><p>  In this beautiful country, every tourist who comes here will find his "tidbit."  If you are attracted by the cleanest mountain lakes and hot mineral springs, then you need to go to the southernmost federal state of Austria - Carinthia.  If you are a fan of opera, then you are in the capital, in Vienna.  Fans of beautiful landscapes and classical music will discover all this in Salzburg.  We will go there. </p><h2>  Visa application </h2><p>  Austria is a country that is included in the Schengen area, therefore, to get there, citizens of Russia and most CIS countries, except Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, require an entry visa.  To get it for the first time, you must personally submit documents to the Austrian embassy or consulate.  After that, you will have to wait for a while until a decision is made. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A visa can also be obtained by contacting the travel agency where you intend to purchase a tour, or through visa centers accredited with the Austrian Embassy.  Although diplomatic missions are involved in obtaining visas, it is much more convenient to draw up documents through similar offices, which are located in almost every major city in Russia.  Here, a wide network of visa centers in Austria is represented by the operator VFS.GLOBAL. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Visa Center" class="if uuid-3230261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3230261.jpg"></div><p>  To obtain an Austrian visa, the following steps must be taken: </p><ul><li>  Clearly indicate the purpose of the trip.  It must be real, otherwise, if there is any doubt about the truth of the stated goal, you may be denied permission. </li><li>  Collect all the documents that need to be submitted to the Austrian diplomatic missions. </li><li>  Hand over the documents and expect what decision will be made.  In most cases, it is positive. </li></ul><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you decide to make a short independent trip to Austria and visit Salzburg, you will naturally be faced with the question of how to get there most conveniently.  Don‚Äôt worry.  You will not have any problems with this.  Salzburg today is a major transport hub in the center of Austria. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Salzburg Airport" class="if uuid-3230263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3230263.jpg"></div><p>  It has its own international airport, from where flights are made to Munich, Stockholm, Dusseldorf, London, Tallinn and many other cities and countries of Europe.  Railway and bus services also provide an opportunity to get here to many tourists who prefer to travel by land modes of transport. </p><p>  There are no direct flights from Russia to Salzburg, and they are quite expensive both in terms of money and time.  From Moscow you can get here with one change in Munich, Vienna or Frankfurt.  The most budget flight can be made using the services of Lufthansa airline with a round-trip ticket. </p><p>  You can get to Salzburg from Moscow by using two modes of transport - by plane and by train.  The latter option is less expensive in terms of money, but not in time. </p><h2>  A brief introduction to Salzburg </h2><p>  This small town is one of the most famous tourist centers of the country and the capital of the eponymous federal district.  A huge number of tourists are attracted here annually by numerous historical monuments of architecture, which are perfectly preserved in the old part of the city.  This area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Here you can get acquainted with the gallery of European painting, which is located in a 17th-century building, the former residence of the archbishop.  It is also worth visiting the city cathedral, Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter and others. But the main attraction of Salzburg is the place where the world-famous composer Wolfgang A. Mozart was born. </p><p>  To accommodate such a large number of guests in the city there are several hostels, many hotels and guest houses.  In Salzburg, hotels are mainly of 3 * and 4 * class.  There are very few five-star and non-star hotels.  Most of them operate on an all-inclusive basis.  It is also possible to cook for yourself. </p><h2>  City center hotels: Salzburg City 4 * </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.inghams.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salzburg city" class="if uuid-3230264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3230264.jpg"></div><p>  Each traveler, arriving in a foreign city in order to get acquainted with its attractions, always tries to find a hotel in the center for himself.
