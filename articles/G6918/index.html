Definition, features, history and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The meaning of the word "Bonapartism" is inextricably linked with the name of the French Emperor Napoleon I Bonaparte, as it is a term denoting a policy similar to that which he pursued to strengthen his power.  For the period, which includes the XIX, as well as a significant part of the XX century, the forms of this state system underwent significant changes, but the principle laid down in them remained the same.  We will try to characterize its main features. </p><h2>  What is bonapartism? </h2><p>  The most capacious characterization of this phenomenon was given in his writings by V.I. Lenin.  In particular, he pointed out that Bonapartism is primarily a form of dictatorship, in which the political leader uses the army to strengthen control over the state, making it the main pillar of his regime.  In addition, striving to achieve its goals, the new Bonaparte, manipulating the consciousness of people, skillfully maneuvers between classes and individual social layers of society, using them as a tool to maintain their power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sympatico.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bonapartism is" class="if uuid-2232361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2232361.jpg"></div><p>  As many historians have noted, Bonapartism is a dictatorship that proclaims its goal to restore order in the country and thereby attracts the masses to its side, aware of the perilous rule of the anarchy.  It is the fear of comprehensive chaos that is the life-giving force that allows political leaders of this type to successfully confront ideological opponents and hold power in their hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where did the word Bonapartism come from? </h2><p>  Let us turn to the history of the emergence of this term.  Initially, he designated the regime established in France after the victory of the revolution of 1799 and the <span>rise to power of Napoleon</span> Bonaparte.  Having become the first consul and seizing the reins of power of the largest European power, he established a regime of severe despotism.  Later becoming her emperor, Napoleon continued to adhere to the same principles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gettyimages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is Bonapartism" class="if uuid-2232371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2232371.jpg"></div><p>  Later, the term ‚ÄúBonapartism‚Äù was used to refer to domestic policy pursued by another dictator who came to power after the defeat of the 1848 revolution ‚Äî Louis Bonaparte, the nephew of the ‚Äúgreat Corsican‚Äù who had died by then. </p><p>  From December 1852 to September 1870 he was the emperor of France and widely used methods inherited from his crowned uncle to maintain power.  Thus, at an early stage, Bonapartism is a policy born in the fire of the French revolutions.  In the future, many elements of this form of despotism were characteristic of the rule of such prominent political figures as O. Bismarck, who occupied the post of Reich Chancellor of Germany from 1871 to 1890 (his photo is the penultimate article), and P. A. Stolypin, who headed since 1906 to 1911, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bonapartism dictatorship" class="if uuid-2232379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2232379.jpg"></div><h2>  The experience of French dictators in Russian society </h2><p>  Defining Bonapartism, V.I. Lenin wrote that in Russia its reflection was the reaction of the representatives of the upper bourgeoisie to the <span>July crisis of 1917</span> .  In particular, he emphasized that no matter where events unfold, Bonapartism is always an inevitable consequence of the counter-revolutionism of the ruling class. </p><p>  A powerful detonator for its external manifestations was the attempt to implement any democratic transformations and, especially, the commission of revolutions.  It was these conditions that provoked in July 1917 the extremely reactionary actions of the Provisional Government aimed at counteracting the seizure of power by representatives of democratic forces.  As a result, as is known from history, they led only to exacerbation of <span>social tension</span> in the country and the subsequent armed coup.  Similar phenomena were observed in a number of other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meaning of the word bonapartism" class="if uuid-2232383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2232383.jpg"></div><h2>  Lies - a tool of Bonapartism </h2><p>  A very characteristic device, which representatives of this form of dictatorship have resorted to at all times, is the proclamation of the classlessness of their policies.  Such a statement is fundamentally false.  Any political struggle is an expression of the contradictions between the social groups of people that make up one or another social class.  Thus, the reaction to the confrontation between them can in no way be considered outside the manifestation of class interests. </p><h2>  Chauvinism in the service of the ruling classes </h2><p>  Many researchers also note that Bonapartism is a form of military-political dictatorship that uses the widest range of means to achieve its goals.  In particular, its characteristic feature is the combination of demagogy with chauvinistic (extremely nationalist) propaganda, aimed mainly at the poorly educated and backward part of the population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The word Bonapartism" class="if uuid-2232386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2232386.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, wanting to sow discord among the revolutionary masses, the Russian bourgeoisie tried to adopt an ideology based on the denial of internationalism and the assertion of Russian national superiority over representatives of other peoples inhabiting the country. </p><p>  In some cases, this deeply false policy allowed for temporary success, but then inevitably led to an even greater aggravation of the contradictions.  On the whole, to strangle revolutionary movements and democratic freedoms, Bonapartism always resorted to the help of the bureaucracy and the police apparatus, and, where possible, the church. </p><h2>  Civilized solutions to political problems </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Bonapartism is one of the forms of dictatorship aimed at holding power in the hands of the ruling class.  As history shows, its consequences are often completely opposite to their goals and take the form of revolutions and civil wars.  At the same time, in states that have fairly stable democratic traditions, dictatorial methods of political struggle have given way to parliamentary activity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asia.nikkei.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bonapartism definition" class="if uuid-2232388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2232388.jpg"></div><p>  The constructive role in <span>solving political</span> problems in a democratic way is also played by the pre-election contests of parties, the acuteness and orientation of which depend on specific historical realities, due to both the economic situation in the country and the cultural level of its inhabitants.  It is not an exaggeration to say that an indicator of the general progress made by the people is their ability to find political solutions without going beyond the constitutional field. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is this way that eliminates the possibility of the emergence of any form of dictatorship, including those that correspond, in their signs, to Bonapartism, which still has many manifestations in the modern world.  In order for any political struggle to be waged in line with civilized, that is, legalized forms, it is necessary first of all to organize a broad ideological and legal education of citizens aimed at creating a society in which any attempt to strangle democratic freedoms would be unacceptable. </p>
