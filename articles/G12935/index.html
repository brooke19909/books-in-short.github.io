    <h2>  Choosing a good model </h2><p>  When choosing a Chinese projector, you need to pay attention not only to resolution, but also to aspect ratio.  This parameter is usually specified 16: 9.  Matrices are required to operate at a frequency of 200 Hz.  It is important to pay special attention to the noise level when choosing a device.  If you select a device for the home, then the specified parameter should not be less than 40 dB. </p><p>  Minimum resolution is welcomed at the level of 1930 at 900 points.  Brightness of 300 lumens is definitely enough.  Lastly, the control panel is checked.  It should have a menu button, as well as shutdown.  Separately, manufacturers set the clarity control.  To understand this issue in more detail, you need to consider the most popular projectors and understand their advantages and disadvantages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
