    <h2>  Phone support </h2><p>  The company is quite attentive to its customers, therefore a multi-level system of customer assistance has been developed.  And in the first 90 days after the purchase, Apple warranty repair can be found free of charge by calling customer support.  Qualified specialists consider the client‚Äôs appeal, and then decide which category they belong to.  So, there are several problems: </p><ul><li>  operation of equipment; </li><li>  product assembly; </li><li>  device connection; </li><li>  hardware problems </li><li>  software problems. </li></ul><p>  After qualifying the appeal, it is transferred to the master responsible for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warranty repair apple iphone" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/719972.jpg" width="400"></div>

And many owners of "apple" products most often expect that they will receive exactly the warranty repair of Apple for free.  However, this is not quite true.  There are a huge number of repair services, far from each of which accepts equipment under warranty without payment. </p><h2>  Free Repair </h2><p>  You can try to find the official service center recommended by the company in your city.  Warranty repair Apple free is only possible in it.  A private company, which has not signed an agreement with an "apple" company, will not undertake it.  Defective items that were not subject to external damage (that is, they were malfunctioning from the very beginning) are subject to free repair. </p><p>  All Apple products have a one-year limited warranty.  During this time period, defective items can be replaced or repaired for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warranty repair apple ipad" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/719968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is not included in the warranty </h2><p>  During operation, owners are often to blame for device breakdowns.  So, for example, many users seek to violate the terms of the guarantee by installing content that is not certified by the company.  And, by the way, jailbreak, which about 40% of owners sin, is one of them.  If the device fails because of this, then you can forget about the warranty right away.  In addition, there are a number of standard breakdowns that are not subject to free repair.  For the money produced: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  replacement and correction of items that are not owned by Apple, even if supplied with the gadget (for example, non-branded headphones that are so fond of "giving" in stores when buying); </li><li>  repair of parts that tend to wear out (batteries, <span>protective films,</span> covers, etc.); </li><li>  repair of hacked or previously repaired elements (that is, if previously someone already tried to fix broken parts, the warranty disappears). </li></ul><p>  In the latter case, there is an exception.  For example, Apple (iPhone) warranty repairs were performed by an authorized service center.  In this case, the one-year right to a free replacement of the fault is retained.  The repair mark should be in the documents on the gadget and, of course, will be displayed in the personal data stored in the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="service center warranty repair apple" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/719969.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Replacement programs </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the company carefully monitors the quality of its products.  Therefore, factory faults are carefully studied.  That is why the manufacturer has developed a number of programs to expand guarantees.  You don‚Äôt have to pay for it!  And if necessary, then losses can be compensated.  An example of such a program will be described below. </p><h2>  Apple Extended Warranty Repair </h2><p>  So what does this mean?  This is not an extension of the <span>warranty period,</span> but a program to support the quality of service.  So, for example, the MacBook Pro can be factory-defective (spontaneous reboot or lack of image).  In this case, you can contact the official service representative of the company in the buyer's country of residence for diagnosis.  If during its course it is revealed that the device falls under an extended warranty repair, then it will be produced.  It is noteworthy that money should not be taken for this.  However, sometimes representatives go to the trick, eliminating immediately all the malfunctions (both warranty and beyond).  In this case, you can directly contact the company, describing the situation in detail.  In 99% of cases, funds spent on replacing items subject to extended warranty service are refunded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warranty repair apple in spb" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/719967.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Where to look for official representatives </h2><p>  There are many repair companies.  But not every one of them is the official representative of the manufacturer.  Therefore, it is worth looking for the latter in order to be sure that the rights will be fully respected.  So, for example, Apple warranty repair in St. Petersburg (St. Petersburg) is carried out immediately at seven different points.  But each of them has its own specialization.  Making a choice is quite simple: </p><ol><li>  Go to the official website of the company. </li><li>  Go to "Support". </li><li>  Select the sub-item "Service". </li><li>  You can find the right authorized service representative in it. </li><li>  You must select a city, device, operator. </li><li>  View all offers (address, phone, mode of operation). </li></ol><p>  Thus, you can make warranty repairs for Apple <span>(iPad, iPhone)</span> in a service center convenient for your location and specialization. </p><h2>  Store Warranty </h2><p>  Every <span>sales representative</span> who sells Apple products is under the obligation to provide a warranty.  Therefore, you can contact with malfunctions in the first place exactly to the place where the gadget was purchased.  They do not have the right to refuse diagnostics.  As well as violating the terms of warranty service.  It is noteworthy that the buyer must provide an equivalent device for the duration of the repair, which is worth remembering.  Apple Service Warranty applies to all authorized representatives.  Therefore, you can turn to them too - refuse to repair and diagnose also do not have the right.  This is the direct responsibility of representatives.  If the buyer was deceived, he retains the right to contact the company with a claim directly. </p>
