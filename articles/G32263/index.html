    <p>  It was here that palaces were erected with the light hand of Peter I, where the entire royal court rested in summer.  His work was continued by the following representatives of the Romanov family, and what today is the greatest architectural open-air museum is the work of the best masters for 200 years.  One of its pearls is the Tsaritsyn Pavilion in Peterhof. </p><h2>  History of the construction of the pavilion </h2><p>  Each palace architectural complex in this place and even some fountains are confined to any events or festivities.  So the small Tsaritsyn Pavilion in Peterhof was built by decree of Nicholas I as a sign of comfort for his wife, who survived the death of her daughter.  He presented another pavilion on a neighboring island to his other daughter, Olga, on the day of her marriage to Prince Karl of W√ºrttemberg. </p><p>  The house was built in the style of ancient Roman villas, which was a big fashion.  It is called ‚ÄúPompeii,‚Äù since it was at this time that the city of Pompeii and its suburbs buried under a layer of ash were found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Architect Shtackenschneider</span> and gardener Erler were instructed to recreate a romantic paradise in the small Tsaritsyno island in the middle of Holguin Pond, which the Empress Alexandra Fedorovna loved so much. </p>

    <p>  They fully succeeded.  As the <span>Grand Duke Konstantin</span> Nikolaevich noted, their son, Tsaritsyn Pavilion in Peterhof, which cost the treasury a million two hundred thousand rubles, was wonderful and really liked the Empress. </p><p>  The house consists of 7 rooms and a terrace.  Surrounded by a garden and water, it still creates the impression of a quiet corner for peace of mind.  There is nothing easier than to get to Peterhof from St. Petersburg from the Avtovo metro station.  Shuttle taxis No. 224, 300, 424 and 424a depart from here. </p><h2>  Atrium </h2><p>  The first guests are greeted by a hall built according to the architectural standards of ancient Pompeii.  Atrium is a guest room where the hosts spend daytime activities surrounded by servants or guests.  In such a room there is a swimming pool and a roof hole through which fresh air would flow in hot Italy and cool the hall on sunny days, or rainwater would fill the pool during heavy rains. </p><p>  But to be in the atrium during the dank Petersburg winters is a dubious pleasure, therefore the architect A.I. Shtakenschneider provided a glass dome in the roof, which was cleaned in the summer.  The rest of the hall is similar to the ancient original: in the middle is a pool with a fountain made of blue and pink marble.  At its corners are columns that support the roof, and the walls of the room are painted with frescoes depicting sea monsters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The bronze figures</span> adorning the pool were personally brought by Nicholas I from Italy. </p>

To see this strict beauty, it is enough to come to the Tsaritsyn Pavilion in Peterhof, whose opening hours are from 10.30 to 18.00 daily. </p><p>  From the office through the door it was easy to get into the inner garden, at the end of which you can go up the external stairs to the tower, where the emperor‚Äôs office was located.
