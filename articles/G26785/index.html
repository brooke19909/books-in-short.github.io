    <p>  <span>Rehana Resort 4 * Sharm is</span> suitable for people who want to enjoy a relaxing family vacation, spending time on their leisure time on a calm beach owned by the hotel.  For those who crave the exciting nightlife of discos, bars and clubs, there is a sightseeing bus near the hotel that will bring you 18 km to Naama Bay with its many attractions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rehana <span>Sharm Resort 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh)</span> was opened in 2007, but in a short time it became a favorite vacation spot for couples, lovers and those who appreciate privacy with nature.  In 2012, the hotel partially renovated, which today makes it look like it was recently built.  Construction of new buildings is still underway on its territory, which allows us to hope that the hotel will expand both the area for living and the number of entertainments. </p><h2>  Nabq Bay </h2><p>  This is the most remote bay resort of Sharm El Sheikh.  It is famous for its many inexpensive family-friendly hotels. </p><p>  Open to all winds, this bay is unsuitable for swimming in winter due to strong storms and winds, although in good weather the water is warm enough to plunge into the Red Sea.  The best time for relaxation, as the reviews of the Rehana Sharm Resort 4 * hotel (Egypt) say, is autumn and spring.  For those who want to get the most out of the pleasure with the least outlay, the hotel waits in the winter when you can have a great time by the pool, without depriving yourself of all the other pleasures. </p><p>  The corals in Nabq Bay are far away, so diving fans of the Rehana Royal Sharm Resort 4 * hotel are unlikely to do, but some of the bay's beaches are cleared of coral growth, which makes it possible to enter the sea.  In general, it is advisable to purchase special bathing shoes in the hotel‚Äôs store. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the 2nd line, and the beach, equipped with a pontoon for swimming in depth, belongs to a 5-star institution of the same name.  They peacefully share the coastline between their customers, and at the same time there are always free sunbeds.  In this bay, all the beaches are equipped with piers, some of them reach a length of 1 km, since the feature of the bay is the shallows, which are only 1 m deep. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach Hotel Rehana Sharm Resort 4 * </h2><p>  An amazing feature of the <span>Rehana Resort 4 * Sharm</span> is the presence of an underground tunnel that allows guests to walk to the beach of the Rehana Resort 5 * hotel, which is only about 700 meters away. between the hotel and the beach. </p>

Helpful waiters will bring the order directly to the deck chair. </li><li>  A photographer working on the beach will take professional pictures in the shortest possible time. </li></ul><p>  Caring for the guests of the Rehana <span>Sharm Resort 4 *</span> hotel <span>(Sharm</span> el Sheikh) on the beach is of the same excellent quality as on its territory.  As noted by those who rested here, the administration and hotel employees really know their job well and try to please every client. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  By what kind of services and entertainment the hotel offers, you can judge the quality of the holiday. </p>
