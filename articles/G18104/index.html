    <p>  And now, while waiting for their vacation, they are looking for a new travel option until they finally find it in a blessed country, where a crop ripens three times a year, where beaches delight with exotic white sand, and the turquoise sea is visible tens of meters in depth.  They excitedly ask Google: "How much to fly to Thailand?".  The question is purely practical, but some hint of concern is guessed in it.  Of course, those who asked him carefully looked at the map. </p><p>  Google, as always, is wise.  The plane, carrying out a tourist flight, must cross as many as three time zones.  This means that the actual flight time, which is approximately 9 hours for a flight from Moscow to the Land of Smiles, is artificially reduced to 6 hours.  A tourist who is just preoccupied with the question of how much to fly to Thailand, as a rule, calms down on this and starts looking for a suitable tour. </p><h2>  Holidays in Phuket </h2><p>  The unique resort potential and developed tourist infrastructure has the island of Phuket.  It is located in the <span>Andaman Sea</span> near the western coast of Thailand and is connected to the mainland by three bridges.  Here are some of the most rated beaches in the world, long and covered with unique white sand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most tourists fly to the Land of Smiles solely because of the rest on its beaches.  Their names - Patong (which bears the same name as the entire resort), Kata, Karon, Kata-Noi, Naihan - like gentle music, caress the ears of holiday-makers from different countries.  Moreover, the "star" of the hotel for them does not play a decisive role.  Most young tourists buy a tour to an inexpensive hotel complex, investing their money in excursions. </p>

    <p>  A standard transfer to the hotel by a middle class taxi (‚ÄúToyota‚Äù sedan) awaits them, which will cost them 1000 baht.  One of the popular hotel complexes providing a decent level of basic resort services is the Days Inn Patong Beach 3 *.  Reviews of tourists about him are friendly and grateful.  Transfer to it takes 40 minutes. </p><p>  The price of the tour is also attractive: for accommodation in a double room 2 adults for 5 days without food will have to pay only 13221 rubles. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The tropical monsoon climate of the island determines the presence of dry (from November to April) and wet (from May to October) seasons.  At the same time, the waters of the Andaman Sea are suitable for swimming year-round, and the air temperature is approximately the same throughout the year.  In the hottest month - April - it does not rise above 28.5 ¬∞ C, and in the coldest - October - its value is 26.8 ¬∞ C. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the dry, or high, season, the resort island is visited by a maximum of tourists.  January is its peak: the sky is amazingly clear, the weather is beautiful, and prices are doubled.  <span>Hotels in Patong,</span> and the Days Inn Patong Beach 3 among them, are filled almost to the eyeballs.  Tours for this time should be bought in advance - for 3 months. </p><p>  The rainy season in Phuket also has its ‚Äúpluses‚Äù: quite substantial discounts on the purchase of tours and lower prices for fruits.  Moreover, the rains in Thailand are not so long, they usually go at night.  Their duration is generally small - only 40-60 minutes.  At the same time, the air temperature is in the range of 20-27 ¬∞ C, and the sea remains fabulously warm.  Many people in temperate latitudes prefer to relax in Tae during the rainy season. </p><p>  A feature of Patong resort is another climatic factor, which, perhaps, is not found in neo-oceanic resorts.  This is the height of the waves.  In June - August in the open water area they reach a height dangerous for bathers.  At this time, tourists prefer to slide on them on the board rather than swim. </p><h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  It is located in the heart of the resort of Patong - a small hotel Days Inn Patong Beach 3 *.  Its room stock includes only 70 rooms.  Finnish businessmen own it, which, judging by the reviews, can be trusted.  The staff cherishes its place and shows attention and care to the guests.  The contingent of vacationers is diverse: more Americans and Europeans, fewer Chinese, Russians, Ukrainians. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Tourists of temperate latitudes, resting under the tropical sun of Thailand, are forced to observe safety measures - no one is safe from getting sunburn.  To do this, they should not save on high-quality tanning creams, which are better to buy in the resort of Patong.  The level of protection for local creams reaches the required SFF of 70, while drugs purchased at home reach only 30 units, which does not protect against burns.  At the same time, the cream acquired in Patong should be applied 3-4 times a day to the body.  What do you want - the tropics ... </p>

Patong Beach is located just 250-300 meters from it.  It is huge and noisy, the infrastructure is amazing with the number of restaurants, massage parlors, various entertainment venues.  Salesmen scurry about it every now and then, distributing tickets to various shows.  If we talk about its resort advantages, it is sandy, with a smooth entry into the water, but the sea in its water area is unclear.  Patong Beach is ideal for foam parties, meetings, walks and all kinds of entertainment.  Here you can take a jet ski or fly a parachute behind a boat.  For a traditional beach holiday, Kata Noi and Karun zones with white sand and clear turquoise water are more suitable.

    <p>  Ideal and deserted (in the Bounty style), but small beaches can be found in the lagoons located in the north of the island. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Water sports enthusiasts in Patong have the opportunity to go diving, surfing, water skiing, fishing, yachting.  Having bought several diving or surfing lessons and having succeeded in the science of controlling breathing or keeping balance, they acquire a new magnificent hobby.  In contrast, water ski enthusiasts are a more professional caste.  Keeping a balance on them is much more difficult; you cannot learn this in a couple of lessons. </p>
