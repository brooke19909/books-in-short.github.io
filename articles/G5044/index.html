    <p>  The international airport is just 30 km from Blanes.  However, experienced travelers do not advise flying to tourists who have booked rooms at the Costa Brava Blanes 2 * hotel.  You will have to get to the hotel from this airport with several transfers.  Which, of course, is not too convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who decide to spend their holidays in Blanes should still use the services of Aeroflot (Sheremetyevo) or Vueling Airlines (Domodedovo) companies that organize flights to El Prat Airport.  A Sagal√©s bus daily runs from here to Blanes.  It is worth a trip on it for only about 11.5 euros.  The total travel time to the village is 1 hour.  From the nearest bus stop in Blanes itself, the transfer is carried out by the hotel itself. </p><p>  It takes care of how to get to the Costa Brava Blanes 2 * hotel, reviews of which are mostly only good, of course, only those vacationers who rented rooms here on their own need.  Travel agencies usually organize a shuttle bus for their customers who have bought trips with accommodation in this hotel.  Most often this is a modern technology, equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable trip. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  On some travel agency sites it is indicated that the Costa Brava Blanes 2 * hotel is located in the village of Toss.  However, this, of course, is not the case.  Apparently, an inaccuracy was once made on one of such Internet sites, and other companies simply copied this false information to their resources. </p><p>  Sometimes even the managers of travel agencies themselves are mistaken and tell customers who wish to rent rooms in the Costa Brava Blanes 2 * hotel that it is located in Tossa.  In such cases, you just need to ask the agent to double-check the information.  This hotel is, of course, still in Blanos. </p>
