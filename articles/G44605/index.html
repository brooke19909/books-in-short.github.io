Useful tips for knitters</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who have long knitted, know if you need to increase the number of loops in a row (that is, add them), you should apply air loops.  They can be located after the edge, inside the rows or outside.  We learn about how to draw air loops with knitting needles from this article.  This is much simpler than it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  Where can they come in handy? </h2><p>  As a rule, knitting air loops with needles is necessary when expanding the knitted fabric, when it is necessary to increase the number of loops sharply along the edge of the part, and not by gradual dialing. </p><p>  This happens when a funny hat with ears is knitted.  The process starts from the abalone, and then loops should be added to get the main part of the cap.  This method is also suitable when creating a one-piece kimono sleeve.  In this case, the loops are added starting from the armhole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepik.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/threads-and-knitting-needles-for-hand-knitting_1825504.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-3039267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3039267.jpg"></div><p>  Where else can such a scheme be applied?  When it is necessary to make various holes in a knitted fabric, which is made horizontally: for example, welt pockets, loops for fasteners, holes for thumbs on mittens. </p><p>  When working on these parts, the loops for the hole first close, but in the next row, to replenish the number of loops, they must be taken in by air. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to create them? </h2><p>  How to draw air loops with knitting needles?  Initially, it should be understood that they are the basis of every knitted thing.  If you type them correctly, the edge of the product will turn out to be elastic and will stretch well. </p><p>  To get the required number of these loops, the craftswoman will need two knitting needles that should fit snugly together, and a ball of thread selected for work.  The tip of the ball should be long enough and hang freely.  The knitting needles are held in the right hand, and in the left - the thread so that it can pass at the base of the thumb and forefinger from the outside.  It must be fixed in the palm of your hand with other fingers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.the-knitting-wool-store.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.the-knitting-wool-store.com/how-to-knit-buttonholes.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="We collect air loops" class="if uuid-3039309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3039309.jpg"></div><p>  Now you need to enter the knitting needles into the resulting loop from the outside of the thumb.  Then pick up the thread from the index (also outside) and tighten the air loop on the knitting needles, which turned out.  Likewise, do as many times as necessary. </p><h2>  How to dial? </h2><p>  Let's talk about the ways in which they are created.  How to draw air loops with knitting needles?  This can be done in two ways.  Their difference is in how the loop will pounce on the spoke.  But in the end, the craftswoman gets exactly the same elements.  Everything depends solely on who and how convenient it is to type loops for work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To make the edge of the product thin, you can use a method called hanging.  In this case, the loops are obtained by hanging threads on knitting needles.  That is, the thread folds in the form of a loop and is worn on knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knitting-naturally.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.knitting-naturally.com/how-to-hold-knitting-needles.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-3039314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3039314.jpg"></div><p>  Other schemes are a bit more complicated to complete.  With your right hand you need to grab the end of the thread and the working needle.  Grab the material with your left thumb and pull it to the side a little.  Using a finger, take the yarn counterclockwise.  At the same time, pick up the lower thread with a knitting needle, pushing it with a point under it. </p><p>  How to dial air loops differently when knitting?  Consider another option when creating loops with a right turn.  The thread must be moved clockwise.  Start the needle under the thread from yourself.  Put the loop on the left knitting needle and tighten. </p><p>  Knitting air loops is not at all difficult.  You just need to practice a little. </p><h2>  In the center of the row </h2><p>  And how to draw air loops with knitting needles in the middle of the row?  Such a skill can be useful if, for example, you need to create a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù for a button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gypsywools.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.gypsywools.com/products/prym-single-point-knitting-needles"><img itemprop="image" alt="Start knitting" class="if uuid-3039343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3039343.jpg"></div><p>  With your thumb, you need to hold the loops located on the left needle so that they do not slip.  Now you can carry out a sketch with knitting needles of air loops in the amount that is provided for by the knitting scheme. </p><p>  After you have already gained the required amount, knitting continues from the left knitting needle.  So a few loops are added in a row. </p><h2>  At the end of the row </h2><p>  The craftswoman finished the series with the main drawing and closed the edge.  Now she needs to dial with the help of knitting needles several air loops according to the scheme.  This is quite simple to accomplish using one of the above methods.  You can choose the one that you liked more or seemed easier to execute. </p><p>  In this case, the most important thing is not how to type them, but how to knit them in the next row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knitting-naturally.com" data-author=": Mel North | Flickr Knitting Buttonholes, " data-source="https://www.knitting-naturally.com/how-to-knit-buttonholes.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Buttonhole knitting" class="if uuid-3039297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3039297.jpg"></div><p>  Need to turn the product over.  Now these new air loops will be in the first row.  That is how air will be the first extreme.  It just needs to be removed, like the most ordinary edge when knitting. </p><p>  The remaining loops can be knitted as purl.  They should be pretty good, tightly tighten to each other.  Then unnecessary holes do not form. </p><p>  Now, perhaps, it became clear how to dial air loops with knitting needles.  To do this is not as difficult as it might seem at first.  And even a beginner knitter can cope with this task. </p>
