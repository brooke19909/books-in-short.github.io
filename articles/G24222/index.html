Bright and contrasting, it attracts a huge number of tourists who want to look at the picturesque landscapes and fully enjoy the sights that will satisfy even the most sophisticated taste. </p><h2>  Unknown Spain </h2><p>  The city of Bilbao is full of historical monuments that have preserved their national flavor, and is rich in fantastic buildings that open their eyes to the unknown Spain.  As the locals say, here you can visit the time machine, plunging into the past and future.  Surprisingly, in just twenty years, the city has changed dramatically. </p><p>  The cultural center, which has turned from a small village into a major port of the country, is extremely attractive to all visitors to the city.  Ancient Bilbao, whose sights will be remembered for a long time, is famous for the main architectural building that has become world famous. </p><h2>  Guggenheim Museum </h2><p>  <span>The Guggenheim Museum,</span> created in the image of a futuristic alien ship, was opened 19 years ago.  The impressive structure, about 50 meters high, was created in the manner of deconstructivism, which is characterized by broken lines and unusual shapes.  The Museum of Modern Art, built on the banks of the river, makes an indelible impression: titanium structures sparkle in the sun, and inside the atrium made of glass and steel resembles a huge maze. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of bilbao and the surrounding area" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1339054.jpg" width="600"></div>

The sights set on it amaze with its unusualness: a huge frame spider and a puppy made of flowers have long become peculiar symbols of the city. </p><h2>  White bridge </h2><p>  Not far from the museum there is an amazing bridge paved with glass tiles.  The structure, consisting of curved arches, suspended on metal cables, resembles the spine of a giant dinosaur.  The pedestrian suspension bridge looks impressive in the dark, when the glass of a beautiful building and the titanium surface of the museum are reflected in each other, creating amazing effects.  It is at night that the snow-white illumination of the unique bridge is turned on, on which all the lovers of <span>Bilbao (Spain)</span> adore kissing <span>.</span>  Sights made in the style of futuristic architecture wonderfully complement each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bilbao spain sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1339053.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Begonia Basilica </h2><p>  Tourists, making a leap from the future to the past, fall into the wonderful basilica erected in the 16th century.  The church dedicated to Our Lady of Begonier was built in the Gothic style, however its entrance is made in the form of an arch, which looks very curious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bilbao attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1339052.jpg" width="600"></div>

The sights are famous for the facade decorated with <span>lancet arches</span> and colorful stained-glass windows. </p><h2>  Old city </h2><p>  Every day, tourists rushing to the old part of the city to touch the ancient history.  The Casco Viejo region has perfectly preserved all the monuments recognized as a legacy of the dynamically developing Bilbao.  The sights of the old quarter are not in vain called the soul of the city.  Here you can wander through seven charming streets, getting acquainted with the various architectural styles of buildings erected in previous centuries.  Embellished with colorful coats of arms with wrought-iron balconies, the main square turning into a flea market on weekends, the Gothic cathedral beckons travelers who admit their love for the <span>Spanish city.</span> </p><h2>  Sights of Bilbao and surroundings </h2><p>  A tiny village with colorful houses is not in vain called the most beautiful place on the coast.  The village of Elanchove, surrounded by rocks, is a very interesting place to relax.  The unusually narrow streets on which you will not find vehicles belong exclusively to backpackers.  Not many guests of the country come here, because the village is devoid of beaches, and therefore it will appeal to those who prefer a secluded vacation away from the noise and problems of megacities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bilbao sights reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1339055.jpg" width="332"></div>
