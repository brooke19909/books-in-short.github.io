However, this does not mean at all that there is nothing interesting in this village.  Where to go and what to see in Khanty-Mansiysk, we tell in our material. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.00909189999999" data-lng="69.03745959999992" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/0/9/5/14095.png"></div><h2>  Hunting Monument </h2><p>  If you arrived in Khanty-Mansiysk by plane, the first monument you saw when entering the city will be the above-mentioned monument.  He depicts a family of Khanty in a halt - father, mother and baby.  Near them - a deer and a dog.  The figures are made in full size, which gives them a resemblance to living people, and there is no end to those who want to be photographed near the composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.openarium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hunting Monument" class="if uuid-3066264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3066264.jpg"></div><h2>  Archeopark </h2><p>  You will not find such a thing in any city anymore - and this is rightfully considered to be a real calling card of Khanty-Mansiysk.  The archeopark there is a whole cultural and historical complex, on the territory of which there are various sculptures of ancient people and animals.  Named this place is the "Namber One" in the list of what you can see in Khanty-Mansiysk.  The archaeopark is called the Samarovsky Outlier, and it shows the figures of mammoths and bison, wolves and lions, deer and rhinos, and so on.  The sculpture of 11 mammoths is considered the most important in the park, in addition, it is a symbol of the whole city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="krasotyrossii.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archeopark in Khanty-Mansiysk" class="if uuid-3065995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3065995.jpg"></div><p>  The archeopark appeared in Khanty-Mansiysk not so long ago - it is only ten years old.  However, he already managed to win both the love of the inhabitants and the continued interest of all the guests of the city.  It‚Äôs also great in the park that you can climb all the sculptures except mammoths, so this place is a great option for where to go with a child in Khanty-Mansiysk.  Almost all the figures are made in full size, and some are even larger than in life.  So for children to play there is a complete pleasure! </p><h2>  Ethnographical museum </h2><p>  Another local attraction is the ethnographic museum, which is called "Torum-Maa" and is located directly in the open air, in the middle of picturesque Siberian nature and chic taiga.  The museum displays exhibits telling about the traditions and life of the indigenous peoples of these places: clothing, buildings, jewelry and the like.  The museum is interesting in that it constantly hosts various holidays, exhibitions and cultural events - for example, the wagtail festival.  Do not know where to go in Khanty-Mansiysk?  Go to the open-air museum - this is a win-win! </p><h2>  Nature Park </h2><p>  Where to go in Khanty-Mansiysk?  If it‚Äôs warm outside, and you are a lover of natural entertainment, the answer is obvious: of course, to the Samarovsky Chugas ecotourism park!  It has the status of a natural monument and extends over more than six thousand hectares - and this area is constantly increasing.  Forests and lakes, fields and streams - all this is part of the natural complex.  And on its territory there are many rare plants and animals.  Walking in the Samarovsky Chugas is a pleasure, and you can do it both independently and in the company of an experienced guide. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Church of the Protection of the Holy Virgin </h2><p>  Even if you are not a believer, the aforementioned temple is definitely the place to go to Khanty-Mansiysk - at least in order to see this beautiful cathedral with your own eyes.  It was originally erected at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the revolution of the twenties of the last century did not pass it either.  The temple was destroyed, and for a long time - until the mid-nineties - in its place were ruins and wasteland.  Only twenty-odd years ago, work began on this site and a decision was made to rebuild the temple. </p><h2>  Faberge Fountain </h2><p>  Everyone heard about expensive Faberge products, but among the attractions of Khanty-Mansiysk (pictured below) there is a whole fountain with that name.  It, of course, is not gold, and it is not inlaid with diamonds, but it resembles the famous egg of a famous jeweler in its form and appearance.  In the evenings, the fountain is illuminated and its lights simply dazzle! </p><div class="photo" data-original="visit-hm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Faberge Fountain" class="if uuid-3066004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3066004.jpg"></div><p>  It took several months to create the fountain;  its individual parts are made of bronze and colored glass to give the composition as much as possible similar to the original Faberge product.  This element of urban "decor" has been delighting the eyes of the inhabitants of Khanty-Mansiysk for ten years now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of the Resurrection </h2><p>  Another temple in Khanty-Mansiysk, where you need to go without fail.  Strictly speaking, this is not one small temple, but a whole complex.  He is relatively young - next year he will be only twenty years old.  The temple is noteworthy in that, remaining in its first years virgin white, not so long ago it was in all its breadth and height painted with unusually beautiful frescoes.  Five golden domes crown the temple.  Seeing it with your own eyes is by all means! </p><p>  The complex has its own park with fountains, an Orthodox gymnasium, a Sunday school, as well as a crucifix and a monument to Cyril and Methodius, the holy brothers who made a huge contribution to the enlightenment of the Slavic people.  An interesting and interesting, by the way, fact: it is the Church of the Resurrection of Christ in Khanty-Mansiysk that is mentioned in one of the modern films with actress Anastasia Zavorotnyuk in the title role. </p><h2>  Stela "To the Conquerors of the Land of Ugra" </h2><p>  What to see in Khanty-Mansiysk from the sights?  Of course, a beautiful monument dedicated to the conquerors of the area.  First of all, it is interesting for its appearance: executed in the form of a pyramid, as conceived by architects, it simultaneously resembles the plague of local indigenous peoples, the Cossack observation tower, and the oil rig.  Secondly, each of the faces of the stele (there are three in total) symbolizes a certain time: the ancient era, then the period of the conquest of Ugra by Yermak and, finally, modernity with the development of oil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The stele of the conquerors of the land of Ugra" class="if uuid-3065997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3065997.jpg"></div><p>  What is more attractive this attraction of the city of Khanty-Mansiysk is its backlight.  There are no analogs like this in the whole country!  The thing is that it is carried out with the help of more than a hundred computer backlight programs, which together create more than a thousand different variations.  The sight seen is truly impressive. </p><p>  Inside the stele is hollow, but this space, by the way, a height of as much as 62 meters, is not empty.  There is a restaurant on the first level of the monument, a museum above;  finally, at the very top there is an observation deck from where a stunning view of Samarovo - the old part of the city.  By the way, they promise to soon open an exotarium in the stele - a room for keeping exotic animals. </p><h2>  Champagne Spray Fountain </h2><p>  The Faberge Fountain is by no means the only unusual in Khanty-Mansiysk.  What else to see in this city is the fountain "Champagne Spray".  Similar to it there are also in other cities, but it is Ugra that is of interest to us. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ugra-tv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Champagne Spray Fountain" class="if uuid-3066006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3066006.jpg"></div><p>  It is located on Freedom Square, in the old part of the city, and is a combination of two bowls of granite.  Below the bowl is larger, above it is a smaller one.  From the top, decorated with twelve balls, jets of water pour into the bottom.  The fountain is very beautiful and deserves to be seen by guests of the Ugra capital. </p><h2>  City Embankment </h2><p>  Where can I go in Khanty-Mansiysk, in addition to all of the above?  On the city promenade, of course.  Despite the fact that there is nothing particularly remarkable in it, this is a great place for walks - both alone, as a family or together with the second half.  Fresh air blows from the Irtysh River, on the contrary, wonderful views open up - a great option for relaxing and not rushing anywhere. </p><h2>  Museum of Nature and Man </h2><p>  In the thirties of the last century, it was decided to start the fight against illiteracy and ignorance of the indigenous population of Ugra.  For this purpose, the creation of a museum was planned, the exhibits in which, inextricably linked with the history and formation of Khanty-Mansiysk itself, donated a museum from Tobolsk.  Eight parts of the museum, telling about the politics and economy, life and nature of Ugra, became available to a wide range of visitors in the mid-thirties.  At first, the museum‚Äôs collection was replenished thanks to gifts, later independent expeditions began to be organized.  By the eighties of the last century, the fund had grown so much that the former premises were not enough, and a new building was built for the museum.  Today, among its exhibits are more than 140 thousand different items, clearly demonstrating all the milestones of the development of Ugra.  The Museum of Nature and Man is the very place in Khanty-Mansiysk, where it‚Äôs not only possible to go, but also very useful, especially for schoolchildren. </p><h2>  Museum of Geology, Oil and Gas </h2><p>  It was already mentioned above that Yugra is the largest oil-producing region of our country.  And therefore it is not at all surprising that there is a corresponding museum in Khanty-Mansiysk.  He is relatively young - began to function only fifteen years ago.  It is interesting and unusual primarily for its construction and size: it occupies more than seven thousand square meters and is one of the ten most original buildings in the world that were erected in the harsh climatic conditions of the North. </p><p>  Most of the exhibits are occupied by photographs and documents on the development of this industry in Ugra.  In addition, the museum has mineralogical collections - for example, quartz, the largest representative of which weighs more than three hundred kilograms.  Such a pastime is not suitable for everyone and seems to many to be boring, but it‚Äôs worth a visit to the museum for general development.  So with full right we bring it to the list of places where it is recommended to go to Khanty-Mansiysk. </p><h2>  Touch the beautiful </h2><p>  What about entertainment in Khanty-Mansiysk?  Where can I go to unwind in this wonderful northern city? </p><p>  There are enough options.  For example, the Theater of the Ob-Ugric peoples is relatively young - only sixteen years old, but it has already proved itself in a positive way to the church of the servants of Melpomene. </p><div class="photo" data-original="konsultants.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Theater of Ob-Ugric peoples" class="if uuid-3066000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3066000.jpg"></div><p>  Two troupes of artists are its employees at once - a folklore-musical ensemble and a multi-genre national theater.  The performances and other events organized by these groups are very interesting and affect the peculiarities of life and mentality of the indigenous peoples of the Ugra region. </p><h2>  Kogolymlor Lake </h2><p>  Where to go on a weekend in Khanty-Mansiysk (or rather, to go, but these are already details) is necessary for all lovers of outdoor recreation, as this is one of the most beautiful Ugra lakes.  Kogolymlor - such is its name (the town of Kogalym is located a few kilometers from it), which means ‚ÄúLake of an extinct man‚Äù in local dialect.  It sounds, perhaps, a little sinister and frightening, but there is nothing frightening in the pond itself.  Fresh air, silence, peace, a beautiful view - this is what awaits those who come here to relax.  The lake is quite large, more than fifteen square kilometers in area, so that there is enough space on the shores of it for everyone. </p><h2>  Monument "Symbol of Ugra" </h2><p>  In the year of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the district, a magnificent monument appeared in the capital of Ugra, which is now called the symbol of the city.  Do not know what to see in Khanty-Mansiysk?  Go to this monument, which stands right in the center of the aforementioned settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument Symbol of Ugra" class="if uuid-3066009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3066009.jpg"></div><p>  It is a high pedestal with a twelve-meter bronze female figure on it.  This figure is Mother Yugra.  Near her, a little lower, are three sculptural compositions.  They symbolize different eras of the development of the city and represent, in fact, its past, present and future. </p><h2>  River Station </h2><p>  What else can be seen in Khanty-Mansiysk is the building of the River Station.  For its amazing architectural design, it deserves to be considered a local Ugra landmark.  Its appearance resembles one of the parts of a large ship - it is not for nothing that the station is exactly river.  In the evenings, lights are turned on near the station, and it all looks even more magical and spectacular.  The building appeared at the very beginning of this century and immediately won the love of the Khanty-Mansiysk.  Against the background of the river station, many photographs were taken! </p><h2>  Interesting facts about Khanty-Mansiysk </h2><ol><li>  This is the capital of the largest oil region of our country. </li><li>  The city has almost no railways, the nearest station is three kilometers away. </li><li>  To this day, in Khanty-Mansiysk, the habit remains of not locking the doors of the apartments - there is practically no crime in the city. </li><li>  Khanty-Mansiysk is a very unpredictable city: it even snows here in the summer. </li><li>  From late May to mid-July, you can watch white nights in the city. </li><li>  In winter, a film debut festival is held in Khanty-Mansiysk, conceived by director Sergei Solovyov and artist Alexander Abdulov thirteen years ago.  By the way, it is here that the only existing monument to the famous aforementioned actor is located. </li><li>  Khanty-Mansiysk is divided into two parts - the old and the new city.  The old part is called Samarovo - named after the prince who ruled the area four centuries ago.  Hence, such, at first glance, incomprehensible names like Samarovsky Chugas or Samarovsky remnant.  It is in this part of the city that the largest number of attractions is concentrated, but there are practically no hotels. </li><li>  The population of the city is approximately 70 thousand people. </li><li>  The former name of Khanty-Mansiysk is Ostyako-Vogulsk. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="admhmansy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Northern Khanty-Mansiysk" class="if uuid-3065991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/3065991.jpg"></div><p>  In Khanty-Mansiysk there are still many attractions that you can explore both independently and with a guide - the city has a service of sightseeing tours.  This amazing northern city deserves to be seen!  Have a good time! </p>
