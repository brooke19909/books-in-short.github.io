Many sacred temples (mainly Buddhist) and relics attract pilgrims from all over the world to this country.  The mysterious southern Sri Lanka attracts different categories of tourists.  They come here to see a world full of exotics, enjoy nature, and also swim in the waters of the Indian Ocean.  The local golden sand beaches are amazing. </p>

    <p>  In Sri Lanka you will find hidden bays and coves, underwater coral gardens, as well as the remains of sunken ships and much more ... Holidays on the ocean coast, an introduction to Buddhist shrines, national nature parks, secrets of tea cultivation and its production, communication with cheerful and open Sri Lankans - all this guarantees you an unforgettable experience of visiting this island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is Sri Lanka located on the map? </h2><p>  This <span>exotic country</span> is located on a small island in the Indian Ocean.  The list of UNESCO protected historical values ‚Äã‚Äã(130 in total) includes seven objects located on this island.  Sri Lanka is an ancient state with deep traditions and a rich history.  This is the center of Buddhism, where important monuments of this teaching are located.  However, not only the historical heritage forms the exotic of the country.  Sri Lanka on the map is located just 800 kilometers from the equator.  Here you will find all the wealth of the tropical islands.  Sri Lankans say that they know only three colors - the blue of the ocean and sky, the yellow tones of beaches and the greenery of vegetation. </p><h2>  Flight from Moscow to Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Currently, there is only one direct flight from Moscow to Sri Lanka (Colombo).  However, it is valid only in winter and does not have a strict schedule.  The charter flight Moscow - Sri Lanka is operated by Aeroflot air carrier.  The distance from Moscow to Colombo is about 6700 km.  Therefore, the travel time is approximately 8.5 hours. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka: time and climate </h2><p>  Those who are going to the island will probably be interested in the difference in time here.  On the island, time is 1.5 hours ahead of Moscow in the summer, and in winter by 2.5.  As for the climate, it is both subequatorial and equatorial monsoon.  It is complicated by the relief, as well as the orientation of the island, its location from north to south.  About 29-31 ¬∞ C is the average annual temperature in the lowlands of Sri Lanka.  The season has almost no effect on temperature.  In the mountainous part, it varies from 16 to 24 ¬∞ .  All year round, the sea temperature is above 25 ¬∞ C on the island of Sri Lanka.  In January, therefore, you can safely swim, as in July. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for humidity, it is high here and almost always exceeds 75%.  Rainfall ranges from 1,000 (eastern and northern regions) to 5,000 mm per year (southwest coast).  From May to September, the rainy season lasts, which causes the southwest monsoon.  The northeast monsoon determines inclement weather from October to April on the island of Sri Lanka.  The rainy season, however, may shift somewhat in time.  It depends on the area.  In general, the island of Sri Lanka has a very favorable climate for tourism.  In January, when it is cold in our country and you want summer so much, tours here are very popular. </p><h2>  Island population </h2><p>  The population of this island is about 18 million people.  Of these, more than 500 thousand people live in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.  The ethnic composition of the population is rich.  This is a multinational country.  Its population consists of Tamils, Sinhals, burghers (descendants of the Dutch and Portuguese) and the Moors. </p><h2>  Language and religion </h2><p>  Sinhali is the official language in Sri Lanka.  Tamil and English are also equated to state ones.  As we already mentioned, Buddhism is very common on the island.  In addition to it, the main religions are Christianity, Islam, Judaism.  Sri Lanka does not impose strict requirements on clothing, but it is not recommended to visit temples in clothes with bare shoulders and back, in shorts.  In addition, shoes should be removed at the entrance.  Buddhists are approximately 70% of the population, Tamils ‚Äã‚Äã(Hindus) - 15%, Christians - 8%, Muslims - 7%.  In this country, freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, but Buddhism is dominated here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Many attractions for every taste offers the island of Sri Lanka.  Tours here will interest various categories of tourists.  Sri Lanka's Resort Triangle is the island‚Äôs most popular excursion program.  It includes acquaintance with three cities - Kandy, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura.  Let's talk about each of them. </p><h2>  Anuradhapura </h2><p>  Anuradhapura is the first capital of the Sinhala state.  This city is unique; it was built in the 2nd century.  BC  e.  In his lifetime, he saw 113 kings.  The exact founding date of Anuradhapura is unknown.  According to the astrological tradition of the Indo-Aryans, he was named in honor of Anuradha - a star located in the constellation Scorpio.  King Pandukabhaya in 380 BC  e.  approved this city as a capital.  Basawak Kulam reservoir was built to the west of it to supply the population with water.  The city during its heyday occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 52 square meters.  km, and its population reached several tens of thousands.  In the 1st century AD  e.  plumbing, bridges and roads, palaces, temples, monasteries, cemeteries and hospitals were built. </p><p>  For 1.4 thousand years, Anuradhapura was the capital.  This is a true masterpiece of Sri Lankan architecture.  And nowadays Anuradhapura is the capital of Buddhism.  In order to visit it, annually a lot of tourists come to the island of Sri Lanka.  The city is located on the Aruvi river.  Tourism is developed here, agricultural products are processed, as well as a number of <span>handicrafts</span> (wood carving, etc.). </p><h2>  Polonnaruwa </h2><p>  The next city, Polonnaruwa, was the medieval capital of Sri Lanka from the 11th to the 13th century.  This is one of the main cultural and historical centers of the country.  To this day, preserved Hindu and <span>Buddhist temples, the</span> ruins of the Royal Palace.  The main attraction of the city is Gal Vihara (12th century BC).  These are 4 huge Buddha statues carved in granite rock. </p><h2>  Kandy </h2><p>  Kandy is the center of Buddhism and the religious capital of the island.  An artificial lake has been created in the center of this city.  The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Dalada Maligawa) is located on its shore (pictured below). </p>

    <p>  The city is rich in historical monuments.  These include the courtyard and the palace of the last king of Kandy.  There is also an archaeological museum, near which there is a botanical garden and a university with a picturesque campus.  Nearby these historical monuments are located rubber and tea plantations.  Kandy is 116 km from the island's capital, Colombo.  It is famous as a center of crafts and arts, as well as bazaars, lapidaries, and a museum of jewelry.  This place is great for sightseeing and shopping.  Nearby you will find views of the legendary mountains with beautiful Hindu and Buddhist temples. </p><h2>  Piradenia </h2><p>  Piradenia (Royal Botanic Gardens) is located 4 km from Kandy.  It is one of the largest gardens in Asia.  Here is a large collection of tropical plants and trees.  Gardeners of the island pitched a large hilly territory into park zones.  Various types of tropic flora are represented in these zones.  Another interesting feature of the garden is more than a hundred species of ornamental orchids growing here. </p><h2>  Dambula </h2><p>  Another local attraction is Dambula.  This is a temple built in the 1st century BC.  e., called the Sleeping Buddha.  It is the largest cave temple in South Asia.  The dambula consists of five caves.  Not only the temple itself, but also its painting is the largest in South Asia.  A huge collection of Buddha statues is presented in Dambul.  Moreover, many of them are more than two thousand years old. </p><h2>  Mount Sigiriya </h2>

    <p>  We also recommend visiting the Lion Rock (Mount Sigiriya).  This picturesque mountain is located in the center of Sri Lanka and is one of its main attractions.  The lion rock is protected by UNESCO.  On this mountain, at an altitude of about 180 meters, a picturesque city was built.  It is surrounded by gardens with pools, fountains and unusual staircases, the steps of which are carved between the jaws, throat and paws of a huge lion.  One of the attractions of this place is the gallery of frescoes, which depicts a procession of half-naked palace ladies or princesses, which seem to soar in the air.  These murals are coated with a special composition of egg white mixed with wild bee honey.  And to this day their bright colors have not dimmed.  Today, unfortunately, only 17 of the 500 frescoes have survived. </p><h2>  Adam's Peak </h2><p>  Another interesting mountain is Adam's Peak.  Since ancient times, this is a place of pilgrimage for believers.  They climb this mountain in order to touch the sacred footprint on the top with their lips.  Muslims believe that it was here that Adam, the first man, first set foot on earth. </p><h2>  Colombo </h2>

    <p>  The capital of Sri Lanka is Colombo.  There are many temples, cathedrals and mosques.  The most famous temple is Kelania Raja Maha Vihara.  This is an excellent example of Sinhalese art and architecture.  The frescoes that adorn the walls of the building tell us about the many lives of Buddha.  For example, about how he visited the temple, about legends and myths connected with his name.  Other Colombo sights include the Church of St. Anthony and Peter, St. Lucia Cathedral, Jamul Alfar (the main mosque of Sri Lanka), as well as the Hindu temples of Old and New Katiresan and Ganeshan. </p><h2>  Nuwara Eliya </h2><p>  Many interesting places offer tourists Sri Lanka.  Weather, however, may not allow you to see all the attractions of this country.  On hot days, many people prefer the beach to travel around the island.  However, the inconvenience of the weather can be avoided if your choice is Nuwara Eliya (Sri Lanka).  The weather here is rarely too hot to take walks.  Nuwara Eliya resort is located at an altitude of about 1900 m above sea level.  It is located at the foot of Pidurutalagala.  This mountain is the highest peak of Sri Lanka.  Here you will be pleased with a favorable mild climate (average temperature is 15-20 degrees), as well as mountain landscapes, picturesque valleys and meadows.  All this makes this place a popular resort.  Nuwara Eliya, the land of blessed climate, is also known as ‚ÄúLittle England,‚Äù as it is called on the island of Sri Lanka.  Tours here are in constant demand for many years. </p><h2>  Elephant nursery and Bo tree </h2>

    <p>  The state-owned elephant nursery is located in Pinnawel.  It was created to save animals that suffered from poachers or were left without parents.  Today, more than 60 elephants live in it. </p><p>  Sri Lanka is the country where the Bo tree grows, which is considered the highest in the world.  He is already more than two thousand years old.  We also recommend visiting the endless tea plantations.  This is the pride of Sri Lanka, thanks to which the island gained world fame.  Also very popular are Sri Lankan spices, gems, exotic fruits, and batik. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  It should be noted that in this country there is left-hand traffic.  Most of the roads are in the mountains.  Neither pedestrians nor drivers observe traffic rules.  In this regard, it is best to rent a car with a driver on the island of Sri Lanka.  Prices for this type of service are acceptable - the estimated cost per 1 km is 20 cents.  You can also rent a car for personal trips.  At the reception of your hotel you can get the necessary information about transport on the island of Sri Lanka.  Car rental prices start at $ 20 per day. </p><h2>  National cuisine </h2><p>  The cuisine here, even close to the European version familiar to us, is quite spicy.  The most popular type of food in hotels is the buffet.  Those who do not like spicy things should consult a waiter about what to take.  Mineral water, like other drinks, in Sri Lanka is not included in the price of dinner or lunch.  This island is especially beneficial for vegetarians. </p>

    <p>  Flavored curry rice is the most common food product in Sri Lanka.  Seafood dishes (taste lobster and shrimp), fish, meat, vegetables and poultry are also popular here. </p><p>  Local strong drinks are not recommended to be abused.  The main one is arak.  This is coconut moonshine, which even the local population does not drink much, but for a change you can try a little bit. </p><p>  On the island you will find inexpensive and beautiful tropical fruits: avocados, bananas (more than two hundred varieties), papaya, mango, avocados, oranges, coconuts, etc. Pineapples are especially good here. </p><h2>  Tip </h2><p>  Typically, the accounts of bars, restaurants and hotels already include tips, which make up 12.5%.  You can decide whether to give more.  Porters, chauffeurs and a guide are customary to tip.  They are usually expected from Russian tourists, but not from the Germans. </p><p>  One of the best places to relax is the island of Sri Lanka.  The time spent here is never forgotten. </p>
