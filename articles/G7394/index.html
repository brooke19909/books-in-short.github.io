Such a loud popular name for this area was due to the picturesque landscapes and favorable climatic and environmental conditions.  It is here in the village of the same name that the Kiritsa sanatorium is located.  The Ryazan region is famous for its abundance of ancient sights, it is not surprising that the medical and health center is located in the building of an old estate. </p><h2>  Palace of Baron S.P.  von Derviz </h2>

After almost 40 years, a mirror factory was opened in its place, successfully functioning until the customs duty on the import of similar products into the country was reduced.  In 1892, production was closed, the factory building and all surrounding land put up for sale.  The new owner of the village of Kiritsy (Ryazan region) was the son of the famous railway builder Pavel Grigoryevich von Derviz.  After examining his acquisition, the baron ordered to demolish all industrial buildings and begin construction of a personal mansion.  The palace and park ensemble was built and improved in the period from 1892 to 1907.  The central mansion is designed in the style of early Art Nouveau.  Around it there were farm buildings, a church, impressive grottoes, suspension bridges over ravines, a system of ponds and a luxurious landscaped garden.  S.P.  von Derviz did not live permanently in his estate, but invariably came here to relax in the summer.  In 1907, the baron seemed to feel something was amiss and sold all the land together with the mansion, while he himself immigrated abroad.

In 1918, the palace became state property; an agricultural school was opened in it.  Already in 1934 the building was transferred to the People's Commissariat of Health, initially a rest house was opened in it, and then a children's sanatorium for patients with tuberculosis.  This institution exists today, also remaining municipal.  Inside, a magnificent palace today is not much different from any other sanatorium opened during the USSR.  For a long time, the building was not undergoing major repairs and reconstruction.  However, not so long ago, the facades were restored.  Today, the castle pleases the eye with fresh paint, but the decorative elements (grottoes, stairs) are still not in the best condition.  The sanatorium ‚ÄúKiritsy‚Äù (Ryazan region) is a municipal institution, and apparently no funds are allocated for the full restoration of the palace and park complex.  But despite this fact, von Derviz Castle is a well-known ‚Äúinformal‚Äù attraction in the region, and many tourists come here to admire the facade and photograph it at least from afar.

Children aged 2 to 18 years are accepted for treatment.  The Kiritsa Children's Sanatorium specializes in the treatment of non-pulmonary forms of tuberculosis, namely <span>tuberculosis of bones and joints, the</span> genitourinary system, eyes, and peripheral lymph nodes.  Also in the medical institution, the consequences of the above diseases are corrected.  There are four buildings on the territory of the sanatorium, three of them are designed to accommodate and treat patients with tuberculosis of the musculoskeletal system, and the fourth is for patients with other diagnoses, there are also rooms for study, rest and leisure activities.  Sanatorium Kiritsy (Ryazan region) has its own school, the curriculum in which is fully consistent with state standards. </p><h2>  How to get to the sanatorium? </h2>
