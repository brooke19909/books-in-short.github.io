In addition, each graduate student was obliged to learn the articles of the Constitution of the USSR, which set out the basic principles of communism, the cherished goal of the whole of Soviet society.

    <h2>  The role of money </h2><p>  Under socialism, no one canceled it; everyone was eager to earn it.  It was assumed that whoever has more of them works better, and, therefore, benefits are relied on.  The highest phases in the development of <span>social relations</span> proclaimed socialism and communism.  The differences between these formations, however, were very serious.  Their understanding in society ranged from primitive (there will be no money, take what you want in the store) to highly scientific (creating a new person, add-on basis, material and technical base, etc.).  The task of the propagandists was difficult - it was necessary to find a certain middle ground, since the broad masses did not in their majority own the "science of all sciences", namely they were the main object of propaganda.  The simplest principle of modern life was affirmed in the "Stalinist" Constitution.  It was clearly stated there that everyone is obliged to work to the best of his abilities, and he will be rewarded according to the work invested in the common cause.  The postulate of Soviet life was formulated in approximately the same way in the main law of 1977. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Sources </h2><p>  Even the most devoted supporters of Marxism were forced to admit that communist ideas did not arise in the ingenious head of the author of the most progressive theory, but were the result of a synthesis of ‚Äúthree components‚Äù taken from ‚Äúthree sources‚Äù, as V. I told about in one of his works. Lenin.  One of the life-giving keys of science was utopian socialism, the founder of which was the French sociologist and philosopher Saint-Simon.  It is to him that we owe the wide popularity of the expression that has become the motto of the socialist world order: "To each according to his work, from each according to his ability."  Previously, Saint-Simon wrote the same thing and Louis Blank in an article on the organization of labor (1840).  And even earlier, the fair distribution of the product was preached by Morelli ("Code of Nature ...", 1755).  Karl Marx quoted Saint-Simon in his Critique of the Gotha Program in 1875. </p>

    <h2>  <span>New Testament</span> and principle "to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability" </h2><p>  If we study the course of human thought regarding the proportionality of the labor contribution to the benefits received, we can see that the rephrased motto of Marxists is even in the New Testament, which proclaims that everyone should receive what they need.  In practice, this is the same as "to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability."  The difference is only in the wording.  Thus, the slogan of communist society formulates the New Testament Christian love to the detriment of <span>social justice.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do with the property? </h2><p>  The fundamental difference between socialism and capitalism is the <span>social</span> ownership of the means of production inherent in this <span>system</span> .  In this case, any private enterprise is considered exploitation of a <span>person by a person</span> and is punished according to the law in criminal procedure.  Socialism under socialism is what belongs to the state.  And idealistic utopians like Thomas More and Henri de Saint-Simon, as well as Marx and Engels closer to us chronologically, considered that any possession in an ideal human society was unacceptable.  Moreover, under communism, the state is doomed to die out due to its uselessness.  Thus, private and personal, and state, and public property must completely lose their meaning.  It remains only to reflect on what structure will be involved in the distribution of material wealth. </p><h2>  The triune task as a mirror of revolution </h2><p>  Marxism-Leninism pointed to the fact that for a successful transition to a higher social formation it is necessary to solve the triune problem.  In order to avoid disputes when dividing the social product, absolute abundance is required, in which there will be so many benefits that they will be enough for everyone, and still remain.  The following is a paragraph that is not clear to everyone about the formation of special social relations inherent only to communism.  And the no clearer third component of the triune task is to create a new person who does not care for all passions, he does not need luxury, he is content with enough, he just thinks that it is about the benefits of society.  That is, as soon as all three parts converge, the line separating socialism and communism will be immediately crossed.  Differences in the approach to solving the triune problem were observed in different countries, from Soviet Russia to Kampuchea.  Not one of the bold experiments was crowned with success. </p>

    <h2>  Theory and practice </h2><p>  Soviet people have been waiting for communism since the beginning of the sixties.  According to the promise of the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, N. S. Khrushchev, by the eightieth year, conditions will generally be created under which society will heal on the principle of "to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability."  This did not happen immediately for three reasons, corresponding to all three principles of the triune task.  If in the eightieth year of the twentieth century the USSR began to share the social product, then the conflict would not end without conflict.  This was confirmed somewhat later, during mass privatization in the nineties.  It somehow didn‚Äôt work out with relations either, and about a new person ... It turned out to be very tight with him.  Hungry for material wealth, the citizens of the former great country found themselves in the power of the exact opposite ideology, which preaches money-grubbing.  Not everyone managed to realize the desire for enrichment. </p>

    <h2>  Eventually </h2><p>  Communist society went down in the history of mankind as one of the grandiose unrealized projects.  The scale of the attempt to fundamentally transform all previously established principles of social organization in Soviet Russia was unprecedented.  The new authorities have broken the age-old way, and in their place they built a system alien to human nature, in words preaching universal equality, in fact, immediately dividing the population into "higher" and "lower".  In the very first years after the revolution, the inhabitants of the Kremlin began to seriously think about which of the tsar‚Äôs garage cars more befits the rank occupied by the party member.  Such a situation could not but lead to the collapse of the socialist system in a historically short time. </p>

    <p>  Most successfully, the principle of "to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability" is observed in kibbutzim, public farms established on the territory of the state of Israel.  Any of the inhabitants of such a settlement may ask him to give him some household item, justifying this with the need that arose.  The decision is made by the chairman.  The request is not always fulfilled. </p>
