    <h2>  Briefly about plastic </h2><p>  What is a studied card?  The answer to this question should be known to every modern resident of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  "Conscience" is an installment card.  Some call it an interest-free credit card.  When using plastic, a person purchases goods on credit.  More precisely, he will have to pay for the purchase for a certain time, but without interest.  Installment - this is how these operations are called correctly. </p><p>  What is the point of offering such opportunities to the residents of the Russian Federation?  Is there any catch here? </p><h2>  Terms of registration </h2><p>  Let's start with the requirements for applying for a Conscience installment card.  What's the catch?  Not every resident of the Russian Federation can issue it. </p><p>  A citizen must meet the following requirements: </p><ul><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  permanent residence in the country; </li><li>  good credit history; </li><li>  constant stable earnings; </li><li>  age - not less than 18 years. </li></ul><p>  Foreigners will not be able to use the "Conscience" card.  This will have to be remembered.  In addition, at the beginning of 2017, plastic was issued only in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  But now it is taking shape throughout Russia.  And this fact pleases potential customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  A few words about what the plastic holder will have to observe.  Qiwi Conscience Credit Card allows you to buy goods on credit without interest. </p><p>  The conditions for using plastic will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  production and maintenance of the card - 0 rubles; </li><li>  SMS informing - 0 rubles; </li><li>  1 year of service - 290 rubles; </li><li>  subsequent years - 590 rubles; </li><li>  limit - up to 300,000 rubles; </li><li>  validity period of plastic - 5 years; </li><li>  reissue - 590 rubles; </li><li>  late fees - 10% per annum + 290 rubles / month; </li><li>  the possibility of early repayment of the debt - is; </li><li>  courier delivery - free of charge. </li></ul><p>  Reviews about the card "Conscience" are left different.  But customers emphasize that the terms of use of plastic are really attractive.  Especially taking into account the fact that the term for the installment plan can reach 12 months. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  What is the catch of the Conscience card?  Reviews of its holders indicate that it is not so easy to arrange plastic.  You can either contact the "Messenger", or leave a request via the Internet.  At some Qiwi partner banks and outlets, applications are also accepted.  But for the time being, it‚Äôs mainly through the Internet. </p>

    <p>  Many run into problems when processing applications - they are not processed.  After submitting requests to customers, the operator should call back and confirm the task.  But this does not happen.  It happens because of system failures.  Accordingly, the application through the Internet has to be carried out several times. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Activation </h2><p>  What is the catch of the "Conscience" installment card?  The next caveat is activation.  It gives customers a lot of problems.  Why? </p><p>  The manufacture of plastic is usually not denied.  But not everyone can activate the Conscience card.  If you believe the customer reviews, the plastic is not activated if: </p><ul><li>  a person has a bad credit history; </li><li>  a system failure has occurred; </li><li>  False information about the card holder. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, many have a Conscience card, but it is idle due to a lack of activation.  To use it does not work. </p>

    <h2>  Cash </h2><p>  What is the catch of the Conscience card?  Reviews of the holders of such plastic quite often emphasize that with it you can forget about cash. </p><p>  Conscience cards do not allow you to withdraw money from your account.  All operations include non-cash.  And if you want to cash out funds from time to time, you have to forget about the studied plastic. </p><h2>  Bounce </h2><p>  The next nuance is the accounting for existing loans.  The bank may refuse to issue and issue plastic ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù if the client has outstanding loans.  It‚Äôs not necessary to have a bad story.  Even bona fide payers may be denied. </p><p>  With all this, according to numerous reviews, Qiwi does not explain the reasons for its decision.  Everything is legal.  Therefore, people with loans, it is better not to contact the card "Conscience". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Closing </h2><p>  But that is not all.  Reviews of the Conscience card emphasize that closing this plastic is not easy.  Will have to try. </p><p>  Qiwi Bank has no branches throughout Russia.  Therefore, to close the card, you will have to send an application with notarization of the signature to Moscow.  The only customer service center in the country is located there.  Qiwi plastic itself also requires a return.  And these are huge risks.  After all, all manipulations are carried out by mail. </p><h2>  Using </h2><p>  What is the catch of the Conscience card?  Reviews of the owners of such plastic most often indicate that it can not be used everywhere.  That is, often from the card there is no use. </p><p>  The thing is that ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù is a plastic that offers to make purchases in specific Qiwi partner stores.  In other retail outlets, it will be useless.  This is the main catch of the card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conscience installment plan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2053401.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Partners </h2><p>  And where can I pay with plastic?  What is the catch of the Kiwi card (Conscience), we found out.  This plastic has a lot of features.  And if all of them are taken into account, a person will be able to decide how suitable a credit card is for him. </p><p>  Customer reviews of the Conscience card refer to a very narrow range of partner stores.  At first glance it seems that there are a lot of them.  But if you look closely, you will notice that this is not so. </p><p>  In total, Qiwi has more than 45 partner stores.  Here is some of them: </p><ul><li>  Euroset. </li><li>  The Messenger. </li><li>  Aeroflot. </li><li>  "M Video". </li><li>  "Daughters and sons." </li><li>  Lego. </li><li>  "Lamoda". </li><li>  "Shatura". </li><li>  "Burger King". </li><li>  "Ile de Beaute". </li></ul><p>  For daily purchases, plastic is not good at all.  But if a person actively uses the services of Kiwi partners, Conscience will seem to him an extremely attractive offer.  Therefore, you just need to consider that the plastic under study is not suitable for everyone. </p><h2>  How to get the? </h2><p>  A few words about how to draw a Conscience card.  You can do it this way: </p><ol><li>  Open the site sovest.com. </li><li>  Click on the "Order" button. </li><li>  Fill in the data requested from the user. </li><li>  Wait for the operator‚Äôs call and confirm the plastic manufacturing process. </li><li>  Get a card. </li><li>  Send plastic number to 5152.  It consists of 16 digits. </li><li>  Wait for the PIN.  He will come in a message.  This is a consequence of the successful activation of plastic. </li><li>  Make a purchase using a card. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  In fact, with proper preparation, there are no problems with ordering and activating a Conscience card.  This is evidenced by many Qiwi customers. </p>

    <h2>  To take or not? </h2><p>  Conscience user reviews are shared.  Among them, there are both positive and negative opinions.  Therefore, it is difficult for beginners to understand the topic under study. </p><p>  Should I order plastic?  There is no definite answer.  We found out what the catch of the Conscience card is.  Responses of owners of plastic emphasize that it is suitable for people with stable high incomes, an ideal credit history, repaid debts, and also for those who often buy from Qiwi partners.  Otherwise, the sentence makes no sense.  As we already said, plastic does not work everywhere. </p><p>  Some people advise you to refrain from issuing a Conscience card.  But there are no justifications in favor of such a decision.  If you want to take goods by installments from Qiwi partners by installments, the proposal under study will be very useful.  It will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  About the benefits </h2><p>  What is the catch of the Conscience card?  Reviews from the owners of plastic have long pointed us to it.  The features of the studied map are many.  And all of them are important. </p><p>  What are the advantages of Conscience?  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  card service cost; </li><li>  free courier delivery; </li><li>  lack of interest on loans; </li><li>  the ability to replenish plastic through Qiwi; </li><li>  large installment limits. </li></ul><p>  All this only pleases.  Can I call the card "Conscience" a hoax?  Not.  This is just plastic for installments, having many nuances of maintenance.  Not all customers pay attention to them.  And therefore, after the first use of plastic, they remain disappointed. </p><h2>  Not all at once </h2><p>  Another important nuance is that installment limits are issued individually.  High trims are not installed immediately.  Sometimes you have to re-register them several times.  This alignment leads to negative customer reviews about the Conscience card. </p><p>  Accordingly, you will first have to use plastic with a small installment amount.  Over time, it can be increased to 300,000 rubles, this is the maximum.  Not too convenient, but this approach allows you to take into account the solvency of the card holder.  People with bad credit history can issue (activate) plastic, then with small limits. </p>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We found out what the catch of the Conscience card is.  Customer reviews say that this plastic is perfect for people who often shop at Qiwi partners.  He has not so many shortcomings. </p><p>  Firstly, this is not support in all retail chains.  Secondly, the lack of cash withdrawals.  There are no more significant flaws in the card. </p><p>  We have already studied all the features of plastic.  Now everyone can decide whether he needs a Conscience card or not.  The main thing is to remember that an offer is not a hoax.  This is a very real installment card.  It allows you to buy goods and not overpay for them.  This is what Qiwi customers say. </p>
