A lot has happened, both mournful and joyful.  It is difficult to give an unambiguous assessment of the period, but the fact that this date is important is undeniable. </p><h2>  Winter 1682 </h2><p>  Starting in January, the significant can be distinguished.  It was this month that the Boyar Duma issued a decree that the state needed the destruction of localism.  Thus, there is a rejection of the system of distribution of posts in the state, depending on how famous a person is.  Also, as a result, Muscovites saw a public destruction of bit books. </p>

    <h2>  Spring 1682 </h2><p>  The most important thing happens in the spring: at the end of April there was a brutal reprisal against the Old Believer Avvakum and his followers.  The Protopop was burned alive, like other leaders of the Old Believers who went against the reforms of the Patriarch of All Russia Nikon.  St. Habakkuk managed to leave behind a biography, which is a cultural monument of the seventeenth century. </p><p>  A little later, Tsar <span>Fedor Alekseevich</span> dies <span>,</span> and the reasonable question arises: who will continue the reign of the Romanov dynasty?  On May 7, the answer was found: it was decided to put on the kingdom of an infant brother on the father of the deceased tsar - Peter Alekseevich.  True, there were other applicants, even older than Peter.  <span>Tsarevna Sofya</span> and Tsarevich Ivan are the children of Alexei Mikhailovich from their first marriage with M. Miloslavskaya.  It was Sophia, who was offended by this situation, who managed to raise the rebellion of the Tsarist archers against her younger brother and achieved the following: the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù tsar, he was the main in the country, Ivan, the ‚Äúsecond‚Äù was Peter, and Sofia herself was appointed regent with them.  And all the real power in the country was in her hands.  The year 1682 in the history of Russia is the year when the throne takes place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Peter the Great, as an adult, often recalled the horror of the Streltsy uprising, which happened then, on the twenty-eighth of May, fateful <span>1682.</span>  Tsar Sofya did not forgive the <span>streltsy revolt</span> , although at that time he was only ten years old. </p>

    <h2>  Summer of 1682 </h2><p>  In mid-July there was a new dispute between the Old Believers and supporters of church reform, the aforementioned events serve as the prerequisites for this incident.  At this time, in order to streamline relations in the state between the disputes, it was decided to arrange a confrontation in the <span>Faceted Chamber of the</span> Kremlin and resolve all pressing issues.  This meeting was attended by both young kings and their sister.  What is noteworthy, the Old Believers behaved inappropriately.  Historical documents indicate that they were proud that the dispute would be clearly resolved in their favor (Prince IA Khovansky assured them of this).  When they left the Kremlin, then, pacing the streets of Moscow, they shouted that they would be supported by archers, because they won an honest dispute.  In addition, they called on everyone to break the reforms and be baptized or to carry out a procession in the old way. </p>

    <p>  The cunning princess wanted to use the right moment and ordered the archers to massacre the schismatics.  The chief orator of the Old Believers, Nikita Pustosvyat, suffered the most from all for his impudent behavior; as a warning to all, he was executed in public at the Execution Ground on Red Square.  The rest fled away from the capital: to the Urals, to Siberia.  After that, for a very long time, questions about the sacrilege of the Nikon reform were no longer raised.  The year 1682 in the history of Russia is a time of many executions. </p><p>  But there was another problem.  There was a rumor in Moscow that the archers, together with Prince Khovansky, were going to destroy the royal couple and arrange a coup.  Frightened that a streltsy rebellion would break out, the entire Romanov family fled to the Moscow Region, not forgetting to surround themselves with guards. </p><p>  In August of the same year, Tsar Ivan became completely ill (he was sick).  Peter is crowned the sovereign ruler of the kingdom. </p>

    <h2>  Autumn 1682 </h2><p>  It is logical that Khovansky did not live long after rumors of a conspiracy.  He served as the head of the <span>Streltsy order,</span> and he was very much feared.  The reign of Sofya Alekseevna was very oppressive.  Being a very decisive ruler, she ordered the prince to be captured and executed, even though he had once supported her claim to the throne. </p><p>  Thus ended the fateful 1682 year in the history of Russia, full of executions and conspiracies.  Although for many who consider themselves to be Westerners, this year is joyful, because Pyotr Romanov comes to power, later nicknamed the Great according to his merits. </p>
