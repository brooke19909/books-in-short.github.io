    <p>  So, one of the recognized sources of those times - ‚ÄúThe Tale of Bygone Years‚Äù - indicates that the future Princess Olga, whose brief biography does not provide accurate information about her parents, was brought from Pskov. </p><p>  Another source - "The Life of Princess Olga" - claims that she was born on Pskov land, in the village of Vybuty.  <span>There was a girl</span> commoner, which is why the names of her parents remained unknown. </p><p>  The Iokimov Chronicle mentions that the future wife of the Prince of Kiev was a noble Izborsk family, and her roots go to the Vikings. </p><p>  Another version: Olga is the daughter of the <span>Prophetic Oleg.</span> </p><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  Igor‚Äôs acquaintance with his future wife is also shrouded in a mass of inaccuracies and mysteries.  In the Life, it is said that the future princess Olga, whose brief biography is sometimes contradictory in various sources, met her future husband in Pskov, where the prince hunted.  He needed to cross the river, and, seeing the boat, Igor got into it.  After the prince discovered that his ferryman was a beautiful girl.  She refused all courtship of her passenger.  And when it was time for the prince to choose a bride, he remembered the girl in the boat and sent messengers after her with an offer of marriage.  So Olga became the wife of the <span>Grand Duke of</span> Russia.  Princess Kievskaya, whose brief biography has since been traced more clearly, was a good and wise wife.  Soon, she gave birth to Igor's son, Svyatoslav. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The assassination of Prince Igor </h2><p>  Prince Igor was a great conqueror, he constantly raided with his squad in neighboring lands, collecting tribute from weak tribes.  One of these campaigns became fatal for the Russian prince.  In 945, Igor with his retinue went to the neighboring Drevlyans for the due tribute.  Taking a lot of wealth, destroying villages and abusing the local population, Rusich went home.  However, on the way back, the prince with a small number of soldiers decided to return and rob the Drevlyansky lands again.  But local men, making sure that the prince was coming with a small army, attacked him and killed him. </p><h2>  Revenge to the Drevlyans </h2><p>  Upon learning of the death of her husband at the hands of Drevlyans, Olga grieved for a long time.  Princess Kievskaya, whose brief biography is described in The Tale of Bygone Years, turned out to be a wise wife and ruler.  According to the customs of that time, <span>blood feud</span> was acceptable <span>.</span>  Naturally, Olga could not get around this tradition.  Gathering a squad, She began to wait.  Soon, ambassadors from the Drevlyans came with a wedding proposal for the unification of the Russian and Drevlyan lands.  The princess agreed - this was her revenge. </p>

    <p>  Trusting drevlyane believed her, went into the capital, but were captured, thrown into a pit and covered with earth.  So, part of the most daring and brave drevrels was destroyed.  The second batch of ambassadors was also euthanized by cunning - they were burned in a bathhouse.  When Olga and her retinue approached the gates of Iskorosten, the main city of the Drevlyans, under the pretext of celebrating a feast (commemoration) for the prince, she doused her enemies, and the retinue cut them down.  According to the chroniclers, about five thousand drevlyans died then. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 946, the princess with the army went to the Drevlyansky lands, destroyed them, collected taxes and established a mandatory, fixed amount of tax, but she failed to take Iskorosten.  The city was impregnable.  Then Olga burned down the city with the help of pigeons and sparrows, tying a burning cloth to their paws.  Students are told who Princess Olga is.  A brief biography for primary school children omits the full story of revenge.  It mainly focuses on the years of her reign and the adoption of the Christian faith. </p><h2>  Princess Olga: short biography, years of reign </h2><p>  After the death of Igor, their son Svyatoslav became the successor, but in fact all power was concentrated in the hands of his mother, and while he was young, and after he came of age.  Svyatoslav was a warrior, and spent most of his time on campaigns.  Landscaping of lands and controlled territories was done by Princess Olga.  A brief biography of the ruler indicates that this woman founded several cities, including Pskov.  Everywhere she ennobled her lands, erected walls around large villages, and built temples in honor of Christian saints.  During the reign of Olga, excessive taxes were replaced by fixed fees. </p>

    <p>  The foreign policy of the princess also deserves attention.  Olga strengthened ties with Germany and Byzantium.  This was promoted, first of all, by her adoption of the Christian faith. </p><h2>  Baptism of Princess Olga </h2><p>  The first sign of Christianity on Russian soil is Princess Olga.  A brief biography for grade 4 pays special attention to this event.  In the written sources of past years, there is no single date for the Princess to accept Christianity.  Some call 955 year, others - 957 year. </p><p>  Having visited Constantinople, Olga not only was baptized in the Christian faith, but also renewed trade agreements signed by her late husband.  <span>Emperor Constantine</span> VII and priest Feofilakt baptized the princess.  They called her Elena (according to Christian custom). </p>

    <p>  Upon returning home, Olga tried in every possible way to introduce her son Svyatoslav to the new faith, but the prince was not inspired by this idea and remained a pagan, fearing condemnation of the squad.  Nevertheless, he did not forbid his mother to build cathedrals and churches.  Olga remained in Kiev, actively participated in the education of grandchildren.  Perhaps it was this fact that led to the fact that Svyatoslav's son, Vladimir, baptized Russia in 988, thereby uniting it. </p><p>  In 968, the Pechenegs attacked Russian land.  Olga was in the besieged capital with her grandchildren.  She sent a messenger for Svyatoslav, who at that time was in the next campaign.  The prince arrived home, defeated the Pechenegs, but Olga asked her son not to plan another campaign, since she was ill and foreboding about the near end.  In 969, Princess Olga died and was buried in the Christian rite.  Legend has it that the relics of the Grand Duchess were incorrupt. </p><p>  In the XVI century, Olga was canonized. </p>
