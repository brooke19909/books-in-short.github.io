    <p>  The domestic market is literally oversaturated not only with sensible models from Europe, but also with dubious devices from Asia, so more and more often the choice of a microphone resembles a lottery, and with minimal chances of getting a happy ticket. </p><p>  Let‚Äôs try to figure out what this device is like, what kinds of microphones there are and what moments you should first pay attention to before taking your money to the cashier of a music store.  The opinions of specialists in this field and the reviews of the owners will be taken into account. </p><h2>  Device types </h2><p>  A microphone is an almost ubiquitous thing.  It is in players, computers, telephones, video cameras, that is, in almost everything that is called two-way gadgets and devices.  However, in this article we will consider a specific group of devices. </p><h2>  Variety microphones </h2><p>  A pop, dynamic or stage microphone is a device that was originally designed for specific areas.  Such models are most often associated with hand-held devices, where there is a handle and a capsule protected by a net from the wind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  A microphone device of this kind is not very diverse.  Almost all models have a similar appearance, and the problem here is not that the designers have run out of ideas and ideas for visualization - just all manufacturers are striving for unification.  That is, the standard device is well and reliably fixed in the same standard rack holders, and in addition to the unified models it is much easier to choose a replaceable wind protection, unlike their "sophisticated and glamorous" counterparts. </p><p>  In turn, there are coil and ribbon microphones.  That is, in the first case, the diaphragm is connected to the coil, which is located in the gap of the magnetic system, and in the second case, instead of the coil, a corrugated tape made of aluminum foil acts.  Both the first and second types have both their advantages and disadvantages.  Coil devices are used mainly on stage because of their reliability, but to the detriment of quality, and a tape microphone is most often used in recording studios for more clear voice transmission. </p><p>  Variety devices can be grouped into wired and wireless.  In addition to the models that are used on stage, there are also headsets and lavaliers (lavalier).  Moreover, there are also subgroups of these devices: for songs, voices, for pianos and guitars, and mics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reporting Microphones </h2><p>  The scope of such devices is more than clear from the name.  A reporter‚Äôs microphone is a device that is not afraid of the wind, as well as low or high temperatures.  Models can be wired, wireless, used as a headset, for hidden wearing.  There are also simple manual types. </p>

    <p>  Such devices cost a very round sum, so before you buy such a microphone, carefully and comprehensively study the model you are interested in, and then draw the appropriate conclusions.  It may well turn out that all these "bells and whistles" will be useless to you. </p><h2>  Studio devices </h2><p>  A studio microphone is a small device, usually of a lapel or head type, operating on radio waves, but you can also find the usual manual varieties. </p>

    <p>  In addition, tablet-type desktop devices are used in television studios.  They have flat outlines and are almost invisible on the tables of reporters.  Their main task is to fix all the waves above the table.  The upper part of such a microphone is non-directional, and the bottom is simply not covered. </p><h2>  Broadcast Microphones </h2><p>  This type of device is used for radio broadcasts and television broadcasting.  Such devices are intended both for broadcasting live, and for recording radio and TV programs. </p><p>  The design and functionality of such devices is designed to work with ordinary speech.  Such devices are distinguished by their recognizable appearance, because they are designed for fastening to a special ‚Äúspider‚Äù rack.  She received the nickname thanks to the shock-absorbing receiver with a ring and rubberized ears.  In addition, a kind of adapter for the microphone plays the role of the body of the "spider". </p><p>  Very often, such devices are additionally equipped with a switch, where the directional characteristics can be changed if necessary.  More expensive models can work "in a circle": cardiodes, "eights" and supercardiodes. </p><h2>  Devices for music studios </h2><p>  This group is also divided into several types of devices: instrumental, speech and vocal microphones.  Each category is distinguished by its appearance.  Speech and vocal models, as a rule, are very similar in appearance, and they can be distinguished only by a specific wind protection grill.  In addition, they have special brackets with which they are mounted on racks with shock absorbing suspensions. </p>

    <p>  Instrumentation devices resemble conventional studio or stage <span>microphones for vocals.</span>  The design and functionality of these devices creates all the conditions in order to perceive the smallest details of sound, moreover, at the highest resistance to sound pressure.  This effect is achieved thanks to the built-in attenuator, which prevents microphone overload. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  If you are looking at a microphone, you should clearly understand for yourself that universal models simply do not exist, and a good device is far from cheap.  And do not listen to sellers who describe the versatility of the model - you need to buy a microphone for specific goals and objectives. </p><p>  For vocals - one thing, for drums - another, for piano - the third, etc. In addition, you should not be tempted by the low price of the device from a well-known brand.  Even the most venerable manufacturers will not sin to throw budget devices for mass production onto the market.  Remember that good professional microphones cannot be cheap. </p>
