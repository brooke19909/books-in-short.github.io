But once the area fascinated painters with its landscapes, stunning beaches and clean air.  And now, Berg (France) attracts with its climate, the beauty of European streets and historical sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mapandmaps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="berg france climate" class="if uuid-3126065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3126065.jpg"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Berg is a city in France that is located in a region called Hautes-de-France, the department of Nor, the canton of Cudkerk-Branche.  It is located ten kilometers south of Dunkirk, and fifteen kilometers west of the border with Belgium. </p><p>  The population of the town is almost four thousand people.  All people communicate not only in French, but also in Flemish (the reason for this lies in historical sources). </p><div class="photo" data-original="fietsknooppunten.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="berg city in france" class="if uuid-3126071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3126071.jpg"></div><p>  The name itself has Flemish roots and translates as "green hill".  The Dutch translation is slightly different and means "Mountains of St. Vinok."  The locals also magnify the home side of the Other Bruges in Flanders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The moderately warm marine climate of the city of Berg (France) pleases.  Thanks to regular precipitation, the area does not suffer from drought, and the air here stabilizes the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The beginning of the existence of Berg (France) is associated with the first century.  Legend has it that the son of the Breton king by the name of St. Vinok decided to isolate himself from everyone on the hill.  The same place later became a shrine. </p><p>  In the year 882, Count of Flanders Baudouin II took up the construction of fortifications as the Normans invaded the territory.  Successful defense left the area in the hands of Flanders.  Forty years later, Baudouin the Fourth founded the St. Vinok church, which later became the basis for the construction of the monastery. </p><p>  The city developed due to the presence of the abbey and proximity to the sea.  In 1240, Berg (France) received the status of a city, and the townspeople embodied their independence in the creation of the bell tower.  Good geographical location had a great impact on the trading sector.  The town served as a port and textile center at the regional level.  The made wool helped Berg to stay afloat and maintain his own autonomy. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.968519" data-lng="2.4333239999999705" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/2/5/3/15253.png"></div><h2>  The fall of the city </h2><p>  But Berg was not able to maintain an independent status.  Already in the sixteenth century the territory was besieged and conquered by Alessandro Farnese.  In 1668, the First Aachen World led to the port Berg becoming a part of France.  But this did not benefit the city, because Dunkirk overshadowed its full potential. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further events only spoiled everything.  The bombing of two world wars destroyed about eighty percent of the city.  From the once beautiful structures, only ruins remained.  The remaining monuments help to return to the past and feel the wealth of Berg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="berg city" class="if uuid-3126069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3126069.jpg"></div><p>  But it is not all that bad.  Since the twenty-first century, the city has regained its former popularity.  The filming of the French comedy ‚ÄúBeaver To Bejourn‚Äù (2008) played into the hands of its inhabitants.  In the film with good humor and in all colors they show the townspeople, their unusual accent and way of life.  So, Berg in France has become a kind of bridge between a good comedy and interested tourists. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Despite the terrible events of the past century, some of the assets of past centuries remained in good condition.  Therefore, the list of "mast-si" included: </p><ol><li>  Bell tower.  This building survived the invasion, and fires, and the bombing.  On July 16, UNESCO classified the building as a World Heritage Site.  Carillon melodies can be enjoyed on Mondays or on public holidays. </li><li>  Earthen ramparts that spanned more than five kilometers.  The majestic medieval building, which was designed by Sebastien le Praetre in the seventeenth century. </li><li>  Abbey of Saint-Vinok.  Rather, what is left of it is two towers and a portico of marble.  But here you can turn on the imagination and design the scale of the monastery in your own thoughts. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="fietsknooppunten.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://fietsknooppunten.blogspot.com/2012/09/sint-winoksroute.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="berg city france" class="if uuid-3126068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3126068.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth visiting the monument to the ‚Äúgrieving widow‚Äù, or in the translation ‚ÄúMarianne is all alone.‚Äù  This woman lost her husband and four children during the plague and, despite her condition, helped other sick babies recover. </p><p>  The described city should be visited in order to meet with real life.  Here you will not be able to see skyscrapers and neon signs, but you can easily penetrate sincere people and the difficult history of a small European town. </p>
