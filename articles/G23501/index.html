You can write a lot about all its advantages, however, at first, users often wonder where to put the tablet and how best to use the product to wash the most dirty dishes.  In the article you will find information about where the tablet compartment is located in the Hotpoint Ariston dishwashers and other models, as well as how to use this type of detergent correctly. </p><h2>  Where is the tablet compartment located? </h2><p>  When developing household appliances, manufacturers strive to make it as user-friendly as possible.  If during the operation any questions arise, the answers to them can be found in the instructions.  Unfortunately, people often act intuitively through trial and error.  Such experiments sometimes end in failure.  Therefore, first of all, you need to read the instructions and find out where to put the tablet in the dishwasher. </p><p>  Equipment of different brands differs in its internal structure.  A detergent container is typically located on the inside of the door.  There is also a rinse aid compartment, usually equipped with a screw cap.  Some models have a special indicator that indicates the presence or absence of rinse aid. </p><p>  A gel or bulk analog is loaded into the detergent compartment.  Depending on the model of the machine, there may be a container for a liquid product, capsule or powder, or a special compartment for briquettes.  For example, in the Bosch dishwasher, the compartments are quite distant from each other.  In the photo below you can see how the compartment of the latest Hotpoint Ariston dishwasher is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.frog.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to put the pill in the dishwasher" class="if uuid-3118992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3118992.jpg"></div><p>  In older models, the use of capsules for washing ‚Äúall in one‚Äù is not provided at all, but simple briquettes can be used.  In this case, salt and rinse aid are purchased separately.  In cars of this type on the upper basket there is a container.  When choosing a dishwasher, it is advisable to pay attention to the presence of a 3-in-1 tablet compartment. </p><h2>  Do I need to open the packaging? </h2><p>  Each detergent tablet is packaged in a film that protects it from moisture.  The answer to the question of how to lay the capsule: in the package or not, can the instructions for the tool.  If the wrapper is soluble, then the briquette is placed in the tablet compartment in the dishwasher without removing the film.  It is very convenient, no need to wipe your hands first.  Dissolving packaging is available for such products as Amway, Finish, Sodasan. </p><p>  If the packaging is removed to prevent softening of the tablet, make sure that your hands are dry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moralfibres.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dishwasher tablet container" class="if uuid-3119000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3119000.jpg"></div><h2>  The nuances of using pills </h2><p>  Before using a dishwasher, many people are interested in questions: what tool is better to purchase, what is better - gel or tablets, how much drug is required when the machine is fully loaded, and so on.  To find answers to these questions, you need to know some of the nuances of using pills. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the operation, many housewives found that for incomplete loading of the dishwasher, it is enough to place half the tablet in a container in the dishwasher.  The same option is suitable for a compact dishwasher. </p><p>  Another important point in the use of capsules is the choice of washing mode.  For example, the instructions for some modern models of the machine indicate which washing mode it is necessary to use a 3 in 1 tablet. As a rule, these are functions of a long wash for more than one hour. </p><p>  If there are small children at home, storage rules must be followed.  The bright packaging and appearance of the capsules attract their attention.  The chemical composition of the pill can greatly harm the baby's health when trying to eat it.  If the tablets have a soluble package, then if moisture gets on it, they can stick together, so they should be stored in a dry place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="parkresidences.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotpoint ariston dishwasher" class="if uuid-3118997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3118997.jpg"></div><h2>  If a pill drops out </h2><p>  Some users are wondering if it is normal for the tablet to fall out of the compartment, maybe the tablet compartment in the dishwasher has broken.  The principle of operation of the dishwasher is designed in such a way that after its activation, the capsule is thrown out of the compartment and gradually dissolved in water. </p><p>  In some cases, people will push the tablet into powder to speed up the dissolution process.  For 3-in-1 detergents, this is fundamentally wrong: rinse aid should be used only at the final stage of washing, when crushed, this will not happen. </p><p>  When the program starts, the briquette is thrown out of the compartment, but this should happen at some point.  If this does not happen, the reason is as follows: </p><ul><li>  the dishes are not properly laid out, something prevents the compartment from opening; </li><li>  jammed dispenser lid. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.whatsupfagans.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="broken tablet compartment in the dishwasher" class="if uuid-3118998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3118998.jpg"></div><h2>  How to place the pill? </h2><p>  Some users place the tablet in any place that they think is most appropriate without reading the instructions.  Others, on the contrary, are interested in where to put the pill in the dishwasher so that the washing is effective. </p><p>  The answer is simple - you can put it on either side in a special compartment, this will not affect the action of the product and the process of its dissolution. </p><p>  However, it is recommended that you adhere to the following rules: </p><ul><li>  leftover food from plates should be removed; </li><li>  the lid of the container into which the product is loaded must be tightly closed. </li></ul><p>  Where to put the pill in the dishwasher to wash the dishes was of high quality?  Cleanliness depends more on the washing mode than on the placement of the product.  You must select a continuous mode at maximum load.  Not having time to dissolve in a short wash, the product will settle on the bottom, and the dishes will be washed poorly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lorigarcia.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dishwasher tablet compartment" class="if uuid-3119002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3119002.jpg"></div><h2>  An analogue to tablets is gel: where to pour? </h2><p>  Where to put the pill in the dishwasher.  We figured it out.  But what to do with the liquid product? </p><p>  Many users prefer to use dishwashing gel instead of tablets.  Its application directly depends on the selected program. </p><p>  For example, if the ‚ÄúPre-rinse‚Äù mode is set, the product is poured into the rinse aid compartment.  If the main wash mode starts, then the gel is poured into a container for powder or other detergents. </p><p>  The action algorithm is as follows: </p><ul><li>  according to the rules, dishes are loaded; </li><li>  according to the instructions, gel is poured into the detergent container; </li><li>  the machine starts. </li></ul><p>  Many users claim that the manufacturer indicates the dosage, obviously more than necessary.  If you reduce it by a quarter, you can achieve the same result, but at the same time save.  Even if the product contains emollients, salt is recommended in any case. </p>
