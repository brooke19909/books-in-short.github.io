How to embroider a Temari ball</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The art of Temari is the embroidery of bright patterns on balls.  Patterns can be simple or abstract, with shapes intersecting at different angles (triangles, rhombuses, ovals, squares, ellipses, and so on).  This is a very exciting and relaxing needlework, which you can do at home, sitting in front of the TV, or on a trip. </p><p>  Have you decided to make Temari balls yourself?  How to do this craft, you will understand by reading this article to the end.  But first, find out where these amazing products came from. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  So, what are Temari balls, how to make them with your own hands?  You are probably interested in such questions.  Let's start with the history of the Temari. </p><p>  This is a fairly ancient art.  It originated in China.  And about six hundred years ago, these balls of extraordinary beauty were brought to Japan. </p><p>  Initially, they were made for a ball game called Kemari.  As a filling, the remnants of the fabric from old kimonos were used, which were then rolled up and stitched to make a ball.  Later, the game changed, the ball stopped kicking, and began to pass with the help of hands.  So there were "Temari". </p><p>  The game became popular among young girls who came from noble families.  The girls began to decorate their playing balls - embroider with silk.  Thus, a simple ball game turned into a fine art. </p><p>  Over the years, such a craft as embroidery of Temari balls became popular throughout Japan.  In the future, each region of the country possessed only its own ornament, not like the others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Temari balls how to make" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/373360.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  These materials need to be prepared in order to make Temari balls.  How to make a basis for a ball made of fabric, read on. </p><h2>  Base manufacture </h2><p>  Take pieces of cloth.  Pack them tightly.  Form a ball with a diameter of five centimeters (you can optionally make the size of the craft more).  Cut off excess polyethylene.  Wrap the thread tightly around the base, thereby you also fix the package.  Do it evenly, apply each turn to a new place, so that you get the perfect base surface, because in the future patterns will be created on it.  Then fasten the <span>thread.</span>  <span>Thread the needle</span> and sew the base several times. </p><p>  In Japan, small bells are sometimes placed inside a ball; it turns out to be something like rattles. </p><h2>  Markup </h2><p>  To embroider a Temari ball, you must first mark up.  Cut out a paper tape a centimeter wide and thirty centimeters long. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery temari balls" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/373370.jpg?1397499358348" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Marking must be done to indicate the top ("North Pole"), the bottom ("South") and the middle ("equator").  Take the red pin and stick it anywhere.  This will be the top of the ball (The North Pole).  Attach the end of the tape there.  Wrap around the ball.  Thus, you seem to draw the diameter of the workpiece.  The strip should fit snugly to the ball.  Then bend it in half.  So you define the bottom point - “South Pole”.  Pin a different color.  Then bend the tape again in half and cut the corners on only one side.  Then wrap the ball in a strip again.  In the places where the corners were made, put pins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Temari balls" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/373359.jpg?1397499387992" width="409"></div>  It will be the "equator."  Take a centimeter.  It will be needed to determine the distance between the segments.  Measure them.  It is important that they are the same.  In our case, we should get segments of six centimeters.  When all the points are marked, start wrapping the base with silver thread from pin to pin (this will be the guide).  You can say that you mean the axis.  Now you can apply beautiful embroidery.

    <h2>  How to embroider Temari balls </h2><p>  Pattern patterns can be found in specialized magazines.  So, we begin embroidery. </p><p>  Take the needle and thread the yellow thread.  Take the first turn as follows.  Pull the thread from the "North Pole" through the "South", again return to the "North".  Then make the second round perpendicular to the first.  Start again at the North Pole.  Pull out the needle so that the thread engages the guide and winding.  There should be four identical sectors. </p><p>  Then draw the needle inside the ball to the pin, which is located on the "equator".  Make four turns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make temari balls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/373358.jpg?1397499474881" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Insert the brown thread into the needle.  Make four turns along the guide on each side.  Repeat these steps with each color.  At the same time, the width of the "belts" should gradually increase.  Pay attention to how the threads go.  There should be no gaps! </p><p>  As soon as the threads begin to fall off the ball, it's time to finish work.  Make another pair of rows with a thread of bright color along the last "belts", fasten the thread.  That's all, Temari balls are ready. </p><p>  Step-by-step instructions, detailed marking and embroidery schemes will make it possible (even if you have at least minimal needle and thread skills) to master this original skill.  Good luck in the difficult, but surprisingly beautiful art of the Temari! </p>
