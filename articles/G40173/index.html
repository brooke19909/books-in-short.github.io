    <p>  Like all of Greece, Kassandra is a universal resort.  Here adventurers and adventurers, as well as lovers of outdoor activities, and families who come to spend their holidays here with their children find themselves entertaining.  In ancient times, the Greeks called this island fiery.  It was believed that among its high and black rocks lived real giants, among which the most popular was Alkionei - the son of Heaven and Earth.  Few Greeks dared to sail to these shores in early antiquity, so these lands were previously empty.  The Greeks moved here around the time of the reign of Alexander the Great, having founded settlements and small towns here.  Already in those days, together with the entire state of Greece, Kassandra began to flourish: an international port opened here, active trade and exchange of goods was conducted, settlements were built for settlers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece cassandra map" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293166.jpg" width="300"></div>

The beach season here, as in most of the Mediterranean, begins in April and comes to an end with the arrival of October.  Despite the high temperature showed, there always blows coolness from the <span>Aegean Sea.</span>  Therefore, you can go on a walking tour and even visit a remote village (there are 44 of them), without fearing to overheat.  On these lands tourists will be met by lush tropical and coniferous vegetation, which blooms against the backdrop of the endless blue sea.  It is in this place that Greece itself will appear before you in all its glory. </p><p>  Kassandra is divided into many resort areas, each of which has its own characteristics.  Very popular is the western part of the peninsula, on which the village of Nea Fokea is located.  It is always quiet and calm, the golden sands of the beach merge with the turquoise bay, and near the sea is a chapel built here during the <span>Byzantine Empire.</span>  This place is followed by the village of Nea Potidea, which is famous for its clean and wide beaches, as well as the village of Afitos.  It has preserved a lot of ancient buildings that carry great cultural value for the entire state of Greece. </p>

Among these we can mention Kallithea - the main center of the entire peninsula.  Here, noisy clubs, chic restaurants and large shops with national goods are combined with stunning beaches, green vegetation and the turquoise sea.

    <p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that local hotels are affordable and at the same time well-equipped.  As a rule, Russian tourists choose the category of 4 * hotels in Kassandra here.  Greece is an amazing country in which every corner deserves your attention and close study. </p>
