    <h2>  ‚ÄúNo cost‚Äù </h2><p>  This is the name of the first type of card that I would like to talk about.  This tariff includes a free year of service, increased discounts on a premium card, a rate of 23.99% per annum, and even up to 60 days without interest on the use of funds and a limit of up to 300,000 rubles.  These Alfa-Bank credit cards are very popular.  Conditions really seem to be beneficial.  Are there any pitfalls? </p><p>  So, a card is issued for free.  The first year of maintenance does not need to be paid.  For the second one it will already be required - 990 rubles a year.  A fee is charged for cash withdrawals (minimum 500 rubles, rate - 5.9%).  There is also a limit.  You can withdraw 200,000 rubles a month.  And to be more precise, 188,200 rubles.  (taking into account the notorious commission). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In three steps, such an Alfa-Bank credit card is issued.  The conditions are as follows: a person must fill out an online application, wait for approval, and then come to the office with the documents.  The standard set is a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and something else to choose from (driver‚Äôs license, SNILS, compulsory medical insurance, international passport, TIN, military ID, etc.). </p>

    <h2>  "100 days without%" </h2><p>  This tariff should also be noted when talking about Alfa-Bank credit cards.  The conditions are as follows: a person orders ‚Äú100 days without%‚Äù for free and can use it for 100 days without thinking that he will need to pay interest.  If the client manages to return the time spent before this period comes to an end, then he will not lose anything. </p><p>  There are three types of this card - Classic, Gold and Platinum.  They differ in credit limits - 150, 300 and 750 thousand rubles, respectively. </p><p>  It is worth noting that it is most profitable to issue it to those who own Alfa-Bank's salary card.  For them, the annual rate will be 26.99%.  The limit for cash withdrawals per month is 60 thousand rubles.  But this is the case with Classic.  For Platinum owners, the limit is 200 thousand rubles.  In general, this Alfa-Bank credit card - ‚Äú100 days‚Äù is quite advantageous.  The conditions are very clear, and the documents for presentation are standard.  By the way, a personal income tax form certificate will never be superfluous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Other features </h2><p>  This is not all that a person who needs an Alfa-Bank credit card needs to know.  The terms of use are very favorable, but with them customers get some other opportunities.  In addition to the interest-free period, which was already mentioned above. </p><p>  So, for example, the minimum payment is 5% of the amount owed.  Another person can track all his expenses and dates in a modern and convenient Alfa-Click mobile bank.  There is also an application - you can choose who is more convenient to use.  And you can even repay your debts by transfers from cards of other banks. </p><p>  By the way, through these applications you can request any information regarding a credit account.  The person will be given data in which his spending and the amount that he is obliged to pay will appear painted up to copecks. </p>

    <h2>  Important information </h2><p>  It is worth giving answers to the questions that people ask when making a card most often. </p><p>  So, the first is the annual maintenance fee.  It is debited from the account the day after the credit card has been activated. </p><p>  The second is the interest rate.  It is individual for everyone.  The description indicates approximate data, but the final rate is determined by bank employees.  It must be remembered: the more documents confirming solvency a client provides, the more favorable the conditions will be for him. </p><p>  Third is the limit.  Any type of card has it.  What to do if the limit is reached?  It is necessary to pay off the debt - in whole or in part.  Then again, you can make consumables within the limit. </p><p>  And the fourth nuance is the validity period.  A person can use the card during the time for which it was issued.  The term is indicated on its front side.  When it expires, the person goes to the office, where he will be issued a new Alfa-Bank credit card.  The conditions for obtaining it are even simpler, since it essentially requires an extension of the service. </p>

    <h2>  "Twins" </h2><p>  This is another interesting tariff that I would like to say a few words about.  Based on the name, it becomes clear that customers are offered dual opportunities and innovation. </p><p>  So, the first condition is 100 days without interest on cash withdrawals and purchases.  The limit on the credit side is 300,000 rubles.  The ability to pay using Samsung Pay and Apple Pay.  The minimum interest rate starts at 26.99%.  Gold discounts are available at increased rates.  And maintenance costs only 2490 rubles a year. </p><p>  What is interesting: this is a unique card, which has no analogues in the Russian Federation.  It is convenient to use due to its universal purpose.  One card for all operations! </p><p>  Also, each side of the card has its own chip, number, PIN-code and magnetic strip, which increases its reliability and security.  Perhaps this is the best credit card issued by Alfa-Bank. </p><p>  Cash withdrawal conditions are as follows: 4.9% of the commission amount, but at least 400 rubles.  The limit per month is 120,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Convenience </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank credit cards, the terms of use of which were described above, are accepted in every country around the world.  After all, the organization issues cards of the international systems ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, which are distributed all over the world. </p><p>  With a dollar credit card, the client can withdraw the amount in any currency - in rubles or euros, for example.  The same applies to the payment of goods and services (in the case of abroad, for example). </p><p>  You can attach an SMS alert to your credit card.  Each time a person will receive messages on credits and debits, on the expiration of the card and on receipt of funds at cash points. </p><p>  And you can put your personal money on a credit card over the limit.  No interest will be charged for their use.  That is, if the card limit is 200,000 rubles, and the person has deposited another 30,000, then he can manage these thirty thousand without thinking about interest. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  People who own Alfa-Bank credit cards are generally satisfied.  Of course, if they carefully read the contract and got acquainted with all the conditions.  There are also negative comments, but people who did not ask all the questions before signing the contract respond negatively to the organization‚Äôs services. </p><p>  But in general, the reviews are encouraging.  Alfa-Bank is a good organization with a conscientious attitude towards its customers, fast operational services and competent, professional employees who are always ready to help people who turn to them. </p>
