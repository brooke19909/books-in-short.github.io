It is amazing how in a relatively small area could accommodate so many zoos, of which there are as many as half a dozen.  Which one to choose for visiting, because there is not so much time at the resort, where they come mainly for the sake of the sea?  What zoo in Anapa is so interesting that a trip there will be remembered for a lifetime?  To decide, let's take a short excursion to each of them. </p><h2>  "Balu" </h2><p>  This zoo was called a safari park and gave it the <span>name of the bear</span> Balu - one of the most beloved heroes of Disney cartoons.  Here, as it should be in safari parks, animals are kept without cages.  Zoo "Balu" in Anapa has an unusual design.  The usual iron gratings here are replaced by glass, that is, in fact, the same cells, only in a new way.  On the one hand, this is pretty good, because you can better see all the representatives of the fauna and even ‚Äútouch‚Äù the terrible tiger, lion or bear with your hand, if it suddenly occurs to you to lie down next to the glass.  With this innovation, it is the only zoo in Anapa.  Photos here, if there is no bright sun and stand at the right angle, are unique.  In addition to glass cages, the ‚ÄúBall‚Äù has several open-air cages for large animals and ponds with small islands in the center, where lovers of water elements live.  Entrance to the safari park costs 300 rubles for all, without exception, who are already 5 years old.  This wonderful place is located near Lake Chemburk on Pionersky Prospekt, 20A.  You can get here on foot or by minibuses 128, 114 or 134. Get off at the Dolphinarium stop.  Nearby there is a parking place.  There is no trade in the territory of the zoo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Anapa" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/902084.jpg" width="530"></div>

At first glance it is clear that here they are being watched as if they were relatives.  Touching animals and feeding (those that are not behind glass) is strictly prohibited.  This zoo in Anapa boasts a white blue-eyed tiger - a rarity even in the largest <span>zoos in the world,</span> leopard, lions, llamas, a wonderful cute pony, reindeer, brown and <span>Himalayan bears,</span> porcupine, a large collection of primates and birds.  Nutria, turtles, fur seals, and crocodiles live in the reservoirs.  There is also a special corner on the territory called the night world.  Here live animals who like the darkness.  The main drawback of this zoo is its compact size.  Even if you walk along it slowly to see all the animals, 30 minutes is enough. </p><h2>  "Animal world" </h2><p>  This zoo in Anapa is called a contact, because here, in contrast to the "Ball", you can not only touch all animals, but also feed them.  In order for the feeding not to go against the usual menu for the guests of the zoo, at the entrance they sell food for each of them.  Animals are kept in ordinary cages, clean and spacious, or in well-equipped enclosures.  The price of the ticket to "Animal World" is also pleasantly surprising and amounts to only 200 rubles for adults and 150 for young visitors, and kids under 3 years old are skipped for free.  Among other advantages, this contact zoo in Anapa is very conveniently located.  The address of the institution is the 30th Victory Anniversary Park.  It is in the very center of the city, near the Pobeda cinema.  There are a lot of minibuses.  You need to exit at the "Mail" or "Second School" stop.  Entrance to the zoo from Gorky Street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contact zoo in Anapa" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/902086.jpg" width="397"></div>

It is called a mini, but, despite its rather modest territory, it leaves good impressions in adults and enthuses the kids.  There are not very many animals here, but not few.  Among them are the kangaroo family with the rarest albino of this species, worldly pigs, monkeys, raccoons, goats, lambs, lambs, a handmade ostrich, which was born here from an brought egg, peacocks, toucans, talking parrots, a lot of other birds, there is a small terrarium and aquarium with fish.  Reviews who have been here are only enthusiastic.  Although they are written by adults, in this wonderful corner of nature, where you can chat live with our smaller brothers, they seem to become children again for some time. </p><h2>  Crocodile farm </h2><p>  This place is hardly a farm as such.  Most likely, this is another contact zoo in Anapa, you only have to iron and feed here not cute fluffy bunnies and guinea pigs, but toothy crocodiles and treacherous pythons.  This fantastic corner is located on 4. Grebenskaya Street. It is not so far from Pioneer Avenue, but it‚Äôs more convenient to drive there by taxi or your car.  Nearby are the water park "Golden Beach" and the stadium "Spartak".  The farm area is wonderfully decorated, there is a lot of greenery, there are funny animal figures on which many visitors take pictures of kids, there is also a pavilion with ice cream, and next to the farm there is a cafe where you can have a bite to eat.  Suspended and classic bridges are arranged above the ponds with crocodiles, so that it is more convenient to consider toothy beasts.  Prices here are very different.  So, adults pay 600 rubles for entry, children over 3 years old - 500 rubles, feeding a crocodile with a fishing rod costs 200 rubles, and feeding other animals - 100 rubles.  It is also possible to stroke reptiles in this zoo, but only with the permission of the instructor.  And here you can take a picture with the most dangerous predator in your hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DoDo Zoo in Anapa" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/902087.jpg" width="513"></div>

Children and adults will surely enjoy the pavilions with birds and animals, where you can see monkeys, rabbits, painted in different colors of goats.

    <h2>  DoDo </h2><p>  This zoo in Anapa could be called differently, for example, "Animal Paradise", everything is so wonderful here!  The DoDo zoo is located not in Anapa, but in the village of Natukhaevskaya, which is 23 kilometers from the city.  More precisely, on the outskirts of the village, so there is plenty of room for animals.  But getting here is not entirely convenient.  By car, drive along the A290 highway.  At the right turn there is a large billboard banner of the zoo.  You need to take a taxi or take a minibus or a shuttle bus going to the village in Anapa, and then either walk or take a taxi again.  The ticket prices here are as follows: children under 3 do not pay, from 3 to 5 - 50 rubles, from 5 to 12 - 200 rubles, from 12 years - 300 rubles for admission.  The zoo has an equestrian club.  Horseback riding lessons cost 700 rubles per lesson, and 10 lessons cost 5,000 rubles.  The territory of the zoo is not only huge, but also very beautiful.  There are many flower beds, benches, funny figures.  There is also a toilet, a shop, a playground, a large parking lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Anapa photo" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/902088.jpg" width="505"></div>

    <h2>  Animal world "DoDo" </h2><p>  The DoDo Zoo in Anapa is so large in area that at the entrance they offer to buy a card so as not to get lost.  Aviaries for animals are as close as possible to their natural habitat.  Among the happy inhabitants (there are forty of them in all): meerkats, camels, llamas, monkeys, lemurs, peacocks and many others.  On the territory there is a large pond where you can see a variety of waterfowl, such as mandarin ducks, swans, pelicans, cranes, ostriches, a large collection of chickens, pheasants and parrots.  Many of them are happy to make contact, not at all afraid of a person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Anapa Madagascar" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/902083.jpg" width="451"></div>

The fauna of Lukomorye is rich and diverse.  Here is a huge collection of birds, many different animals, has its own terrarium. </p><h2>  "Madagascar" </h2><p>  The most interesting zoo in Anapa is Madagascar.

Adults pay 600 rubles for admission, children under three years old are admitted without payment.  Here they offer to look at the many inhabitants of the seas and oceans, including the world's largest shark, at bloodthirsty crocodiles, poisonous snakes and spiders, at peaceful animals and birds, even at microbes.

    <h2>  Impressions from the visit </h2><p>  Madagascar is Anapa's most controversial zoo.  On the one hand, the organizers have done a lot to attract as many visitors as possible.  A tunnel aquarium, the zoo itself, a terrarium and a hall with microorganisms, that is, microbes and other microscopic animals, were placed on the territory of Madagascar.  On the other hand, there are many animals, but there is not enough space for them.  In the aquarium, glass is not the first freshness, through them it is difficult to see.  In the terrarium, snakes and other inhabitants are squeezed into small aquariums of their size.  Therefore, many who visited this zoo in Anapa leave reviews far from enthusiastic.  The microorganism hall occupies the superiority in complaints, which is a small room with two working screens on which something incomprehensible is projected.  Why incomprehensible?  Because there is no guide in Madagascar, each visitor himself understands what is in front of his eyes.  Even in the reviews there are comments that in the halls there is an unpleasant smell from the vital activity of animals, not all cells and aquariums have explanatory signs. </p>
