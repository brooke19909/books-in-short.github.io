Although other animals can be a source of raw materials: goats, llamas, dogs, camels and rabbits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is wool laster yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2129578.jpg"></div>  After shearing, the yarn ends up in a spinning mill.  At this stage, a variety of debris is present in the fibers: sticks, blades of grass, dirt.  With the help of loosening-bogging machines, the fleece is cleaned of impurities.  The next stage is repeated washing, which allows you to get rid of the smallest contaminants.  Further, coloring: for 3 hours at a temperature of 120 degrees, the raw material is aged in a dye solution.  Now it is ready for a carding machine, from which comes out in the form of a thin cloth.  All further processing is reduced to a gradual separation and compaction of the strands.  Such material is called roving.  Original bobbins are formed from it, which are placed in an airtight container with an acid solution - this is the beginning of the transformation of ordinary wool into yarn marked "Laster".  The next step is artificial resin coating and spinning.  Why is such processing necessary and what is it - Laster wool?  Knowing the properties of wool will help to understand this.

    <ul><li>  Evacuation occurs due to the adhesion of flakes located on the surface of the entire rod.  In the product, this leads to shrinkage when non-compliance with the washing conditions and the formation of coughing. </li><li>  The lightness of the fibers is explained by the cavity inside the rod, filled with air and dry cells. </li><li>  Hygroscopicity.  Due to the porous structure of the hair, the material absorbs and retains moisture from the air.  In the future, it slowly evaporates from the surface of the clothes and does not allow the body to cool. </li><li>  Crush resistance - a consequence of the increased elasticity of the fibers. </li><li>  Low thermal conductivity. </li></ul>

    <p>  When treated with acid, the flakes are shortened, and the resin is wrapped in a thin film of fiber.  This is what Laster wool is - yarn that has the virtues of a regular one and does not roll, does not prick, does not shrink, and has enhanced gloss.

    <ol><li>  Glitter and a wide palette of colors of yarn.  After coating with polymer resins, the color becomes juicy and saturated, as it reflects light better.  Ordinary wool has a matte effect and is rarely bright colors. </li><li>  Tactile sensations.  Wool "Laster" - soft and silky, when knitting slightly glides on knitting needles.  Working with her is very comfortable.  And in the sock, the yarn does not annoy with its thorn. </li><li>  Non-volatility.  When friction does not form pellets, and after washing does not shrink.  This property is not suitable for some knitting techniques, such as Fair Isle, where the product must be cut to form a shelf and armhole.  The ability to stray makes a woolen fabric impervious to wind. </li><li>  The qualities of thermal conductivity and hygroscopicity are deteriorating due to a decrease in the porosity of the fibers. </li><li>  The price of such yarn is higher than usual, because during processing 2-3% by weight is lost. </li></ol><p>  When choosing yarn, you should be guided by what properties the finished product should have and what equipment will be used.  For each case, there is a perfect coat. </p><h2>  Types of wool for knitting </h2><p>  Shiny, smooth, pleasant on the body - this is Laster wool.  What is wool in other cases?  The criteria by which yarn is evaluated: </p><ul><li>  fineness (hair thickness) - the thinner, the better; </li><li>  wool length; </li><li>  tensile strength; </li><li>  color of raw materials; </li><li>  plastic. </li></ul>

    <p>  Specialists classify yarn according to each of these criteria, and for ordinary consumers the choice is narrowed to knowledge of the characteristics of the wool of certain animals. </p><ul><li>  Alpaca.  The coat of cloven-hoofed animals, distant relatives of camels is long, thin, very durable and light.  Often used for children's products.  It has about 20 colors in the palette, and the extra-class raw materials are not stained.  100% alpaca is very expensive, therefore, for the production of yarn, mixtures with synthetics and with the wool of other animals are used. </li><li>  Merino.  The most expensive raw materials are given by the breed of merino sheep.  Their coat is the thinnest, longest, incredibly strong and elastic.  Even thermal underwear and clothes for children ‚Äî weightless hypoallergenic things ‚Äî are made from yarn.  The cost of 100% yarn is high, so it goes on sale as part of mixtures with other types. </li><li>  Cashmere.  It is not even obtained from wool, but from the fluff of a high-mountain goat.  Once a year during the period of spring molting, about 150-200 grams of fluff from one animal is manually combed out.  The woven thread is thin and durable, and products made of it are famous for their incredible comfort - they are warm, light and durable.  Of the minuses, we can distinguish the formation of coughing in places of contact with other things, as well as the fear of high humidity. </li><li>  Angora.  It's about the <span>wool of Angora</span> rabbits - <span>soft, fluffy,</span> but prone to molting.  Therefore, angora can only be found in a mixture with other fibers that have a stabilizing property. </li><li>  <span>Mohair.</span>  <span>This</span> wool is sheared from Angora goats.  The result is an airy and warm yarn, it is elastic, silky.  Mohair must be mixed with other threads to strengthen the yarn.  On sale you can find mixtures with a maximum mohair content of not more than 83%. </li><li>  Wool superwash.  Superwash (SW) is Hercosset's proprietary acid and polymer processing technology.  What it is?  Wool "Laster" loses about 3% of its mass, while Superwash - up to 7%.  Super Wash is a more expensive technology, it improves the performance of wool products. </li><li>  Wool.  If the label says "wool", it means sheep.  This is an inexpensive yarn, very warm, durable, but requiring careful care - it can sit and fall off during washing.  It has the property of pricking, therefore, it requires an additional layer of clothing for itself. </li></ul><h2>  Producers of wool "Laster" </h2><p>  This yarn is most widely represented by the German brand Vita, which is produced in factories in India, China and Turkey. </p><ol><li>  Vita Cassandra - 100% Laster wool, 100 g - 400 m. </li><li>  Vita Luster Wool - 100% Laster wool, 100 g - 336 m. </li><li>  Vita Sapphir - 45% Laster wool, 55% acrylic, 100 g - 250 m. </li><li>  Vita Brilliant - 45% Laster wool, 55% acrylic, 100 g - 380 m. </li><li>  Vita Smily - 30% Laster <span>merino wool</span> , 5% silk, 65% acrylic, 50 g - 225 m. </li><li>  Vita Caprice Lux - 100% Laster wool, 100 g - 400 m. </li></ol><p>  Other manufacturers have found Superwash wool in their collections: </p><ul><li>  Alize (Turkey) SW 100 - 75% SW wool, 25% polyamide, 100 g - 420 m. </li><li>  Vita Candy - 100% SW wool, 100 g - 178 m. </li><li>  Fibranatura Lima (made in Turkey for the Italian brand) - 100% SW wool, 100 g - 260 m. </li><li>  Fibranatura Inca - 100% SW wool, 100 g - 97 m. </li><li>  Fibranatura Dona - 100% SW Exstra Fine Merino, 50 g - 115 m. </li></ul><h2>  Yarn reviews and care </h2><p>  What are the reviews of wool "Laster"?  According to most needlewomen, it is very pleasant to work with yarn, it is great for embossed patterns, as it retains volume after repeated washing.  The color of most is stable, but may vary in different batches.  Many people confirm that Laster wool is a fabric that can be washed in a machine at a temperature of 30 degrees.  Dry horizontally.  The product does not need to be ironed, since the threads are very elastic and resilient, take their original shape on their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wool laster reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2137370.jpg"></div>  The yarn is really silky and a little slippery.  When connecting two segments, the knots need to be tied very tightly, since they can be untied due to the slipping of threads on each other.
