A couple of hours spent watching them will never be considered wasted time, because this is a very exciting and interesting activity.  And if you put an informative filmstrip, it‚Äôs also very useful! </p><p>  The magical world in which viewing captivates us is special and always full of miracles and fairy tales.  He will always be full of kindness and love.  Overhead projector is great for learning both real and fairy world! </p><p>  Adults who have childhood impressions of watching films from a filmoscope always remember them with warmth.  And then, finally, after so many years, they were again remembered, they can again be seen on sale, of course, in the neighborhood of the new generation of projectors.  One of these modern filmoscopes is the Regio slide projector. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The Regio slide projector deserves only positive reviews, as it is made of materials safe for the health of the child, it has no sharp corners and, very importantly, it is easy to operate even for children.  It is designed so that it quickly becomes interesting to the child.  Your baby will learn how to install, scroll and stop the film.  And therefore, soon, if he wants to see the filmstrip himself, he will not need the help of adults. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the Regio slide projector-filmoscope ("Reggio") is the only practical and inexpensive analogue of the filmoscopes of the past.  This is really a worthy device.  In addition, if we compare the prices of Soviet filmoscopes and the prices of the Regio slide projector, then it even gains a bit due to the cheaper production technology and the cost of composite materials! </p><p>  And now more about the appearance of the model! </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  In terms of general technical characteristics, the Regio slide projector is not too noticeably different from 20th-century filmoscopes.  The main differences are only a few futuristic design, great ergonomics and compactness (in comparison). </p>

Since this is a film-type device, you can view not only new films on it, but also old Soviet films and cartoons, as well as film photographs.

    <p>  The material of the outer shell of the slide projector itself is a high-quality non-toxic plastic in two colors: gray and blue.  The device itself is very durable, but not shockproof, children over 6 years old can quite use it on their own.  But even if it accidentally falls, it will most likely remain intact and operational.  Users confirm this fact. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The kit, in addition to the Regio slide projector itself, also includes a charger, instructions for use and a spare lamp. </p>

    <h2>  Using </h2><p>  If you had a movieoscope in your childhood, it won‚Äôt take a long time to figure out how to use a slide projector.  For the rest, an understandable instruction is written below.  To start watching a filmstrip using the Regio slide projector, you need to follow a few simple steps. </p><ol><li>  Find the film you need. </li><li>  Insert it into a special slot in the housing. </li><li>  Lock it by scrolling the wheel all the way. </li><li>  Adjust the sharpness (in slide projectors, as in filmoscopes, there is a sharpness control). </li><li>  Scroll through the film and enjoy watching. </li></ol><p>  Especially in order to make it easier for a child to remember how to turn on and off the Regio slide projector, the button is made large enough.  It is made in red.  There is a smaller button in the overhead projector, it is also red.  You need to use it if you want to quickly remove the film from the slide projector without scrolling it.  Since the entire operation process is very simple, the child will be able to use a filmoscope without assistance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In order for you to change the tilt angle of the filmoscope, there is no longer any need to use foreign objects.  The slide projector is equipped with a stable adjustable foot.  A big plus in using the device is its noiselessness, buyers say. </p><p>  Unlike previous generation filmoscopes, the Regio slide projector-filmoscope does not heat up, as there are openings for removing excess heat, which means that it does not have a noisy air cooling system that can destroy the whole atmosphere from viewing filmstrips. </p><p>  The device has a passive cooling system.  The Regio slide projector will be able to give you and your family a lot of joy and positive impressions that will remain in your memory for a long time.  Then your child will remember these home ideas with the same kind nostalgia as you. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The slide projector as a whole poses no danger to the child.  But still, you should not put it at the level of your child‚Äôs head or higher.  He can pull the charging cord, the device will fall and can hit the baby very hard.  So it is better to leave the slide projector so that the child does not harm himself, but can use the device on his own. </p><h2>  Child development with Regio Filmoscope </h2><p>  In fact, cartoons projected by a filmoscope are much more useful than regular cartoons that your kids watch from a TV or computer screen.  Cartoons on the wall develop imagination and stimulate the development of mindfulness and sensitivity. </p>

Parents watch filmstrips with the child and read inscriptions to him (of course, if he still does not know how to do this), which brings them very close together.

    <p>  So the baby has the opportunity to compare what they read with what he sees on the screen.  In addition, the analytical center and the center of visual perception of the child are developing.  Also, each projected picture is very bright and colorful, it goes without saying that it will interest him. </p><p>  If your child is overly active, with the Regio slide projector you can calm down your fidget.  By the way, if you get an informative filmstrip, then your family viewing will be not only fascinating, but also useful for the development of the child.  And you will get invaluable experience of closer communication with your loved ones. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2>

Filmstrips for the Regio slide projector are not included in the package, but you can buy them in the same place where you bought the device.  The kit contains from 4 to 6 films, designed for children from 2 to 8 years old inclusive.  But as a rule, old film Soviet cartoons are quite suitable.  This is what users say.

    <p>  So, the main technical characteristics: </p><p>  - The manufacturer gives a factory warranty for up to 12 months.  But when ordering, you can buy an additional warranty for up to 24 months. </p><p>  - Possibility of autonomous work (using four batteries of type D). </p><p>  - The overhead lamp has a power of 110 lumens, which is a pretty good indicator.  Thanks to such a powerful lamp, the image will be bright and clear.  The life of the LED lamp itself is approximately 20 thousand hours (in total). </p><p>  - The size of the image itself is approximately 130 centimeters. </p><p>  - It is light in weight, approximately 1.45 kilograms. </p><p>  You can buy a slide projector either in online stores or in highly specialized retail outlets.  Rarely, but it is also found in household and computer equipment stores.  You will definitely enjoy the Regio slide projector. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The average price of Regio overhead projector varies from 6 thousand to 9 thousand rubles, which is quite acceptable for this type of equipment.  Such a cost can afford even people with low incomes! </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you want to give your child the opportunity to develop creative abilities from a young age, to give your beloved baby a fairy tale full of magic or to get an opportunity, albeit not for long, but still return to childhood, then do not skimp.  Feel free to purchase this device.  In general, the price of filmoscopes is constantly changing, and statistics show that it is steadily falling due to a gradual decrease in cost and an increase in demand for goods of a similar nature. </p>
