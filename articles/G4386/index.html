You could either forget it yourself, or accidentally enter it incorrectly, or a child played with your device and accidentally turned it on.  Next, it will be described how to unlock the Android graphic key for any version of the OS on any of the devices.

The methods are grouped depending on the device and the simplicity of working with them.  You will either have to try the one you like, or the most suitable, or try several different ones in order to determine which one is suitable.

    <h2>  Simple options </h2><p>  You can use a fairly simple method, which in this case is seen as the most obvious of all.  You will be required to enter the password for your Google Account.  There is one condition: you must have an account.  If it is not, then you should get it in advance.  So, if you entered the described key several times incorrectly, the smartphone or tablet will offer you to enter the password for the account.  After entering, it will take several seconds to wait, and after that the same graphic key will be unlocked.  If you forgot the password for your account, then recovering it is quite simple, and then use it for input on your smartphone or tablet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you do not have a computer or some other smartphone at hand, you can use the locked device for password recovery for this purpose, however, this requires Wi-Fi or mobile Internet on it.  If it turns out that Wi-Fi is turned off, you can turn it on yourself.  To do this, the <span>emergency call</span> button is pressed <span>,</span> after which the combination * # * # 7378423 # * # * is entered.  Next, select the menu of the Service Test - Wlan menu, and then connect to Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  How to unlock a pattern: a common case </h2><p>  You can resort to such a very simple and affordable way - to make a call to a locked smartphone.  This option does not work on all versions of Android, only on 2.2 and earlier.  You will need to pick up the phone after the call, and then go to the security settings service and disable the lock using the pattern key. </p><p>  Another option for unlocking a phone whose graphic key is lost is to completely discharge the battery.  To use it, you need to put the battery of the device.  When the battery runs down, the smartphone will issue a notification, and when this notification is received, you can go to the power settings, then return to the menu on one page, and then enter the security settings, where you can disable the option to use the graphic key. </p>

    <h2>  Using the SMS Bypass App </h2><p>  It is worth noting that using this method requires the user to have Root rights.  And it can only help with preventing unwanted blocking.  That is, the smartphone can be unlocked only if this application is installed in advance.  Naturally, you can search and find hacked versions or free analogues well, but it is better to use the original, which costs only one dollar. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the smartphone has already been locked, but you have <span>root rights</span> and an Internet connection, you can take advantage of the remote installation of this application through the web version of the Google Play Market service on your computer. </p><p>  Now about the application itself.  By default, the application has a password for unlocking the graphic key in the form 1234. In order to unlock it, you must send an SMS containing the text from anywhere: 1234 reset.  This will cause the smartphone to reboot, and then you can enter the graphic key and it will work. </p><h2>  How to unlock a graphic key: more complex ways </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that this option involves partial loss of data on the smartphone, namely: your contacts and various messages will disappear, settings will fly off.  In this case, the device settings are reset, that is, a return to the state that was originally what is called ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù.  If you have a Google account, then contacts and notes can be easily restored from there, so you should get them if you don‚Äôt have one yet.  There is a different algorithm for each manufacturer, so it is worth considering each of them separately. </p><h2>  How to unlock a Samsung pattern </h2><p>  There are two options for the development of events.  If you are the owner of an old smartphone model, you must turn it off, and then hold the Home button at the same time as the on / off button.  For new models, the algorithm is almost the same, however, you will need to add another button, namely, increase the volume.  This procedure will lead to the fact that all settings will be completely reset, after which you can restore your data from your account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  How to unlock LG pattern </h2><p>  In the case of phones of this manufacturer, as in other cases, the device must be turned off and fully charged.  This option involves resetting to factory settings, so all your data will be deleted.  For several different models, the algorithm will be slightly different, it is worth considering options. </p><p>  If we talk about how to unlock the LG Nexus 4 graphic key, then everything is quite simple.  You will need to hold both volume and power buttons simultaneously for three to four seconds.  In front of you on the screen appears the image of the android, which lies on its back.  Through the use of <span>volume controls,</span> you must find the Recovery Mode item, and then activate the power button to confirm your choice.  This will cause your device to reboot and an android with a red triangle will be presented on the screen.  Again, you need to hold the previously indicated buttons for a few seconds until the menu is displayed in front of you.  Next, you will need to go to Settings - Factory Data Reset, where the selection should fall to ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, for which the volume buttons are used to select, and the power button is used to confirm the selection. </p><p>  The model of the <span>LG L3</span> device assumes a slightly different option for calling up the settings menu: simultaneously press ‚ÄúHome‚Äù + ‚ÄúVolume Down‚Äù + ‚ÄúPower‚Äù.  For the LG Optimus Hub, you must immediately press the volume, power, and home buttons. </p><h2>  Situation: forgot the pattern.  How to unlock? </h2><p>  The essence of the problem lies in this - sometimes a situation occurs when the graphic password from a smartphone or tablet is simply forgotten.  In order to return everything to its original state, and at the same time get your Android device in its usual form, it is necessary that the special option "USB debugging" be enabled on it.  Many people know that this is a guarantee for a lot of opportunities: you can get root rights, develop applications on a computer, then test on a connected gadget, install custom Recovery, and much more.  For all this, you need a simple program called ADB.  Many users claim that anyone even slightly familiar with the ADB program is able to crack a smartphone or tablet lock on an Android-based tablet with a graphic key in a couple of clicks.  To do this, you do not need to get root rights. </p><p>  So, you need a fairly simple set of tools.  First of all, this is a computer on which the Android SDK application is installed, which has the ADB program included.  In addition, you definitely need a USB cable through which your smartphone or tablet will connect to the computer, as well as the locked gadget itself, which you will work with.  The author of the proposed method claims that hacking the device‚Äôs graphic key is possible through one of two options.  Depending on what type of device you are working with, as well as on its model, the first or second method may work, or both in turn. </p><p>  The first of these involves working with the command line.  In the window, enter the following combination: adb shell rm /data/system/gesture.key.  After that, you can reboot your device.  Next, the same lock window containing the graphic key will again appear before you.  And here the most interesting: now the lock can be removed by entering any sequence. </p><p>  You can use this option, which will require you to enter in the command line not one command, but a whole sequence. </p><ul><li>  adb shell; </li><li>  su; </li><li>  rm /data/system/locksettings.db; </li><li>  rm /data/system/locksettings.db-wal; </li><li>  rm /data/system/locksettings.db-shm; </li><li>  reboot. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to unlock Fly pattern </h2><p>  It often happens that the owner of a Fly smartphone sets a graphic lock on it in order to protect the device from their children.  But if the child still took it, and, trying to pick up the pattern, blocked the device, you have to solve this problem.  If the phone does not have a lot of significant information, then you can go the simplest way, that is, reset its settings to factory settings.  This is done quite simply.  You will need to turn off the smartphone, while the battery must be charged.  Now you should simultaneously hold down the volume up and ‚Äúon‚Äù buttons.  This will allow you to appear in the recovery menu.  Then, using the volume down button, you should go down to the Wipe data / factory reset line, which can then be activated using the power button.
