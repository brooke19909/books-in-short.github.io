  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lenovo gadgets: reset to factory settings - methods, procedure for performing actions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) on the Android platform are high-tech and sophisticated gadgets.  Sometimes they start to work very strange.  And the point here is not at all the manufacturer.  Gadgets from Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo and other manufacturers suffer from this disease.  The thing is that something happened to the device‚Äôs operating system.  And so she began to work very badly.  Only resetting to factory settings will help.  Lenovo, like many other manufacturers, has simplified this process so that this same reset can be done by users.  We‚Äôll show you how to reset your smartphone or tablet to the factory settings.  But first, let's talk about the reasons for the poor performance of the gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.lenovo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo logo" class="if uuid-3019739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019739.jpg"></div><h2>  Why did the device suddenly start to work badly? </h2><p>  There may be several reasons for this.  The most common is the virus.  The fact is that under the Android OS they write a fair amount of viruses.  Moreover, mobile antiviruses are absolutely not able to identify and eliminate them.  If any malware got into the system, then it will start to glitch and slow down.  Another common reason is cluttering the system drive.  When there are too many files accumulating there and there is disastrously little free space, the OS may also behave inappropriately.  In any of these cases, resetting Android to factory settings can help.  Lenovo also implemented such an opportunity in its devices.  Now consider all the reset methods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.currys.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reset laptop lenovo to factory settings" class="if uuid-3019749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019749.jpg"></div><h2>  Factory Reset Methods </h2><p>  As for the reset parameters, there are no unusual features of the gadgets from Lenovo.  Resetting to the factory settings of the phone occurs according to a completely ordinary and logical algorithm.  And you can carry out this operation in several ways.  All of them are extremely simple and will not cause any problems. </p><ol><li>  Using the settings of the device.  In all versions of smartphones or tablets from Lenovo there is a system option to reset to factory settings using the parameters of the device itself. </li><li>  Forced reset.  If the above option for some reason does not work, then there is an option to force a reset through the recovery of the phone or tablet.  But you need to use it in the most extreme case. </li></ol><p>  That's all the ways.  But if you need to reset the Lenovo laptop to the factory settings, then everything will be a little more complicated.  Although there is one very simple option - disassemble the laptop and remove the battery (tablet), which is responsible for keeping the BIOS settings in the off state.  Settings will instantly reset to standard. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that a reset to the factory settings of Lenovo will be accompanied by the deletion of all user data and applications from the device‚Äôs internal drive.  Therefore, it is highly recommended that you back up your data.  And now you can start the reset process itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="prolenovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo tablet reset to factory settings" class="if uuid-3019743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019743.jpg"></div><h2>  We use the settings of the Android operating system </h2><p>  This is the easiest and most accessible way for any user.  So you can make the Lenovo tablet work too.  Reset to factory settings is carried out according to an extremely simple algorithm.  There is nothing complicated about it.  And you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Open the settings menu using the appropriate shortcut on the device‚Äôs desktop (usually a gear). </li><li>  In the "System" block, click "Restore and reset." </li><li>  Next, select the "Reset Settings" item. </li><li>  A message appears stating that all user data from the unit will be deleted. </li><li>  Confirm the action using the "Reset phone" button. </li><li>  We are waiting for the completion of the process (usually it takes 5-7 minutes). </li><li>  Reboot the device. </li><li>  Re-configure it and enter user data. </li></ol><p>  That's the whole reset process.  In this case, the user does not require any special knowledge.  The device will do everything by itself.  But it also happens that this item of the settings menu for some reason does not work.  In this case, you need to use an alternative method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prolenovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reset to factory android lenovo" class="if uuid-3019746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019746.jpg"></div><h2>  We use standard recovery </h2><p>  This is an alternative way to reset to factory settings.  Lenovo (like other devices) fully supports this feature.  It will take a little knowledge.  It will be nice if the user is savvy in English.  You also need to remember to back up the data.  And the instructions for resetting are: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the device completely. </li><li>  Turn on the smartphone with the power and volume buttons held down. </li><li>  We are waiting for the Android logo to load and release the buttons. </li><li>  We are waiting for the download of the recovery. </li><li>  In it, select the item "Wipe Data / Factory Reset". </li><li>  We are waiting for the completion of the process. </li><li>  Select the "Reboot system now" item. </li><li>  We are waiting for the full loading of the OS. </li><li>  We configure the device and enter the necessary user data. </li></ol><p>  This reset method will work with a 100% guarantee.  It is worth noting that the first boot of the device after a reset can take from 5 to 10 minutes.  You need to be patient.  Now let's see what users say about a particular reset method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo factory reset phone" class="if uuid-3019748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3019748.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What option for resetting to factory settings "Lenovo" users choose?  There is no consensus.  Those who have recently purchased a smartphone on the Android OS prefer the option with settings.  They say that is much easier.  But those who grew up on the old ‚ÄúAndroids‚Äù, which needed to be reset once a week (and there could be no talk about any settings), claim that the recovery method is more reliable and ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù.  Nevertheless, users note that both methods work well.  But not if there is a virus in the system.  Often it blocks the ability to reset by system tools.  Therefore, knowing how to reset the device to the factory settings using recovery will definitely not hurt.  Users note that the second option works in one hundred percent of cases.  Therefore, he is the most preferable. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, above we examined the options for resetting devices from Lenovo to factory settings.  You can do this with two options.  The first is more loyal to users, and the second is more radical.  However, the latter is also the most effective.  But only the user to decide which one to use.  If one does not work, then there is always another.  The main thing is to try.  And also do everything according to the instructions.  Then there will be no problems. </p>
