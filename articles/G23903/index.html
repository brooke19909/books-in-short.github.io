How to disable the Latitude service on Megaphone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes there is a need to search for a particular subscriber on the map.  Here a service called Locator will help you.  Megafon offers its connection and use to all its customers.  True, some are skeptical of this possibility.  Indeed, few people believe that it is possible to determine the location of a subscriber on an interactive map with an accuracy of 15 meters.  Is this a hoax? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="locator megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128484.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Not at all.  In fact, the operator has the Locator service.  "Megaphone" allows any subscriber to connect to this opportunity and at any time to determine the position of relatives, friends and relatives on an interactive map. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The proposal, according to the operator, is very interesting for modern parents.  After all, they can always check where their child is.  The Latitude service on Megafon sends messages to mobile devices with all the information about the person‚Äôs position.  In SMS there is a link to the card.  Very comfortable and practical.  But what are the conditions for this opportunity?  Is there really no limit here? </p><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the service "Locator" ("Megaphone") has some rules for use.  If you do not follow them, then you will not be able to realize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfinding a person on the map. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, an important point - the subscriber must give his consent to surveillance.  Without this, it will not work with the service.  Perhaps such a condition exists with any operator. </p><p>  The service "Locator" is paid.  And for each function of the opportunity there are prices.  For example, the search for your number ("Where Am I") will cost 5 rubles.  Additional movements on the map cost 1 ruble, an SMS request is 5, and the USSD command is 6 rubles.  In principle, not very expensive.  But for constant and regular use, Locator from Megafon is not entirely suitable.  This service is already very expensive. </p><p>  Subscriber search works only within your home region.  Incidentally, Locator does not work throughout Russia.  You can see the exact information on the Megafon website.  There you can find out if there is a connectivity option in your area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="locator megaphone through computer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128487.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Call connection </h2><p>  We decided to use the service from the Megafon company - Locator.  There are several ways to connect it.  In any case, that‚Äôs exactly what the mobile operator says. </p><p>  For example, you can try the call option.  To do this, dial 0500 on the phone and wait for an answer.  Tell your telecom operator that you‚Äôd like to connect Latitude to yourself.  He will check the connectivity, and then ask you to name your initials with a surname and a phone number.  A few minutes of waiting - and the application has been sent for processing.  In response, you will receive a message about the successful completion of the process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  True, this situation is not particularly pleasing to subscribers.  Much more often they use special requests and SMS messages.  But which ones?  The company "Megaphone" "Locator" to connect as easy as shelling pears.  It is enough to enter certain commands to implement the search.  And nothing more special. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone locator connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128485.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Inquiries </h2><p>  If you want to activate Locator (Megafon) through a computer, you will have to use the official page of your mobile operator.  Log in there, and then visit the Services section.  In the list that opens, you need to find the "Locator".  Opposite this inscription will be the "Connect" function.  If you click on it, then you will receive a message on the phone with a request confirmation code.  Enter it in the appropriate field on the screen - and all problems are resolved.  "Locator" ("Megaphone") is activated through the computer. </p><p>  But in the case of the phone you have to use certain queries.  To connect (and search), you need USSD commands.  Your phone is searched using * 148 #, of some subscriber - * 148 * number #.  By the way, you must add yourself one or another user in advance to work with the service.  More about this later. </p><p>  Please note that the search can be carried out via SMS.  It must be sent to 000888. The text should contain only the subscriber's number.  In response, you will receive an email with a link to the map and a description of the user's location. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  And now a little about navigation.  It‚Äôs very difficult to use the locator without additional work.  You can only find your own phone.  But not a stranger.  For this you, as already mentioned, you need to get confirmation from a friend to implement the idea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="service locator on a megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128488.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The service "Locator" ("Megaphone") allows you to add numbers to the search list.  To do this, you need to dial a message on your mobile device and send it to number 000888. The text is as follows: + 792XXXXXXX, where XXXXXXX is the user's phone.  After the request, your friend will receive an SMS notification with a verification code and instructions.  He will have to send back a secret combination to the number 000888. And after that, the subscriber will be included in the list of approved. </p><p>  You can also exclude a person at any time.  In this case, further search on the map without confirmation will be impossible.  Send a message to the number you already know with the text: + 792XXXXXXX.  Here XXXXXX means the same thing as last time. </p><p>  The list is completely deleted with the CLEAR or C command (it is important that the letters are uppercase), and can be viewed with LIST and L. That's how it is extremely easy and simple.  As you can see, managing a locator from Megafon is not as difficult as it seems. </p><h2>  Cancellation of Services </h2><p>  True, sometimes there is a need to refuse the service.  You can either simply not send new requests, having previously cleared the contact list, or refuse the offer altogether.

    <p>  To get started, call the operator and ask him to fill out an application.  Not the most popular, but very effective method.  It works both for the subscriber who is looking for someone, and for those who are trying to find.  We dial 0500 and inform the operator of our intentions.  We confirm the actions (just say that you agree with the shutdown) and wait for the result.  A notification about the successful completion of the process will come in about 5 minutes. </p><p>  In addition, the "Personal Account" on the site of "Megaphone" is an ideal option.  It is better to work with him through a computer.  Go through authorization, select "Services".  Next, find there "Locator" and press "Disable".  A window for the verification code will appear on the screen.  It remains only to enter it and click "OK." </p>
