Beeline Tab 2 tablet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the market is filled with so many diverse gadgets that anyone (even the most fastidious buyer) can choose a ‚Äútoy‚Äù to their liking.  Some people prefer an iPad, while others prefer a rather simple tablet for watching movies, reading literature and visiting social networks.  The main thing is that the purchase does not harm the family budget.  Especially if the tablet is required by children who do not really cherish an expensive thing.  Most budget gadgets run on Android. </p><h2>  Beeline company crowds competitors </h2><p>  Although inexpensive and good device is almost impossible to find.  Value for money themselves contradict each other.  In general, this was a long time until the Beeline company appeared on the market, which introduced its hit tablet Beeline Tab. </p>

    <p>  Despite its relatively affordable price, the tablet has a ton of new-fangled chips.  In the meantime, we continue to do a brief review of Beeline Tab 2. </p><h2>  A small tablet or a huge phone </h2><p>  Beeline Tab is a budget model, so it's silly to compare it with the models of leading brands.  But to describe the main characteristics of new items is still worth it.  To begin with, it should be noted that it was incredibly in demand.  Still would!  The tablet did not cost even 2000 rubles, but the buyer received not only a full-fledged computer, but also a phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the Beeline Tab 2 novelty, the discussion should start with the fact that it is identical to the original in the structure of the case and in the package of delivery, but in design and construction it is slightly different. </p><h2>  Benefits of the 2nd Model </h2><p>  The first-born of Beeline was completely plastic, and another design flaw was that it did not close the slots for a SIM card and memory card.  Naturally, this is not very beautiful, and created additional difficulties in caring for the device.  Dust, crumbs, and other debris clogged into the holes. </p>

Already at the first appearance of the tablet, customer reviews of Beeline Tab 2 encouraged manufacturers and sellers.  Especially pleased connoisseurs decent sound device.  Of course, it is not super loud, but it is clean, without wheezing and extraneous noise.  On the upper edge there is an audio port for headphones and a USB connector.  By the way, listening to music through headphones is very nice!

    <p>  And the main plus of the tablet is the removable top panel, which hides underneath the slots for SD and SIM cards.  This is a significant advantage in comparison with the first model.  The model has a cellular module with support for GSM frequencies 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and UMTS 900/2100 MHz, the peak speed of data reception / transmission is 21.6 / 5.76 Mbps.  Thanks to this, the device can also be used as a large phone.  Naturally, it is equipped with a microphone and speaker for conversation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, not everyone wants to ‚Äúshine‚Äù on the street with such a contraption near his ear, it is better to use a standard telephone for communication.  But still, it's not bad when a tablet has such a useful feature. </p><p>  To be honest, during testing, the device was not checked for incoming calls.  Tests were conducted only for Internet connectivity.  But before talking about the operation, we will continue to do a review of Beeline Tab 2, since many more aspects have not been considered. </p><h2>  Internal organization </h2><p>  The tablet is very compact.  A touch 7-inch display with a resolution of 600 by 1024 pixels makes it even better.  The colors are not bright enough, since the matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãTN + Film, and the viewing angles are not very wide.  With a strong deviation, the colors are inverted, although no one looks at the tablet from any angle when working with it.  So this is not a problem at all. </p>

    <p>  To be honest, the screen is pretty well visible in sunny daylight and in complete darkness.  It recognizes all touches and the touch panel, which is very nice at such a low cost model.  Many sites offer versions for Android, so the font on the screen will also be very easy to read. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The central processor is dual-core, the OP is designed for 4 GB.  It can be expanded with a memory card.  As with any model, there is Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and a receiver.  Battery capacity - 3000 mAh.  Another plus - the charge is enough for the whole day of active use of the tablet.  There is also a backlight that glows when notifications or messages arrive. </p><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  The review of "Beeline Tab 2" can be continued by analyzing the operation of the gadget.  Are the device capabilities sufficient for convenient operation?  The concept of comfort is different for everyone, but thanks to a fast, clean OS and good software optimization, the interface practically does not freeze. </p>

And the pages on the tabs are constantly reloading.  But for constant use of networks, watching movies and videos, more is not needed.

    <h2>  Comfort </h2><p>  After appearing on the market, Beeline Tab 2 reviews gaining speed.  The people are pleased with the comfortable size.  The device fits comfortably in the middle palm of an adult.  His weight is also quite light (only 250-280 g). </p><p>  The tablet is quite wide and thick, but thanks to this it turns out to be very compact - when you hold it on weight, you can not be afraid that the device may slip out. </p>

When she reports on the use of the limit, data transfer automatically stops.

    <h2>  Pros and cons, according to buyers </h2><p>  Of course, everyone has a different opinion, because of which the Beeline Tab 2 tablet is gaining a variety of reviews - from admiring to negative. </p><p>  Basically, all users note as the main advantages of the device - the affordable price for everyone, the maintenance of almost all functions of the computer, ease of use, and the ability to use the tablet as a means of communication. </p><p>  There are also disadvantages, and most often it is a low screen resolution.  Not everyone is happy with the camera and sound. </p><p>  Users have a different attitude to the removable top cover, which covers the slots.  Some people like that the cards are protected, others think that removing the cover is a waste of time. </p><p>  We can conclude by looking at the various comments about the Beeline Tab 2 tablet - the reviews agree that the device is quite successful, lasts a long time and enjoys the greatest popularity among children and adolescents.  The exception is one review, which reports that the tablet‚Äôs internal screen burst on the third day after purchase.  What it was (a manufacturing defect or the buyer's fault) is difficult to argue. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  This has not been written about anywhere, but Tab 2 supports OTG.  True, the cable is not included, but you can try connecting a mouse and a flash card to it through a standard cable - everything should work.  If everything is quite simple with a mouse (usually a cursor should appear), then the tablet independently determines it as an external USB-drive. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, Beeline Tab 2 is not the most expensive tablet, it cannot boast of super features: a super-efficient processor, clear sound or a bright screen.  Nevertheless, it pays off its cost by 200%.  Decent video quality, fast downloading files, reading e-books, surfing, listening to music, navigation, simple toys and other pleasant things. </p>
