One of the largest hotel chains</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Chain hotels have</span> gained immense popularity among tourists.  Many look for familiar names when booking a room away from home.  Indeed, the hotel brand is a quality mark, a guarantee of level and comfort.  Many hotel chains are enterprises with many years (and sometimes even centuries) of history.  Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide is a name familiar to everyone. </p><h2>  A bit of history.  How did the brand appear? </h2><p>  You can write books and make films about the history and appearance of Starwood.  This is a story about how to find benefits even in times of crisis, how to think outside the box and take reasonable risks. </p><p>  Founded in 1991 against the backdrop of the American crisis of the 80s, by the end of the 90s it became the largest hotel chain of the time.  The company was allowed to conquer the market by purchasing the Sheraton hotel chain.  For her, the company competed no more no less with Hilton. </p><p>  Now under the brand name of Starwood Hotel there are more than 1300 hotels in 100 countries of the world.  Starwood is a conglomerate.  He manages 11 hotel chains from budget to luxury, designed for different target audiences. </p><h2>  The flagship project of the company </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sheratonfiji.com" data-author=": sheratonfiji.com, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Fiji" class="if uuid-2629518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2629518.jpg"></div><p>  With Sheraton in the 90s, the story of the unprecedented success of Starwood Hotels began.  The first hotel of this chain was purchased back in 1937 in the city of Springfield.  Changing the name was then economically unprofitable, so all subsequent acquisitions were renamed.  And so the Sheraton network was born. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All hotels are awarded 5 stars.  The motto of the network - ‚ÄúWe give you peace‚Äù - is the philosophy of the concern.  It literally covers the whole globe, offering uncompromising service, unique architecture, culinary experiences and much more. </p><p>  Sheraton Hotels were the first to introduce a free internal telephone in each room, a gym on site, and turn the lobby into a full-fledged conference center with wireless Internet.  And to this day, the company keeps up to date, somewhere even ahead of it, and offers services that go far beyond the "standard". </p><h2>  The largest hotel in the world </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hotel.mtravelclub.com" data-author=": hotel.mtravelclub.com, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Macau Kotay" class="if uuid-2629417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2629417.jpg"></div><p>  In 2012, China opened its doors to the huge and incredibly beautiful Sheraton Macao Hotel Cotai with 4,000 rooms, the two buildings of which are poetically named Heaven and Earth. </p><p>  The hotel in China is a luxury complex, where even the category of rooms starts immediately with the 45-meter Delux.  The apotheosis of the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù style is, of course, the presidential suite measuring almost 270 square meters.  m </p><p>  Spa, 4 theme restaurants, 3 swimming pools, gym, golf, real jungle in the lobby - you will not be bored at the hotel.  Staff speaking at least 4 languages ‚Äã‚Äãare ready to fulfill any whim. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For privileged guests, the hotel has a club lounge where you can work, hold meetings or just relax.  Actually, such a club is in every hotel in the chain, however, it is available only to loyal customers of the ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù level. </p><h2>  SPG.  Starwood Hotels Loyalty Program </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.macobserver.com" data-author=": macobserver.com, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile booking application" class="if uuid-2629522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96741/2629522.jpg"></div><p>  The Starwood Preferred Guest membership card (Starwood privileged guest) gives hotel guests even more benefits.  This program is perhaps the best in its class.  It consists of three levels, the transition to each of them depends on the number of nights spent in hotels. </p><p>  Becoming a member of the Strawood Hotel family is simple and free.  More than 1300 hotels in 100 countries will be in your pocket on one plastic card.  Exclusive offers, discounts, bonus nights and much, much more. </p><p>  For the convenience of guests, mobile applications have been developed that allow you to quickly book, cancel, check the balance, order additional services.  SPG even offers its own Visa-based credit card for even greater convenience of settlements and accumulation of bonus points. </p><p>  Traveling is made up of little things.  Sometimes a cup of coffee served on time can save the day.  What if chocolate is also served for coffee?  Will they order a taxi, tickets, play with the children, arrange a meeting, smile and invite you again? </p><p>  Starwood makes sure that the guests' life consists only of pleasant trifles. </p>
