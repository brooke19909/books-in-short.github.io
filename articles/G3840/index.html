This is due to the fact that the manufacturer produces high-quality equipment, time-tested.  Real musicians do not need to talk about this company for a long time.  She occupied a cell in the Russian market for a long time and more than once came to the rescue by the fact that she wanted to buy good equipment at a very reasonable price. </p><p>  This article provides an overview of the well-known model - Microlab M880.  The main objective of the technique is to work with a computer or laptop, it should play all the sounds transmitted to it through the bluetooth module version 4. Moreover, you can also use smartphones and tablets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab m880" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1560621.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The box in which the manufacturer supplies the equipment looks cumbersome enough, which makes it clear that there is serious equipment inside.  The configuration of the Microlab M880, however, is quite modest and does not pull at a high cost.  All that the consumer sees in the box is the cable and the <span>speaker system</span> itself <span>.</span>  The control panel and other similar devices are not provided by the manufacturer.  This makes it clear that the equipment is designed for use in small rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The model is sold in one color - black.  The usual stereo speakers are installed and there is a subwoofer.  The system amplifier is operating normally.  The signal to noise ratio is 75 dB.  The frequency range varies from 50 to 20 thousand Hz.  The power of each speaker is 16 watts, which is quite adequate for a device of this price category.  The subwoofer has a rated power of 27 watts.  It works well, there are no complaints about the functioning.  The total power of the system is 59 watts. </p><p>  Of the additional functions, it can be noted the connection via the bluetooth module, the ability to adjust the sound timbre by amplifying bass or treble. </p><p>  The cable has a mini-jack, that is, 3.5 mm.  The system also received a headphone output. </p><p>  <span>The volume control</span> is located on the front.  The speakers and subwoofer have the same finishing material - MDF.  These are medium density panels.  The weight of the device is 6.5 kg.  The dimensions of the speakers are 10.5 √ó 21 √ó 12.5 cm, the subwoofer is 18 √ó 21 √ó 33.5 cm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab m880 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1560626.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Device placement </h2><p>  Due to the specific size of the equipment, you will have to decide where it will be located before buying.  You need to be smart and maximum creativity, otherwise the use of Microlab M880 will turn into a continuous meal.  It is best not to place the unit on the floor.  The fact is that the sound controls are arranged in such a way that it will be difficult to reach them.  The most rational solution is to install on a table.  The problems with this option are that not all surfaces are designed to accommodate such dimensional devices.  In this case, there are two solutions to the problem.  First: using a wireless connection.  This will avoid the use of cable, which will clearly expand the scope of the installation choice.  Second: Microlab M880 can be placed under the table, setting all the settings at one time, without the prospect of their constant change.  If necessary, the volume can be changed using software installed on a computer or tablet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The model looks great as a separate music center.  Its appearance is impressive and attracts any audiophile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab m880 instruction" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1560630.jpg" width="582"></div>

    <h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  The Microlab M880 system, a review of which will help to understand whether this model is suitable for the consumer, is made of specially processed cardboard.  The material is in demand among manufacturers who create inexpensive, but high-quality equipment.  Do not think that it is somehow worse than ordinary plywood.  The difference is only in cost, the quality in both cases is at an excellent level. </p><p>  The case of the Microlab M880 system (the instructions describe more detailed data) received an impressive speaker.  However, the manufacturer forgot about the grill.  It is not important to someone, some believe that the protective grill looks too awful, while others distinguish it as a serious flaw.  Of course, the presence of a lattice is optional, but still desirable.  If the unit falls, there is a great risk of damaging the speaker when there is no protective surface.  The speaker cable is attached to the unit tightly.  Therefore, it is better not to touch it once again, otherwise during the repair process you will have to replace the cord completely.  Moreover, damage to this part can lead to malfunctions, the elimination of which will cost a pretty penny. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Acoustic system for <span>low frequencies</span> (subwoofer) combined with an amplifier.  It should be noted that they look quite nice, the performance style is strict.  The kit itself also inspires confidence;  The design is nice and disgusting.  It will fit perfectly into any of the modern interiors, especially if you find a good place for it. </p>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Microlab M880 <span>speaker system</span> , reviews of which can be read below, on the front side has all the necessary levers for controlling the installation.  On the side, you can find a bass reflex.  There are very few levers, so it will be easy to understand them.  Among them are controls for tones, volume and low frequencies.  Additionally, a button to turn on and off the device is installed.  The display of the Microlab M880 (specifications are described in this review) is not.  The only thing that can be added is the backlight of the volume lever, which is a kind of informant that the installation is on. </p><h2>  What is the device suitable for? </h2><p>  This device is perfect for holding discos in small rooms or for home parties.  For those who are famous for their love of powerful reproduction, it will not be the best option.  Buying a device will be a great solution if you need to listen to a different genre of songs.  It is also suitable if there is a desire to improve the game process.  Subwoofer Microlab M880, reviews of which are positive, in this case will prove to be the best, especially if there are shots and explosions in addition to music. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab m880 specifications" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1560636.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  As a rule, this equipment is connected to a stationary computer and listen to genre compositions.  Consider how the device sounds in different styles. </p><ul><li>  Trance.  The bass is poor.  The overall impression is good.  The sound is clear, all musical instruments are heard clearly. </li><li>  Darkwave.  The sound is normal.  At minimum and medium volume, playback is clear.  At maximum, noise appears.  At the same time, the mid-frequencies are noticeably distorted, and the lead singer‚Äôs vocals are transformed into the usual ‚Äúbubbling‚Äù. </li><li>  Rock.  The sound is transmitted perfectly.  Musical instruments are well audible, especially the violin. </li><li>  Alternative.  Although it is one of the styles of rock, the speaker system does not cope with it well.  Too many basses that are transmitted too aggressively.  Against this background, alternative songs become like hard rock, because the vocals are almost lost in noise. </li><li>  Chillout.  Sound can be classified as high-quality.  The most clear sound, indescribable sensations. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that this equipment was tested on one of the well-known rock compositions.  It's about Queen - Is This The World We Created.  The sound can be called great.  Given the wide range of frequencies that are present in this song, the guitar and vocals sound as harmoniously as possible.  On a high note, unfortunately, the speakers are not doing their best.  However, another inexpensive speaker system is not able to perfectly reproduce this composition.  Therefore, <span>the Microlab</span> M880 <span>speakers</span> are constantly receiving excellent reviews - for sound quality. </p><p>  When connected to a smartphone or tablet, you can hear some noise in the background.  Sometimes the problem is the sound source, in certain situations, this equipment becomes it.  When playing tracks through the bluetooth module, you can see that the volume of any will be too low for a separate speaker system.  However, in general, this device fully justifies its cost and all the expectations of customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab m880 speaker system" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1560638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Among the positive aspects of the device, consumers note the following nuances: excellent bass, impressive design, value for money, powerful and clear sound, size, assembly, low cost, adjustment from the front, durability, good subwoofer, consumption of 59 watts and the ability to connect headphones. </p><p>  Considering the shortcomings that buyers do not like so much, it is necessary to note short wires (however, it depends on personal taste and needs of everyone), too long a subwoofer, lack of a control panel, poor audibility of high frequencies, open speaker design.  Of the problems, consumers notice that over time, the on and off button is pressed poorly, and also after a certain period the metal panel starts to peel off. </p><p>  In general, the owners are satisfied with their choice, and most of them advise buying this particular model from similar budget options.  It will amaze with the quality of reproduction, which is noticeable in almost all genres.  The average price for a kit can be seen below. </p><h2>  Price category </h2><p>  The average cost of the model is 5 thousand rubles.  As a gift, this device acts as an ideal solution, for yourself you need to weigh everything and think.  If the budget is small, you need to take it without hesitation.  In another embodiment, it is better to look at more expensive models of the same manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab m880 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1560640.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Microlab has long been considered a reputable company that has a rich history.  Unfortunately, her era has already passed, but many remember how the Solo and Ash series gained immense popularity and broke sales records in this market segment.  Now the products of this manufacturer are being replaced by more modern and expensive models, quickly gaining the favor of the consumer.  This is not to say that the Microlab M880 speaker system is far behind its analogues, but it is not worth recommending it to a serious audiophile. </p>
