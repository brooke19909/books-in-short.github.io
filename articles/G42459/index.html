Two circles of the same size are cut out of the material (you can give preference to any of the above).

    <h2>  Strong Wax Amulet </h2><p>  It is important that before proceeding with the manufacture of any amulet, put your thoughts in order.  During the rite and the creative process, one cannot doubt the power of magic, otherwise it will not work. </p><p>  To make a wax amulet, you first need to choose a suitable candle.  Let it be small and not very expensive, bizarre or the simplest.  You need to purchase the one that you immediately liked.  The ritual is recommended in the first days of the growing month.  The younger the month, the stronger the mascot will be. </p><p>  The ritual is held at 12 a.m.  The selected candle must be placed in a glass and set on fire.  In this case, no special conspiracy words need to be pronounced, it is enough just to convey the desire of the candle flame, to connect with it at the energy level.  While the flames are playing, you should whisper your desires.  Tell the candle about the fears too.  According to magicians, candle wax will absorb dreams and desires, will remember anxieties and undesirable plots. </p><p>  When the candle burns out, you should wait until the wax cools and hardens, taking a bizarre shape with curls and patterns.  They will be stored and spoken mysterious information of the owner of the amulet. </p><p>  The figurine that will remain after the rite must be carried constantly with you and do not let anyone touch it.  It is better if the eyes of others will not see the amulet.  Usually, the said wax is placed in a medallion or healed in a bag made of velvet or brocade golden fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Make an amulet for money with your own hands" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5137/985273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Amulet from the four elements </h2><p>  To make an amulet for good luck and money with your own hands, charged with the energy of the four elements, you will need a gold or purple ribbon.  With it, using natural threads, you need to embroider the symbols of the sun and moon, wind and water in such a way that as a result you get a whole and woven picture.  Each character cannot be sewn separately.  Therefore, before starting to create a talisman, it is worth considering how everything will look in the end.  The embroidered ribbon should be illuminated by the sun and the full moon, blown by the wind and moistened with heavy rain.  When all the elements share their energy with the amulet, you can use the talisman. </p><h2>  Amulet Power and Belief in Magic </h2><p>  Without faith in magic, an amulet for money is powerless.  For it to truly become a powerful amulet, you need to constantly nourish it with your energy.  <span>Thoughts materialize.</span>  To become the owner of a powerful talisman, you should not only learn the rules of the rituals, but also perform all the steps correctly.  Charging the amulet with energy is a difficult and tedious process.  It is necessary to concentrate and connect mentally with the <span>objects of magic</span> ritual.  It is equally important to make it with your own hands. </p><p>  Finally, so that the amulet does not lose its strength, you can not show it even to close people.  This is a very personal item.  And in no case can it be donated and given for temporary use even to very close people. </p>
