How to sell apartments so as not to be deceived</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As soon as the owner of the apartment is thinking about selling, there is no doubt that you should contact a realtor.  The specialist will do everything in the highest rank, find the right buyers and help arrange all the documents.  But the commission will also have to pay a considerable amount.  Many realtors charge 1% of the transaction value.  It is easy to calculate how much money the seller loses.  But you just have to study some of the nuances, and housing will be able to be sold absolutely safely without intermediaries.  So how to sell an apartment? </p><h2>  We carry out an assessment of real estate </h2><p>  Before placing an advertisement for the sale of an apartment, first of all, it is necessary to determine its cost.  This moment is quite responsible.  If you put too low a price, the deal will not work out profitable.  But overpriced housing can be on sale for years.  Before you sell apartments, it is worth exploring the real estate market in a particular region.  To do this, for example, you can look through the pages of the corresponding portals and forums for several days and look for similar ads.  Initially, you can set a price that will slightly exceed the market.  If the demand for real estate is low, the amount indicated at the beginning will have to be slightly reduced. </p>

First of all, this is the location of the house.  If the living space is located in a not very prestigious area where there is no good transport interchange, it will not be possible to sell it at a high price.  The price can also be affected by the age of the house, its number of storeys, and the availability of auxiliary communications.  Selling an apartment that was built less than 3 years ago will be much faster and more profitable.  After all, this is almost a new building.  The view from the window also matters.

It will not be too expensive to sell housing if people live on minimum wages.  Even those who pre-set aside funds for the acquisition of real estate, try to consider cheaper options. </p><h2>  How to sell an apartment fast and expensive? </h2><p>  To change the level of solvency of the population or to move housing to another area will not work, because it is beyond your strength.  But here you can still slightly increase the cost of housing.  Everything must be done so that the apartment visually looks more expensive.  Most people make the final decision only after examining a potential purchase.  If the apartment looks perfect, you can sell it for good money. </p>

One has only to glue the wallpaper, <span>paint the ceilings</span> and tidy the balcony.  It will be possible to sell a room apartment at the price of a piece if you make a good renovation.  It is recommended to entrust this work to a true professional.  Living space with designer renovation always costs much more.  Experts felt that after simple finishing work, the value of real estate increases by 20-30%.

    <p>  The clutter of the premises should also be eliminated.  Almost all apartments have different little things that are difficult to get rid of.  These are souvenirs brought from abroad, packages with unclaimed items, old soft toys, etc. All this is a memory for the owner of the living space.  But for a potential buyer, these "values" seem like trash.  Those who are determined to sell the apartment without intermediaries should take out all unnecessary to the garage.  In the room should be a minimum of things.  You need to leave only furniture and basic necessities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some pieces of furniture will also have to be disposed of.  First of all, this is done in order to visually expand the space.  In addition, a potential buyer will probably want to arrange the furniture in his own way.  It is necessary to create everything so that another participant in the transaction could show his imagination.  Well, if at the time of sale will be able to move to another place altogether.  Why?  Everything is simple.  The sale term of an empty apartment is reduced several times. </p><h2>  We compose an ad correctly </h2><p>  Everyone knows that advertising is the engine of commerce.  Selling real estate is no exception.  And the advertisement is an advertisement.  It is necessary to place information about the sale in various newspapers and on electronic resources.  At the same time, it is worth a little money to make the ad stand out among many others.  To sell an apartment without intermediaries will quickly allow high-quality text.  You can come up with a bright headline that will attract potential buyers. </p><p>  The body of the ad should be as informative as possible.  A potential buyer wants answers to all his questions.  Those who seek to sell an apartment in Moscow should not only describe the area, but also indicate its advantage.  If there is a metro station within a five-minute walk from the house, you should definitely remember this.  All information must be entered compactly, in small sentences.  Too long and tedious text will not interest the buyer. </p><p>  The announcement, of course, must be composed correctly.  If necessary, you can use the services of the corrector.  The specialist will not only correct spelling, speech or punctuation errors (if any), but also tell you how to make sentences correctly. </p><h2>  How else to advertise a property? </h2><p>  If you need to sell an apartment in Moscow or another city urgently, you need to use every opportunity.  You can post information about the sale on television or radio.  There are also completely free advertising methods.  The announcement can be hung on the porch door or car window.  Anyone who needs an apartment in a specific area will definitely read the information on the sale. </p>

    <p>  So, the ads are compiled, designed and posted / placed in the newspaper, the Internet, on the radio, etc. What next?  As soon as information about the sale has become available to potential buyers, you need to be prepared for the fact that there will be a huge number of calls.  Well, if in the ad you specified what time it is better to call.  It might be worth selling an apartment on vacation.  This time can be fully devoted to the transaction.  Try to pay maximum attention to each client.  The larger the number of people with whom you communicate, the higher the likelihood that housing will be sold in the near future. </p><h2>  How and when to organize a viewing? </h2><p>  Inspecting the apartment is an important step.  Only after the client sees the property in person, he will decide on the transaction.  Is it worth it to sell an apartment if it is not put in order?  We have already raised this question.  Recall again: the lack of repair and proper cleaning will not play in favor of the seller. </p><p>  It should be prepared for the fact that, in addition to potential buyers, realtors will want to visit the apartment.  On the phone, they are most likely not to be presented as such.  But as soon as they cross the threshold of the house, they will immediately begin to offer their services.  You can sell a new apartment without the help of intermediaries.  But if the housing does not have a presentable appearance, and you need to make a deal faster, it makes sense to take the help of specialists. </p><p>  In addition to realtors, those who are used to making money illegally can also come by ad.  Under the guise of potential buyers, bandits enter the house, study the owner‚Äôs behavior, look at what values ‚Äã‚Äãare in the apartment.  If the person who came to see the living space seems suspicious, ask for your passport.  Agree that the buyer took the documents with him, you can still over the phone.  Such a request does not frighten a decent person.  But most of the "fake" buyers will not want to come. </p><p>  It is worth carefully choosing the time to organize viewing.  Ideally, this should be daylight hours.  If you cannot organize a meeting during the day (for example, the client works until late), invite a friend or neighbor.  Thus, you can protect yourself from dubious individuals. </p><p>  Inspecting a room in the dark has its advantages.  If the apartment has flaws, a potential buyer simply may not notice them. </p>

    <h2>  What documents are needed? </h2><p>  If the buyer is ready to complete the purchase and sale transaction, the time has come for paperwork.  It is necessary to put in order the passport of the owner of the apartment and the technical passport of the room, in which the main parameters will be indicated.  It is also impossible to sell an apartment without the consent of the family members registered in it.  The only exceptions are children under 18 years of age.  In addition, such documents will be needed: a certificate of the state of the personal account, an extract from the house book, a copy of the financial and personal account, a certificate from the tax office. </p><p>  The seller and the buyer at the stage of preparing the documentation draw up a preliminary contract.  At the same time, a security deposit is paid for the apartment.  This will guarantee the good faith of the buyer.  Is it worth it now to sell an apartment without collateral - it's hard to decide.  Making all the necessary paperwork is a costly procedure.  However, most certificates are valid for no more than a month.  If the buyer at the last moment refuses the transaction, the money will be wasted.  The deposit is not returned to the buyer. </p>

    <h2>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãan apartment in a mortgage </h2><p>  Any transactions with mortgage real estate can be made only after agreement with the financial institution with which a loan agreement was concluded.  First of all, the seller must obtain the appropriate permission from the bank.  The next step is to determine the exact amount that the homeowner must return to the financial institution.  This is the difference between the total loan amount with interest and the money that the landlord has already managed to pay. </p><p>  Important!  You can sell an apartment in a mortgage only if the potential buyer is aware of the conclusion of an agreement with the bank.  A financial institution issues a special certificate that confirms the legality of the sale of real estate.  And then everything is simple.  The procedure is the same as for the sale of ordinary real estate.  The seller needs to collect all the documents and obtain the consent of the relatives registered in the apartment. </p><h2>  How to sell an apartment if it belongs to several owners? </h2><p>  It is possible to sell a share of the apartment.  Moreover, the deal has a huge number of nuances.  It can not be compared even with the sale of a dorm room or in a <span>communal apartment.</span>  The problem is that determining the boundaries of a share is quite difficult.  The co-owner of the premises can occupy the whole room.  But this does not mean that he is its rightful owner. </p><p>  You can <span>sell a share in the apartment</span> only if the housing is privatized.  In this case, the entire room will have a common personal account.  According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, an apartment that is owned by several people can be sold only with the consent of all of them.  The right to acquire a share is primarily acquired by the co-owner. </p><p>  The wife has the opportunity to sell her husband an apartment or her share.  A deal can be made with an unauthorized buyer only by agreement with the <span>immediate family</span> registered in this housing.  A notification is sent to the owners of the property, which indicates information about the upcoming sale.  If within a month another owner does not make a decision on the acquisition of the sold part, it can be offered to unauthorized persons. </p><p>  Not everyone knows whether it is possible to sell a share of an apartment if minor children live in it.  It is difficult to answer this question.  Each situation is individual.  A decision can be made in a judicial proceeding if the owners cannot agree on the details. </p>

    <h2>  How to draw up a contract of sale? </h2><p>  Before selling an apartment, it is necessary to clarify the correctness of registration of basic documents.  When a buyer is found, this will help to conclude a contract of sale much faster.  This is the main legal document that describes the nuances of the transaction. </p><p>  The main data of the contract include the value of the property, a description of the subject of the transaction.  In addition, it indicates the passport data of the parties, as well as lists the documents that are necessary for the sale of real estate.  If the buyer previously made a deposit, this information is also displayed in the contract.  The main document for the sale of real estate describes the obligations of the parties, their mutual agreements, and also indicates the date of the transaction. </p><p>  The contract of sale is the main document by which money can be transferred.  If cashless payments are made, this must be indicated.  Information is also entered on the financial institution through which the transaction is executed, and the account number. </p><h2>  Crisis - it is also a crisis in Africa </h2><p>  Many today are wondering whether it is worth selling an apartment in 2015?  And this is not surprising.  The economic situation in the country remains unstable.  This affects, first of all, the real estate market.  The question of whether it is worth selling an apartment now does not arise except for those who are going to go abroad.  In this case, real estate must be disposed of as quickly as possible.  Moreover, the cost of housing can be significantly underestimated. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sell a new apartment" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23426/655184.jpg" width="551"></div>  Over the past year, real estate prices rose 10%.  At the same time, the average salary of Russians remained the same.  People have to save significantly in order to accumulate the necessary amount.  This is associated with a decrease in activity in the real estate market.  Experts predict that there will be much less transactions in 2015.  Thus, it is no longer possible to resolve the issue on the principle of ‚Äúexpensively selling an apartment‚Äù.  Secondary housing over the past few months has fallen significantly.  Those who want to sell real estate profitably should wait a few more years.  Analysts hope that the economic situation in the country will stabilize soon.

    <p>  Finally, briefly consider another option.  More and more young families prefer to buy real estate from the developer.  This exacerbates the situation in the <span>secondary market.</span>  You can attract a buyer only with an ideal location and renovation.  In this case, the price of the apartment should be significantly underestimated.  The seller risks losing more than 15% of the real value of housing. </p>
