There are lots of opinions on how to charge them properly.  They provoke a number of questions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet charging" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/331567.jpg" width="600"></div>  Should I wait for the battery to discharge completely?  Or is it better to connect the device to a power source from time to time?  Does charging for the tablet happen the same way as the phone or does it have its own characteristics?

    <h2>  So how right? </h2><p>  Many users believe that it is impossible to bring the battery indicator to a position below 40%, since this can adversely affect the stable operation of the device.  It is better to charge more often.  At the same time, opponents of this group of users are inclined to believe that charging for the tablet should be used only after the device is completely discharged.  At the same time, you should start working on it only after the battery indicator shows 100% charge.  So who is right?  How to operate mobile devices without fear for their safety and stable operation? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="charging for samsung tablet" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/331566.jpg?1391953588660" width="574"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that <span>lithium-ion batteries</span> used in mobile phones and tablets began to be used only a few years ago.  Therefore, today it is extremely difficult to answer the question of what kind of charging for the tablet can extend the battery life.  However, there are still a number of ways, the use of which, according to experienced users, will have the best effect on your mobile device. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  It is recommended to replenish up to 100% of the <span>battery</span> charge all the time <span>.</span>  Do not wait for it to completely discharge and turn off the device.  And in order for you to know exactly the battery life, refer to the special table in which its capacity and maximum number of charges are indicated.  Based on these data, it follows that the most acceptable option is not to bring the battery charge below 40%.  It is not recommended to leave the mobile device connected to the network for a long time, since lithium-ion batteries really do not like recharging, because it significantly reduces their service life.  Watch the time!  Prolonged charging for the tablet is harmful! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="charging for asus tablet" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/331565.jpg?1391953633401" width="300"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, at least once every 30 days, a full (100%) <span>battery charge</span> should be made <span>.</span>  It is possible that this advice may seem somewhat contradictory to you, especially against the background of the above methods, but this is not entirely true.  Following this procedure allows you to calibrate your mobile device.  In the future, this can ensure the correct, highly efficient battery operation. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  In addition, if you want to extend the <span>life of</span> your mobile device, you need to keep it in a cool place for as long as possible.  This is a very important factor, since it is the high temperature on the phone or tablet that negatively affects the battery life.  As you can see from our small material, saving your mobile device and maximizing its life is simple.  You need to follow basic tips.  And then your charging for <span>the Samsung tablet</span> (or any other) will work flawlessly.  In conclusion, I would like to note that they are equally applicable to different manufacturers of mobile equipment.  And this means that it doesn‚Äôt matter what is in your hands: charging for an <span>Asus tablet,</span> Samsung or another device, they perform the same functions, each for their own gadget. </p>
