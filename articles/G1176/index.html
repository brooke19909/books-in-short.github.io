    <h2>  Old owners </h2><p>  In ancient times, until the XVIII century, the territory on which the present Vyritsa (Leningrad Region) is located belonged to Votskaya Pyatina, an administrative-territorial unit used in <span>Novgorod Rus.</span>  The lands between the Volkhov and Luga rivers, of which Orej is a tributary, belonged to this patch of Novgorod land.  During the time of the owners of the village there were many, the last pre-revolutionary owner was His Excellency Prince F. <span>L. Wittgenstein, the</span> son of Stephanie Radziwill, who dominated a huge number of lands in the west of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyritsa Leningrad Region photo" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1109934.jpg" width="600"></div>  The first written references to the current village of Vyritsa (Leningrad Region), and the then Swedish village of Werektca date back to 1676 (map of Ingermandland, or Izhora land, compiled by A. I. Bergenheim).

In 1906, there were plans to create a "garden city" or "ideal city", the concept of which included the unity of maximum urban comfort with nature, which would make human living in it exemplary.  These plans arose after the commissioning of the Tsarskoye Selo railway line, which runs directly through the village of Vyritsa.  The Leningrad Region now has several stops at the Oktyabrskaya Railway (this is the oldest in Russia, the section of this road St. Petersburg - Pavlovsk is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List) - Mikhailovka, Vyritsa, platforms 1, 2, 3 and Poselok. </p><h2>  The largest village of the Leningrad region </h2><p>  Such a number of stopping points is not surprising, since Vyritsa is the largest (occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 square kilometers, in some sources - 50), the village of the Leningrad Region - 12 (sometimes 20) sometimes live and work in it.  The railway line running through the village from the south-west to the north-east stretches 15 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vyritsa of the Leningrad region" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1109936.jpg" width="571"></div>  Along the Gatchina-Shapki motorway, Vyritsa is 7 km away.  In summer, the population of Vyritsa increases several times, since this settlement remains a favorite summer residence for Petersburgers, despite the industrial enterprises available here.  In the 70s of the last century, 4 factories were built here - metalware and the experimental-mechanical, sawmill and weaving factory ‚ÄúUzor‚Äù, the tapestries of which are known and in demand abroad.  For people working at these enterprises, a microdistrict of 8 floors has been built.

The riverine, steep banks reveal red clay, and the old pine trees above them give the area a peculiar charm and make the village of Vyritsa more and more popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyritsa village, Leningrad region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1109937.jpg" width="595"></div>  The Leningrad Region boasts many wonderful recreation areas, such as Komarovo, but Vyritsa is quite in demand.  Here are the summer residences of such famous people as academician D. Likhachev, I. Glazunov and K. Lavrov, V. Bianchi and V. Pikul, M. Svetin and O. Basilashvili.

    <h2>  Famous residents </h2><p>  Vyritsa is also famous for its inhabitants, the most famous of which are the philosopher and paleontologist, science fiction writer Ivan Efremov, the author of the world famous ‚ÄúAndromeda Nebula‚Äù.  The elder Seraphim Vyritsky, glorified in the face of saints and reverends, lived in this village for many years.  His grave became a place of pilgrimage.  Another famous resident of Vyritsa is the composer <span>Isaac Schwartz.</span>  Such an interesting person as the leader of the Christian teetotaler Ivan Churikov brought fame to the village. </p><h2>  There is something to see and something to bow to </h2><p>  In addition, many tourists also go to the village of Vyritsa (Leningrad Oblast).  The sights of this place are known far beyond its borders.  How attractive is the town in this sense? </p><p>  The main attractions include the temple of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God.  Made of wood in a tent style under the guidance of engineer M.V. Krasovsky, it is an architectural monument of the first half of the XX century.  Next to it is the chapel of St.  Seraphim Vyritsky. </p><p>  Another architectural monument of the beginning of the last century is the church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul.  It was built on the donations of parishioners according to the project of architect N.I. Kotovich.  As a result of restoration work, which lasted 13 years, the church received the status of a newly identified cultural heritage site. </p><h2>  Specific objects </h2><p>  Another unique attraction is the village of Vyritsa (Leningrad Oblast).  The photo attached below shows an unusual mansion.  It was built in 1906 for the teetotaler community, which was formed and grew into a rather large sect thanks to Ivan Churikov, who, reading the Gospel aloud, healed people from alcoholism.  Pos.  Vyritsa of the Leningrad Region is also famous for the mansion built in our time (2006).  This is the palace of the Vasilyev brothers, which amazes the imagination with both the layout and decor, and the architectural volumes.  Locals love to watch the owners of the palace, made by the best domestic and Italian craftsmen, arrive by helicopter. </p><h2>  The charm of antiquity and the possibility of access </h2><p>  On the western outskirts of the village, mounds of the 11th-12th centuries were preserved.  Survived to this day and the wonderful Wittgenstein hunting castle, as well as several old cottages erected at the beginning of the last century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyritsa Leningrad region attractions" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1109938.jpg" width="600"></div>  There is a dam of the former hydroelectric power station in the village, which is a place for walking and a kind of attraction.  The easiest way to get here is by train from the Vitebsk station, and from Gatchina you can go by numerous buses, which depart on average in 15 minutes.
