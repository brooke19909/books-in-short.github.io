  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bosch refrigerator, reviews and specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many years, the German company Bosch has been a leader in the domestic market of household appliances.  In stores you can find a washing machine and dishwasher, <span>hob</span> and oven, vacuum cleaner and Bosch refrigerator.  Customer reviews about this technique are the most flattering, often one name serves as a guarantee of quality.  There is an opinion that pedantic Germans are very careful in the production of household appliances, and the manufactured products are carefully monitored.  Therefore, many, despite the high price, buy a Bosch washing machine and refrigerator in the apartment.  Customer reviews indicate that such things take at least 10 years, they are expected from them for a long, trouble-free operation throughout this time.  A refrigerator and a washing machine are not a kettle that can be changed every year, </p><p>  However, among the models of this brand there are options quite affordable for middle-income families.  For example, Bosch KGV33Y37, which is perfect for a single pensioner, student or young couple.  It is not tall (but not quite small), not bulky, very neat, 170 cm high. </p><p>  Why is this <span>Bosch refrigerator</span> good <span>?</span>  <span>Customer reviews</span> indicate that many primarily pay attention to noise and energy consumption.  This is especially true for pensioners who find it difficult to fall asleep to the roar of a running compressor and who seek maximum energy savings.  This model works very quietly and spends electricity at a minimum - only 264 kWh / year.  The refrigerator is two-compartment, it can store both fresh vegetables and fruits, as well as frozen foods and semi-finished products.  At the same time, the freezer has an impressive capacity of 91 liters.  The entire volume is divided into 3 convenient plastic drawers.  In the refrigerator compartment there are three high-impact <span>glass shelves</span> and one large drawer for vegetables.  On the door are three small shelves for storing medicines, eggs, vegetable oil, sauces and juices.  One of them has a bottle holder.  At the top of the refrigerator compartment there is an electronic control panel with an indication of temperatures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, such a Bosch refrigerator, customer reviews confirm this, is a convenient, practical and economical option. </p><p>  The option is more expensive - <span>Bosch KGV36XL20.</span>  Its main difference from the previous model is the volume.  If the freezer is practically no different (the difference of 4 liters can hardly be called significant), then the refrigerator compartment is almost 50% more.  Accordingly, this refrigerator created by Bosch is 185 cm higher. Another significant difference is color.  If white is considered universal, then silver is more stylish and modern, although, of course, it only suits the corresponding interior.  Once the size has changed, the equipment has also changed.  One shelf was added in the refrigerator compartment - in this model there are already not three, but 4. There is a convenient hanging shelf for storing two bottles and hanging containers for slicing.  However, you can store anything in them - yogurts, herbs, fruits or even canned goods.  The Bosch KGV36XL20 refrigerator is as economical as similar models of this brand. </p><p>  In general, this brand can be assessed as practical and reliable.  Few regrets subsequently that they purchased a refrigerator manufactured by Bosch.  Owner reviews indicate that rather the opposite.  Once having bought the equipment of this brand, a person becomes its adherent. </p><p>  True, there are also disadvantages.  The fact is that manufacturers pay more attention to reliability than appearance, therefore, refrigerators and washing machines are very simple in appearance.  No beautiful displays, elegant pens or unusual design, everything is very restrained and practical.  The same applies to functions - only the minimum necessary for the consumer, especially when it comes to mid-range models. </p>
