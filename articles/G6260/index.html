  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choose an air conditioner and make no mistake</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Air conditioning has become a very popular device in a number of regions of Russia, the infamous summer of 2010, when high temperatures were set in some regions and forests burned.  In Moscow, then lines were formed for their purchase and installation, so it may make sense to purchase this useful unit.  And how to choose it - we will tell. </p><p>  If there is a need to choose an air conditioner, then you need to start with the parameters of the room that it will serve.  It is one thing if it is a small room, and absolutely another - if you need a device for a restaurant, a large hall or industrial premises.  It is also important to have permission to carry out installation work on the <span>facade of the building</span> and in the interior, because without it the range of models that can be installed is narrowed significantly. </p><p>  In the absence of installation restrictions (they may be present, for example, due to the building's belonging to architectural monuments), you can choose an air conditioner from an extensive line of split systems that have two units - external and internal.  When choosing a model, you need to proceed from the fact that 1 kW <span>of air conditioning power</span> in cooling mode will serve 10 square meters well.  square meters with a ceiling height of up to three meters.  And for heating a room up to 25 square meters.  meters suitable devices with a power of 1.7-2.4 kW. </p><p>  Note that not every air conditioner can work for heating at a negative external temperature, so you need to approximately represent the temperature regime in your region and buy suitable all-weather models (they are usually more expensive). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who select equipment for large spaces, the question of how to choose an air conditioner arises not only in connection with its required power, but also with a suitable configuration, because it is not always possible to hang the entire facade of a building with rows of split systems.  In this case, cassette and channel air conditioners come to the rescue, which are one external unit connected by air ducts or communications with several indoor units.  Such systems are mounted under the ceiling and closed with special grilles and panels, they are quite expensive and are carried out only with the help of professionals, often at the stage of building construction. </p><p>  The remaining characteristics of the proposed devices are very diverse, so you can choose an air conditioner for every taste.  For example, almost all models are equipped with a remote control, some have deodorizing filters, others have additional filters, plasma filters and anion generators.  Some devices work with <span>air drainage,</span> many organize <span>forced ventilation.</span>  Each model is characterized by a certain <span>noise level,</span> one or another refrigerant used in it, and the minimum and maximum temperature supported.  Advanced models have a built-in motion sensor that allows the air conditioner to turn on only when there are people in the room. </p><p>  For numerous tenants of residential and commercial premises, manufacturers offer mobile air conditioners, many of which do not require additional installation and can be easily transported from one building to another when moving.  If you don‚Äôt know how to choose a mobile air conditioner, we recommend starting with a search for the hole in the window (wall) where the flexible hose for the outlet of heated air will be supplied, because this is the only thing that is required for the mobile air conditioner to work.  Further, it makes sense to pay attention to the dimensions of the device, its maximum noise level (it can be higher than that of a split system).  Otherwise, a <span>mobile air conditioner</span> has the same list of different characteristics as stationary systems, and you can choose an air conditioner of one configuration or another depending on individual preferences. </p>
