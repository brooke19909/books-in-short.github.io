This is an ancient art, with the help of which you can make any figure of any size out of paper, and sometimes make it move (for example, you can make a frog out of colored paper, which will jump when pressed).  So, let's move on to <span>making paper claws.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Method one: without glue and scissors</strong> </p><p>  Firstly, do not think that such claws will fall apart immediately, since they are not glued together!  You just need to correctly wrap the tips of the paper inside the claw, then it will retain its shape and will hold well on the fingers.  To make it clearer how to make a claw out of paper, the procedure for working with the sheet is painted in the form of sub-items, which should be followed one after another in the same sequence in which they are indicated. </p><ol><li>  Take a square sheet so that its tips look up and down, that is, so that a sheet of paper appears as a rhombus. </li><li>  Make a bag out of a piece, and when you make it, try on the finger on which you plan to put the claw.  In other words, at this stage you are making the base of the claw, which is a cone at the base of which your finger enters. </li><li>  Gently bend the protruding tips, securing them and simultaneously supporting the claw so that it does not lose its shape.  If you do everything right, the claw will not fall apart and will sit well on the finger. </li></ol><p>  By the way, this method is good for those who have experience in making such claws, since the first time few people manage to do them properly, training is needed here.  An interesting fact: in this way in America on the feast of <span>all saints (Halloween),</span> children make claws on their fingers, decorating them (or simply hanging them around the neck). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Method two: glue + scissors</strong> </p><p>  This method is great for those who make claws for the first time or simply do not understand how to make claws out of paper without using glue and scissors.  This method is distinguished by its unique simplicity: in ten to fifteen minutes of work, you can make claws on all fingers.  For this method you will need: sheets of paper, the number of which coincides with the number of planned claws, scissors (they should be sharp enough, so do not take those that ‚Äúchew‚Äù the paper) and good quality glue stick (not one that smears thick layers or even flow).  So, let's begin. </p><ul><li>  Fold a cone from a piece of paper that can easily be put on your finger, but will not fall down. </li><li>  The tips that protrude from the base should be carefully cut with scissors. </li><li>  Glue the claw so that all the glue is under a layer of paper, as it will stick and collect fine dirt and dust on itself, and this will ruin the overall appearance of the claw. </li><li>  Do all of the above as many times as you want to have claws. </li></ul><p>  Tip: if you have a desire to paint the claws, then wait for the glue to dry on them, because the paint will ‚Äúfloat‚Äù where there is a layer of glue. </p><p>  <strong>The third method: without scissors, but with glue</strong> </p><p>  Such claws are distinguished by a special strength, since they are fastened not only by glue, but by tips bent inward.  Before you make claws out of paper, make sure that the glue is of good quality and will not spoil the work. </p><ul><li>  Make a small cone out of a piece of paper, try putting it on your finger. </li><li>  Glue paper joints with glue. </li><li>  Bend the corners sticking out at the base and glue them so that they do not interfere. </li></ul><p>  Tip: do not put the claws made on the fingers until the glue has completely dried out, since when you start to remove the claw from the finger, it will deform. </p><p>  If you do everything right, then your claws will be neat and will not fall off your fingers.  If you have a desire to decorate the claws, you can color them, wrap them with colored threads or braid them with wire with beads.  Choose any way you like to make paper claws, and get to work! </p>
