    <p>  But it is best to use the Sberbank-Online service: ‚ÄúPayments and Transfers‚Äù - ‚ÄúTaxes and Penalties‚Äù - ‚ÄúSearch and Payment‚Äù - enter the decree data (number, date) - pay off the debt.  The advantages of the service have already been appreciated by hundreds of thousands of Russians.  He not only quickly transfers funds, but also independently searches for arrears according to the entered details.  Here's how to pay traffic fines.  Commission: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank Online: 1-3%. </li><li>  Cashier - at least 30 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  SMS </h2><p>  How else can you pay fines quickly?  Without commission, this will not work.  But if a person has absolutely no time or opportunity to contact a bank branch or use the Internet, then he can pay off the debt using an SMS message.  This is the most affordable, convenient, but at the same time expensive way.  The commission will be 5-10% of the payment amount.  Yes, and you won‚Äôt be able to print the receipt.  Another drawback.  This method of debt repayment is available only to residents of Moscow who are registered on the site of the Unified Mobile Platform.  To perform this operation, you need to send SMS to the number 7377 with the text "servicereg".  You can find out about the presence of unpaid fines by completing the following request: ‚Äúfine series and vehicle registration certificate number‚Äù.  In the case of unpaid debt, 2 messages will come to the user's phone: one with a notification, the second with a proposal to pay off the amount.  Residents of other areas can use the similar moishtrafi service.  It is necessary to send SMS to number 9112 with the following content: ‚Äúpay for   Petrov V. I.‚Äù, where: </p><ul><li>   - amount; </li><li>  UUUUUUUUUUU - number of the decision; </li><li>  Petrov V.I. - F.I.O.  payer. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="penalties without commission" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/759285.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Receipt </h2><p>  It is best to pay arrears through a bank or terminal.  In this case, the client will always be able to print a receipt, which confirms the fact of repayment of the debt.  This paper should be stored for at least another year after the operation, as traffic police often require repayment of the debt.  Although in this case it all depends on the person.  Someone will prefer to take risks and save money by paying off debts through payment systems with a minimum commission, but without a receipt.  If the amount of the fine is small, then an additional 30 rubles of costs are immediately felt.  Then it‚Äôs better to use Internet banking, pay the debt with a lower commission, save, and then print the receipt. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are many options for paying traffic fines.  It is impossible to repay the debt without a commission.  Although the police and banks create common services for receiving payments, only clients of a certain lending institution can use them on preferential terms.  You can pay off the debt through the bank‚Äôs cash desk, but in this case you have to stand in line and pay a large commission.  The remuneration of most Internet services is not much different from that of a financial institution.  Therefore, in order not to waste time, it is better to use the services of payment systems or the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù of Sberbank. </p>
