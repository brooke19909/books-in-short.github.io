    <h2>  The cost of bath entertainment </h2><p>  Each guest is interested in how much will be required to visit Gostiny Dvor (Kokhma).  Sauna, the price of which is quite low, is a pleasant addition to the rest of the range of services.  Price - 2800 rubles, the time of entry lasts 1 h 45 min.  Children under 7 years old attend the complex for free.  Of course, additionally count on the drinks that you will order.  If you are hungry, then you can order lunch from the restaurant. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists </h2><p>  We analyzed hundreds of reviews and came to the conclusion that we could not help but like it here.  Without exception, everyone notes that this is a very cozy small hotel, which is located close to the city.  Everywhere is very clean, cleaning is done every day.  Many people notice that the staff here is very attentive and caring.  Floor attendants are just wonderful women.  Pleases with excellent cuisine, the presence of a sauna and billiards. </p><p>  The only negative is the modest sound insulation.  Weddings are often celebrated here, and music thunders until the morning.  Of course, those who came just to sleep do not really like this.  But as they say, these are costs. </p><p>  By the way, about weddings and anniversaries.  They are just magical here.  At first glance, young people like a beautiful facade with lighting and an original courtyard, ideal for photographs.  And the hall is exactly what you can only dream of.  High ceilings, mirror design, stylish design and stunning lighting - all this creates a festive atmosphere, as if in a club. </p><p>  But this is only external paraphernalia.  Your guests will find a chic table setting and dishes, excellent cuisine and excellent service.  All the waiters are in uniforms.  For young people, a room with a large bathtub and a jacuzzi is provided as a gift. </p>
