    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  <span>Huawei Ascend P8</span> looks pretty expensive and nice.  Plastic was used as the material, but the device received a metal edging.  The case type is monolithic, the back cover is non-removable, so changing the battery here will not work.  In this regard, the slots for memory cards and SIM cards are located on the side of the phone.  One tray is designed exclusively for SIM cards, the second is a combined one, therefore it accepts both SIM cards and flash drives.  For some, this may turn out to be a drawback, as users will have to choose between using two SIM cards at once or expanding the memory via a flash drive. </p><p>  The display, which occupies almost the entire front panel, has noticeable frames.  They didn‚Äôt turn out to be very large, but from an aesthetic point of view they do not look particularly pleasant.  There is only one speaker: it is located at the bottom of the smartphone.  This decision of the developers can be called successful, because in those cases when the device is lying on the plane, the speaker is not covered by anything, so the sound of the signal is always clearly audible.  At first glance, it seems that there are two speakers in the smartphone, since there is a hole parallel to the first, which strongly resembles an additional speaker.  In reality, this is just a microphone - such a small snag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of the Huawei Ascend P8 is magnificent: it does not creak or play.  The gadget is convenient to use and store it in your pocket, and an attractive, strict appearance will emphasize the status of the owner of the device. </p><p>  The overall dimensions of the device are 143x70x7.7, weight - 131 grams. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Display sizes - 5 inches with a resolution of 720p.  The pixel density is 294 ppi.  The screen was developed using IPS-matrix and it looks quite worthy.  The colors are saturated, the viewing angles are not perfect, but still they can not be called a drawback.  In bright light, the information is discernible, so it is convenient to use a smartphone even in direct sunlight. </p><p>  The sensor turned out to be quite smart and responds well to touch.  Scrolling through menu items is a pleasure: nothing slows down and there are no delays.  An interesting feature of the phone: now it‚Äôs possible to unlock the screen by double-tapping the display ‚Äî no more swipes and inputs of various combinations. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that 5 inches is already a fairly decent size of the display, under which you need to put Full HD.  720p looks decent here, but still the picture is not perfect, and it is clear that for such a diagonal, simple HD is no longer enough.  The pixels are almost invisible when used, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it, but I want to see a clearer and higher quality image, say, when watching a movie in high resolution or when playing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  As the platform, Android 5.0 (Lollipop) was chosen.  The model is equipped with an eight-core processor Hisilicon Kirin 620, operating at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The gadget has 2 GB of RAM and a quad-core graphics accelerator ARM Mali-T628.  16 GB are available for data storage, which are expandable using micro-SD memory cards.  Huawei Ascend P8 Lite accepts flash drives up to 128 GB.  From the interfaces there are: Wi-Fi 802.11, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, NFC, IrDA and micro-USB. </p>

    <p>  The processor in the Huawei Ascend P8 16Gb is quite good, only the core frequency would be slightly increased for complete delight.  2 GB of RAM is a fairly standard figure for phones of a similar price segment: after all, 3 GB is usually put in more expensive devices.  The generous amount of memory for data storage - 16 GB - is available, which is available by default.  If they are not enough, then it will be possible to install a flash drive up to 128 GB in the gadget, but, as mentioned above, in this situation, the use of two SIM cards simultaneously becomes impossible. </p><h2>  application </h2><p>  In AnTuTu, Huawei Ascend P8 showed very good results, surpassing many competitors.  This was facilitated by the 64-bit architecture, which allows the smartphone to work smartly and without any errors.  Most modern applications are comfortably used on this device.  Of course, in some cases the lack of RAM is quite noticeable, but in general, the system does not cause any complaints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Games </h2><p>  A good filling allows you to run very beautiful and powerful games on the Huawei Ascend P8 Lite.  Enjoying the gameplay on the device is a pleasure: applications are loaded quickly and work fine.  Of course, you won‚Äôt be able to play in the most top-end projects at maximum graphics settings without lags, but we remind you that for all its merits, the model is still not a flagship capable of launching anything. </p>

    <p>  When using games on the Huawei Ascend P8 Lite Dual, a slight flaw is revealed: when the phone is flipped to a horizontal position, the palm of his right hand rests exactly on the speaker, muffling it somewhat.  Given that most toys are adapted specifically for the horizontal position of gadgets, some problems with the volume of melodies may arise.  Perhaps for some this aspect is not critical at all. </p><h2>  Main camera </h2><p>  The main camera of Huawei Ascend P8 Dual has in its asset 13 megapixels, autofocus and LED flash.  With sufficient lighting, for example, during a daytime shooting on the street, optics produce a very decent image quality: there is practically no noise, the detail of the objects is good, and the color rendering is normal.  With artificial lighting, the camera behaves no worse.  We note excellent detail when shooting near objects.  But the less light, the more the quality of the photos falls.  Detailing begins to limp, noise appears in the image (this is especially noticeable on black and dark objects) and other negative factors appear.  The flash, although not bad, is not outstanding, so you should not expect good quality in poor lighting conditions or when shooting at night. </p><p>  There is nothing much to say about the functionality of the cameras, since the present set of options is quite typical for most devices.  There are various filters, panorama, HDR option, perfectly coping with its work, and other ordinary functions.  It is also worth noting that the gadget is capable of shooting videos with a <span>resolution of 1080p.</span>  The developers obviously did not focus on the rich settings for camera effects. </p><h2>  Front-camera </h2><p>  The front camera of the Huawei Ascend P8 Black is great for taking selfies.  Optics takes photos with a maximum resolution of 5 megapixels.  This is enough to achieve a good image and put it on a social network or just add it to your gallery.  The front camera is endowed with one very interesting function - a mirror.  Not only will this smartphone be able to be used as a full-fledged mirror when this option is activated, this function also has various additional effects.  For example, if we click on the screen, artificial cracks will spread across the mirror, and when we move to the microphone‚Äôs area, the screen will fog up like real glass, and with the help of swipe it will be possible to wipe it like a fogged mirror in a bathroom or a window on a frosty day . </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Although there is only one speaker, it produces an amazing sound, especially in films and games.  However, we have previously discussed the location of the sound hole: in one case it is a plus - the speaker does not pinched when the phone is in a lying position, and in the other it is a minus, because during the game the hole for sound covers the palm.  When watching a movie, you can easily take a smartphone in such a way that your hand does not cover the speaker, and therefore you can enjoy melodies from your favorite movies with amazing effects with pleasure.  Speaking of volume, we note that it is here above the average level. </p><p>  The smartphone can be used as an mp3 player and listen to songs through a headset.  The standard headphones supplied, obviously leave much to be desired, so for a greater effect it is recommended to purchase a headset more expensive, better vacuum, then the quality of the music of the gadget will pleasantly surprise. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Huawei Ascend P8 Dual Sim has a non-removable 2200 mAh battery.  In talk mode, the battery will last up to 20 hours, in standby mode - up to 500. Very decent performance, given the relatively small battery capacity.  Of course, the resolution, which is usual HD, had a great influence on the long work.  With moderate use, the device may well be enough for 1.5-2 days of autonomous use.  With active listening to tracks, using the Internet and watching movies, this figure will decrease by one and a half, or even two times. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before us is a good device with an attractive and high-quality case, a good screen, an eight-core processor and a loud speaker.  Among the minuses, we highlight the lack of Full HD resolution, the small frequency of each processor core and, perhaps, the price, which starts at 13,990 rubles - the bar is clearly somewhat overstated.  The phone did not demonstrate anything truly amazing and proved to be more like a middle peasant than a device close to the flagships.  Of course, the presence of 4G and NFC, a large display, compact sizes and other advantages of the device cannot but rejoice, but still, in some places, the developers, frankly, did not hold out. </p>

    <h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Using Huawei Ascend P8 Lite Dual White is convenient for almost everyone: it is noted for its lightness and practicality.  Those who are uncomfortable using the device with two hands, use the option of one hand, which somewhat simplifies the work.  Everyone praises the design of the model: the owners believe that here the Chinese have done an excellent job. </p><p>  The screen in the majority received quite positive reviews, but not without drawbacks.  Viewing angles greatly distort color reproduction, also the resolution is only 720p, and for many this is a critical drawback.  Advantages are bright and saturated colors, good multitouch performance and a nice device interface.  There were no problems with using the sensor among users. </p><p>  The camera has received mostly criticism rather than praise.  The quality of the shooting does not live up to expectations, the functionality is not rich, and at night the flash poorly illuminates photographed objects.  It is also noted that pictures taken in low light conditions have a lot of noise and some blur.  There were, however, those users who were satisfied with the optics of the device and noted a decent macro and autofocus. </p><p>  As it turned out, most owners who already have a Huawei Ascend P8 smartphone have enough of the technical specifications that the developer offers.  The system‚Äôs fast and high-quality operation is noted: it doesn‚Äôt glitch and freezes, and the smartphone does a great job with games and applications. </p>

    <p>  The battery, according to customers, is one of the most significant shortcomings of the device.  The charge is sometimes not enough even for a day.  Especially the battery quickly ‚Äúmelts‚Äù in the operation mode of LTE networks.  Switching to a 2G network somewhat corrects the situation, but not by much. </p><p>  The owners of the device rated the sound excellently and repeatedly praised the volume and clarity of the speaker.  A decent quality of music in the headphones was also noted, due to which the device replaced the player by many. </p>
