    <h2>  Appearance is always misleading </h2><p>  In pursuit of the goal of acquiring an inexpensive and compact camera on the market, customers constantly forget about quality.  For this reason, owners are not always satisfied with their digital devices and are faced with the choice of a SLR device.  But the situation can be corrected by initially giving preference to a gadget with a large and high-quality matrix. </p><p>  There are not many devices on the market that combine high quality and compact sizes, for example, the Sony Cyber ​​Shot DSC RX series camera.  These devices use a 13.2x8.8 mm matrix.  For comparison: for all other “soap dishes” this parameter is 2-3 times less.  As for the comparison with the “DSLRs,” the Sony matrix is ​​exactly 4 times smaller than the budget SLR camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  It's time to meet the sales leaders </h2><p>  This is not to say that the main characteristic of the Sony Cyber ​​Shot RX series camera is the <span>size of the matrix.</span>  It refers more to the basic parameters that determine the purpose of the device - for travel and creativity.  One of the main criteria of this device is high photosensitivity with low noise figures.  Unlike a SLR camera, which has a larger matrix size, a Sony representative has a smaller <span>focal length,</span> and, accordingly, allows the electronics to receive more light. </p>

    <p>  A sturdy aluminum case and compact dimensions reduce the risk of damage during transportation, and low weight will be only a plus.  Focusing is performed at 25 points and multi-zone exposure metering is supported.  In their reviews, many users compare Sony's RX models with SLR cameras, which have similar functionality but are more weighty and overpriced. </p><h2>  Unique segment </h2><p>  Protected from shock, dust and moisture, cameras always find their customers in the digital device market.  Indeed, in addition to functionality and portability, many are attracted by the possibility of shooting in extreme conditions.  The compact Sony Cyber ​​Shot TX30 camera has a rather attractive price (15-17 thousand rubles), so it is not surprising that he quickly found his owners in the world market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Let the appearance of the device not bother the potential buyer - as practice shows, Sony technologists were able to once again surprise their fans.  A wide-angle matrix (7.76 mm), high-aperture optics with a focal length of 4.7-23.5 mm, the availability of serial shooting and the possibility of macro photography make this gadget unique in the class of compact devices.  Do not forget that the case protected from shock, dust and moisture only protects the camera from accidental and short-term effects of an aggressive environment, and does not allow you to be comfortable in it. </p><h2>  The device for creativity </h2><p>  Many potential buyers believe that the Sony Cyber ​​Shot camera - in a small case with light weight - is not capable of much, because it has a small matrix.  There is some truth in this, but when it comes to shooting landscapes and objects for creativity, the matrix parameters are not as important as the lens.  Ultrathin devices come with Carl Zeiss optics.  All owners of Sony smartphones are already familiar with this name, because over the past decade, no company has been able to exceed the quality of shooting from a smartphone that Sony is capable of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Quite interestingly, the technologists of the manufacturer came up with the functionality of the camera.  It is equipped not only with an omnivorous card reader, which understands many different formats of memory cards, but also with wireless technologies (Wi-Fi and NFC).  Do not forget about the manual control of shutter speed and aperture, as it is implemented in the "DSLRs", and the possibility of shooting video in FullHD format. </p><h2>  Fight for survival </h2><p>  The Sony Cyber ​​Shot W800 digital camera is considered the cheapest product on the world market from a well-known Japanese manufacturer (7,000 rubles).  Judging by the reviews of the owners, its low cost is the main and only advantage in the budget class.  All other characteristics of the device are only negative, because the manufacturer, in pursuit of megapixels, could not provide the device with decent optics. </p>

    <p>  The small size of the matrix, large focus and low aperture simply disqualified the gadget in the market of portable digital devices.  True, the owners found a way out of the situation - in their reviews, they recommend reducing the quality of shooting to 8.1 megapixels, choose an exposure so that the light source is behind, and try to hold the camera firmly with both hands while releasing the shutter. </p><h2>  Between heaven and earth </h2><p>  Modification DSC-H7 - Sony Cyber ​​Shot camera, reviews of which literally filled the media.  The fact is that this particular model does not apply to any segment existing on the digital device market.  On the one hand, the device is lightweight and compact - with a special desire it can be carried even in your pocket.  But management and appearance suggest that it belongs to the creative class.  A great functionality, a huge lens and a decent fast aperture matrix, generally places the gadget in the entry-level DSLR segment. </p><p>  Many owners consider this camera to be the pride of a manufacturer who, having departed from the norms and rules dictated by the market, made such an interesting symbiosis.  Photography?  Please: full manual control, plot selection, special effects, ultrasound.  Need a video?  There is no alternative on the market: FullHD with a high frame rate, auto focus tracking, night shooting, stabilizer.  Made to last. </p><h2>  Features of a complete set of digital devices </h2><p>  Advertising of the last decade: “This is not a dream - this is Sony” is quite justified, because, in addition to a high-quality product, the buyer receives a two-year warranty on all digital devices and a complete set of accessories that will be useful to any photographer.  In the box for any Sony gadget, the user will always find not only the device and instructions, but also a cover, a wrist strap and many interface cables that can be useful when working with photos. </p>

    <p>  A very interesting instruction from the manufacturer, which will tell the owner not only about the characteristics and functionality of the device, but also provide a complete algorithm on <span>how to set up a</span> Sony Cyber ​​Shot <span>camera</span> .  This approach to a potential buyer was appreciated by all newcomers who purchase a digital device for the first time. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the positive impressions associated with the ease of use, functionality and compactness of the digital devices of the Japanese company, negative reviews about Sony products can also be found in the media.  Although their percentage is not so large, but, as practice shows, everyone has one problem - the lack of sharpness in the obtained images.  Yes, the Sony Cyber ​​Shot sometimes misses with choosing the right exposure.  And such a problem arises only when manually setting the shutter speed or aperture size. </p>

    <p>  Professionals recommend that all owners of cameras from this manufacturer learn how to choose the right exposure, because “blurred” photographs are the result of inept actions by a user who, in pursuit of the light, forgets about other, equally important parameters. </p><h2>  Review Results </h2><p>  The conclusion on digital technology presented by Japanese experts suggests itself.  The Sony Cyber ​​Shot is the best gadget in the segment of similar devices in the world market.  Technologists of the company managed to do the impossible - to combine high quality, functionality, new technologies, convenience and external beauty in one product, presenting it on the shelves of the store at a very attractive price. </p><p>  As for the cheapest representative of the company in the market of compact digital devices, the conclusion is quite obvious - the Sony brand does not know how to create low-quality products, respectively, fans should not look for a decent camera in the lower price category of the budget segment. </p>
