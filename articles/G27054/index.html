And not all good projects appear on access on tablets with phones.  There are still some similar entertainments, and a list of the most worthy users can be found in this article. </p><h2>  The list of games ports from sixth to first place </h2><ol><li>  Botanicula; </li><li>  Hearthstone; </li><li>  XCOM: Enemy Within; </li><li>  Valiant Hearts: The Great War; </li><li>  Minecraft </li><li>  Goat Simulator. </li></ol><h2>  Great quest </h2><p>  Among the best ports of games from a PC to Android, it is necessary to note a project called Botanicula.  The player is given the opportunity to manage a company of friends: Acorn, Tuber and other characters of this kind.  They decide to explore their universe, which for them does not go beyond a tall tree. </p><p>  A group of heroes begins their journey near the roots.  Purpose: to get out to the highest branches.  Their path began due to the fact that evil black blots invaded the world.  From time to time they disturb residents with their raids, as a result of which they suck out his life from each inhabitant of the tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bonusweb.idnes.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="game ports" class="if uuid-2250401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2250401.jpg"></div><p>  Interventors should be punished, and for this purpose the team is moving towards adventure.  This is a fable about how people kill the environment, embellished with many simple puzzles with a rather unusual atmosphere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Card strategy </h2><p>  If we consider the best ports of games from a PC to Android, then it is simply impossible not to mention Hearthstone.  The project was released back in 2014 and is now the official e-sports discipline.  Millions of fans around the world play it, delightedly immersed in a pleasant atmosphere. </p><p>  The essence of the project is that the player can choose one of nine characters, form his own deck of cards in the amount of thirty pieces and start a battle with the enemy.  Cards can be creatures, spells, or other specific actions with their own unique effects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best ports pc games for android" class="if uuid-2250404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2250404.jpg"></div><p>  The player's task is to build tactics on the field so as to outsmart the opponent.  Each character has thirty health units and one unique skill.  During the existence of the project, an incredibly large number of various strategies for the game were invented.  The user only needs to download it, which can be done completely free of charge and begin immersion in the universe, where the well-known heroes of the World of Warcraft live. </p><h2>  Step by Step Actions </h2><p>  On many sites, including w3bsit3-dns.com, the ports of games from PC to Android include the ingenious project XCOM: Enemy Within, which deserves to be on the list of the best.  It should have been an addition, but the story turned out to be too big and original, and therefore it is considered a separate part of the franchise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this project, the authors of the original series completely updated the gameplay, tactical actions, added new scenarios and much more.  The developers tried to make the line get a second wind, and they succeeded.  Interaction with the outside world has become much wider, and modifications of their own soldiers will please any user. </p><p>  The player can use one of the ten proposed tactical paths in the battle, which creates a vibrant atmosphere.  Create cyborgs from your fighters to destroy everyone with a frontal attack, which also takes place.  The project is highly recommended for fans of tactical turn-based strategies, where you need to think a lot about further actions. </p><h2>  Not just a platformer </h2><p>  If even the best ports of games from a PC to Android do not strike the user's attention, then you should try Valiant Hearts: The Great War, so that the opinion changes dramatically.  This is an incredibly deep story about how war can break people's lives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="store.steampowered.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ports of games from pc to android list" class="if uuid-2250407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2250407.jpg"></div><p>  The plot tells the story of several characters from different countries who were scattered around the barricades during the First World War.  During the passage, a person will discover for himself the fullness of simple human truths about kindness and morality. </p><p>  The gameplay will offer a number of simple puzzles that cheerfully pass almost non-stop.  The graphics are in a drawn style, but this only emphasizes the atmosphere.  Another important plus is the narrative from several persons, which is then organically intertwined. </p><p>  The project should occupy first places in the category of the best ports of games from a PC to Android, since users cannot even find anything close to similar. </p><h2>  New legend </h2><p>  No one will deny the fact that the Minecraft project has become simply incredibly popular among the younger generation.  Children are ready to sit in it for days and nights, and thanks to this fact, he deserves his place among the best games ported from a PC to Android. </p><p>  This simulator offers the user to plunge into a pixel, randomly generated world where you can develop your imagination to incredible limits.  Thanks to an unlimited number of resources, the player will be able to build the most unusual structures inside the world - restrictions only in the ways of implementation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blamelessgame.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PC game ports on Android w3bsit3-dns.com" class="if uuid-2250410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2250410.jpg"></div><p>  Already in the first days after the release, the fans showed castles built by themselves, entire space stations, settlements, buildings from famous films and much more.  Since the release, the game has gained such popularity that it has made the creator of Marcus Persson a billionaire. </p><p>  That's what a brilliant idea in a simple shell is worth.  It is worth noting from the minuses that not all features are implemented in the mobile version, but even without it, it deserves attention. </p><h2>  Real madness </h2><p>  For fun entertainment, the Goat Simulator should be listed in the list of game ports from PC to Android.  This project offers each user to take on the role of a goat who travels freely around the city. </p><p>  Surrounding conditions create an atmosphere that encourages residents to do their best.  On the street they can be licked up, jumped onto a lamppost, and from there fly into a crowd of citizens, shoot down fire cranes and the like.  The simulator offers free travel around the world with no restrictions in action. </p><div class="photo" data-original="store.playstation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="games ported from pc to android" class="if uuid-2250411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2250411.jpg"></div><p>  The plot was not added here, because such an animal cannot have any goals.  Instead, developers have introduced a point system for a wide variety of actions.  In a special section, your achievements can be compared with the successes of other users, which causes a spirit of healthy confrontation. </p><p>  For relaxation and rest after a hard working day, “Goat Simulator” will be the most suitable game.  Passing by such a sandbox is not recommended to fans of this genre, especially those who want to feel exotic adventures in a big metropolis. </p>
