    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Panorama Hotel is located in Marmaris (Armutallan region), in a rather secluded place, among beautiful nature, on a small hill.  The central part, where all the entertainment places are concentrated, is located at a short distance - 4 km from the hotel.  The nearest beach can be found three kilometers from the Panorama Hotel, which is quite inconvenient for those tourists who prefer to relax on the sea coast, under the sun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  This place offers very comfortable holiday apartments, of which there are a total of 104. All of them are located in one building.  The fund does not provide for their division into different categories, so they are all presented in one form.  Each room is a separate room, fully equipped with furniture necessary for a comfortable stay, with a bathroom combined with a bathroom.  There is also a sink, and there are also several shelves that store bathrobes, towels and bath accessories for each guest. </p><p>  The high level of comfort of the guests is achieved due to the climate equipment installed in the rooms in the form of modern air conditioners.  With their help, tourists can independently adjust the desired temperature in the room, based on their wishes. </p>

    <h2>  Aquazone </h2><p>  The reviews of hotel guests say that they spend a huge amount of time within the aquazone.  This is primarily due to the distant location of the Grand Panorama Hotel (Marmaris) from the sea.  The aquazone is a combination of a large sun terrace and a swimming pool with clear water. </p><p>  On the terrace there is everything that is necessary for guests to relax: sun loungers, umbrellas, towels and air mattresses.  In addition, it has a bar, which offers very popular bright cocktails.  In the very center of the terrace is a pool of 110 sq.m.  It is equipped with one slide, on which vacationers can have fun frolic.  Water here is heated only under the influence of sunlight, and is purified thanks to an automated system. </p>
