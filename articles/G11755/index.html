Material support may be required by relatives (for example, children studying in another city or living far away parents, friends). </p><p>  Cashless payments are often used in work activities (additional expenses during a business trip, etc.) and in everyday life.  Finding a way to transfer money, especially without a commission, is quite relevant today.  Each person wants to carry out a similar financial transaction with minimal expenses, and, best of all, for free. </p><p>  How to transfer money without a commission is interesting to many. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rappler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money without commission" class="if uuid-3128108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128108.jpg"></div><h2>  How to transfer? </h2><p>  At the moment, there are various ways of transferring money, and all of them can be used in certain situations.  The choice of option depends on certain factors: </p><ol><li>  Commission fee: various services charge a certain amount of money for their own services. </li><li>  The presence of a plastic card: the terms of transfers on cards of even the same bank are not always free.  For example, Sberbank takes commission money for transferring funds to another city.  And transferring money between plastic cards of different banks can be quite an expensive service. </li><li>  Convenience: in most cases, a more affordable translation option is selected. </li><li>  Terms of transfer: in certain cases, it is necessary to immediately transfer funds, and some transfer options can take quite a while (through the Russian Post, the maximum transfer time is 14 days). </li></ol><p>  These are the main parameters that bank customers who want to transfer money are guided by.  Without a commission, such an operation without using plastic cards is almost impossible.  And in some cases, even having a plastic card from one bank cannot solve the issue of free transfer to other cities (for example, Sberbank cards). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So.  You can transfer money to a Sberbank card without a commission exclusively between cities in the same region of residence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money from your phone without commission" class="if uuid-3128121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128121.jpg"></div><h2>  Money Transfer Methods </h2><p>  So.

How to transfer money without commission?  The answer is simple.  Such a transfer option is usually available to customers of one banking institution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most financial institutions allow their customers to conduct such operations without commission (for example, between plastic cards of one holder or transferring money to other customers).  However, such a provision is not mandatory.  And absolutely all banks can set their own commissions and rules. </p><p>  How to transfer money without commission at Sberbank? </p><p>  This rule works here.  Transfers made between the customers of this bank within the same region are carried out without withdrawing commissions.  If the transfer needs to be made to a client of Sberbank in another region, a certain commission will have to be paid for such an operation. </p><p>  If you need to transfer money in one region, this is quite simple.  By means of the Mobile Bank application.  A convenient translation system is provided here, without commission.  It is enough to know the current account, where to transfer the money, or the phone number of the client who needs this transfer, if this number is linked to a bank card. </p><h2>  Transaction through Russian Post </h2><p>  Russian Post offers the services of using the CyberMoney service.  The advantage of this method can be considered accessibility (there are many branches of the Russian Post in different regions of the Russian Federation).  The main disadvantage of this method is the duration of the transfer (in some situations, up to 14 days). </p><div class="photo" data-original="myslo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to the card without commission" class="if uuid-3128123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128123.jpg"></div><h2>  Transfer from plastic cards </h2><p>  This option is the most convenient and affordable for all banking customers, including Sberbank customers.  You can send money from card to card, or to a bank account.  Similar operations are possible between plastic instruments of the same or different banks.  Money is transferred from the account to the electronic wallet.  Each banking organization has the right to establish a commission for a certain transaction.  And the timing of the transfer.  In most cases, money comes from plastic to plastic of one bank instantly, the deadline here is a period of 5 banking days.  Excluding weekends.  A similar operation can be performed directly in the bank branch, as well as in the terminal and in the mobile bank using a smartphone.  If this service is activated. </p><p>  In addition, specialized banks card-to-card services are provided on the websites of various banks, which are created specifically for transferring funds that can be used if necessary.  In this case, you can use the cards of any issuing banks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arabianbusiness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money to a sberbank card without commission" class="if uuid-3128115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128115.jpg"></div><h2>  Interbank and bank transfers in Sberbank </h2><p>  Be careful.  Transferring money without commission at Sberbank is not always possible. </p><p>  This is a very convenient option for making transfers between current accounts.  In this case, you can send the necessary amount of money from the current account indicating the amount of payment to the card or in cash.  When transferring money to the account of another financial institution, a commission is established, the amount of which depends on the type of card.  The funds reach the addressee in a fairly short time (usually no more than three days). </p><h2>  Transfer via electronic wallet </h2><p>  Recently, this method of transfers has become very popular, since many people have e-wallets.  This operation usually takes only a few minutes. </p><p>  Systems such as Yandex, Qiwi and WebMoney are actively used in cases of need to instantly transfer the necessary amount of money, and this is the main advantage of electronic money.  The disadvantages of this method include some restrictions on the amounts of financial elements (in most cases, no more than 15 thousand rubles can be sent per day).  There is also a mandatory commission, not only for the transfer itself, but also for cash withdrawal.  You can make a transaction through an electronic wallet through the Internet, without even leaving your home.  Still how to transfer money to a card without commission? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditcards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money to a card without commission" class="if uuid-3128118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128118.jpg"></div><h2>  Application of money transfer systems </h2><p>  Such systems as Unistream, Contact, Western Union, Zolotaya Korona are actively used, which are ready to deliver the sent amount to the addressee in a short period of time - about an hour after the transaction is completed.  However, here, too, a fee is charged from the sender, while the recipient pays nothing when receiving financial funds.  Another drawback is the localization of cash points: in some small cities, a particular service may not work. </p><h2>  Phone transfer - what does it mean? </h2><p>  How to transfer money from the phone without commission?  Previously, the assortment of many operators was the service of replenishing the balance of the phone from the card.  Now its reverse option has appeared - the ability to replenish the card from the balance of the operator.  A similar function provides the ability to control their funds on the card and balance.  The first such opportunity in their range of services was added by such operators as MTS, Beeline and Megafon. </p><p>  If the bank client wants to replenish the card account with the phone balance, you must enter the operator‚Äôs website (via the mobile application on your smartphone) and use the appropriate service.

It will not work out without commission, and it amounts to 4% of the financial amount that the client intends to transfer.  This is due to the fact that, in addition to the bank, telecom operators also take part in the work on this operation, and they do this only for money.  This applies to absolutely all telecom operators that provide such a service.  If after transferring funds to the account of your phone there is less than 50 rubles, then such an operation will not be carried out.  The operator that provides this function can change the percentage of the commission at any time. </p><p>  We examined how to transfer money without commission. </p>
