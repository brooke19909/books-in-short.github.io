The project is based on a simple algorithm of actions for users.  At the first stage, participants register on the platform and receive a personal trading account.  After completing the registration procedure, users are invited to deposit funds to purchase software. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The authors of the fraudulent TradeScaner project regularly create new versions of the site to attract the attention of traders.  For several months of its work, the project was presented in a dozen options.  Real reviews about Trade Scanner confirm the facts related to changes in the domain name of the site.  The divorce mechanism is quite simple, since users are offered to earn easy money.  Participants are convinced that they can get a real $ 500.  The system also offers investors to work for 50% of the total profit.  Beginners lose sight of a small nuance related to the fact that the trading program works on a demo account. </p><h2>  The essence of the project </h2><p>  Binary options are a lightweight option to trade on the stock exchange.  This type of bidding involves making two types of bets: to lower and increase the exchange rate.  Beginners in this industry may not always be able to accurately predict course changes.  In this regard, trading programs have appeared on the market that facilitate this process.  Trade Scaner is designed to maximize the automation of the bidding process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="binaryoptionsstrategy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exchange operations" class="if uuid-2606749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606749.jpg"></div><p>  <span>A trading robot</span> uses certain algorithms that are used to trade on binary options.  The program calculates profitable lots and makes bets around the clock.  Many novice traders lose money because of their own emotions.  A trading robot is free from such a drawback, so possible losses are minimized.  However, checking the site tradescaner.com for fraud showed that the platform is a peculiar form of divorcing people for money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Short review </h2><p>  If readers have doubts about whether tradescaner.com can be trusted, you should read the real user reviews of this program.  The authors of the project promise the participants a guaranteed profit, as well as the provision of an effective trading adviser that automatically carries out transactions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.actionfraud.police.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Real Binary Options Earnings" class="if uuid-2606760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606760.jpg"></div><p>  However, the site does not contain a description of the trading strategy according to which trading is carried out.  There is also no confirmation of successful trading from the participants in this project.  The lack of trade reports and the lack of contact information also makes one wary.  The reviews of the Tradescaner.com website and the discussion of the <span>participants in this project allow us to conclude that this is a fraudulent website that in a straightforward manner raises trusting people for money.</span> </p><h2>  Broker "Trade 12" </h2><p>  <span>Despite the presence of certain shortcomings, some users claim that the Trade 12 broker is working properly.</span>  <span>However, many note a long transfer of funds.</span>  <span>The broker provides acceptable trading conditions, as well as the ability to make transactions with various assets.</span>  <span>The real customer reviews about Trade12 are quite contradictory, as the opinions of traders differ in their views on the effectiveness of its work.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.foxserv.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings in the direction of price movement" class="if uuid-2606768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606768.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Users talk about the fact that the effectiveness of the work will directly depend on the manager with whom the investor will work.</span>  <span>In most cases, the broker makes concessions to his clients.</span>  <span>It is not difficult for traders to open an account with this broker and make profitable sales and purchase transactions.</span>  <span>The presented review of the</span> Trade 12 broker will allow forming an objective opinion of potential investors about the specifics of its activity. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the site </h2><p>  For the first time, users of this Internet resource are invited to familiarize themselves with the merits of a trading robot.  Therefore, most traders have no doubt about the effectiveness of this program.  However, do not rush to such an important issue as the choice of a trading program, as this is fraught with negative consequences.  Careful acquaintance with the presented information and its analysis allow us to conclude that there is simply no evidence of the effectiveness of the trading program. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etxcapital.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Binary Options Efficiency" class="if uuid-2606796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606796.jpg"></div><p>  On the main page of the site there is information that the robot guarantees uninterrupted and high-quality work.  Beginners take this information literally, so they believe that the authors of the project guarantee them high profits.  But if you go to the tab called "Terms and Conditions", you can find interesting information about the fact that the creators relieve themselves of responsibility for the result of this program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What causes doubt? </h2><p>  The site has a special block that contains several awards.  Among them is an award that states that Trade Scanner is the best broker of 2013.  However, the site began to function only in 2017.  Therefore, all the awards presented are fakes.  Numerous reviews about tradescaner.com claim that this project is a scam.  The site provides false information and is inherently fraudulent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="binarybettingguide.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings on the Internet" class="if uuid-2606758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606758.jpg"></div><p>  The binary options market is growing rapidly, but high-quality trading programs are rare.  Since the development of such products is a real event in the field of trading, the appearance of the <span>Trade Scaner</span> project <span>has interested the public.</span>  <span>Professional market participants are in no hurry to put such robots into practice.</span>  <span>Most traders prefer to wait a while and read reviews from other investors.</span>  <span>Since a sufficient amount of time has passed since the launch of Trade Scanner, based on existing reviews, reasonable conclusions can be drawn.</span> </p><h2>  The essence of the scam </h2><p>  <span>In fact, a robot like Trade Scaner simply does not exist.</span>  <span>The trader is invited to purchase one of the keys and carry out work on partnership conditions.</span>  <span>In this case, the financial result is divided in half.</span>  <span>The program simulates profitable trading for 1 week, and then refuses to withdraw funds.</span>  <span>Trading activities are conducted on a special demo account, and the service cooperates with the dubious broker BinAmero.</span>  <span>Therefore, we can make an unambiguous conclusion that the Trade Scaner project and the above broker are partners in this type of fraud.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.evtc2014.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tool for making money" class="if uuid-2606790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606790.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Numerous reviews about the Trade Scaner project indicate that the trading program was created to withdraw money from users.</span>  <span>Therefore, former participants in this project strongly do not recommend purchasing keys or transferring funds to this project.</span>  <span>Also reviews on the tradescaner site.</span>  <span>com talk about the fact that the site is constantly changing its name in order to attract new members.</span>  <span>In this regard, TradeScaner is an ordinary scam, which lures money from project participants, then the program stops working and drains the deposit.</span>  <span>Any efforts of the trader to withdraw funds will be in vain, since the money has already arrived at the account of scammers.</span> </p><h2>  Existing Rates </h2><p>  <span>Trade Scaner is provided to users on a paid basis.</span>  <span>The following cooperation options are offered to investors:</span> </p><ol><li>  <span>Standard.</span>  <span>It is enough for a trader to deposit $ 200 to gain access to work with the trading program.</span>  <span>The fee is paid monthly.</span> </li><li>  <span>Premium</span>  <span>Investors are invited to deposit $ 500 to gain access to the program.</span>  <span>The fee is paid once a quarter.</span> </li><li>  <span>VIP</span>  <span>Traders are invited to deposit $ 1,000 to gain access for 1 year.</span> </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.feedroll.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Binary Options Earnings" class="if uuid-2606755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606755.jpg"></div><p>  After making the payment, the client will receive an individual <span>Trade Scaner</span> activation key <span>.</span>  <span>However, the expenses of traders do not end there, since this robot is used only on the site of the BinAmero broker.</span>  <span>To work with this trading platform, you will need to make a minimum deposit of $ 250.</span>  <span>The developers of the program recommend that users replenish the account for an amount that is double the amount indicated.</span> </p><h2>  Scam or not </h2><p>  The feedback from numerous users allows us to conclude that this program is a real money fraud.  The majority of participants agree that <span>Trade Scaner quickly merges the deposit.</span>  <span>Then the broker tries to convince the investor of the need for additional replenishment of the trading account.</span>  <span>Numerous tricks are used for this.</span>  <span>Fraudsters use two main schemes for stealing money from users.</span>  <span>The first scheme is based on the psychological impact, which makes users confident in the possibility of obtaining easy money.</span>  <span>The second scheme is much more complicated and sophisticated, as traders are introduced to the "financial genius" through social networks or thematic groups that offer assistance in trading.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.financemagnates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings in the network using binary options" class="if uuid-2606794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2606794.jpg"></div><p>  <span>At the same time, investors are convinced that the robot conducts all trading operations independently, and the trader does not need to do anything.</span>  <span>After that, the trading program allegedly earns money.</span>  <span>At some point, the account holder refuses to pay cash to the assistant.</span>  <span>In order to avoid conflict, the trader is invited to independently use the trading program and make money on it.</span>  <span>Then the investor makes a deposit to the broker's account, and the program merges the received funds.</span>  <span>In the event that the trader suspected a fraud and decided to withdraw funds, the system will not allow this operation.</span>  <span>The brokerage company resets the account and logs out the investor.</span> </p><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Many traders are still in search of the easiest way to make money on binary options.  This desire of market participants is used by numerous scammers who regularly develop trading programs that merge deposits.  <span>Trade Scaner is one of these programs, which is designed to lure people out of as much money as possible.</span>  <span>You should be aware that binary options provide an opportunity for real money.</span>  <span>However, such an activity requires real trading experience, as well as an effective trading strategy.</span>  <span>It is not possible to delegate binary options trading to the robot, as this will lead to a negative result.</span>  <span>In order to earn significant capital, you need to choose the right broker through which you can make profitable transactions.</span> </p><p>  Recently, binary options have attracted the attention of many participants in the financial market.  This is largely due to the ability to earn large sums of money with relatively small investments.  In this area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, the main economic law is in force, which states that the higher the risk, the greater the likelihood of a high income.  However, fraud cases have become more frequent in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity.  This article is dedicated to the trading program, the effectiveness of which is in great doubt.  Market participants should be aware that there are no magical robots that carry out successful trading activities without any trader effort.  The desire of traders to quickly earn money is advantageously used by scammers. </p><h2>  Trade Scanner: reviews </h2><p>  In order to form an objective opinion about this project, traders are encouraged to read the reviews of real participants.  Many reviews of Trade Scanner tell us that TradeScaner is a polite money-laundering.  The authors of the project rely on features of the human psyche.  The desire to receive certain benefits without any effort is characteristic of almost every person.  Therefore, developers use the hidden desires of people and earn on their trust.  Reviews of Trade Scanner unanimously state that it is impossible to participate in this project, as well as to purchase the proposed trading systems.  Also, do not purchase additional subscriptions, otherwise you can lose your money forever.  The site is designed solely to enrich its creators, so it is impossible to make money on it.  Traders are better off avoiding such programs in order to save nerves, money and personal time. </p>
