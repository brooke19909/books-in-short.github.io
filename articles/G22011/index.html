It began to function in the 20th century. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  <span>The circus of</span> Chelyabinsk began work in 1901.  Then the South Ural capital acquired its own troupe, which worked on a regular basis and took a place in the big top, which was planned by Koromyslov, an entrepreneur from the province. </p>

    <p>  A year later, the circus began to function.  Chelyabinsk was decorated with a building in the middle of the boulevard in the south, which was called the trading area.  P. Shaykovsky opened <span>this big top</span> .  In the years 1929-1930 people moved to a new building made of wood, maintaining the circus in good condition.  Chelyabinsk was a city in which art was actively developing. </p><p>  This building was used for housing until the 1970s, and then was burned.  Starting in 1973, they planned to build a new building in the city, where circus workers could live.  The project, which was then implemented, exists to this day.  It was created under the direct supervision of architects Ruvinov, Molotov, Onishchenko, a place used by the circus.  Chelyabinsk could brag of performances of the remarkable artists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The engineers were Bragin, Storozhenko.  Built on the example of a similar building in Krasnodar. </p><h2>  Excellent result </h2><p>  The local version turned out even better, because there are more rooms, another lobby.  Evacuation conditions have also been improved.  On the ground floor you can find several simple bathrooms and a buffet room.  There are also animal enclosures and an arena for training.  The dentate bowl in which the arena is located is made of concrete.  A huge dome rises above it, on top of which lay a blue corrugated board.  Its volume is 69.86 thousand cubic meters.  m. In the very middle is a lantern for aeration.  This amphitheater can accommodate 1814 people at a time. </p>

    <h2>  What you can take a look at </h2><p>  Finding out which circus in Chelyabinsk is now, you will surely stumble upon a description of the world famous troupe or wonderful Russian clowns, amazing acrobats, impressive jugglers and fearless trainers.  The work of the people who perform here is sometimes extremely dangerous. </p><p>  Somehow the tragedy in the Chelyabinsk circus almost happened.  This was due to the disobedience of the lion during the performance.  These rooms, as a rule, are very popular just because of their severity.  On stage at that moment there were as many as six large cats.  The events took place in 2010.  One of the wards attacked his trainer twice.  Assistants tried their best to help a colleague.  They poured water, beat with sticks, tridents. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Effects </h2><p>  The audience was scared, especially the small visitors.  Someone cried out, raising a wave of horror.  Due to the aggressiveness of the lion Perseus, who at that time was in the phase of ascertaining authorities with other males, the performance broke down. </p><p>  Everything was fine, but the beast, sensing its strength, decided not to obey outside orders anymore.  The trainer A. Pinko, who at that time was 43 years old, was taken to the hospital.  The wounds were on the arms and legs, the stomach was bleeding.  He had to survive the shock and pain, to be in a state of moderate severity.  I had to intervene surgically to properly heal all the wounds.  After that, this number was not performed in the walls of the circus.  The sagging niche was occupied by acrobats, girls with hoops and gymnasts. </p>

    <h2>  Exotic </h2><p>  Another interesting program is the California Sea Lions.  The Chelyabinsk circus began to show it last year from July 18.  As part of the speeches, you can get acquainted with clowns, have a look at trained horses, cute dogs and monkeys. </p><p>  Gymnasts and acrobat skill will bring a fair amount of pleasure.  The highlight of the show is the ‚Äúmarine idyll‚Äù - an attraction in which underwater lions take part.  You can see them walking around the arena, standing in a rack and twirling a ball.  These are the kindest animals that deliver a lot of positive.  They are plastic and cheerful.  They will even sing, these capable and intelligent creatures. </p><p>  From the youngest days, these animals are already being prepared for stage activity and put on stage at least a year later.  It all depends on how gifted the animal is.  It is very important to please this beast, because they are masterful, almost like earthly lions, and will only do what they like.  Although they are friendly, you need to be able to please them and make your union mutually beneficial. </p><h2>  Work specifics </h2><p>  Violence and cruelty are not suitable in working with sea lions.  They themselves also will not use fangs in response.  The trainers on stage are professionals in their field, they always know how to make contact and reach out to the animal.  They are well fed, cared for and cherished. </p><p>  The popularity of the attraction with sea lions is due to the fact that this is a rather unusual sight, which began to show the viewer only in recent years, but it has already managed to become famous throughout the world.  The founder, Irina Zapashnaya, handed over the authority to Gayane Martirosyan, to whom the animals trained earlier showed confidence.  The grandfather of a young trainer spoke with Nikulin in Moscow. </p>

    <p>  Also famous throughout the world and his father.  Thanks to such genes and her own perseverance, the girl coped with the task and took control of the room in her hands.  To begin with, she simply had to wash her aviaries and feed the animals in order to ‚Äúrub herself‚Äù into them in confidence.  Now, she is completely trusted, and together they give excellent representations. </p><p>  Such a spectacle brings genuine pleasure.  Circus address in Chelyabinsk: st.  Kirova, 25. You can go to the cashier every day <span>from 10:00</span> to 19:00.  You are waiting impatiently. </p>
