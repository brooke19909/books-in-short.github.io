An amazing and very special country.  One of the most interesting islands here, in terms of tourism, is Bohol.  This is one of the most amazing island resorts in Southeast Asia.  Tourists leave a lot of positive reviews about Bohol in the Philippines.  He and several dozen smaller islands surrounding him are combined in one province with the same name. </p><p>  To better imagine this place and the people living in it, you need to understand that Filipinos are not one people, but more than a hundred ethnic groups.  Residents of the island of Bohol in the Philippines consider themselves the descendants of warlike people with tattoos.  Archaeologists argue that this people, in the tenth century, had trade ties with China.  They had their own written language, which, unfortunately, has not survived to this day. </p><p>  In 1565, the Spaniards entered into an agreement with the leader of Sikatun, and the island fell under their rule.  Over the next three hundred years, the local population raised two serious uprisings against the Spanish colonialists.  One of these riots is considered the largest in the Philippines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="livedreamdiscover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterfall on Bohol" class="if uuid-2880067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880067.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  We will tell you how to get to the Bohol in the Philippines.  The island and its capital, Tagbilaran, are relatively close to the main transport hubs.  There is an airport where flights from Manila regularly fly.  You can also take the ferry from Cebu.  It should be noted that the ship looks pretty decent and has all the minimal elements of modern comfort, such as comfortable chairs and air conditioning.  From the airport or the sea station to the city can be reached by taxi.  Hotels, in case of booking, organize a transfer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can travel around the island of Bohol in the Philippines and the city by bus, taxi or jeepney - an analogue of the Thai tuk-tuk or our minibus.  Hotels and travel agencies offer car rental and are ready to provide transport with a driver for sightseeing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asiatravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bohol from the sea" class="if uuid-2880068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880068.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The main tourist island is not Bohol itself, but the neighboring Panglao.  From the city you can get there through the bridge.  Wild beaches here are not suitable for swimming due to the rocky shores and the strong ocean swell.  It is not very convenient and pleasant to swim also on the equipped beaches of Panglao.  The best beaches of Bohol in the Philippines are listed below: </p><ul><li>  Alona - a strip of white sand, with a pleasant entrance.  But very crowded.  Solid cafes, sellers of tours and pearls.  At sea, there is a very dense movement of small vessels that transport tourists to diving, snorkeling and other, very popular entertainment in the Philippines associated with access to the sea. </li><li>  Dolkho.  Despite the constant attempts of staff to clean the beach, it is almost always covered in mud. </li><li>  Bikini beach - covered with small sharp stones.  Swimming and moving around the beach is possible only in shoes.  It is also worth noting the inconvenience associated with low tides, marine life and fauna.  Very close to the coast, the sea is full of algae, sea urchins and other life, which is unsafe to contact with. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.losthorizonresort.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel on Bohol" class="if uuid-2880084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880084.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The vast majority of Bohol hotels in the Philippines are located in Panglao.  The largest and busiest is Alona Beach, next to which is the beach of the same name.  In the Philippines, the coastline can be privately owned, and many hotels fence the coast.  The service is basically no different.  The cuisine in the restaurants is not full of any dishes specific to these islands, but at the same time you will be offered a rich assortment of seafood dishes.  All hotels offer a range of excursions, shuttle services and car or motorcycle rental.  Guests can enjoy in-room massages or relax treatments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights of the times of Spanish rule </h2><p>  Bohol in the Philippines abounds with interesting sights.  Many of them are associated with the era of Spanish rule in the Philippines.  For example, the place of signing of the so-called blood contract between the leader of the Date and the conquistadors.  The process of concluding the agreement was accompanied by a ritual drinking of wine, in which the head of the Spanish expedition and the leader mixed blood from cuts on their hands.  Now there is a monument in honor of this event. </p><p>  It is also worth visiting the Bohol Museum, which presents a rich collection of ancient finds, models of architectural monuments of the Philippines and stuffed animals living on the islands. </p><p>  Noteworthy is the church located in Baclayon.  This is one of the oldest churches in the Philippines.  It was originally built in the 16th century and looks more like a fortress, since in those days it served not only as a temple, but also as a barrier against enemies. </p><h2>  Bohol Philippines: Natural Attractions </h2><p>  The most interesting on the Bohol Islands is nature that has prepared for us.  The province is replete with natural sites worthy of the attention of tourists.  The islands have a limestone-karst nature, and under the influence of water and winds, over millions of years of their existence, the coasts have acquired very bizarre forms.  They abound in caves. </p><p>  The most interesting of them can be attributed to Dagoja, who served as the headquarters for the Philippine revolutionaries during the uprising against the Spanish crown in the eighteenth century.  You can get into their secret shelter only by swimming under the water of the lake through the tunnel.  Or the cave of Antiguerra, where locals were saved during the Second World War.  Not far from it is a city with the same name and several more interesting caves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>The deepest cave of</span> Hinakbanan is located on the island of Panglao.  As well as the most mysterious - Binkak.  Locals are now afraid to go down here because of a very inconspicuous entrance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thereiscory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chocolate Hills" class="if uuid-2880052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880052.jpg"></div><h2>  Chocolate Hills </h2><p>  Another amazing place to see is the Chocolate Hills.  It is they who, as a rule, appear to our view of the numerous photos of Bohol in the Philippines.  More than a thousand two hundred hills, on which only grass grows, which has a characteristic brown hue.  The mystery of the phenomenon has not yet been solved.  One of the hypotheses that scientists put forward is the assumption that this strange relief was formed at the bottom of the ocean, even before the islands rose above sea level. </p><p>  Locals believe that these are the stones left here after the battle of the formidable gods.  Now a national park is located here and a viewing platform has been built from which you can explore this natural miracle.  Not far from the hills is a hotel with spectacular views.  You can get to the park by regular bus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thereiscory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Filipino tarsier" class="if uuid-2880056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880056.jpg"></div><h2>  Tarsiers </h2><p>  Further, as a rule, tourists are recommended to visit the center of the Philippine tarsiers.  These small creatures live in a fenced garden.  Entrance to it is free, but you can make a donation to feed animals.  The impression of observing tarsiers is difficult to convey in words.  This must be seen for yourself.  Animals are very small in size, literally fit in the palm of your hand.  At the same time, they are so shy that sometimes they fall from stress from a tree and break to death.  Therefore, behaving in the park must be extremely quiet and careful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.commdiginews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lobok River" class="if uuid-2880064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880064.jpg"></div><h2>  Lobok River Tour </h2><p>  This is a popular Bohol low-cost route.  You can get to the pier, from which the sightseeing boats depart, on a moped or book a transfer at the hotel‚Äôs travel desk.  You will be driven along the Lobok River in a catamaran past the city of the same name. </p><p>  On the way, they are treated to local cuisine.  The buffet includes several types of meat, seafood, side dishes and desserts.  Everything is tasty and in sufficient quantity.  During the excursion, folk artists perform songs and dances on the ferry.  There will be a stop at which, in addition to drinks, colorful dances are performed by local children. </p><p>  The main advantage of this river walk is the beautiful river landscapes.  The emerald river, surrounded by forests, at the final point of the route is crowned by Busai waterfalls.  The local population entertains tourists by jumping into the water from high palm trees. </p><h2>  Whales and dolphins </h2><p>  If you find yourself on Bohol Island in the Philippines from March to June, do not miss a trip to Pamiklan Island.  The walk begins very early, as it is best to watch the whales in the morning.  During this period, you are almost guaranteed to meet whales and dolphins.  Huge marine life will seem to you in all its glory.  Watching them is a truly unique experience, incomparable with anything. </p><p>  Previously, the local population lived at the expense of whaling.  Now whales are protected by law and Aborigines carry tourists to look at them.  After meeting with these amazing creatures, you will visit the island.  They offer a simple rustic lunch, a gorgeous beach with white sand and clear water.  Do not forget to bring your bathing accessories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Underwater world" class="if uuid-2880048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2880048.jpg"></div><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  The islands of Bohol Province in the Philippines are a great place for lovers of the underwater world.  The nature here is rich in marine attractions.  The islands are surrounded by coral reefs and abound in life.  As elsewhere in such places, demand creates supply.  Diving tours for beginners and already held amateurs can be purchased at every step, in a hotel or in specialized clubs. </p><p>  Prices depend on the season.  On average, a dive trip will cost you twenty-five dollars.  It is worth visiting the island of Kabilao, where in the coral gardens you can find hammer fish.  If you are interested in barracudas, try to dive against the wall of Tangnan.  Beautiful views can also be observed, immersed in the Napalling area or near the island of Balikasag, located less than an hour from Bohol.  For lovers of exotic visit the underwater caves, where you can meet with unique sea views. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A visit to Bohol and the Philippines is generally worth the time and money.  You can see and experience a lot of interesting things here.  This is confirmed by numerous reviews of tourists about the island of Bohol in the Philippines.  Filipinos are described by travelers as a very good-natured, hospitable people.  Infrastructure quite developed for this country is also noted. </p><p>  Of course, there are also disadvantages characteristic of the Philippines, in the form of surprisingly widespread corruption and arbitrariness of the authorities, but it is worth attributing such things to the national flavor, which, by the way, is also presented here in all its charming beauty.  Bohol is full of sights of the Spanish era that were not mentioned in the article.  In addition, for tourists, fascinating tours are conducted inland, where they are introduced to the unique ecosystem of the Philippine islands. </p>
