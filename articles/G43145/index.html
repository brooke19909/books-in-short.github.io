    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  So, the Regalia Hotel 3 * complex is located in Nha Trang - this is the capital of Khanh Hoa province.  Quite a large city, in which several hundred thousand people live.  This metropolis is located along the coast of the South China Sea.  It‚Äôs immediately clear why this is where a larger flow of tourists travels.  After all, many go on vacation to see the sea, swim and sunbathe. </p><p>  The hotel itself was located in a very good location.  Literally 800 meters is the Vietnam Sailing Center.  A spacious and clean beach can be reached in just ten minutes.  By the way, the hotel has its own private beach. </p><p>  And the hotel is located near the airport.  The distance is 26 kilometers.  This is not a lot and not a little - in any case, and you can get to this place quickly, and landing and departing aircraft will not cause discomfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  In Regalia Hotel 3 * there are lots of different rooms.  The most popular option is an improved double room.  It is relatively inexpensive and very comfortable.  There is also a 2-bed deluxe apartment, as well as executive rooms.  Potential guests can be offered family rooms (both with a balcony and without).  Different apartments may have sea or city views. </p><p>  And, of course, there are suites.  There are only two types of them - one for two (maximum three) people with sea views, and the other - family.  Both rooms have a private balcony. </p>

    <h2>  Superior double room: cost and amenities </h2><p>  So, to book these apartments in Regalia Hotel 3 * will cost about 65 thousand rubles for 14 nights.  The price is indicated for two people.  And by the way, with breakfast included in the price, fees and taxes. </p><p>  For this price, guests will be provided with a 24-square-meter room with one huge 2-double bed (declared, in any case, one, but in reality it would be more correct to call it a 3-bedroom).  These apartments offer beautiful city views.  The room itself has a flat-screen TV, telephone, safe with air conditioning - everything you need.  A seating area and parquet flooring add to the comfort.  There is also a wardrobe, shower, toilet, hairdryer, as well as such nice additions as a minibar, towels, linen and slippers.  And of course, free Wi-Fi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Deluxe Apartment </h2><p>  This option is also popular.  Apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã28 square meters will cost 68 thousand rubles for 2 weeks of vacation and, again, for two people with breakfast.  The conditions are not bad, amenities are also at a decent level. </p><p>  Guests staying at the Regalia Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) can even choose the type of bed - either one very large, 2-bedroom, or two separate.  This room will also have a minibar with air conditioning and a seating area.  But, in addition to the above, there are many more various amenities.  For example, a TV, telephone, safe, wardrobe, shower, hairdryer, toilet and, of course, regularly replaced linen and towels.  The guests who chose the Regalia Hotel 3 (Vietnam) as their temporary residence, the reviews were left quite positive and even inspirational.  They argue that if you want to find a good, but budget hotel, the rooms of which would be clean, tidy and comfortable, then you should make a choice in favor of this complex.  Because here is a really good standard.  And especially pleased with the corporate design of the apartment - on many things there is an engraving of the abbreviations of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Executive Room </h2><p>  I would also like to tell about apartments of this class separately.  The administration of the Regalia Hotel 3 * (Vietnam) tried to arrange the rooms in such a way that the guests were really pleased to be in them, and set fairly reasonable prices even for representative apartments.  So, for two they will cost 85 thousand rubles (2 weeks, breakfast and fees included).  32 square meters, a balcony with spectacular sea views, a wide flat-screen TV, a spacious bathroom and a huge bed - all that is needed for a comfortable stay and relaxation. </p><p>  In addition, there is also a telephone, a safe, air conditioning, a seating area, a minibar, as well as all other conditions and amenities that are available to guests who have booked apartments of a different category. </p>

    <h2>  Suite rooms </h2><p>  So, finally - about the upper class apartments.  What can you say about family deluxe?  36 square meters, plasma TV, city views, air conditioning, private bathroom, breakfast - and all this can be obtained for 100 thousand rubles for 4-5 people!  Otherwise, the amenities are the same as in the rest of the apartments, only there is still a living area.  There are two huge 2-sleeping beds in the room.  Additional apartments for this category are not provided. </p><p>  And finally, a few words about the deluxe room.  It will cost 125 thousand rubles for two (14 days, breakfast is included).  The room is spacious, its area is 45 square meters.  The apartment has a bedroom with a huge 2 double bed, a living room, and a balcony with sea views.  There is also a flat-screen TV, a safe, wooden floors and, of course, a bathroom with a shower, hairdryer, towels and other amenities. </p>

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars and leisure </h2><p>  Hotel Regalia Hotel 3 * reviews get very pleasant.  Many guests talk in detail about the restaurant and how they are fed there.  So, in this institution you can try the delicacies of European and Asian cuisine.  But most of all, guests are advised to try seafood.  These dishes are cooked using local seafood.  And also in the Regalia Hotel 3 * complex (Nha Trang, Vietnam) there is a bar in which there is a huge selection of various alcoholic drinks and soft cocktails. </p><p>  The hotel has a swimming pool, which is open all year.  There is also a billiard room and a private beach area.  Of course, leisure at the hotel is not organized as much as some would like - this is what the reviews left about Regalia Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) tell, but the main entertainment here is the sea, excursions and walks to places with attractions.  And also shops.  There are countless them.  So, going on vacation to this place, you should prepare for a great shopping. </p>

    <h2>  Service and maintenance </h2><p>  I would also like to talk about this topic when talking about Regalia Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam).  According to guests who have already visited this place, service and maintenance are developed here at the highest level.  For example, room service can be arranged for drinks or food, if guests wish.  A transfer to or from the airport is also offered.  The reception is open 24 hours a day so guests can be independent of arrival or departure times.  They can check-in or check-out at any time (although it is possible that they may ask for a symbolic amount). </p><p>  There is also a point at the hotel complex where you can exchange currency.  And a tour desk, by the way, is also there.  Luggage storage is also provided, as well as lockers for small items.  The hotel also has a common living room with a TV.  Dry cleaning, laundry, gift shop, fax and photocopying facilities, banquet and conference rooms, and even ironing services - this hotel has everything you need and more. </p><p>  It is not surprising that this hotel is very popular.  Guests say that if you need a budget, but a decent option, you should go here.  But, if such a decision is made, then you need to book a room as early as possible - a month and a half or two before the trip.  Because if you are puzzled by this question in a week, then the numbers may simply not remain.  So it is advisable to consider everything in advance, choose and reserve an apartment for yourself, and sleep peacefully.  In any case, there is a cancellation of the reservation, and if something does not work out, it will be possible to refuse the order (and for free). </p>
