    <p>  According to the townspeople, this place in the capital is the most peaceful and romantic. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  There are good reasons to believe that in the 10-13 centuries.  on the territory of the Loshitsky park there was a huge fortification.  Over time, it was fragmented into a number of settlements.  These included Loshitsa Malaya and Loshitsa Bolshaya, Loshitsa Gornostaevskaya and others. </p><p>  The estate is mentioned in documents dating back to the middle of the 16th century.  At that time, the land was in the possession of V.Yu.  Tolochinsky, who was a representative of the princely family of Drutsky.  Further, the property passed to the sons of I. Ermine.  He was the husband of the widow of Tolochinsky, Mary. </p><p>  At the turn of the 17-18 centuries.  the estate was bought by the noble family of the Pruszinski.  Famous people became their guests.  So, the poems in which the Loshitskaya land and its owner are mentioned were left to the descendants of V. Dunin-Martsinkevich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Estate plan </h2><p>  Documents dating from 1772 and 1787 were discovered in the archives.  These are the plans for the buildings included in the Loshitsa Park.  The map suggested to the researchers that the manor itself was previously located at the place where the outbuilding was later built. </p>

    <p>  Presumably, during its construction, the foundation of some minor building located in the old manor complex was used. </p><h2>  Secret </h2><p>  Loshitsky park in Minsk is known for its ghost that walks along the alleys.  This legend is connected with Jadwiga Lubansk√° - the wife of one of the owners of the estate, Eustathius Luban.  They say that a handsome, but poor young man turned his head to the young wife.  Rumors immediately spread about infidelity in Minsk.  The girl could not stand the shame and, having descended the path to the river, drowned herself. </p>

    <p>  Eustathius of Luban was shocked by the death of his wife.  At the place where her body was later found, he planted an apricot.  They say that the ghost of Mrs. Jadwig wanders at midnight along the alleys of the Loshitsa Park.  It happens at the time of apricot blossom.  The ghost in white robes does nothing wrong.  Jadwiga is glad to help with good advice to lovers on her way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  After the revolution of 1917, the Loshitsky park in Minsk began to exist according to the new rules.  Local old-timers say that in the twenties the GPU of Belarus was located in the estate.  <span>The black yard</span> located in the park was fenced with barbed wire during the period of the Stalinist repressions.  Here, gunshots and human moans were often heard. </p><p>  After the Nazi occupation of Belarus, representatives of the German command occupied the Loshitsky estate.  Wilhelm von Kube himself often visited here. </p><p>  After the war ended, Loshitsky Park in Minsk was given to the state farm of the same name - ‚ÄúLoshitsa‚Äù.  It was a period of desolation of the estate.  Several state farmers even settled in a dilapidated outbuilding and in the guard's house.  They liberated these buildings only in 1988. It was this year that Loshitsky Park in Minsk was declared a monument of architecture and history.  However, the high status did not affect the life of the estate.  The state farm continued to plow its land until 1998. </p><h2>  Modern period </h2><p>  Loshitsa estate has partially survived to the present day.  The structure that we can see today dates back to 1895. This is the style of Russian Art Nouveau and eclecticism.  The house fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape.  It is located on a high bank, above the junction of two rivers.  When planning the park, all the features of the existing terrain were perfectly taken into account.  Applied here and the effect of visual augmentation.  It allows a relatively small park to give the impression of a vast territory. </p><p>  Currently, restoration work is underway in Loshitsky Park.  Back in 2003, BelNIIS specialists were involved in the process.  They issued a verdict on the unsatisfactory condition of the wooden part of the house and its floors. <br>  The former mill is also in poor condition.  She stands at a distance, her restoration will begin only after the restoration of the manor house and buildings located near the center of the architectural complex.  Despite the neglect, Loshitsky Park today looks majestic.  The main house and the manager‚Äôs house, two buildings of an economic type, an old distillery, a water mill, a tomb-chapel - all these structures can still be seen in the park. </p><p>  In Loshitsky estate there is an equestrian club.  Those who wish have the opportunity to ride in the park on a horse. </p><h2>  Vegetation </h2><p>  The park has many exotic trees.  There are two-bladed ginkgo, <span>Japanese crimson,</span> fluffy oak, manniferous ash, Siberian, European and Japanese larch, black and <span>weymouth pine,</span> as well as <span>paper birch.</span>  Apricots and hydrangea delight visitors. </p><p>  Loshitsky Park is famous for its wedding oak.  They say that from time immemorial people came to him to ask for friendship, love, health and creative inspiration. </p><h2>  Green areas of Minsk </h2><p>  In the capital of Belarus there are twenty-six parks and the same number of boulevards, as well as one hundred and fifty-nine squares.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis green area is more than two thousand hectares. </p>

    <h2>  Chelyuskintsev Park </h2><p>  It was created in 1931 on the southeastern outskirts of the capital of Belarus.  <span>Chelyuskintsev Park</span> in Minsk was named in honor of the participants of the famous expedition led by O.Yu.  Schmidt and captain <span>V.I.</span>  <span>Voronin.</span>  In 1933 they attempted to navigate the sea route from Murmansk to Vladivostok in one navigation.  However, the Chelyuskin steamer was crushed by the ice of the Chukchi Sea.  All members of the expedition and the pilots who saved them received the title of Heroes of the Soviet Union. </p>
