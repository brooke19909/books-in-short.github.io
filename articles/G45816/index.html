Surprisingly, given that this city is not a seaport.  It is located on the banks <span>of the Voronezh River,</span> not far from the place where it flows into the Don. </p><h2>  Predestination </h2><p>  As early as one thousand seven hundred years, on the orders of Peter I, the first battleship was launched here.  Therefore, sightseeing should start with monuments dedicated to the Navy.  The battleship mentioned earlier is called ‚ÄúGoto Predestination‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúGod's foresight‚Äù in Latin.  Since the vessel was intended for sailing in the shallow waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, its draft, respectively, was less. </p>

Thus, a unique vessel was obtained that prevented leakage in the event of a stranded impact.  In 2010, the leadership of Voronezh decided to recreate the Goto Predestination ship according to the drawings, which was done in 2014.  For the ship, they determined a permanent parking place on the pier near Admiralteyskaya Square in order for it to become a museum.  The exposition of this amazing museum ship has many items that tell about the eighteenth century sailors and their campaigns.

It is located on Petrovskaya Embankment.  Its decoration is the Rostral column, which was erected in 1996 in honor of the centenary of the Russian fleet.  In the same year, the triumphal arch was erected, which is the entrance to the square.  Here is the oldest building - the Assumption Admiralty Church.  The first wooden structure was built back in 1660.  Buildings made of stone appeared in the late seventeenth - early eighteenth century.  For a long time a monastery existed here, but Peter transferred it, and at this place there remained a church, where all the solemn ceremonies of the descent of ships and services were held. </p><h2>  The streets of the town </h2><p>  Now let's look at the famous streets of Voronezh, which are named after local heroes. </p><ol><li>  Street Malinowski.  Located in the Zheleznodorozhny district.  Named after the Marshal of the Soviet Union, twice Hero of the Soviet Union. </li><li>  Liza Chaykina Street.  Located in the same area as Malinowski.  Named after the partisan.  Elizabeth Chaikina organized a whole partisan detachment, is a Hero of the Soviet Union. </li><li>  Street Zoe Kosmodemyanskoy.  Located in the Zheleznodorozhny district.  Zoya Anatolyevna is a partisan of the Great Patriotic War. </li><li>  Street <span>M. Raskova.</span>  Named in honor of the Soviet pilot navigator. </li><li>  Street Polina Osipenko.  Located on Leninsky Prospekt, in the Left Bank region.  The street is named after the Soviet aviator. </li></ol><h2>  Pokrovsky and Annunciation Cathedrals </h2><p>  Another temple of the city, preserved from the beginning of the eighteenth century, is the Intercession Cathedral, which has long been considered a model of classicism.  Only from the mid-thirties to the end of the forties of the XX century the church was closed to believers, but from the post-war years it became re-operating. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  May Day Garden and other squares </h2><p>  Remembering the May Day Garden, one cannot help but recall its history.  This is what he is called now, but earlier he was simply called - City Garden.  For the first time this beautiful place was planted with trees and declared urban in the mid-nineteenth century.  This is where you can relax in Voronezh, slowly walking and enjoying nature.  Despite the fact that the garden now belongs to the diocese, the entrance is open to all comers.  Fans of fresh air, leisurely walks in nature, jogging in the morning will also like other parks and squares of Voronezh. </p><p>  Among these can be called the Northern Forest, an arboretum where people can feed the squirrel, collect cones and other natural material for crafts.  Koltsovsky Square will delight its visitors with a beautiful illuminated fountain, many benches for relaxing and the presence of Wi-Fi, as it is located in the city center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
