Even if we travel, it‚Äôs more convenient to always stay online in order to be able to check the most current weather information, make a walking route, write a message to friends, or simply drop a photo on Instagram.  The mobile Internet on your tablet or smartphone can help you with this. </p><h2>  How to stay online? </h2><p>  Let's start with the fact that you can work with the Internet in different ways - both free and those that require a certain fee.  It all depends on what you count on when connecting to the Internet.  Tasks are different depending on the duration of your connection, its regularity, and the amount of data transferred.  Say, go to the VK and send a couple of messages can not be compared with downloading a movie using Torrent.  Therefore, you need to consider this when looking for the Internet abroad. </p>

    <p>  MTS, for example, is a leader in the field of mobile connection in roaming.  Therefore, we will be talking about this company in today's article, talking about the Internet for mobile devices.  True, the cost of such a connection is quite high.  In the meantime, consider other options for how to stay online.  Some of them, by the way, absolutely do not require any fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Free Wi-Fi hotspots </h2><p>  If you are traveling abroad, you can safely count on open Wi-Fi networks.  They can be found near some cafes, restaurants, hotels, train stations, airports and other crowded places.  If we talk about European countries, then it is very easy to find a point for access to the Internet there.  The USA, Canada and other developed ones are the same. </p>

    <p>  The coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãopen Wi-Fi networks is quite wide, so it will most likely satisfy your needs without any charge.  If you need the connection to be constantly present on your device, you should pay attention to paid services.  For example, the same wireless networks from the MTS operator.  They are located in many countries, and therefore, wherever you go, they are likely to find. </p><h2>  Paid Wi-Fi from MTS </h2><p>  To begin with, we will inform you of the price of connecting and using services - this is 40 rubles for each hour of access.  To say that it is cheap is impossible.  In fact, the cost of services is quite high, even considering comfortable conditions for the user and flexible settings of the tariff plan.  By the way, nothing is said about him on the company's website. </p><p>  But it is known that the MTS network has 800 Internet access points around the world.  All have one password and login, which will be provided to you as a subscriber of the service.  Access points are located anywhere - in various entertainment venues, at transport infrastructure facilities, in places of tourist congestion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to connect Wi-Fi? </h2><p>  Connecting to the MTS Wi-Fi service is very simple.  You need to send a message including the word pass to the short number 1106, specially highlighted by the company.  In the response message, you will receive the login under which you were registered in the system, as well as the password (this will be the network access key). </p><p>  MTS mentioned above 40 rubles per hour Internet access abroad MTS can write off in two ways.  The first is the withdrawal from the user's subscriber account, the second is payment by credit card.  It is noteworthy that anyone can use this service, regardless of whether it is connected to the MTS or not. </p><p>  The advantage of this kind of Wi-Fi from MTS - unlimited Internet abroad - will allow you to download movies at high speed or, for example, upload archives with photos.  Doing this is necessary to free up space or gain access to entertainment media content. </p><h2>  How to set up Wi-Fi? </h2><p>  It is very easy to set up the Internet abroad MTS.  Since the subscriber of the service receives a password and login on his mobile, all he needs to connect is to enter this data.  Unfortunately, no one will be able to transfer them - the system does not authorize the second device under the same parameters.  Therefore, if you would like to use one key together with friends, you will be upset. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  But the plus of such a connection is absolute simplicity and speed.  No need to think about whether your phone will catch a signal or not.  You can be absolutely sure that Wi-Fi is a stable high-speed connection that gives great opportunities to your tablet, smartphone or laptop even when traveling. </p><h2>  Mobile Internet and its advantages </h2><p>  However, there are situations when we do not have the opportunity to enter from a fixed point of wireless Internet.  For example, we travel around the country, away from Wi-Fi routers, but need to check the route through online maps.  Of course, exclusively mobile connection is suitable for such needs.  It is provided, for example, by MTS.  Roaming (Internet) abroad will cost more than within the country, but the quality of service will remain quite high.  You should not worry about connection speed.  The main thing is to choose a tariff with which you would like to interact and configure it correctly. </p><h2>  Internet tariffs from MTS </h2><p>  In total, the mobile operator has three packages that are advantageous for using Internet services.  They are called ‚ÄúBIT abroad‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuper BIT abroad‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúMaxi BIT abroad‚Äù.  Connection, working conditions, as well as restrictions for each of the indicated tariff plans differ from each other.  Each of these tariffs will be described in more detail in this article. </p>

    <h2>  "BIT abroad" </h2><p>  The easiest option to connect MTS-Internet abroad (reviews indicate that the most profitable) is the activation of this tariff plan.  It provides for a traffic volume of 30 megabytes per day at a cost of 300 rubles per day.  This quota applies, according to the terms of service, to the countries of Europe, the CIS, the USA, Canada, China, Turkey and some other states popular for a domestic subscriber.  If the user of the service enters the territory of other countries (or is located somewhere on the high seas), the amount of data decreases to 5 megabytes, and the cost increases to 1200 rubles per day.  If you plan to go to another state, obviously, it is unprofitable to use the service offered by MTS (Internet abroad). </p><p>  You can find out how to activate the ‚ÄúBIT abroad‚Äù tariff by visiting the page on the company‚Äôs website.  It says that to activate you need to dial one of the commands: * 111 * 2222 # or * 212 #.  In addition, you can activate the service using SMS 2222 sent to number 111, as well as using the subscriber‚Äôs online account.  Charge-off occurs only if the user connects to the network. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúMaxi BIT abroad‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The second largest data plan is the Maxi package.  Its conditions are the same as the previous one, the only difference is how many megabytes at what price will be available to the subscriber.  So, the mobile Internet abroad (MTS ‚ÄúMaxi BIT‚Äù) will cost 600 rubles per day for the first group of countries and 2200 rubles if the user leaves their borders.  At the same time, a quota of 70 and 10 megabytes is given for spending, respectively.  Connection is made using the command * 111 * 2223 # or by sending a message with the numbers 2223 to 111. </p><h2>  Super BIT Abroad </h2><p>  The third package tariff - ‚ÄúSuper BIT‚Äù - is the most voluminous in terms of the traffic provided.  On it, the Internet abroad (MTS is a service provider) will cost 1,500 rubles per day for use by a user from the listed countries, as well as 4,000 rubles for using the network from other countries.  The data volume is 200 and 20 megabytes, respectively. </p><p>  You can connect this plan by sending a request * 111 * 2224 # or the message "2224" to number 111. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  Choosing a tariff plan with which you would be more comfortable working is easy enough.  Immediately you need to decide in order to activate the service at MTS.  Connecting the Internet abroad is quite simple, we already wrote about this;  another thing is the appropriateness of such costs.  The cost of the third tariff plan is colossal.  Most likely, you will have the opportunity to save money by choosing an alternative source of network access.  Therefore, we pay attention to why you need a connection on a tablet or smartphone.  Most often, the MTS roaming service (Internet abroad) is taken for the simplest actions that are required away from stationary Wi-Fi networks: checking mail, social networks, weather or a navigator.  For this, the minimum tariff will be enough - 30 megabytes per day.  And its cost is adequate - 300 rubles. </p><p>  If we talk about more extensive plans, then they are suitable even for some work tasks when connected from a laptop.  However, is there any point in acquiring such expensive tariff plans?  Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to search for stationary Internet in the area where you are traveling to connect to it?  This would be more reasonable, since MTS has overseas internet (the tariffs that are provided for network connections from abroad) are too expensive. </p><p>  In an extreme case, if you really have circumstances when you need to drop a data file on the Internet that exceeds 30 megabytes and there is no civilization nearby, it makes sense to connect to Maxi and Super.  But you can choose between them purely by the required amount of traffic. </p><h2>  If not enough? </h2><p>  The site of the MTS operator (the Internet abroad, the tariffs and the conditions for its provision are described here) also contains information with guidance on what to do if the traffic allocated under the BIT tariffs, as well as BIT Super and BIT Maxi "is not enough for the user.  The basic tariffs that operate within the country (for example, ‚ÄúMTS tablet‚Äù) do not provide the Internet abroad, so you should not count on it. </p>

    <p>  In order not to go beyond the allocated quota and not spend a lot of money, the operator offers each subscriber a special service.  It is called "Turbo Button."  Its conditions are the same as those of the BIT plan (basic) - an additional 30 megabytes of traffic is provided for 300 rubles per day.  To activate this option on your phone you need to dial the combination * 111 * 485 #.  There is no need to disable the service, since its action will be terminated within 24 hours after activation, as well as if the provided traffic volume was, in the end, exhausted. </p><h2>  Operator Tips </h2><p>  In addition to data on its tariff plans, MTS also provides users with information on how to use the Internet when roaming is cheaper and more profitable. </p><p>  For example, the operator recommends replenishing the account in advance for the amount that you expect to spend on communication.  This will save you from troubles, like the fact that you will need to look for funds to replenish on the way and spend your time on it.  Even at MTS, it is recommended to activate the ‚ÄúOn full trust‚Äù service.  It allows you to use mobile communications even in cases where there is no money left on your balance, ‚Äúdriving‚Äù it, thus, into a negative value.  Again, this will allow you to talk right away, and then pay for the services provided. </p><p>  Also, carefully consider the settings of your mobile phone.  The operator recommends disabling the automatic setting of the operator so that the user does not lose money from the account in such a way if he was in the border zone and the phone switched to roaming mode on its own. </p><p>  Finally, keeping track of the balance and the amount of traffic spent, pay attention to relevant information about how much data you spent.  Do not forget that these data are updated with a delay, because additional time is required for the balance to be provided by foreign telecom operators of MTS.  For this reason, do not rush to resume a conversation or an online access session if you are not sure whether the provided data packet was enough for you or not. </p>
