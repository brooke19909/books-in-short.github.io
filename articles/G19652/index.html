Perhaps this is why it differs significantly from many Chinese device developers in its policy, approach and product quality.  For this, it is, in fact, so highly valued by customers. </p><p>  It can be seen that for the successful sales of their smartphones, Huawei tried a lot of strategies.  One of them is the allocation of an independent line of devices under the new brand.  In particular, we are talking about the phone Huawei Honor 4C.  We will consider it in today's review. </p>

    <p>  In our country, Honor is associated with the Huawei brand and, of course, does not independently advance among consumers;  while the company itself strongly advocates this product as a separate development, an independent brand that produces devices. </p><h2>  Model positioning </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth noting that the phone was released in April 2015.  At the time of the debut, it was so in demand that in stores where sales were made, a temporary shortage of devices began - they were bought faster than they were brought to the warehouse.  And this is not surprising! </p><p>  In the process of preparing the review, we studied more than one <span>review: Huawei Honor 4C</span> in the eyes of people is defined as an affordable solution with high-tech equipment, worthy of attention.  The model is actually functional, reliable, high-quality assembled and at the same time inexpensive.  At the time of sale, the price of 9000 rubles was installed on the Huawei Honor 4C.  Some experts on the mobile market believe that this was a promotional price aimed at popularizing a smartphone, its advertising, so to speak;  but at the same time, the price did not rise in the end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  What about the design of the device?  First of all, the phone, like many other Huawei products, is presented in a typical for this company, but somewhat not original design.  This is a simple ‚Äúbrick‚Äù, decorated with a pseudo-metal surface with a texture dotted with intersecting grooves (the latter takes place on the back cover).  In addition to this feature, nothing unusual can be found here anymore. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the design is very similar to ‚Äúnoname-smartphones‚Äù, in the hand of Huawei Honor 4C (8 GB) lies nicely.  Probably, the whole matter is not only in the correctly selected form, but also in such materials of the case. </p><p>  The front panel is completely covered with glass: according to the technical specifications, this is <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 (a coating that is more resistant to shock, scratches and other types of damage).  On the side faces traditionally located a button to change the sound, as well as a key to lock the screen.  The back panel of the Huawei Honor 4C (Black modifications and other color solutions) contains a barely noticeable Honor inscription and a camera peephole with flash, highlighted by a special metal plate.  At the bottom of the panel, you can also notice the speaker - a lot of small holes were made above it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you buy a phone Huawei Honor 4C on the official website, the model can be obtained in white and black variations;  there is also a gold version, although it cannot be bought on the Russian market. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device is presented in the hottest category of 5-inch smartphones to date.  With a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, the phone has a good display density (294 dpi).  This allows us to talk about high definition images on the screen, give it a rating of "5".  Huawei Honor 4C smartphone can serve as a player for high-quality films, for example.  It is almost impossible to consider grain size here.  Yes, and of course, no one will do this on purpose. </p><p>  With the color rendering and viewing angles of the model, everything is also in order - this was confirmed by more than one review left on the Web.  Huawei Honor 4C has several functions that can make working with a smartphone in a dark room (where minimum brightness is required) and, conversely, in the sunlight more comfortable. </p><p>  In addition, there is also the ability to customize the screen display to your liking.  To do this, the phone menu provides for a number of options, each of which can be configured. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  Regarding Huawei devices (Honor 4C 8 GB also applies), it should be noted that they are equipped with "hardware", individually developed by the company for its products.  We are talking about HiSilicon Kirin 620, running on 8 cores.  Their clock frequency is 1.2 GHz.  And paired with it, the graphic engine (Mali T-450 MP4) also functions. </p><p>  Due to this connection, the device can really be called quite nimble in terms of interaction on a daily level.  That is, the smartphone does not fail if you scroll through the menu on it, open certain applications, leaving others in the <span>background</span> , and so on. </p><p>  It is important to note that some performance problems can be found on "bulky" (in terms of graphics) games.  This is where you need to be prepared for the fact that the phone may simply not play any of them. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The smartphone operates on the basis of Android.  Surprisingly, at the time of the device‚Äôs debut, its actual version was version 5.0, while the developers decided to take 4.4.2 as the basis.  At the visual level, the buyer was presented with their own graphical shell EMUI, which has some differences from the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android.  In particular, this applies not only to the presence of any additional applications, but also to the design of menus, windows, transitions and other things. </p><p>  As another example of the manifestation of such ‚Äúindividualism‚Äù of this UI, we can cite a multimedia player developed specifically for Huawei. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As each review left about the device showed, Huawei Honor 4C has a 13-megapixel camera (as the main one) and a front camera of 5 megapixels.  The quality of their shooting can not be called neither bad nor good.  Rather, these are typical cameras of mid-class devices.  During the shooting, it was also noticeable that in the automatic setup mode the smartphone does not adhere to the color balance well: separately, you can notice the not quite accurate color transfer in a dark room.  Sometimes even a flash does not save you from this, and sometimes it even makes it worse.  Therefore, the camera that was installed on the smartphone Huawei Honor 4C (8 GB) can be used for periodic shots, but you can‚Äôt call this device a ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  An important nuance that we cannot but be interested in in Huawei Honor 4C (Black and White versions) is its performance.  How much time a phone can last on a single battery charge directly affects the user‚Äôs attitude towards it.  Indeed, in fact, on the road or somewhere in a place without access to the network, only the ‚Äúendurance‚Äù factor can determine the ‚Äúlife‚Äù of a smartphone. </p><p>  On the smartphone Huawei Honor 4C 8 GB, the manufacturer installed a battery with a capacity of 2550 mAh.  This is not very much: for a device with such functionality, such a battery is enough for 5-6 hours of video playback, 10 - for working with mobile Internet, 20 - for operation with different functions on a daily level. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  The official name of the device we are describing is Huawei Honor 4C Dual Sim.  Already from it we can conclude that the smartphone has the function of supporting work simultaneously with two SIM cards, which, of course, gives the user advanced communication capabilities. </p><p>  Both cards can receive a signal in 2G / 3G / 4G format.  In addition to conventional mobile communications, there is also support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth-signal.  In addition to all of the above, one can name the navigation abilities of the smartphone, support for GPS and GLONASS systems. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  At the time, as already noted, the phone was quite popular among buyers.  That is why a lot has been written about the device, and it is not difficult to find a true review about it on the Web. </p><p>  Huawei Honor 4C in the eyes of users has more positive qualities.  At least the bulk of the reviews testify to this.  Although, of course, you can meet a lot of comments in the form of complaints about the absence or incorrect operation of a particular function in the device. </p><p>  For example, many emphasized that only 4 out of 8 specified in the characteristics of the core work;  that instead of Gorilla Glass 3 here, judging by the stability, simple glass is used;  that in the shell that the developer installed on the smartphone, there are too many extraneous, unnecessary applications.  In order to remove them, you need to obtain Root rights, which automatically deprives the owner of the phone a guarantee from the seller. </p><p>  There are many other problems.  For example, such a remark is quite common: Huawei Honor 4C weakly holds a battery charge, the smartphone has to be charged too often.  Or another - the device heats up during use, which makes it uncomfortable to work with it. </p><p>  All these and other opinions of customers are interesting to us in order to identify the shortcomings of the device, to turn our attention to them. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  What can be summarized after our review?  Of course, the main plus of the Huawei Honor 4C is the price.  The ratio of the cost of the device and its quality is really very profitable here.  At the same time, there are quite serious flaws, which should also not be forgotten.  They appear mainly not immediately, but some time after working with the gadget.  Some of these errors can be solved by the user, the other - only after contacting the service center. </p><p>  However, you can evaluate the phone‚Äôs performance, despite them, highly: the model, being a budget one, shows wide functionality and high technical characteristics.  But stability is lame here, which, however, can be improved by software updates to the smartphone.  If Huawei specialists work on this, then the Honor 4C will become an order of magnitude cooler device, corresponding to other requirements, and enjoying even greater popularity. </p>
