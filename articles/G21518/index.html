    <p>  <strong>How to get there</strong> </p><p>  Many are advised to fly by low-cost airlines - unless, of course, you prefer to travel on your own, and not as part of an excursion group.  However, if you live near <span>the Austrian capital</span> and at the same time on the Danube, for example, in Slovakia, you can afford to travel along this famous river on a catamaran.  The views will be guaranteed amazing.  Well, if you think that it is better to save on transport and see more attractions, choose a bus.  But no matter what you come there, in front of you is her beautiful Vienna. </p><p>  <strong>Reviews of tourists about the atmosphere</strong> </p><p>  Most of the people who have visited this city with a romantic nature say that there is something special in it - something that you will not see in any other place.  And this, of course, is music.  The crowns are just obsessed with it.  Eyes run up from announcements announcing concerts - both Strauss and Mozart, so foreign, in particular, German and Russian composers.  But the music in this city is not only listened to, it is also eaten!  She is so strange, this Vienna ... Reviews of tourists about the desserts they liked in the Vienna capital mention sweets and cakes that bear the names of Mozart, Beethoven and so on.  But regardless of music and composers, not to visit the local pastry shops - this means a lot to lose in this life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vienna tourist reviews 2013" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/277065.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Dessert</strong> </p><p>  Viennese coffee (especially recommended imperial, with the aroma of which nothing can be compared), strudel and other pastries are not prepared anywhere else like that.  Well, maybe in Budapest and in Lviv.  But this is because once Vienna was also the capital for these cities.  The reviews of tourists, however, assure that the prices for all these goodies, as well as for cheeses, tea and drinks, are pretty high, but it‚Äôs worth it, isn‚Äôt it?  This is a city where people with a delicate taste live.  And their sense of life is also very sophisticated.  They love the measured atmosphere, where you can feel every minute and spend it with pleasure.  Even women often buy flowers for themselves just like that and walk around breathing in the scent.  Especially since shops selling amazingly beautiful bouquets in the Austrian capital are also found on almost every corner. </p>

    <p>  <strong>How to get around</strong> </p><p>  In winter, walking along the streets of the old city is no less pleasant than in summer, with only one difference.  Coldly.  Therefore, there is one secret how to explore the sights of the historic center, enjoying the sight that Vienna represents in winter.  Reviews of tourists recommend traveling around the city by tram D, which actually goes along the tour route.  If you take a good guide with you and buy a daily ticket for public transport for a few euros, you can sit and go at any stop.  And so for a little money and for several hours to see the Cathedral of St. Stefan, Hofburg, palaces and museums.  But parks are better to watch in the summer.  But for traveling in the warm season, of course, you should walk on foot - because the atmosphere of the city is more familiar with it.  And if you get tired, Vienna will come to the rescue here too.  Reviews tourists 2013 call to rent a bike.  It's not very expensive, popular, there are special tracks everywhere.  And if you weren‚Äôt able to find out something right away in the information center for visitors, the good-natured crowns will always tell you and describe in full details where to go and go. </p>
