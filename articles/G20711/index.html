    <h2>  Car insurance </h2><p>  A lot of Russians trust this type of insurance specifically to Rosgosstrakh.  In order to take out insurance for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, a citizen will need a passport, registration of a vehicle, a driver‚Äôs license and a document confirming the passage of a technical inspection. </p><p>  In any of the company‚Äôs offices, as well as on the website, you can either issue or extend an insurance policy that is issued for three, six or twelve months.  The most popular, of course, are insurance policies for 1 year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The document can be distributed to all persons who will drive a car, or limited to specific people who are allowed to drive this vehicle.  Not only the amount of the policy depends on this item, but also the payments of Rosgosstrakh, if any. </p><p>  The cost of insurance may depend on the following factors: </p><ul><li>  car categories; </li><li>  its motor; </li><li>  length of service for the driver and his age; </li><li>  place of residence and registration; </li><li>  Accidents in which the car owner recently got. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the specific persons and their TS, there are objective reasons affecting the cost. </p>

    <h2>  Payments of Rosgosstrakh in 2016 </h2><p>  Data at the beginning of 2016, published by the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers,</span> showed a disappointing result for this large company.  It turned out that Rosgosstrakh's compulsory motor third-party liability insurance payments amounted to 8.5 billion rubles, while there were fewer fees: only 7.7 billion rubles.  It should be noted that the minus indicator happened for the first time in 13 years. </p><p>  After tariffs for compulsory motor liability insurance increased at the end of last year, premiums were more than payments by almost two billion rubles.  But at the beginning of 2016, the market share fell sharply by almost ten percent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Rosgosstrakh itself does not comment on insurance payments.  However, the company believes that such an indicator does not at all indicate that the organization may leave certain regions.  Payments turned out to be more premiums because they were calculated at the rates that were formed last year.  At the same time, at the beginning of 2016, Rosgosstrakh announced that OSAGO was no longer interested in the company.  And in late March, the company even suspended electronic insurance sales.  According to the SAR, as many as two-thirds of electronic policies are related to Rosgosstrakh.  Losses have become somewhat less, but still continue to grow.  In addition to this company, other insurers are sounding the alarm.  Many, however, associate the crisis also with the actions of auto lawyers. </p>

    <h2>  Losses of the company - profit of car lawyers </h2><p>  Some insurance companies are sure that it is the outrages of auto lawyers that lead to a crisis in the system.  Therefore, they even plan to introduce draft laws with amendments so that all insurers have enough tariffs for their normal functioning. </p><p>  But, if insurance companies care about their profits, ordinary car owners expect that they will receive compensation in the event of an accident that will cover all expenses for vehicle repairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Having studied thematic forums, it turns out that, in the opinion of many car owners, Rosgosstrakh's payments in road accidents are underestimated.  It is for this reason that they are forced to seek the help of professional lawyers in order to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù the amount necessary for repairs from the insurance company.  As you can see, many of them are successful in court.  As a result, insurers suffer losses and, in turn, underestimate payments.  It turns out a vicious circle.  But back to the insurance. </p><h2>  Voluntary insurance </h2><p>  In addition to compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, <span>voluntary</span> CASCO <span>insurance</span> exists.  It differs from compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in that it compensates Rosgosstrakh in case of an accident in case of damage to the car during an attack, accident, theft and other situations.  For experienced drivers, there is a separate type of policy called ‚ÄúAnti-CASCO CASCO‚Äù.  Its cost, in comparison with the usual, is less than half. </p><p>  As a supplement to CTP, you can buy DSAGO or DGO, in which damage is compensated if it is caused through the fault of the car owner. </p>

    <h2>  CTP: insurance payout </h2><p>  The insurance company pays money in the event of an insured event if: </p><ul><li>  the car of the accident participant who is innocent of what happened was damaged; </li><li>  traffic lights or signs are damaged; </li><li>  injured driver or passengers. </li></ul><p>  Compensation for damage to life and health can be up to five hundred rubles, and property - up to four hundred.  Payment can be made both in cash and through repair work.  In the latter case, if the damage to the vehicle is caused more than the company can pay, the culprit should be compensated for the missing amount. </p><p>  An insurance company no later than 15 days after the incident must provide a passport, certificate, vehicle registration certificate, a certificate <span>of an accident, a notice of an accident</span> and a copy of the protocol. </p><h2>  What to do if the payment amount is underestimated </h2><p>  So, the documents have been submitted, and you expect to receive a payment for the implementation of repair work.  But suddenly it turns out that the amount received on the account is clearly underestimated and will not cover all expenses when the vehicle is brought back to normal.  What could be your actions? </p><p>  Someone will take what they offer and stop there.  And others will seek a fair payment.  If you have chosen the second path for yourself, then you will have to order an independent examination so that you can prove the understated amount in the future, suing Rosgosstrakh.  The payment amount is disputed by the following preliminary actions: </p><ul><li>  filing an application at the office where the policy was issued; </li><li>  hotline call; </li><li>  appeal to the leadership. </li></ul><p>  It happens that such actions are enough to review the payment.  However, if the company still refuses to increase the amount, you can file a complaint with the PCA, then contact the legal advice and, after the actions recommended there, file a claim. </p><h2>  Peer review </h2><p>  Almost all consultations will tell you that it is necessary to order an independent examination.  This service is popular with car owners.  After all, appraisers of insurers, as a rule, are not so independent.  For example, they may not notice hidden defects that will be detected only during repair.  And then this breakdown will have to be paid from the pocket of the injured party. </p><p>  Independent examination, ordered independently, must be paid.  But, if the results of the examination do not coincide with that carried out by the insurers, and you will challenge it in court, the statement of claim must indicate that the costs of the independent examination by the insurer are reimbursed. </p><p>  Moreover, if the amount of CASCO payments is disputed, experienced car lawyers include a claim for non-pecuniary damage, which in the case of voluntary insurance is often satisfied by the court, and insurance companies do not mind. </p><h2>  Independent Expertise </h2>

    <p>  So, an independent examination is carried out as follows.  A participant in an accident orders a service and pays for it, receiving a payment document (on the basis of which expenses will be charged in court).  It is advisable to describe the nuances that seem to him controversial in assessing the insurance company.  For example, no latent defects were detected. </p><p>  If necessary, independent appraisers agree on the place and time of the inspection with third parties.  Upon examination, all vehicle damage resulting from an accident is carefully recorded by photographing and a detailed description.  Next, accurate calculations of the necessary spare parts and restoration work are carried out.  Valid amounts from authorized dealers are taken into account if the car is serviced by him, or average market.  The wear factor is also important.  Information on prices is taken from large online portals or stores in the region where the accident occurred.  An <span>expert opinion is being</span> prepared <span>.</span>  Often in such organizations they offer further legal support, that is, the conduct of business in court. </p><h2>  Compensation Payments </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh does not make payments in the case of the compensation plan.  This is done by PCA.  The following grounds are required for compensation: </p><ul><li>  bankruptcy of the UK; </li><li>  expiration of her license; </li><li>  the perpetrator of the damage to the victim is not identified; </li><li>  the culprit has no insurance policy of any insurance company, including Rosgosstrakh. </li></ul><p>  <span>Compensation</span> is for OSAGO insurance.  They depend on the salary and other income of the injured person, as well as on the costs of treating injuries sustained in an accident.  Compensation payments relating to the life and health of insured persons vary from 24 to 60,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Payout Amount </h2><p>  After the application for payment is filed with Rosgosstrakh along with other documents, it remains to wait for the decision of the insurance company.  Of course, many people want to quickly find out the amount to be named.  But, having visited the company‚Äôs website, you will not know anything but the status of the case and the number of your payment order. </p><p>  Information on the decision that was made is sent to the e-mail and message on the phone.  You will be informed about the status if you call the Rosgosstrakh company contact number.  To learn the payment in monetary terms, none of these methods will work. </p><h2>  How to find out the amount of payment, and in what time frame will the money go to the account? </h2><p>  Are there any ways to find out this information by case number?  Not.  The amount will be known only when the case is considered and the money is transferred to the bank.  Transfer after the decision is made within three business days.  However, the payment terms of Rosgosstrakh do not apply to this.  The case, according to the regulations, is considered 30 days.  In addition, the timing may be individual. </p><p>  At this time, you can calculate the approximate amount of payment yourself.  On the official website of the company there is an online calculator, with which you can also focus on a certain size.  But in it, rather, you can find out about the amount in the event of an accident.  But on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and motor hull insurance it will be necessary to wait for which Rosgosstrakh decides to make payments. </p><h2>  Reviews: agree with the decision or sue </h2>

    <p>  Many, through their sad experience, were convinced that in most cases <span>, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance for accidents is</span> underestimated.  Sometimes the underpayment can reach 80%.  What to do in such cases, car owners, it is up to them. </p><p>  Some want to quickly understand everything and take the amount that they are given.  Others seek legal advice and sue the company. </p><p>  As practice shows, even the management of the UK confirms this, auto lawyers "rob" insurers if they get down to business.  And this means that if the participant in an accident decides to sue, then there are good chances to achieve a positive result. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews that the drivers who have already passed these tests leave, more and more people decide not to agree with the understated payment, but fight to get such an amount that will fully compensate the repair work on the car.  However, even if Rosgosstrakh objectively should not increase the amount of payment, it can be requested from the culprit of the accident. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  This is the case with Rosgosstrakh today, such are its payments to policyholders.  Of course, any company is faced with dissatisfied customers.  And if initially the reason is very nervous and unpleasant, then positive emotions are not always born. </p><p>  But, on the other hand, paying insurance regularly, the car owner has the right to rely on the payment promised by law.  Therefore, if an accident occurs, you should seek a fair decision in your case.  Indeed, the payment of insurance Rosgosstrakh should cover the repair of a car that got into an accident not through the fault of the owner. </p>
