The Cathedral is the third largest temple in the UK and is truly impressive in its scale and magnificent decoration.  The amazing creation of human hands majestically rises on a hill above the city.  This is the place that you must visit during a tour to England. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.2342968" data-lng="-0.5360156000000416" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/3/2/5/9325.png"></div><h2>  Cathedral History </h2><p>  In ancient times, at the place where the cathedral now stands, were the defensive fortresses of the ancient Romans.  The very first basilica in the city of Lincoln in England was built under the supervision of Bishop Polynus.  It stood 200 years before it was burned by the Vikings along with the rest of the city. </p><p>  After some time, a new cathedral was built, made in the Romanesque style.  The temple was surrounded by defensive fortifications, which made it look like an impregnable castle.  Unfortunately, the cathedral was again destroyed by fire.  A new temple was erected on its ruins in 1072, to which fate was also unfavorable: the ancient basilica was destroyed by a powerful earthquake. </p><p>  The monumental Lincoln Cathedral of the Virgin Mary, which we see today, was built under the direction of Bishop Hugo.  The construction of the cathedral lasted more than 100 years and was completed in 1290.  Thanks to the 160-meter spire that towered over the surrounding area, the basilica has long been considered the tallest building in the world and surpassed even the Egyptian pyramids in size.  In the middle of the XVI century, the proud title of the tallest building was removed due to the fact that the tower collapsed under its own weight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Building's facade </h2><p>  Description of Lincoln Cathedral should begin with its facade.  Before going inside, it is recommended to go around the building in a circle, enjoying the beauty of its design. </p><p>  The architectural style of Lincoln Cathedral is the style of early English Gothic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Western facade" class="if uuid-2848319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2848319.jpg"></div><p>  The temple building is asymmetric and differs in that the portals are placed rather randomly and are located in non-traditional places for structures of this kind. </p><p>  Of particular interest is the Western facade, resembling a horizontally elongated screen.  The facade is not distinguished by a large number of sculptures, its distinctive feature is carved ornaments, the main part of which is geometric.  In the depths of the central arch of the Western facade you can see the Romanesque portal, richly decorated with sculptures and columns that complete the carved capitals. </p><p>  The south facade is crowned with a rose window, which is called the "Eye of the Bishop".  On the Northern facade you can see a similar window called "The Eye of the Superior". </p><p>  The "Bishop's Eye" has stained glass, preserved to this day from the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose window" class="if uuid-2848341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2848341.jpg"></div><p>  The eastern part of the temple can truly be called a masterpiece of <span>English architecture,</span> it is distinguished by skillfully executed openwork carvings and richly decorated protruding parts of the wall - striped buttresses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  The interior of St. Nicholas Cathedral stands out for its noble architectural forms.  A special pride of the cathedral is the "Angel Choir", made in the style of English Gothic.  It is famous for the most complicated architectural decor.  The choir is decorated with thirty monumental sculptures. </p><p>  Inside the cathedral are rows of wooden benches, the backs of which are decorated with carvings depicting Roman soldiers.  The attention of tourists is attracted by colored stained-glass windows on the windows through which light enters the temple.  Guests of the cathedral, who were lucky enough to be inside on a sunny day, say that the beauty of the sun's rays pouring through the stained-glass windows is simply breathtaking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thebaedekerraids.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral Interior" class="if uuid-2848326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2848326.jpg"></div><h2>  Cathedral Attractions </h2><p>  There is a library at the cathedral, which houses a large collection of medieval manuscripts.  A great contribution to the development of the library was made by the English architect and mathematician Christopher Wren.  He transferred to the ownership of the temple a large number of books and historical documents. </p><p>  Being inside the temple, one cannot help but notice the magnificent organ that was created during the Victorian era. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Organ in the cathedral" class="if uuid-2848306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2848306.jpg"></div><p>  In Lincoln Cathedral you can visit the grave of Bishop Hugo of Lincoln, who, after his death, was canonized.  A huge number of pilgrims from all over the UK come to his tomb every year. </p><h2>  Temple legends </h2><p>  Of course, the medieval temple has its secrets and legends.  So, on the northern wall of the Angel Choir, if you look closely, you can see a small figurine of an imp.  According to legend, in the middle of the white for Stan decided to release his imp children for a walk.  A strong wind caught two imps and brought them to Lincoln.  They were so struck by the incredible grandeur of the cathedral that at first they were afraid to enter inside, but one of them could not resist the temptation to slander inside the temple. </p><p>  The little devil set the band to the bishop, pushed the priest, and prevented the church choir from singing with his howl.  Disgrace was stopped by angels descending from heaven.  With their eyes they made the imp frolic under the arch of the temple petrify.  Today, visitors to the Lincoln Cathedral can see the forever frozen figure of the unclean on the wall of the choir. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Little devil in the cathedral" class="if uuid-2848348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2848348.jpg"></div><h2>  Schedule and cost of visiting </h2><p>  Those wishing to admire the facade of the cathedral can do this at any time of the day or night.  You can get inside from May to August from 10:00 to 18:00.  From September to April - from 10:00 to 17:00.  From October to March - from 10:00 to 16:00. </p><p>  The cost of visiting the cathedral is $ 5. </p><p>  A monumental building with luxurious finishes, incredibly beautiful facades and breathtaking interiors is an indispensable part of any tour to England. </p>
