It should be noted that such a financial instrument is significantly different from the usual discount product cards that are offered in competitors' trading networks.  Auchan VISA Classic is more than just a card of a regular customer of this chain of hypermarkets, but at least a full-fledged product of the bank.  The card is supported by the Visa international payment system, so its owners have the opportunity to make payments and purchases in Russia, abroad and on the Web.  In addition, you can withdraw cash from this card at ATMs or, conversely, replenish your account.  Reviews for the Auchan card will be presented at the end of the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="east-fruit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="map auchan europe bank reviews" class="if uuid-3210973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210973.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  Auchan VISA Classic card is a settlement debit co-branding card with overdraft lending.  Moreover, the grace period on this card is 50 days.  Thus, during this time, money spent without interest can be returned.  If it did not manage to meet the preferential stage, then the loan rate will be from 27.5 to 31.5%.  You can repay the loan by paying monthly installments, each of which is 3% of the total debt (however, in any case, it cannot be less than 200 rubles).  In addition, it is necessary to take into account the process of repaying borrowed funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the cardholder fails to pay the loan on time, the banking organization has the full right to raise the interest rate to 59.9% per annum (such interest will be charged on the unpaid amount).  In addition, for example, fines for late repayment of a loan may be levied on debtors.  According to reviews, the Auchan Credit card is still very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card auchan credit reviews" class="if uuid-3210974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210974.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Some of the differences that the Auchan VISA Classic card has are certainly of particular interest to those who want to use this financial product in the future. </p><p>  For example, one of the favorable conditions of use is that the bonus card has been functioning for two years, after which you can issue a new one if necessary.  Reviews on the Auchan credit card are mostly positive. </p><p>  Another feature of the card is that the fee for its maintenance per year is from 350 to 470 rubles.  (at the same time, there is a dependence on the region where the card holder lives).  It is possible to issue another, additional card to the same person.  Moreover, in the first year its maintenance is carried out absolutely free of charge, in the second year the amount for maintenance is 175 rubles.  The commission for withdrawing cash from the card is 4.5%, but not less than 399 rubles.  In this case, you can cash out no more than ¬º of the credit limit.  Payment of SMS notifications - from 50 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The discount card supports 3D Secure and PayWave.  There is a chip and a magnetic strip, free internet banking is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="filipinotimes.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card auchan credit europe reviews" class="if uuid-3210975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210975.jpg"></div><h2>  bonus program </h2><p>  It is better to familiarize yourself with the reviews on the Auchan Credit card from Europe Bank in advance.  This product has a very beneficial bonus loyalty program for users.  At the same time, bonuses are accrued when paying with a card all over the world, including while making purchases on the Internet. </p><p>  If you make purchases in the Auchan chain of stores, then the client receives 1% of bonuses or points from the amount of payments.  When making purchases in other stores, this percentage will be equal to 0.8%.  When a person accumulates a certain amount of bonus points, he can exchange them for gift cards.  1 bonus corresponds to 1 ruble according to the loyalty program. </p><h2>  Partners with whom you can get a discount </h2><p>  Major partners include: </p><ul><li>  Adamas jewelry store chain (discount on all goods purchased with a card is 5 percent); </li><li>  watch salon "3-15" (5% discount on all goods purchased on the card); </li><li>  network of dry cleaners Nikko (10% discount when paying with a card); </li><li>  Imperial Porcelain Factory (5% discount). </li></ul><p>  A complete list of partners can be found on the website of this trading network.  It is interesting that if the partner has its own discount program, then in certain cases the discounts will be added up.  The reviews on the Auchan Credit card from Europe Bank confirm this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneyaftergraduation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card auchan credit europe bank reviews" class="if uuid-3210976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210976.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get a card of this type? </h2><p>  Before you receive an Auchan discount card, you need to make sure that all the conditions that apply to potential owners of this financial instrument are met.  The list of such conditions includes: </p><ol><li>  Cards can be issued exclusively to citizens of the Russian Federation aged 21-65 years.  A client who applies for a card must have a working experience in one place of no more than 4 months. </li><li>  If the client is an individual entrepreneur, he must be presented with the appropriate document - certificate of registration of individual entrepreneurs and a tax return. </li><li>  Indication of three different telephone numbers in the region of residence (at the place of work, home and one additional). </li></ol><p>  You can order a card on the Internet, on oney.ru, or with a personal visit to the Auchan hypermarket in the lending department.  It should be noted the special convenience of this method - after processing the card, you can immediately go shopping.  In addition, it must be understood that the application online is preliminary, in the end, in order to pick up the card, you still have to visit the Auchan store.  Many people leave credit card reviews from Europe Bank right there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="says.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card auchan reviews" class="if uuid-3210977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210977.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents required for issuing a card </h2><p>  To obtain a card, you only need a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  With the necessary limit of more than 350,000 rubles.  Be sure to provide documents directly confirming income: </p><ul><li>  income statement (form 2-PIT); </li><li>  income statement; </li><li>  statement on the salary account, which is opened in the name of the client, indicating the operations on it (the statement is provided for the last 4 months, it must be certified by the signature of the bank employee and seal); </li><li>  IP tax return in accordance with the applicable taxation scheme. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.mycreditfile.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card auchan europe bank reviews" class="if uuid-3210978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210978.jpg"></div><h2>  In which cities are there stores in which this card is useful? </h2><p>  Today, the Auchan chain of stores is represented not only in St. Petersburg and in Moscow.  Auchan stores, where you can get a card, also work in cities such as Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Omsk, Ryazan, etc. To apply for a card, if the client claims a credit limit of no more 20 000 rubles., Only one document is required - a passport.  In order for the credit limit to exceed 20,000 rubles, additional documents will be required. </p><h2>  How to close a card? </h2><p>  Close the Auchan card, if suddenly the client has ceased to need it, it will not be difficult.  To do this, you need to contact the office of Europe Bank or the credit department of the store, where you should fill out a written application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auchan map" class="if uuid-3210979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210979.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on the Auchan map </h2><p>  Feedback from customers who used the Auchan card is rather controversial.  Some of them note that it is very beneficial to use this card in cases when purchases are regularly made from this chain of stores.  In addition, users do not recommend taking large loans on the card, since sanctions for default are quite serious.  And such cases often occur, for example, when a salary is delayed and a person does not manage to make a mandatory monthly payment on time. </p><p>  Customers who have left negative reviews for the Auchan card note that it is completely unprofitable.  In their opinion, the developers of this card earn on the deception of ordinary people.  For example, the bonus program provided for by the card does not work at all as originally intended.  In addition, many of these people, for some reason, worry that their personal data obtained when opening the card will be illegally used by unauthorized persons.  Also, people expressed their dissatisfaction in the reviews of the Auchan card about the amount of accrued interest, indicating that such rates are excessively high, and owning a card does not do any good. </p>
