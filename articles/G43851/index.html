    <p>  Desperate, especially zealous women can angrily free their wardrobe, and in such a radical way that they really are left with nothing.  But if old things are tired of order and there is a desire to recreate, you can try to implement a line from the once famous song: ‚ÄúI blinded you from what it was ...‚Äù And to be more precise, we will tell you how to make a dress from a T-shirt.  Big skills or talents are not needed for this, and even less will be needed from sewing material - one or several old t-shirts of large size (at the same time you can clean the boyfriend‚Äôs shelf). </p><h2>  The impossible is possible </h2><p>  Skeptics will argue that such a task is a monkey work, and nothing worthwhile can come out of this venture.  But really, how to make a dress out of a T-shirt, and even such that it looks decent and fits nicely on the figure?  That's the beauty of this alteration.  Knitwear is an excellent material, it is very pliable, drapes well, does not require processing of cuts.  In addition, most of the clothes that are suitable for future new clothes are sewn from fabrics that are safe and pleasant to the body.  For their greater elasticity, manufacturers include in addition to cotton a small amount of elastane or other synthetic constituents.  But their number is so tiny that it is not even felt during wear, on the contrary, it allows the material to be brighter and more durable, it does not ‚Äúbubble‚Äù in places subject to frequent tension and other deformations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to make a dress out of a T-shirt is really interesting for you, but you are afraid to spoil the thing and do not imagine the final result, this article contains several photo publications that clearly demonstrate how simple the work to be done.  Even if the result is not too pleasing, it does not matter, because, in fact, you risk only old worn clothes, which you still were going to take to the dump. </p>

    <h2>  Raw materials and additional materials </h2><p>  It should be understood that the source material (also called a T-shirt) should not be faded, heavily washed or gaping with picturesque holes, otherwise it would be better to look for a workshop on weaving rugs from knitted flagella.  Worn clothes, even after a very high-quality alteration, will look untidy. </p><p>  An ideal option would be a new T-shirt, but not the right size, of course, that it cannot be small for its owner, rather, on the contrary, most of the works suggest ideas on how to make a dress out of a large T-shirt. </p><p>  Before you start work, it is important to figure out whether you have enough material, to consider not only the style of the dress itself, but also whether there will be decor on it.  You may need a few more T-shirts, which should be combined with each other in color and texture of the fabric, so that the finished product looks organic and natural. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For decoration, lace, rhinestones, buttons or decals are suitable.  Those who have artistic talent can try to make a pattern or drawing on the fabric.  As a simpler (but no less interesting alternative), you can use a stencil, with its help it is enough to print on the entire product or its individual part, and a fun, and most importantly, exclusive summer dress will delight its owner and her people with her extraordinary appearance. </p><p>  Tool and supplies need to be prepared a little: </p><ul><li>  a sewing machine (not always needed, below is information on how to make a dress out of a T-shirt without sewing); </li><li>  cutting scissors (or just sharp, but with long blades); </li><li>  threads </li><li>  needles; </li><li>  pins </li><li>  decorative materials (if necessary). </li></ul><p>  All this good is in almost any home, so you can safely get to work. </p><h2>  Handmade variations </h2><p>  There are several ways of making a <span>dress</span> from a T-shirt <span>with your own hands,</span> and each of them can be finalized by adding your own exclusive touches to the craft.  The simplest and most affordable option is to take very large clothes and, lowering the T-shirt to the chest through the neck, tuck both sleeves inward.  This method does not require cutting and sewing, so you can not be afraid to spoil the thing.  As a result, you can get a great strapless home or <span>beach dress</span> .  A loose style, the absence of strapless and straps will not allow to evaporate even on the hottest day. </p>

    <p>  Other methods require reshaping and stitching the details of the future dress among themselves, so for their manufacture you need a sewing machine and some skills.  Note that knitted fabric is quite delicate and specific in work.  To facilitate the process of laying stitches, it is better to use a special needle for knitwear, its feature is that it does not cut through interwoven threads, but gently passes through them.  Due to this, ugly holes are not formed in the material, which eventually let the arrows. </p><h2>  Work technology </h2><p>  A little time-consuming process will be the overhaul of several T-shirts, but, which is noteworthy, for this it is not necessary to look for clothes of size XXL, you can use your fed up wardrobe.  A fitted T-shirt or short-sleeved T-shirt that needs to be cut along the waistline will act as the top of the future dress.  Next, sheets of other colors are hemmed to it.  The height of the received ‚Äúpipes‚Äù of needlewomen vary, as a result, the dress can be of different lengths, from a very short mini to maxi-style. </p>

    <h2>  Bright sundress from nothing </h2><p>  The following method demonstrates how to make a dress from a men's t-shirt.  Of course, you can take a female one, but you should look for a rather large size, because the alteration requires cutting out details that, after stitching, will become a dress.  As you can see in the photo below, this method requires trimming the sleeves and neck.  The rest of the t-shirt needs to be cut taking into account the bends of the female figure, making a chest and waist line on the workpiece. </p>

    <p>  The next step will be trimming the part that will hold the dress on his chest so that it does not fall off, you need to insert an elastic band into it.  It can be a narrow elastic band in the upper and lower parts of the chest.  As an alternative, seamstresses often use rubberized thread, which is sewn with a sewing machine and will turn the entire part into a wide elastic band.  Having sewed the bottom and top together, laying the side lines, you get a cute dress made by yourself. </p><h2>  Art decor </h2><p>  Women's clothing is charming in that ladies complement it with a variety of accessories and trinkets.  You can also modify something in your dress.  To do this, you can sew a ruffle or a beautiful braid to an initially simple style.  The use of decals, beads, buttons and stones of different sizes will become an even simpler decoration option.  In hardware stores, sellers offer a wide variety of <span>clothing decor items.</span> </p><p>  This article contains several options on how to make a dress out of a T-shirt, but in fact there are much more, and most importantly, any of them can be made by a craftswoman to your taste and discretion, but we wish you creative success and inspiration in your work ! </p>
