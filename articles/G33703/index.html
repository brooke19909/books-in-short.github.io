How to get a tax deduction for buying an apartment?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To purchase any apartment you need to spend a fairly large amount of money.  For this, personal savings of customers or borrowed money can be used, for which a mortgage is issued.  In this case, the state offers special compensation for the purchase of an apartment.  In another way, it is called property deduction, and it is paid exclusively to people with an official salary.  The privilege is represented by the return of personal income tax, which was paid for the buyer by his employer within one year. </p><h2>  The concept of benefits </h2><p>  A property deduction can be made out when buying not only an apartment, but also other significant property represented by a piece of land, a house or a room.  The process of processing compensation for the purchase of an apartment is regulated.  220 Tax Code.  Its main purpose is the ability to buy housing, as well as use a certain amount to pay off a mortgage or improve real estate. </p><p>  The benefit is paid only on condition that the buyer works officially, therefore the employer pays personal income tax for him.  In this case, you can expect a return of 13% of the value of the property.  But there are some limits, so it is impossible to get more than 260 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arcequity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return the tax deduction for the purchase of an apartment" class="if uuid-3044834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044834.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it issued? </h2><p>  Tax compensation for an apartment is considered an important benefit for each property buyer.  It can be made out at the tax office, and also each person can come to the employer with the necessary package of documents for registration of benefits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The deduction is provided only if there are the following types of costs: </p><ul><li>  purchase or construction of housing; </li><li>  the acquisition of a plot of land, which is then used to build a house; </li><li>  payment of interest on a mortgage; </li><li>  decoration or repair of residential premises, but such expenses are compensated solely on the condition that the contract indicates the sale of real estate without repair, as the cosmetic restoration is not refundable. </li></ul><p>  For registration of compensation after the purchase of an apartment, it is required to prepare certain documentation confirming the existence of official and suitable expenses. </p><h2>  When not assigned? </h2><p>  The privilege cannot be obtained if the transaction is carried out between related parties.  They are represented by relatives, spouses, as well as employers and subordinates.  Therefore, if it is revealed that the taxpayers tried to deceive the employees of the Federal Tax Service in order to use the return without legal grounds, then you will have to return all the funds received earlier, as well as pay a fine. </p><p>  Additionally, compensation has a limited size, so if the limit is exhausted, then it will be impossible to contact the Federal Tax Service again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dinero.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tax compensation when buying an apartment" class="if uuid-3044836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044836.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefit Size </h2><p>  Compensation of personal income tax when buying an apartment has a limited size.  Therefore, each taxpayer should take into account the following points: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  13% of the value of the object is returned; </li><li>  as much as possible you can get 13% of 2 million rubles. Therefore, even if the property costs more than 2 million rubles, only 260 thousand rubles are issued, after which the return is considered fully used; </li><li>  if the apartment costs about 1 million rubles, then only half of the benefits are returned, therefore, with subsequent purchases, you can apply for the rest of the compensation; </li><li>  in addition, you can arrange a refund for interest on the mortgage if the housing was purchased while a large loan was issued, and for this benefit, the maximum amount with which 13% is calculated is 3 million rubles .; </li><li>  annually you can receive only the amount equal to the amount of funds paid over the past year as personal income tax, and you can find out this information when contacting the employer and when receiving a 2-personal income tax certificate. </li></ul><p>  If the housing is bought by several persons, then they can independently determine how the return will be divided.  For this, a special statement is usually drawn up, indicating the share of each person.  If there is no such statement, then each buyer can receive compensation for the purchase of an apartment on the basis of his share recorded in Rosreestr. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myperfectmortgage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get compensation for the purchase of an apartment" class="if uuid-3044833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044833.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  Each taxpayer must figure out how to get compensation for the purchase of an apartment so that there are no difficulties with applying for this benefit.

It is represented by personal income tax paid for a year of work of a citizen. </li><li>  Transfer of documentation to the employer.  In this case, a person will not be able to count on receiving a large amount, since he will simply receive his salary in full, since personal income tax will not be collected from it.  The procedure will be performed until the benefits are exhausted.  The advantage of the method is that it is not required to prepare documents every year for registration of benefits. </li></ul><p>  Each citizen independently decides which method will be applied to them.

To do this, the following actions are performed: </p><ul><li>  Initially, it is necessary to take a certificate to the Federal Tax Service that the citizen really has the right to compensation, so an application of the appropriate form and title documents for the apartment are sent to the service department; </li><li>  the received certificate from the Federal Tax Service along with the application is transmitted to the accounting department of the company where the taxpayer works; </li><li>  The documentation is recorded by the accountant, after which from the next month the citizen will be paid in full his salary, which is not levied by personal income tax. </li></ul><p>  The peculiarity of obtaining a deduction through an employer is that you will have to prepare documentation only once, after which for several years a citizen will receive a salary without calculating personal income tax until all compensation is used.  If you understand how you can get compensation for the purchase of an apartment, then a decision is easily made on how the procedure will be performed. </p><h2>  When are documents submitted to the Federal Tax Service? </h2><p>  If the taxpayer wishes to receive a deduction through the branch of the Federal Tax Service, then the following nuances are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  it is advisable to submit documents to the Federal Tax Service at the beginning of each year in order to return the personal income tax paid for the last year of work; </li><li>  a citizen must have title documents for real estate; </li><li>  it is allowed to apply for a privilege even when buying a house on the basis of the DDU; </li><li>  there are no restrictions on the deadline for submitting documentation, so it can be prepared at any time; </li><li>  you can skip three years to request a refund for this period of time; </li><li>  Compensation can be requested for several years until the benefit has been fully exhausted. </li></ul><p>  Any buyer of real estate should understand how to return the tax deduction for the purchase of an apartment.

The task of tax inspectors is to study the content of the papers, since it is important to make sure that such a privilege is not applied by a scammer, but by a person who is really entitled to compensation. </p><p>  Verification takes a maximum of 3 months.  After that, within another month, money is transferred to the citizen's bank account.  If there are reasons for refusal, the applicant will have to correct them.  Usually the refusal is due to errors in the 3-NDFL declaration or statement.  Additionally, a negative decision is made in the absence of the necessary documents. </p><p>  You can find out about the status of the application directly on the website of the Federal Tax Service or on the Gosuslug portal. </p><h2>  Features for unemployed or senior citizens </h2><p>  This benefit is represented by the return of personal income tax, so if a person who is a buyer of real estate does not have official work, therefore personal income tax is not paid to him in the budget, then he will not be able to receive a deduction. </p><p>  Compensation is not made for non-working citizens or individuals working under simplified taxation regimes.  Compensation for the purchase of an apartment may be paid to pensioners, but subject to the following rules: </p><ul><li>  if a person continues to work in retirement, he can apply for a refund, since the employer pays personal income tax for him; </li><li>  a pensioner may request a refund for the last three years during which he has officially worked, but for this he will have to contact the former employer to obtain a 2-personal income tax certificate for this period of time. </li></ul><p>  Personal income tax is not paid from a pension, so if the buyer of the apartment receives any payment from the state, then he will not be able to apply for a benefit. </p><h2>  Can I reimburse compensation? </h2><p>  Compensation can be made up to a maximum of 260 thousand rubles, so if an apartment bought by a citizen costs less than 2 million rubles, then there is still a certain amount of funds that can be requested when re-buying real estate. </p><p>  For example, a man acquires a room in a communal apartment for 1.2 million rubles.  He receives a deduction for such an acquisition in the amount of 156 thousand rubles.  After 5 years, he buys a house, the value of which is 3 million rubles.  He has the opportunity to receive as a return only 104 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The deduction process is performed in a standard manner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.contourmortgage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Compensation for buying an apartment for pensioners" class="if uuid-3044838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044838.jpg"></div><h2>  The specifics of buying a property with several people </h2><p>  Often the buyers of the apartment are spouses or close relatives, so they get a certain share in this property.
