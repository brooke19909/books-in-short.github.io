To make them is not difficult.  In the process of their creation, various improvised tools and materials are used.  There is nothing complicated in the manufacturing technology of such masterpieces for children.  Any dad can easily cope with this task, including one who does not have constant practice in their manufacture. </p><p>  <strong>Necessary materials and tools</strong> </p><p>  First, we will figure out the necessary list of tools and materials with which to make crafts for the kindergarten on the site.  Among the materials can be identified: <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts for kindergarten on the site." class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/265944.jpg" width="309"></div>

Using imagination, you can do something special, such as a giraffe.  But the most common are swans and miniature fences.  With the help of the latter, you can easily and easily demarcate the territory of the playground.  It is done as follows: a trench breaks out a little wider than the wheel, and a depth equal to half its height over the entire gap where such a fence will be installed.  The first tire is mounted vertically in it, filled with soil and rammed.  The second one is installed close to it and is fixed in the same way.  And so on until the entire perimeter of the future fence is covered.  In contrast to the previous case, only one tire is needed for manufacturing.  Marking is applied to its surface.  On the one hand, a tail should be obtained, and on the other, a head with a beak.  Then it all gets cut out.  After this blank is coated with white paint.  Then it should dry.  At the final stage, red paint is applied to the beak and black dots at the location of the eyes.  After drying, the bird is ready, and it can be taken to the playground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Plastic container</strong> </p><p>  Various crafts for the kindergarten on the site can be made using plastic containers.

Then they are connected using two lines that are located on one side of the tank.  The excess part is cut along this line.  Then the workpiece is covered with pink paint, which then has to dry.  At the next stage, black spots and eyes are applied with black paint.  Also in a similar way a patch should be framed, which is located on the lid.  After it dries, the pot is ready.  It only needs to be filled with soil and planted.

    <p>  The last type of material that is often used to decorate playgrounds is wood.  It allows you to create a variety of wooden crafts for kindergarten.  Among them, one of the most common is the goby.  To get started, you will need four identical sticks (these are legs), one large one (trunk), a small piece (head) and a small thick branch (neck).  Then they get off properly.  The legs are securely attached to the body and digged into the ground so as to exclude the possibility of overturning the workpiece.  Next, a neck is attached to the body, to which the head is then attached.  At the final stage, this statue is properly designed using a set of paints.  The bull is ready. </p><p>  <strong>Summary</strong> </p><p>  No problem, you can do any crafts for the territory of the kindergarten.  Thus, a wide variety of statues and animals can appear, which will turn it into something special.  For this, only desire is enough.  Everything else can be found without problems in the household. </p>
