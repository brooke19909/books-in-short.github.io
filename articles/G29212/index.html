It is hard to believe that a few years ago everyone did without mobile phones.  Then these small devices with black and white screens seemed something surprising.  They could be used exclusively for calls and sending SMS messages.  Today the market is filled with smartphones - phones that perform the functions of a small personal computer.  At the same time, the list of opportunities that mobile operators provide their subscribers is expanding.  Struggling for each client, they offer many tariff plans, additional services and options: paid and free.  Their list is constantly updated, conditions, cost are changing.  In order to learn how to navigate this variety, as well as to control their balance, a subscriber can register on the official website of his cellular company by receiving a password for his personal account.  The well-known telecom operator Megafon has a similar system called the Service Guide.  Any subscriber can use it absolutely free.  How to register in your MegaFon account?  Before answering this question, we will understand why this should be done. </p>

    <h2>  Personal account (Service-Guide system): opportunities </h2><p>  Despite the fact that there is no additional charge for registering in your personal account, not all subscribers use this procedure.  Why?  Most likely, many simply don‚Äôt know what opportunities Megafon opens up.  The Personal Account service allows you to manage your account without leaving your home or office, from any computer with Internet access.  In particular, you can change the current tariff plan, connect or refuse any service or option, get information about the balance status, receipts and expenditures of funds, find out about the number of bonuses accrued, and temporarily block the number.  And this is an incomplete list of actions that can be performed using the self-service service "Megaphone" "My Account".  Signing up for it is very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone service personal account" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20571/447254.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Mobile operator "Megaphone": personal account, password for entering the system </h2><p>  There are three ways to access your MegaFon account.  The first of these is as follows: on your mobile phone with a Megafon SIM card, you need to dial * 105 * 00 # and press the call button.

Login is carried out after entering the password, in connection with which it is desirable to change it to a more convenient one.  To do this, send the command * 105 * 01 # from your phone.  Then you must follow all the instructions of the system and change the password. </p><h2>  Personal account (Service Guide system): password recovery </h2><p>  If the password for the Megafon self-service service "My Account" is lost, you can enter the system in three ways.

It involves receiving a new password by sending a USSD command: * 105 * 00 #. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone personal account entrance" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20571/447273.jpg" width="350"></div>
