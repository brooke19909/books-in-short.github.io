In fact, there are more than enough such resorts around the world, and we‚Äôll talk about the features of some of them.  An important factor is also the sea, because it is precisely its turquoise waves that, as a rule, are ‚Äúhunted‚Äù by all tourists who dream of a century not to see frosty winters.  So, we‚Äôll try to figure out where the warm sea is in January and where it will be most interesting for the New Year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where it is warm in January" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The closest and most accessible country for a Russian traveler is Egypt.  The eternally hot and sunny Arab state, located in the northern part of Africa, attracts more and more tourists to its territories every year.  True, it is worth noting that not every <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Egypt has</span> temperatures rise too high.  If you crave the summer heat and the scorching sun, then you need to go to Hurghada or to the <span>Sinai Peninsula.</span>  But Alexandria and other northern resorts of Egypt are definitely not suitable for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where it is warm to relax in January" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276026.jpg" width="600"></div>

In winter, the thermometer often goes beyond 25, and the sea warms up to 23-24.  Despite the fact that the country is Muslim, the service and infrastructure are top notch.  In Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other large centers, there are giant retail stores where you can buy a bunch of things and trinkets. </p><p>  One of the most interesting and breathtaking countries is Thailand.  It is also ideal if you are looking for a place where it is warm in January.  It is in this mysterious country that the air temperature warms up to 30 degrees during the <span>winter holidays,</span> and sea water has about the same indicator.  The main resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãThailand is the central island of Pattaya, which has a lot of entertainment centers and city beaches.  The shores of Phuket, Samui and the "twins" Phi Phi are considered more quiet, but at the same time refined and expensive.  But most importantly, it is during the winter months that the highest waves rise on the islands of the Krabi archipelago, which attract windsurfers from all over the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the warm sea in January" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276027.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  They know the answer to the question of where it is warm in January, lovers of Africa.  In this region, near the equator, the hot sun constantly warms, and under it sand dunes and savannas spread over wide valleys.  An ideal <span>African country</span> for winter holidays is Kenya, which can offer both a safari tour and a measured beach vacation at the same time.  Here you can see real <span>African elephants,</span> giraffes, buffalos, leopards and zebras.  Pink flamingos live in the same region of unearthly beauty.  Therefore, be sure to visit Kenya, which is the embodiment of all African traditions and natural heritage. </p><p>  Of course, if you are looking for a place where it is warm, you can go on a vacation in January to any islands that are in the waters of the oceans.  The main thing is to study in advance the features of the archipelago to which you go, because the beliefs are different everywhere.  For example, the Canaries are a purely Spanish province, where the language, laws, and morality coincide with the mother country.  But the Maldives is a Muslim land where local residents highly honor all their traditions and live as it is written in the Quran. </p><p>  If you still doubt where it is warm in January, then go to South America.  Starting from Mexico and ending with Buenos Ares - all this is an area where there are no frosts or just low temperatures.  It is always warm and the sea and air. </p>
