Rhodes - this is where you can spend your vacation. </p><p>  By the way, this location is very convenient.  For example, within 100 meters there are two public beaches at once.  The center from the capital of the island with all its entertainment can be reached in a few minutes.  Just 150 meters away is the famous Rhodes casino, and the public transport stop is nearby - you can easily and cheaply travel around the area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not far away are the sights of the island, in particular its large ancient port.  Many tourists at least once visit the neighboring city of Faliraki, the distance to which is about 13 km.  Diagoras Airport is approximately 14 km from the hotel - upon arrival you will only have to quickly move, which will take no more than 15 minutes. </p><h2>  Hotel Diana Boutique Hotel 4 * (Greece, Rhodes): Information about the territory </h2>

    <p>  This is a small hotel complex of urban type.  It is located in a quiet area - nearby are other hotels, shops, cafes and bars.  Therefore, you should not count on a large yard.  The hotel consists of one multi-storey building and practically does not have its own territory, which, however, does not prevent guests from fully enjoying a beach holiday. </p><p>  By the way, not so long ago the building was completely renovated - today tourists enjoy the cleanliness, elegant atmosphere and the availability of modern equipment.  The building has elevators, so you don’t have to go upstairs on foot. </p><h2>  Room amenities: description and photos of rooms </h2>

    <p>  As indicated in the description, the Diana Boutique Hotel 4 * is located just 100 meters from the beaches - a convenient road leads to the shore.  You can relax on the popular Psaropula Diana beach or give preference to Elli beach, the distance to which is a little more - 300 m. In any case, you can be sure that you will find clean, soft sand, clear waters and, of course, gentle sun. </p><p>  Since these are public beaches, sometimes there are many tourists and even residents of the island who also do not mind relaxing on the shore.  For a few euros you can get a comfortable sunbed and umbrella to protect from sunlight.  In season, the sea is warm and waves rarely rise.  The entrance, by the way, is perfectly cleared. </p><p>  Of course, many tourists prefer a more active pastime - here you can go water skiing, snorkeling, rent motorless swimming vehicles, play volleyball, in a word, have fun and actively spend your holidays. </p><h2>  Should I count on an additional service? </h2><p>  Despite the relatively small size and number of rooms, the Diana Boutique Hotel complex provides its guests with everything necessary for a pleasant and comfortable stay.  Very close to the hotel there is free parking.  You can rent transport both in the city and directly in the hotel.  By the way, bicycles are also rented here - quite a popular transport among tourists. </p><p>  Guests have the right to use a luggage storage room.  The reception is open around the clock, and currency can be exchanged here at a favorable rate.  There is a small shop in the building selling small souvenirs and some useful household items. </p><h2>  Leisure tourist: what to do on the hotel? </h2><p>  It’s worth mentioning right away that there aren’t any entertainments at the Diana Boutique Hotel, because most of the guests return to their rooms only in the evening, and in the morning they all go to explore the surroundings again.  Here, however, there is a tourist information desk, where they will tell you about the most interesting sights and even offer to buy a sightseeing tour. </p><p>  Nevertheless, you should not be upset, as there are a lot of entertainment near the hotel, ranging from restaurants and nightclubs to museums and casinos, so no one is bored here. </p><h2>  Hotel Diana Boutique Hotel 4 *: reviews and experiences of tourists </h2>
