Its area is 35.5 km <sup>2</sup> .  The rivers flowing through its territory: Oka, Sitnya, Kashirka and Kremnitsa.  In the south, Stupino borders on the city of regional significance - Kashira.

Where Stupino is located, in 1578 the village of Kashirsky Uyezd was located in the possession of the Belopesotsky Monastery.  In 1931, the seat was chosen by the Communist Party secretariat for the construction of a train factory.  The territory was named the working village of Electric Locomotive.  Around the new enterprise grew a school, hospital and a bakery.  But it ceased to exist, and construction sites were used to establish new factories for the production of aircraft industry products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="smorodina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the creators of propellers in Stupino" class="if uuid-2618670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96726/2618670.jpg"></div><p>  In 1938, the village of Elektrovoz received the status of a city and was again named Stupino.
