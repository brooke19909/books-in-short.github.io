We regularly hear that this or that model is on sale, for example, the Megafon Login 3 tablet (its characteristics are given a bit further);  and in the advertising of the largest electronics networks, we have already ceased to notice at what prices and which devices are offered.  After the recent boom, too many players entered the tablet market, due to which most of them simply ‚Äúmerged‚Äù and ceased to be noticeable.  Either flagship devices from Apple, Samsung and Asus, or affordable, but branded computers from operators, stand out more.  One of these is the Megafon Login 3 tablet, the characteristics of which we will consider in this article. </p><h2>  General device information </h2>

    <p>  So, you should start with the fact that the Login 3 tablet is manufactured by Foxda by order of the largest Russian operator Megafon.  For the latter, the release of a budget entertainment device is profitable, at least in that, after purchase, his person becomes a network subscriber.  Consequently, in the future he begins to make regular payments for the use of communication services, the Internet and so on.  In fact, by offering cheap branded gadgets, the company "puts" people at its service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the benefits for customers, it is obvious: the Megafon Login 3 tablet (we will discuss its characteristics further) has quite tolerable functionality at an affordable price - only 3200 rubles.  Rather, on the operator‚Äôs website it is indicated that of this amount, 700 rubles is used to pay for Internet services under the Internet XS tariff plan, and the rest is the cost of the device.  However, you cannot purchase the device separately, without connecting to an operator. </p><h2>  What has been improved? </h2>

    <p>  The Login 3 model is not the first in the line of device models from Megafon.  In fact, before her, ‚ÄúLogin 2‚Äù was on sale, which had the worst camera, hardware and a different design.  In the third generation tablet, many of these shortcomings have been fixed.  Even if you pay attention to the photos of the gadget presented on the page of the Megafon store, you can see that the back cover of the device has become metal, which means it is more pleasant to touch.  In addition, if you believe that about the tablet ‚ÄúMegaphone Login 3‚Äù the characteristics say, the new generation has improved headphone mounts, charging cord, as well as navigation keys for adjusting the sound.  In general, it can be noted that in the third version of the tablet almost all systems were improved, which can not be praised. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Now consider what they offer at Megafon for 3200 rubles.  This is a TFT <span>IPS display with a</span> resolution of 1024 * 600, a 3G module for access to wireless mobile Internet, a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1.2 GHz, as well as a 3.2 megapixel camera.  The tablet comes with a 3500 mAh battery, which should be more than enough for a 7-inch device for 5-7 hours. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the latest version <span>of the Android operating system</span> under the number 4.4.4 (Kitkat) will be installed on the new tablet, though the store‚Äôs website does not specify whether further updates will be available on ‚ÄúLogin 3‚Äù. </p><p>  In general, according to the characteristics of a tablet computer, it can be described as a device from the lower-middle segment, where gadgets of Chinese manufacturers (noname) are located, as well as the brainchild of brands such as Lenovo, Nomi and others.  If we take into account the cost of the model, then it can be called low, even in comparison with competitors. </p><h2>  Cost and terms of purchase </h2><p>  About the price, by the way, it should be noted a few more nuances.  As already mentioned above, you can only buy a tablet if you pay for mobile Internet services (XS plan).  There is another important limitation - the computer will only work with a Megafon SIM card.  This means that the device is locked for this operator at the software level, and, according to official information, you can not insert another card there.  Of course, the "craftsmen" have already learned to remove this restriction, but this is illegal.  In order to purchase a ‚Äúclean‚Äù version, you will need to pay about 7,500 rubles for the Megafon Login 3 tablet (description, characteristics while remaining the same). </p><h2>  Nearest competitors </h2><p>  Of course, in modern market conditions, there are several similar tablet models that have similar characteristics, despite the fact that they are sold at different prices.  In addition to Chinese brands, as well as devices released without any name (they can be ordered on the Internet, for example), there are a number of gadgets.  So, this is the ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù of other operators - ‚ÄúMTS Tablet‚Äù (and ‚ÄúTablet Mini‚Äù), as well as ‚ÄúBeeline Tab‚Äù.  The latter, by the way, is somewhat inferior to the other two in terms of RAM and price;  in general, we can say that gadgets are similar.  The only significant difference between them is the operator under which they are ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù.  Therefore, in our opinion, more attention should be paid to the tariffs of mobile networks than to the characteristics of devices. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion: what is the new Megafon Login 3 tablet? </h2><p>  So what is the new Login 3 tablet?  If we analyze all the pros, cons, and characteristics of the Megafon Login 3 tablet described in this article, we can conclude that it is different!  It all depends solely on the purpose for which the device will be used and what requirements the user will set for it.  So, if this gadget is taken to periodically check mail and read books, then it can be called ideal: it provides the ability to access the Internet, it is inexpensive and, to tell the truth, pretty nice. </p><p>  Another position is the case if you take this tablet computer for other purposes - for example, for a photo.  Of course, it is naive to expect any super-results from the device‚Äôs camera for 3 thousand rubles - its resolution reaches only 3.2 megapixels.  The same applies, in principle, <span>to the reaction speed of the</span> device, its operational ability (with a processor of only 1 GB of RAM).  Running games with the best graphics, installing some kind of ultra-high-volume applications that mobilize a significant amount of resources on such a tablet is not practical - it will slow down, fail and cause a lot of other inconveniences. </p>
