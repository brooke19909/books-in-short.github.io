  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hamburg landmarks: photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hamburg is one of the most popular cities in Germany.  There is everything that a tourist may be interested in: ancient architecture, monuments, museums, park areas, beautiful nature in the vicinity, ancient quarters and much more.  Let's get acquainted with the sights of Hamburg in more detail. </p><h2>  About city </h2><p>  Hamburg is one of the largest and most important ports not only in Germany, but also in Europe.  It is often called the city of bridges for the reason that there are more structures of this type than in the Netherlands, Venice and Great Britain combined.  In addition, the city has an incredibly beautiful architecture.  During the Second World War, a lot of historical buildings were destroyed, but already in the post-war period, the authorities completely restored everything to the smallest detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.aarp.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of night hamburg" class="if uuid-2262063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262063.jpg"></div><p>  Hamburg also boasts a large number of various museums and monuments, among which special attention is paid to the Gallery of Modern Art and the Museum of History. </p><p>  It is for such a variety of interesting places that tourists love this city and come here to admire beautiful and unique objects, but which ones we will tell about.  Below you will find the most popular sights of Hamburg, their photos and descriptions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alster Lake </h2><p>  Hamburg's first attraction on today's list is Lake Alster.  Not only tourists come here, but also locals in order to admire nature and be alone with their thoughts. </p><h2>  Description and photo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cooltwitterbackgrounds.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lake alster hamburg" class="if uuid-2262061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262061.jpg"></div><p>  Now a short description of the sights of Hamburg.  The lake is located in the city center.  Its total area is 160 hectares, and the surrounding area is park areas.  Comfortable benches are provided for vacationers along the entire coast.  Boat rental and excursions are also available.  A couple of years ago, a 4-meter sculpture in the form of a bathing girl was installed in the lake.  The novelty immediately attracted a lot of attention.  It is possible to view the sculpture in the vicinity only by boat or catamaran, although it can be seen no worse from the shore. </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  The next attraction of the city of Hamburg is the local town hall.  It was built in the period 1886-1887 and miraculously preserved in its original form to the present day.  The Town Hall is the hallmark of the city, so many tourists first of all go here. </p><h2>  Description and photo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.marius-klemm.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamburg City Hall" class="if uuid-2262062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262062.jpg"></div><p>  The town hall is located in the center of Hamburg.  The building was built in a strict Gothic style, like most other buildings of the time.  A high clock tower and a spire can be seen from almost anywhere in the city.  Its height, by the way, is 112 meters.  Inside the town hall there are 647 rooms in which representatives of local authorities are staying and working.  Despite this, tourists can get inside and enjoy the unique interiors.  True, this can be done only in the morning, after which no one is allowed in.  Well, and, of course, it is worth saying about the facade of the building, on which the statues of all German emperors flaunt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Port </h2><p>  One of the most important and interesting sights of Hamburg is, of course, the port.  At first glance, it might seem that there is nothing to admire, but this is not at all so. </p><h2>  Description and photo </h2><p>  <span>The port of Hamburg</span> is one of the largest not only in Germany, but also in Europe.  It was thanks to him that the city began to develop and flourish.  Every year on May 7, a holiday is even celebrated here - the port's birthday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hamburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of the main port of hamburg" class="if uuid-2262058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262058.jpg"></div><p>  What could be interesting here?  Virtually everything.  Ancient architecture, all kinds of ships, yachts and boats, field trips, aerostat flights and much more.  People come here just to sit on benches and admire the gorgeous view of the Elbe River. </p><h2>  Kunsthalle Museum </h2><p>  The museum, or as it is also called, the Kunsthalle Gallery is one of the most significant sights of Hamburg and the whole of Germany.  Here are collected outstanding collections of works of art by German and French masters of the 19th century.  A variety of exhibits and colorful exhibits will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  Description and photo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dorfmuellerkroegerklier.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kunsthalle museum hamburg" class="if uuid-2262057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262057.jpg"></div><p>  The Kunsthalle Museum became a landmark in Hamburg in 1850, when it was built and first opened to the public.  During its rich history, a lot of interesting things happened here.  So, for example, in 1937 the gallery lost 74 paintings, which were recognized as samples of <span>degenerative art</span> and confiscated by local authorities.  And here is another interesting case - during the repair in 1978, the alarm was turned off in the museum, which was used by thieves.  Attackers stole 22 paintings, the total cost of which amounted to about 2 million German marks. </p><h2>  City History Museum </h2><p>  Another attraction of Hamburg is the Museum of History.  Here everyone can get acquainted with how the development of the city went from a small settlement in the form of a fortress to a port megalopolis. </p><h2>  Description and photo </h2><p>  The Hamburg History Museum is considered one of the most popular cultural institutions in the city.  It houses the most diverse exhibits that directly show the stages of development and formation of Hamburg.  One of the most ancient relics of the museum is considered the skull of the famous pirate Klaus Stertebekera.  It has been kept here since 1878. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamburg History Museum" class="if uuid-2262060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262060.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the Hamburg Historical Museum boasts one of the world's largest <span>railway models</span> , which show the movement of trains along the Hamburg - Harburg route.  The road was built with maximum accuracy on a scale of 1:32.  Also in the museum there are other, no less fascinating and interesting exhibits, which will be interesting to get acquainted with. </p><h2>  Fish market </h2><p>  Hamburg's last attraction on today's list is the Fish Market.  Each of the tourists considers it his duty to visit this place.  Even among the inhabitants of the city there is a saying: "I have not been to the Fish Market - I have not seen Hamburg." </p><h2>  Description and photo </h2><p>  Getting to the <span>Fish Market is</span> not as easy as it might seem at first glance.  The fact is that the sellers who work here strictly adhere to a centuries-old tradition, according to which trade is allowed only before the start of service in the church - from 5 to 10 in the morning.  After 10, it makes no sense to go to the market - there will be no one here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hamburg fish market" class="if uuid-2262064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2262064.jpg"></div><p>  Of the main features of this facility, it is worth noting a huge selection of fish and seafood.  In addition, they sell meat, vegetables, fruits, all kinds of sweets, spices and seasonings and much more.  But that is not all.  Every day, live music plays on the market, shows and concerts of various artists are held.  The atmosphere here is unforgettable, and after a visit there will clearly be something to remember. </p><p>  That's all.  Have a nice trip! </p>
