    <h2>  Monterey (California): photo, location </h2><p>  For tourists visiting one of the favorite places in the US state of California is Monterey.  This picturesque, sunny town is located on the very shore of the bay of the same name Monterey (Pacific Ocean) between Los Angeles and the beautiful city of San Francisco. </p><p>  In the long history of North America, it occupies a rather honorable place.  This is a true paradise, an oasis for entertainment and wonderful relaxation.  More than 2 million tourists visit it annually to relax and get acquainted with its magnificent natural and historical sights.  This is one of the most beautiful places in California, representing the west coast of the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Monterey (California) is located 80 kilometers south of the city of San Jose, from which the road number 17 (pass) goes to it, passing almost in the middle of the road (from Santa Cruz) to the old coastal Spanish road number 1. The latter extends along the shores of the Pacific Ocean (North and South America). </p><p>  In 2005, the population of the city amounted to just over 30.5 thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monterey (California): photos" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1738057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  Monterey (California), like the entire state, was originally (in the 1770s) part of New Spain.  Moreover, from 1775 to 1849 it was this city that was the first capital of the state. </p><p>  The state was in possession of Mexico until 1846, but after the American-Mexican war, <span>an American flag</span> was hung over the trading house of Monterey.  By this, he marked the accession of California to the States of America.  At that time, this event did not turn out to be particularly noteworthy for the inhabitants of this settlement. </p><p>  Subsequently, Monterey, gradually losing the status of the state capital, began to turn into a place where they began to engage in mass industrial fishing.  Several canned sardine factories have opened here along the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monterey Bay (California)" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1738034.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, by the middle of the 20th century, due to its overfishing, the resources of the bay were depleted.  As a result <span>, the fishing industry</span> is completely ruined. </p><p>  The cases of those factories have survived to the present day, and represent one of the main city attractions.  Many buildings are used for the best hotels and fish restaurants, souvenir shops and shops.  Among other things, since the end of the last century, one of the most unique marine aquariums has been opened in one of the former factories.  It contains about 35,000 species of the most diverse inhabitants of the deep sea. </p><p>  Tourists visiting the city of Monterey (California) can see a lot of interesting things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monterey Attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1738036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Monterey has many attractions: an aquarium, port old buildings, a library, a theater, etc. </p><p>  The atmosphere and surroundings of the city give it an irresistible charm.  Most homes are Victorian.  It even preserved a two-story building with a fireplace in it from the time of the Spanish pioneers - Larkin House.  The structures of the centuries-old construction, which now houses the library, the theater, as well as the Custom House building (customs), have been preserved intact. </p><p>  Interesting and the chapel of St. Presidio, and Colton Hall (old school).  In addition, the only (last) sidewalk in the USA made of whale bones has been preserved in this town.  It is located at the Old Whale Station. </p><p>  Monterey (California) is no less famous for its main street "Canning Row".  Today, there are the main city entertainment venues. </p><p>  Since 1958, the famous jazz festival has been held annually in Monterey.  And since 1991 - a bicycle festival.  Now the city is a great place for a relaxing holiday in numerous coastal hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monterey City (California)" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1738062.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Oceanarium </h2><p>  Monterey has one of the most unique and best aquariums in the world - Monterey Bay, which was mentioned above.  It contains the best marine animals and plants. </p><p>  The water in the aquarium represents the natural habitat for marine exhibits, as it comes directly from the ocean.  The institution itself is located in the building of an old factory located on the shore.  From the ocean side, the aquarium has a unique observation deck with a unique stunning view of the emerald boundless expanses of the great Pacific Ocean. </p><h2>  Marine life </h2><p>  Monterey Bay (California) contains water, which is an excellent breeding ground for all the underwater vegetation in it.  These places are rich in numerous and most diverse representatives of fauna and flora: vast areas with seaweed, rookeries of <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãlions</span> and seals, numerous species of fish, etc. All taken together attract the attention of divers and scientists: geologists, biologists, etc. </p><p>  Vessels periodically sail from the marina to observe <span>belugas, dolphins,</span> gray whales, as well as sperm whales (albeit rarely).  They sail without fear to the shores in search of food, and tourists, observing all this with their own eyes, come in indescribable delight.  Whales accustomed to the presence of people even allow them to touch themselves. </p><p>  An unusual and amazing sight is represented by 3-6-meter algae, stretching to the surface of the water from the very bottom of the ocean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather Monterey (CA)" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1738031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Near the city at the very bottom of Monterey Bay (California), as noted above, is a unique underwater deep canyon.  The presence of it and other smaller underwater canyons led to the formation of such a diverse flora and fauna of the marine world in a relatively small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ocean near the coast. </p><p>  The coastal areas of the city are also remarkable, strewn with a fantastically beautiful carpet of pink lavender.  The shores covered with snow-white sand look beautiful with picturesque landscapes against the backdrop of amazing reefs and rocks. </p><p>  The most amazingly beautiful winding road (No. 17) runs along the ocean between majestic cliffs and snow-white beaches, periodically diving into groves and forests growing in the very depths of the peninsula, where the most beautiful and expensive mansions of the state of California are located. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Great in these places and the weather.  Monterey (California) attracts many tourists from around the world with its warm and sunny atmosphere. </p><p>  The climate in the city is moderately warm.  In winter, there is much more rainfall than in summer.  In total, about 424 mm of precipitation falls annually.  The average annual temperature is + 13.2 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Along the Pacific coast of California are numerous cities, each with its own characteristics and attractions.  But it was Monterey who rightfully earned the title of one of the best places for entertainment and recreation for travelers and tourists. </p>
