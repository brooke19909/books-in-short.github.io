    <p>  In order to apply for a Visa Electron card from Sberbank, you should contact the employees, present your passport and write a statement.  For registration does not require additional documents that confirm the level of income and a permanent place of work. </p><p>  A Visa Electron debit card can be provided by Sberbank as a main, additional or salary card.  The main card is provided to any individual who is a citizen of the Russian Federation no younger than 14 years old and is registered in the bank's service area.  In addition, cards are provided to non-residents or those who do not have a residence permit at all.  In this case, you need to contact the head of the office in person. </p><p>  An additional Sberbank card is issued to both residents and non-residents at least 14 years old, but only if the owner of the main card contacts the bank directly.  In addition, a person who has reached the age of ten, who is a <span>close relative of the</span> holder of the main card, can own such a card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As for <span>salary cards,</span> they are provided only if the relevant agreement is concluded between the bank and the employer.  You can get wages not only in rubles, but also in other currencies. </p><p>  The cost of annual maintenance on such cards is 300 rubles.  Additional cards cost 150. </p><p>  When opening a card, it is not necessary to make a down payment, but it should be remembered that upon receipt of it there will already be a negative balance, since annual service may be debited. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of a Sberbank Visa Electron card? </h2><p>  First of all, the advantages of using such a card is that it provides free services.  For example, re-release is next or early.  In addition, the suspension of the card is also completely free.  Overdraft on cards is not provided, therefore, when it occurs, forty percent per annum is charged regardless of the currency used. </p><p>  A small drawback is that a small fee is charged for providing an extract and a request for a card account, even when performing transactions through an ATM.  To find out what the amount of the spending limit on the card is, you should also pay a certain amount. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Visa Electron Card Features </h2>

    <p>  Card "Visa Electron" (Sberbank) is probably the most popular of all cards with an entry level.  It has a basic set of capabilities, with the exception of several of them, but they still need to be taken into account.  For example, when using a card abroad, some difficulties arise, since any ongoing transaction should be agreed with the bank online.  If the terminal does not have such a connection, then the operation will fail. </p><p>  During the registration of a new card, consultants will help determine the choice of the optimal card option, which will take into account all the individual conditions for its use.  For example, travelers are offered a Visa Classic Aeroflot card, which has the opportunity to receive discounts on airline tickets. </p><p>  Very often Visa Electron cards are used as salary cards.  They are intended primarily for operations within the country and beyond.  According to the available list of bank card capabilities, they allow you to pay for goods and services domestically and abroad.  In addition, you can pay for goods and services via the Internet, receive cash through an ATM.  Transfer funds and pay for services through Mobile Bank and Sberbank Online.  Make payments and transfers through ATMs and terminals of Sberbank, as well as deposit funds into the account in cash and by bank transfer. </p><h2>  Can I use the card abroad? </h2><p>  But, despite all this, the Visa Electron card (Sberbank) provides for its use on foreign services, but since not every site will accept payment from such a card.  For this reason, be sure to check what capabilities the card has before paying for a purchase abroad. </p>

    <p>  When using the Visa Electron and Maestro cards, even Sberbank employees themselves are advised to pay attention to exactly which payment systems are accepted for servicing on the websites or in the stores themselves, as well as familiarize themselves with the payment conditions. </p><p>  For users <span>of the Pay Pal payment system</span> or the European payment system Moneybookers skrill who want to link the card to their account, it is best to first make sure that this opportunity really exists, since the information changes very quickly, and you can get the exact answer only from the bank.  To do this, contact the customer service hotline. </p><h2>  What additional features does Visa Electron have? </h2>

    <p>  Upon receipt, Sberbank's ‚ÄúVisa Electron‚Äù can be connected to additional services that significantly increase its available capabilities.  The easiest to use and really necessary is the Sberbank service called "Mobile Bank".  It can be provided for free or for a fee.  It allows you to control the status of the card account, pay for services using a mobile phone, instantly block the card when it is stolen or lost. </p><p>  For those customers who usually buy something through the Internet, registration on the personal page of Sberbank is also suitable.  This service is called Sberbank Online.  To connect it, just contact the bank branch with a card, and the consultant will help you get the login and password.  These are not all the services of Sberbank OJSC that can be connected to the card. </p><h2>  How to carry out operations in protected mode? </h2><p>  More recently, a new card protection technology called Verified by Visa has been introduced.  Using it, the security of conducting card transactions via the Internet is several times increased. </p><p>  Immediately it is worth saying that the ‚ÄúVisa Electron‚Äù of Sberbank has no embossed data on its surface.  Therefore, the name and surname of its owner are considered a payment detail.  In no case should these cards be forwarded to third parties. </p><p>  To fully verify the safety of the operation, you should use a separate card only for purchases via the Internet.  The account of such a card is replenished only for the amount of the acquisition and after that it is ‚Äúreset‚Äù.  It is very convenient to use virtual cards designed only to pay for purchases via the Internet. </p>
