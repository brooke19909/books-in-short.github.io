  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Weekly thematic planning on “How frogs hibernate”</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Weekly thematic planning becomes relevant when conducting <span>classes with children of</span> preschool and <span>primary school age.</span>  The educational material that needs to be learned is evenly distributed over all classes, fixed in different activities. </p><p>  Weekly thematic planning technology: </p><p>  1) The topic “How frogs hibernate” is a component of the larger educational section “How animals hibernate”.  For each animal species, a time period is allocated corresponding to a specific period of preparation of wild animals for winter. </p><p>  2) At the beginning of the week, the teacher creates an indoor environment that arouses children's interest in this topic: works about frogs appear in the corner of books, illustrations for works and books that help to correctly portray the frog appear in the corner of the drawing.  Books, albums, paintings cause curiosity among children, the need to ask questions. </p><p>  3) Preschoolers should already have knowledge about other inhabitants of the reservoirs, so the topic of frogs can be planned by the teacher immediately after the thematic week “How the fish winter”. </p><p>  4) On the first day of the week, all classes are connected by a single theme: cognitive stories about frogs are read to children, in their free hours they make jumping frogs from paper (origami technique), the frog image becomes the main one in a physical education lesson, so the teacher teaches wards <span>long jumps</span> from a place .  Preschoolers memorize poems on the topic, conduct observations of the animal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  5) This immersion in the topic causes increased interest in children to the object of study.  The teacher waits until the children have a question “How do frogs winter?”, Which becomes the topic of the main lesson. </p><p>  Methods for conducting classes based on fairy tales </p><p>  The teacher offers children to name folk or author's tales, where there is an image of a frog.  Children remember the fairy tale “The Frog Princess” or “The Frog-traveler” by V. M. Garshin.  Depending on which fairy tale causes the greatest interest in children, a lesson is built. </p><p>  Only one fragment of the fairy tale is selected, which reflects the features of the frog's life: swamp, water, mosquitoes and midges, moist soil. </p><p>  If the children chose the fairy tale “The Frog-traveler”, you can tell them about the <span>migration of animals</span> in anticipation of winter, show slides about the movement of animals from places of feeding to the place of wintering.  Thus, the tale becomes a version of the true story that the frogs are able to return to their native reservoir, even if they are carried away over a kilometer. </p><p>  The teacher shows the children special signs for drivers who cross the area of ​​animal migration in the autumn.  He suggests inventing ways to protect animals from death when they move in large groups and can fall under the wheels of a car: laying tunnels under highways, creating dams and lakes near their summer habitats. </p><p>  The teacher does not give accurate information about how frogs hibernate, but offers children to consider different types of amphibians and try to guess where the frogs hide in winter from frost and cold.  The correct answers of children are supplemented by the teacher, confirmed by slides or illustrations, because the place of wintering can be in the earthen hole, and in the thick of silt at the bottom of the pond, and in the hollow of a tree. </p><p>  The older the children, the more details about the wintering of frogs can be reported in the lesson: a decrease in body temperature, mucus protecting them, and restoration of vital activity in the spring. </p><p>  A theme week can end with fun or a frogs knowledge quiz.  A thematic exhibition of crafts, drawings, applications and projects on the topic “How frogs hibernate” is being made in the hall.  Children compete, play, solve riddles, and their knowledge on this topic becomes more complete and stable. </p>
