Features, properties and steps</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  "What is assimilation?"  This is the question we will try to consider in this article.  This is a multifaceted concept, the meaning of which can vary depending on the application.  Among the main varieties of assimilation, there are: biological, linguistic, sociological, ventilation, psychological, linguistic and even ethnic.  Here we will get acquainted with the main views. </p><h2>  The phenomenon in linguistics </h2><p>  What is assimilation in linguistics? </p><p>  Answering this question, we can define it as a phonological term, which designates the similarity of some sounds with others.  This process occurs if there is a commonality in the structure of the device of sounds, which are of a general type.  The assimilation phenomenon is divided into: </p><ul><li>  full - assimilation of sound that completely coincides with the one to which the assimilation takes place; </li><li>  incomplete - a change in a certain number of signs characterizing an assimilating sound. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wiwo.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is assimilation" class="if uuid-2269631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2269631.jpg"></div><p>  In accordance with the direction of assimilation is divided into: </p><ul><li>  progressive, in which the previous sound unit affects the next; </li><li>  regressive, the effect is the next sound on the previous one. </li></ul><p>  There is contact (assistance of participating sounds) and distant (for example, vowel harmony) assimilation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The phenomenon in sociology </h2><p>  What is assimilation in sociology?  In such sciences as sociology and ethnography, this phenomenon is defined as the loss by society of its special characteristics, a set of traits that were either forgotten or replaced by borrowed ones.  In a general sense, this is the implementation of an ethnocultural shift in the structure of self-consciousness of some social community, which used to be a different cultural group.  Most often, such issues affect the issues of language, creationism and cultural heritage. </p><p>  Assimilation can be voluntary (an example is interethnic and interfaith marriages, passion for other cultures, etc.) and forced (it is military in nature, partial extermination, annexation, changes in legislative activity aimed at suppressing specific cultural phenomena are applied). </p><h2>  Assimilation of peoples </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ynetnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assimilation is" class="if uuid-2269630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2269630.jpg"></div><p>  What is assimilation in relation to a nation or nationality? </p><p>  This can be better understood by looking at specific examples.  For example, on the assimilation of the Jewish part of the population.  During this process, the subject ceases to identify itself as a fragment of the cultural, religious, ethnic Jewish community.  One reason is the gradual influence of the social environment in which a person resides.  Other examples of this phenomenon are Christianization, an event of cultural assimilation and Hellenization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Assimilation and language development </h2><p>  In linguistics, assimilation is a process during which the exploitation by any linguistic communities of their own form of language ceases.  There is a transition to another, more prestigious language.  As a rule, the reason for this is the environment of a particular linguistic community with a larger ethnic group. </p><div class="photo" data-original="humanities.exeter.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word assimilation" class="if uuid-2269633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2269633.jpg"></div><p>  Another reason for the adoption of a new language by a particular nation may be conquest, colonization, emigration, etc.  Due to the conquest of autochthonous populations, after a long period expires, the bilingual system formed by the mother tongue and means of communication of the conquerors is replaced by a ‚Äúmonogamous‚Äù one.  The language of the conquering people turns into a universal and only means of communication. </p><p>  The meaning of the word ‚Äúassimilation‚Äù is closely related to the linguistic form of chauvinism.  It serves as an effective and efficient means for the assimilation of other peoples, both in the cultural and ethnic fields.  The language can be imposed by the pressure of the political elite, penetrate into speech through trade, communication of administrations, various documents, etc. </p><h2>  Biology phenomenon </h2><p>  What is assimilation in biology?  In this science of living matter, assimilation refers to the process of biosynthesis of organic compounds, on which the body's energy is expended.  Synthesizing high molecular weight compounds (proteins and nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids) is possible only if there is an energy potential.  A synonym is anabolism. </p><p>  In this process, a simple series of substances (initially complex are destructurable to simple), non-specific for a particular creature, is transformed into complex, characteristic of it.  It is important that the substance can be absorbed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2016.igem.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assimilation what is it" class="if uuid-2269634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2269634.jpg"></div><h2>  Dissimilation is ... </h2><p>  Assimilation - what is it?  If we are still talking about the biological significance, then it will be worthwhile to note the relationship of assimilation and dissimilation.  These are two anabolic processes that balance each other with the sum and purpose of their processes. </p><p>  Dissimilation is called catabolism (energy exchange) - the process of decomposition and / or decomposition of simple substances during metabolic processing.  Also, the object of this phenomenon is subjected to oxidation.  Such reactions are accompanied by the release of energy resources that are stored in the body, taking the form of ATP or turning into heat. </p><p>  Catabolism reactions form the basis of dissimilation, which in fact is the loss of a complex substance, its specificity for a particular organism.  This is due to the breakdown of substances. </p><p>  Considering catabolic reactions as an example, one can pay attention to the way ethanol is converted through the stage of acetaldehyde, ethanoic acid, H2O, CO2, and glycolysis processes.  The latter is the transformation of glucose (C6H12O6) into lactic or pyruvic acids and further decomposition to water and carbon dioxide due to the implementation of the respiratory cycle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fracfx.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is assimilation" class="if uuid-2269635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57676/2269635.jpg"></div><p>  Regulation of the activity and the predominance of certain processes of catabolism is carried out through hormones.  An example is the effect of glucocorticoids, which increase the catabolism of protein molecules and amino acids and inhibit glucose catabolism.  Insulin has the opposite effect on both glucose breakdown and protein synthesis. </p><p>  Catabolism is the ‚Äúantipode‚Äù of anabolism.  The latter, in turn, is the synthesis or resynthesis of more complex substances, the formation of which consumes ATP (adenositriphosphoric acid). </p>
