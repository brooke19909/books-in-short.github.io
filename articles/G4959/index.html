    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Almost all Chinese manufacturers are trying to increase the amount of memory offered.  The device works with 3 GB of operational and 32 GB of internal storage.  If desired, you can use an external drive.  Its maximum capacity is 256 GB.  But you need to understand that a flash drive is installed in the SIM card slot, so you have to abandon the second number.  In fact, 21 GB remains free in the internal memory, which is quite enough for undemanding owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 pro prime 32gb reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2018682.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The rear camera has 13 megapixels, as well as auto focus.  The photos are sharp and bright.  The quality is excellent.  The owners in the reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro Prime 32Gb note that in the center of the picture is excellent detail.  However, its level decreases to the edges.  The dynamics of the photos is excellent, you can shoot in panorama and HDR modes. </p><p>  Video is recorded in resolutions up to 1080 p.  Bitrate is good - 20 Mbps.  Audio is recorded in stereo.

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  In China, budget options are often created with a good screen that can deliver FullHD quality.  The 5-inch display has an excellent pixel density of 411. According to reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime 32Gb Gray, the contrast is excellent.  Brightness has a good range.  At night, the minimum indicator will not dazzle, and when working in direct sunlight, you can easily read information from the screen. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone works with SIM cards of the ‚Äúnano‚Äù and ‚Äúmicro‚Äù format.  One of the available ports is hybrid, so it is often used as a slot for a memory card.  The owners note that when using two cellular numbers, you can set in the settings which of the SIM cards the 4G network will catch.  The second in this case works with 3G and 2G signals.  If 4G is absent, then both SIM cards will try to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a less powerful signal.  This is stated by buyers in reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime. </p><p>  Built-in wireless network module, bluetooth, there is a radio and navigation aids.  Using special technology, you can duplicate the phone screen.  It is needed in order to transfer data between two devices without a router. </p><p>  Due to the fact that there is an infrared port, the phone can be used as a remote control technology.  To function at the best level, the manufacturer has installed a special application. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The main speaker has about the same volume as the predecessors of the model.  In normal mode, audio playback is at a good level.  You can use amplifiers and headphones, as buyers say in their reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime.  The smartphone has special utilities that will improve the sound.  The interlocutor during the conversation is heard perfectly.  Due to the two microphones, the speech of the owner of the device will be transmitted in excellent quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi note 4 prime reviews" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2018685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The phone is running the sixth Android.  Above it, the MIUI 8 interface is installed. An additional shell allows you to work with duplicated applications.  We are talking about the ability to install twice the same utility with different accounts.  How to distinguish a genuine application from a duplicate?  The latter will have a special mark on the bottom of the icon. </p><p>  Due to the program, which duplicates utilities, you can create two work surfaces.  At the same time, it is allowed to change the set of applications, wallpapers, widgets and so on installed on them.  Access to the duplicate is easily configured through a fingerprint scanner.  It is possible to synchronize data from one table to another.  You can switch between them without much effort, but this does not happen in a second. </p><p>  Owners in reviews of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Prime notice an additional feature - the ability to create a screenshot of the entire web page.  This option is liked by many. </p><p>  The manufacturer has installed a special program that cleans the phone of debris, manages the blacklist, monitors battery consumption, and checks the device for viruses.  In addition, there is a system that ‚Äúlooks after‚Äù the applications that consume the most energy. </p><p>  The owners note that there is a lot of unnecessary Compass utility.  It in real time can show where which side of the world is, using the arrow. </p><h2>  Individual characteristics </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs hard enough to surprise buyers.  Most Chinese models are replicas of premium phones.  Smartphones do not have features, but the combination of quality and cost attracts many.  This is what the owners themselves say in reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime.  The described model is considered interesting because it has an application that duplicates other utilities.  Also, a dual SIM card slot allows you to use a pair of numbers.  This feature is particularly in demand, as many "get" a card for work and separately for themselves. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Buyers in reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro Prime note the advantages of the device: a powerful battery and good chipset performance.  The screen supports FullHD quality, the fingerprint scanner works at an excellent level.  The body is made of metal.  The cost is small. </p><p>  Cons practically do not distinguish cons, referring to a good combination of quality and price of the device.  Some buyers notice that the photo is dull.  Many do not like that the phone is not separable. </p><h2>  Who is the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime smartphone for? </h2><p>  This phone is suitable for young people who do not want to spend money on high-quality and expensive models, but want to have a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù smartphone.  For adults and affluent women and men, this gadget will also come in handy.  But before you start using it, they will have to deal with management.  This is due to the fact that the phone is not fully Russified.  There are translation errors. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This smartphone shows itself perfectly.  It has medium characteristics and low cost.  Given that the price in China is slightly lower, it will still be difficult to find something better in Russia.  Customer reviews make it clear that the device has a long battery life, a good screen and excellent cameras. </p><p>  Many people like the phone because of its design.  Although it is not unique, it has some zest that attracts attention. </p>
