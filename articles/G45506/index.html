And he even pronounced all the orders or words of Stalin with the intonations spoken by the Secretary General. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Alexander Nikolaevich knew all his moods, habits and illnesses.

    <h2>  The "squire" of Stalin </h2><p>  Alexander Nikolaevich Poskrebyshev, Stalin‚Äôs personal secretary, was his ‚Äúshadow‚Äù, solving not only administrative, but also personal issues.  He monitored not only the correspondence of the Secretary General, but also the observance of the protocol and the appearance of members of the Politburo.  Everyone had to reckon with Poskrebyshev, both ordinary people and military commanders. </p><p>  Despite being close to <span>Stalin,</span> Poskrebyshev could not save his <span>wife</span> from arrest.  He had to personally issue a warrant for her.  Although he tried to defend his wife.  But Stalin signed the warrant and, seeing the expression on the face of Alexander Nikolayevich, laughed.  He decided that Poskrebyshev ‚Äúneeded a new woman‚Äù, and promised to find him in the near future.  And about the arrest was adamant.  He considered that if the NKVD made such a decision, then there were reasons for that.  And soon a young woman came to Alexander Nikolayevich‚Äôs apartment with a message that she had been sent to farm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Victim of the intrigue of Beria </h2><p>  Poskrebyshev Alexander Nikolaevich became a victim of the intrigues of Beria.  After the fifty-second year, a plan matured to dismiss General Secretary Stalin.  But no one wanted to talk about it openly.  Moreover, loyal people surrounded him.  As a result, Beria decided to remove Joseph Vissarionovich with the help of intrigue. </p><p>  According to Lavrenty Pavlovich, Georgia would be the best place for this.  But because of the ‚ÄúMingrelian affair,‚Äù Stalin did not go to fellow countrymen to rest.  Lived very solitary.  There were only two places left: the Kremlin and the Moscow cottage.  But the Kremlin residence had perfect communication, and if they had begun to insist on his resignation, then alarm would have risen all over the country in a split second.  The last option remained - the Moscow cottage. </p><p>  But she was reliably protected, while next to Stalin there was a guard and Poskrebyshev.  Only the Secretary General himself could remove it.  Beria told Stalin that the secret materials allegedly disappeared from the Politburo.  And apart from Alexander Nikolaevich, no one could do this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a poskrebyshev" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1270781.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <p>  Stalin immediately removed Alexander Nikolaevich from his post and sent him to prison.  He was going to shoot him.  But did not manage to do this.  After Stalin lost his loyal entourage, he was soon found dead at his country cottage. </p><h2>  Politics </h2><p>  In 1934, Poskrebyshev Alexander Nikolaevich became a candidate member of the Central Committee.  In 1936, based on the formulated theses of Stalin, he wrote texts to the Constitution of the Soviet Union.  And after two years - A short history course.  In 1939 he became a member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks, and later - the CPSU.  Poskrebyshev is a deputy of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the</span> RSFSR and the BASSR of the 1st to 3rd convocations. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  For the first time, Alexander Nikolayevich married in 1919 to Jadwig Ippolitovna Stankevich, a Polish revolutionary.  They had been married for ten years and divorced.  Subsequently, she died of tuberculosis in 1937. She was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Poskrebyshev" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1270786.jpg" width="562"></div>

    <p>  After a divorce from his first wife, Poskrebyshev married a second time.  His wife's name was Bronislav Metallikov.  In this marriage, he had two daughters - Galina and Natalya.  In 1939, Bronislava was repressed for communication with Trotsky and on charges of counter-revolutionary activity. </p><p>  There is an opinion that the real reason for her arrest was Beria, who wanted to compromise Alexander Nikolayevich, and then replace him in office with his own person.  But this is only an assumption, since at that time Beria was not closely connected with the NKVD and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. </p><p>  Poskrebyshev made an attempt to rehabilitate his wife, but to no avail.  She was shot when the fascist army approached Moscow.  Much later, in 1957, Bronislava was nevertheless acquitted and rehabilitated.  She was reburied at the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow. </p><p>  The third time, Alexander Poskrebyshev married Yekaterina Grigoryevna Zimina.  In this marriage, a third daughter was born, who was named Elena. </p><h2>  Friends </h2><p>  Despite the busy schedule of sixteen hours a day, Alexander Nikolaevich still found time for friends with whom he went fishing.  There were only three close comrades.  A childhood friend Bakulev, who became a famous cardiologist, General Khrulev and polar explorer Papanin. <strong> </strong>  Poskrebyshev loved not only books and fishing, but also outdoor activities: tennis, a game of towns.  He liked to go to friends in the country, relax there, fish and hunt. </p><h2>  Character </h2><p>  By the nature of Poskrebyshev, Alexander Nikolaevich, whose photo is in this article, was decisive and purposeful.  By nature, he is very kind, but at work collected and strict.  As his daughter recalls, he always said that a person should be kind, but not kind. </p>
