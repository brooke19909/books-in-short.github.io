And this, of course, is far from accidental.  Let's try to deal with this issue in detail. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that Uman is a small settlement located in the very heart of Ukraine, in the Cherkasy region, at almost the same distance from once the two main cultural cities of the country - Kiev and Odessa. </p><p>  In general, there are no particularly significant historical values, or unique architectural monuments.  But nevertheless, this place is visited annually by more than half a million tourists from all over the globe.  What is the reason for such a demand?  All thanks to the fact that here is one of the wonders of Ukraine - the arboretum Sofiyivka, which is a true masterpiece of park art. </p><p>  From the very first minutes, this part of the city amazes with its amazing landscapes, beautiful ponds, fabulous grottoes and fantastic sculptures.  By the way, not everyone is aware that the park, located within a modest city called Uman (Ukraine), may be among the most amazing corners of the world. </p><p>  Sofiyivka is also one of the most romantic corners of its country.  And this is not surprising, because this monument of landscape art was actually not only created in the name of love, but remains its symbol for 200 years. </p><h2>  Sofiyivka from the time of the Potocki </h2>

This settlement is located just at the intersection of important trade routes, and it should be noted that it has always been this way since the very foundation of this town.  Possessing this information, no one will be surprised to learn that this particular transport hub was subsequently chosen for the construction of one of the residences of Count S. Pototsky, a then-known merchant and landowner. </p><p>  The tycoon founded the park on the territory of his possessions as early as 1796. However, its grand opening took place only in May 1800. Works were postponed several times due to heavy floods for the next four years. </p><p>  The very completion of the construction was timed to coincide with the birthday of the count's beloved wife - Sofia Glyavone-Witt-Potocka.  Actually, in honor of her, the park got its name. </p><p>  Initially, Ludwig Metzel, an artillery officer, Pototsky‚Äôs nephew, was invited to the role of the chief architect of the future landscape masterpiece called Sofievsky Park (Uman).  The total cost of its arrangement is also known, which at that time amounted to 2 million rubles.  in silver. </p><p>  In accordance with the very first plan, the entrance to the park was from the greenhouse, and the composition of the complex passed along the riverbed.  Kamenka.  According to Metzel‚Äôs project, the following were created: the water system of the park from interconnected ponds, waterfalls, locks and rivers, sculptures, grottoes of Venus, Oreshek, Fear and Doubt, the rocks of Levkad and Tarpeisk. </p><p>  After the death of S. Pototsky, ‚ÄúSofiyivka‚Äù passed by inheritance to his eldest son from a marriage with Yuzefina Mnishek, namely Jerzy (Yuri) Shchensny.  But the heir ceded possession of the city of Uman and the park to his stepmother Sofia, with whom, they say, they had a long love affair.  But he did this far from free of charge, but in exchange for paying off his debts - 30 million zlotys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uman Sofiyivka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/836187.jpg"></div>

She even personally approached Alexander I with such a proposal. But at that time the deal did not take place. </p><p>  Until 1813 the park "Sofievsky" (Uman) was kept in excellent condition, this was a considerable merit of L. Metzel.  However, after the latter went to work in Warsaw, Sofiyivka stopped receiving proper care and gradually fell into decay. </p><p>  But, apparently, this corner was nevertheless laid under a happy star.  In 1815, the poem Zofi√≥wka, written by the Polish writer Stanislav Trembetsk√Ω, was published in Paris.  It is she who brings the park pan-European fame and glory. </p><p>  After a long illness on November 22, 1822, the owner of the park, Sofia, died in Berlin, so the estate was transferred to her son Alexander.  He returns Sofievka to its former beauty, complements it with stunning new works and even asks A. Andrzheevsky to make a detailed description of the park‚Äôs flora. </p><p>  However, due to the suspicions of Alexander Pototsky in connection with the Polish rebels, although he denied this fact in his personal correspondence, his lands after October 21, 1831 were sequestered by the Russian state. </p><h2>  Sofiyivka as Tsaritsyn Garden </h2>

    <p>  Despite everything, the park was managed by Alexander Pototsky for more than a year, and only then was transferred first to the Kiev Treasury Chamber, and a little later - as a gift to Alexandra Fedorovna from the loving spouse of the Emperor of All-Russian Nicholas I. In confirmation of this, in 1850 in Caucasian instead of the pedestal of Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a statue of the Queen is installed on the hill. </p><p>  Thanks to the laying in 1838, st.  Sadovaya, and then converting it into a highway, the park becomes much more accessible to visitors and begins to actively develop.  During this time, arbors are being erected, the source, the main avenue are being ennobled, and two towers in the Gothic style are being built at the main entrance, a pavilion is being built on about.  Anti-Circe and Flora's gazebo. </p><p>  A little later, by order of <span>Nicholas I</span> , the <span>Gothic-style</span> pavilion was demolished, and instead a building in the Renaissance style appeared on the project of A.I. Shtakenschneider.  Entrance towers are also being rebuilt, this time they are created in the antique style.  In addition, the grotto of Apollo is filled up and an obelisk with a three-headed eagle is installed there and a chic fountain called "Snake" is broken. </p><h2>  Park as the main gardening school </h2>

In this form, he exists for several years. </p><p>  In 1870, like twenty years ago, the park again suffers a flood - the dam of the <span>Red Pond</span> erodes <span>,</span> and a huge water stream flows through the central part of the park.

    <p>  The decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukrainian SSR of May 18, 1929 concerned a city named Uman.  Sofievsky Park, whose history is actually fascinating and extraordinary, is declared a state reserve and recognized as an independent organization.  Although at the same time, part of its territory still remains subordinate to the agricultural university. </p><p>  In 1945, just after the war, it was renamed again, this time in the Uman State Reserve Sofiyivka.  And in 1946, significant funds were allocated for restoration.  At this time, many architectural elements, statues and alleys are being restored.  A special greenhouse area is being created on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 hectares, designed to breed various types of plants and enrich the flora of Sofiyivka. </p><h2>  Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in Sofiyivka </h2>
