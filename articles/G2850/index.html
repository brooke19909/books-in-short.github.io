  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept and essence of the state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any political system includes a central institution - the state.  This is a special form of political power that exists in society.  It has a certain sovereignty.  The state uses a whole system of special bodies for management.  Considering the concept and essence of the state, it is necessary to note the differences in these values. </p><p>  <span>The concept of the state</span> implies characteristic signs or signs of processes occurring in its structures.  In contrast to this definition, essence means deeper properties and attributes that are not recognized by the senses. </p><p>  The concept and essence of the state should be considered more thoroughly.  For a long time, disputes arose over their interpretation.  According to the theory of Marxism, states are an instrument for creating dominance in the <span>political sphere,</span> which this or that class has.  Therefore, the concept and essence were defined as the suppressing factor of one ruling class by another. </p><p>  As experience shows, such suppression has taken place over a long period.  This is due to the fact that society cannot provide all its members with equal opportunities and benefits. </p><p>  Another version arose that considered the concept and essence of the state as an organization for the implementation of general plans. </p><p>  The main <span>features of the state</span> are: </p><p>  - The presence of <span>public authority,</span> which exists separately from society.  It manifests itself in the formation of specialized forced institutions.  This power extends to the entire territory of the country and to the entire population.  Public authorities include the police, the army, prisons, officials and other organizations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - The presence of a system of taxes, taxes and loans. </p><p>  - Independence or sovereignty. </p><p>  - Legal legislation, without which a state cannot exist.  It defines the framework within which the <span>functions of the state</span> are carried out <span>.</span> </p><p>  - Monopoly on the use of force and other types of physical coercion.  The state or its bodies have the right to deprive citizens of certain values, freedom, life, if this is consistent with applicable law. </p><p>  - The obligation to represent society as a whole, to protect its interests and benefits. </p><p>  The concept of public administration, in its material expression, is valid throughout its territory.  The state has the highest power, which extends only within its borders.  It itself determines the nature of its relations with other countries that do not have the right to interfere in each other's internal affairs. </p><p>  The independence of the state does not depend on the size of the territories and the size of its population. </p><p>  An important sign for the state is the legitimacy of power.  This means her justice. </p><p>  The essence of public administration can be expressed in several ways. </p><p>  1. It exists for the realization of common <span>economic interests,</span> and especially the interests of the ruling class. </p><p>  2. The fulfillment of the interests of all social strata, which is based on the principles of compromise. </p><p>  3. The existence of the state to fulfill the interests of the nation. </p><p>  4. Fulfillment of the interests of religions represented in this state. </p><p>  5. The existence of the state in the name of the interests of a particular race, which is represented on its territory. </p><p>  The concept and essence of the state, as well as its structure, is a system that has been formed over a long period.  You can approach its classification from a different point of view.  You can consider its internal structure, the system of higher authorities, territorial division, as well as ways to exercise power. </p><p>  Depending on the specifics of the state‚Äôs interaction with society, one of its characteristics is manifested to one degree or another. </p>
