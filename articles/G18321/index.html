It occupies the southeastern part of Greece.  This place is already surprising in its name, which from Greek translates as "island of roses."  The collapse of the Aegean led to the formation of numerous islands, one of which is Rhodes.  By its size, the island is in fourth place.  But the biggest advantage of Rhodes is its unique climate. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The island is washed by the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas.  Its length is 77 km and its width is 37 km.  The coastline stretches for 220 kilometers.  130 thousand inhabitants live on the island, half of which inhabit the island's capital of the same name.  The city is located in the northern part of the island. </p><h2>  Myths and legends </h2><p>  The origin of Rhodes is unusual.  Many legends originating from the ancient world, tell of the amazing events that led to the emergence of the island.  One of them says that the ruler of the Universe Zeus defeated all enemies and conquered the Earth.  He divided his possessions among other gods.  Helios, for example, received a small island in the middle of the sea, on which he immediately shed its magic light.  This place has turned into the most attractive corner of the Earth.  When Helios saw his brainchild, he himself was in some shock from such magnificence.  Then he gave the island the name Rhodes.  Helios's beloved wife was called Rod.  Legend has it that it was in her honor that this paradise was named. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Most of the island is covered with mountain slopes.  On small plains incredibly fertile land.  A variety of medicinal herbs, conifers, majestic oaks and plane trees grow here.  Man began to explore Rhodes in the deep past.  Since that time, stormy events unfolded on the island.  Numerous empires sought to dominate such a rich land.  Already in 1400 BC  e.  Achaeans lived on the island.  Later, the cities of Ialysos, Lindos and Kamiros formed on this territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Despite the fact that today it is widespread to go on holiday abroad, having applied to various travel companies that offer ready-made tours, it will still be wiser to decide before which trip to which hotel to stay.  To begin with, Rhodes is washed by two seas: the Mediterranean and the Aegean.  The east of the island can be compared with Turkish resorts.  Sand on the beaches, almost no vegetation, the sea is warm and calm.  For those who prefer a comfortable beach holiday, this is an ideal option.  The part of the island washed by the Aegean waters is a mountainous area.  Almost always, winds blow here, which is why the sea often storms.  The southwestern part of Rhodes is great for windsurfers. </p><p>  This article will focus on the hotel Grecian Fantasia Resort 2 *, located in one of the most popular resorts - Faliraki. </p><h2>  Holidays in Faliraki </h2>

    <p>  Superior rooms deserve special attention.  Guests argue that even in 4 * hotels it is not always possible to meet such comfort.  The rooms are freshly renovated and have everything you need for a good rest and even more.  Do not be upset that air conditioning is available for a fee.  Here you can easily live without it.  Sometimes it is stuffy in the rooms, but bearable. </p><p>  Ground floor apartment for an amateur.  Instead of a bath there is a shower and a small bathroom.  If possible, it is better to choose rooms on the upper floors.  In addition to the bathroom, they also have a beautiful view of the sea.  The staff is very caring, although it does not speak Russian at all.  Garbage is cleaned daily.  Toiletries are not included in the room rate, so it is best to bring them with you.  Soap can not be taken. </p><h2>  Nutrition level </h2><p>  Hotel Grecian Fantasia 2 * ( <span>Rhodes, Faliraki)</span> offers breakfast and dinner.  For those who are not used to eating a lot in the morning, everything is perfect.  Breakfast includes eggs, toast, vegetables (mainly cucumbers and tomatoes), various breakfast cereals, jams, hot drinks.  Sometimes indulge in sausages, cheese, sausage and pastries.  Dinner is more varied.  Please note that all drinks at the hotel are paid.  Fruits are not particularly spoiled.  The entire period of rest can be fed only oranges. </p><p>  It's hard to stay hungry here.  In addition, next to the hotel is a wonderful place ‚ÄúCostas Studio‚Äù.  Here you can dine tightly.  Huge portions, delicious food, amazing kindness of the owners.  In addition, the Internet from here reaches the balconies of rooms located on the upper floors. </p><p>  On the way to the beach there is another wonderful place where you can have a tasty meal - the Orion restaurant.  Here is a huge selection of goodies for little money.  And here is Something Different restaurant for an amateur.  Prices here are an order of magnitude higher.
