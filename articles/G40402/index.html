    <p>  Biological resources (BR) are <span>sources of living</span> origin that contribute to a person receiving material benefits, for example, food, material for industry, plant breeding, animals and microorganisms.  These resources are an important component of the human environment and are presented in the form of plants, animals, bacteria, as well as ecosystems (forests, aquatic ecosystems, etc.). </p><p>  It should be noted that all organisms have the ability to reproduce, therefore, biological resources are renewable, it is only necessary to maintain appropriate conditions for this.  To date, the modern system of using BR can cause the elimination of a significant part of them. </p><p>  The main part of the BR is forest flora, due to which we have ¬º part of the annual increase in biomass.  Currently, human activities have led to the fact that this number of living matter has decreased, so the biological productivity of the Earth has decreased.  However, replacing part of the former forests with pastures, people thereby provided food and technical raw material to <span>the world's population.</span> </p><p>  Today, two belts form a forest on the planet: southern (deciduous trees) and northern (coniferous trees).  Those countries that do not have forest zones do not have enough forest natural resources. </p><p>  Currently, forest biological resources of Russia, Canada, the USA and Brazil are the largest.  At the same time, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsouthern forests begins to disappear due to increased export of wood and its use as fuel, while the forests of the sulfur belt remain virtually unchanged.  But, despite <span>this, these resources</span> are increasing annually. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Biological resources, namely food, account for twenty percent of all agricultural products and one percent of all productivity of the oceans and land.  It should be remembered that due to the rapid population growth rate, the productivity of crop products must be doubled, while livestock products should be doubled.  Thus, it is necessary to develop agriculture, irrigation, rational use of ocean resources. </p><p>  The biological resources of the oceans total one hundred million tons of products, of which twenty percent is left for its restoration.  All products are presented in the form of fish and non-fish objects;  many countries are engaged in the so-called marine farming, breeding algae, mollusks, sea cucumbers and fish. </p><p>  Thus, fish takes the first place in production (85%), then non-fish objects, including algae (9%), pinnipeds and whales (6%). </p><p>  Despite the fact that the <span>world's population is</span> growing rapidly, the increase in fishing is always faster.  The need to increase the number of extracted water bodies is associated both with the economy and with medicine, since the latter indicates the need for regular consumption of seafood by people. </p><p>  But still, do not forget about the need to double the amount of extraction of marine products. </p><p>  The biological resources of the animal world are world heritage, since animals ensure the purity of water bodies, soil fertility, pollination of flowers and so on. </p><p>  Today, many representatives of the fauna are facing extinction.  However, it should be said that so far many corners of the planet have not been explored, as well as many groups of organisms.  In addition, only a small part of natural objects is used by humans, and many ecosystems support themselves. </p><p>  Thus, BRs are all living objects of the biosphere that form the environment. </p>
