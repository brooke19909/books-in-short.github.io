However, many furniture and appliances require replacement (it is outdated).  There are also shortcomings in the quality of bedding (used, with small holes).  The reading lamp in the room was also broken.  Bath and toilet are clean.  They are shared by two rooms.  There was no queue.  Sometimes at night, extraneous sounds are heard from the station (train announcements).  However, this did not interfere with rest.  In the room for three people there were two sets of dishes (I had to use them in turn). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/hostel-on-belorusskom.html?aid=322754#tab-main"><img itemprop="image" alt="Double Room" class="if uuid-2972624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2972624.jpg"></div><p>  Of the shortcomings in all reviews there is only one thing - the lack of an elevator to the third floor.  Guests write that it is very difficult to climb stairs with filled suitcases and bags.  In reviews and comments, they ask the hotel administration to place convenient ramps for strollers and suitcases.  Belorussky railway station, Belorusskaya metro station and Tverskaya street in the immediate vicinity of the hotel are both plus and minus.  After all, all these busy places bring extraneous noise, which prevents hotel guests from relaxing. </p><p>  Reviews of guests who stayed at the hotel for a transit stay are mostly positive.  All the nuances of accommodation were instantly decided with the administrator.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  There is everything you need to eat.  As for the cost, then relative to other hotels near the station - this is the most budget option (as customers write in reviews). </p><p>  The hotel on the 3rd floor of the Belorussky railway station building is in demand by many guests of the city.  This is a great option for relaxing between trains or planes.  From this place it is convenient to get anywhere in the capital.  "City Hotel" is in the middle price category.  Living conditions are comfortable, standard.  A wide range of services. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  From all of the above reviews it follows that the Hotel City Hotel at the Belorussky Train Station in Moscow is in demand and popular.  Many believe that it would be nice to carry out ongoing cosmetic repairs, replace furniture and utensils.  The work of administrators is carried out efficiently and professionally. </p>
