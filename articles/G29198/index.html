Probably, many owners have such an assistant who is able to make their everyday life as easy as possible.  Despite its quality characteristics, washing machines even from this leading manufacturer, like any equipment, can fail due to various breakdowns.  One of the reasons for poor functioning of the unit or its failure is the bearing assembly. </p><p>  It is possible to fix the breakdown by involving companies working in the field of repairing various types of household appliances, but this will require additional financial costs.  If this is not possible, you can perform this work yourself.  How to change the bearing on the Samsung washing machine will be described in this article.  To perform repair work, you must carefully read the instructions provided. </p><h2>  The dependence of the performance of washing equipment on the bearing </h2><p>  The operability of the washing machine will depend on the high-quality functioning of the bearings, since it is these details that carry out the function of uniform rotation of its drum.  Two bearings are installed in the units, and their location is the inner plane of the tank.  They have different sizes and, as a result, carry different loads.  In the event of a bearing failure, the quality of the ‚ÄúWash‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpin‚Äù options will immediately change.  In this case, the question arises of how to change the bearing on the Samsung washing machine, because further use of the device can lead to more serious breakdowns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bearing replacement on a Samsung washing machine" class="if uuid-3066944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3066944.jpg"></div><h2>  The main causes of deterioration </h2><p>  They are divided into two types: </p><p>  1. Natural wear.  The service life of the bearing installed in the washing unit is 5-6 years.  As a result, bearing replacement after 5 years is not a breakdown, but is defined as the natural wear of the part. </p><p>  2. Premature failure.  It can be due to several reasons, such as: </p><ul><li>  Wear of oil seals.  They perform a protective function for bearings against contact with water.  The violation of its tightness due to the penetration of water will lead to a gradual flushing of the grease, which will be the main reason for the formation of corrosion of the bearing. </li><li>  Failure to comply with the weight standard for laundry placed in the drum of the machine. </li><li>  Failure to comply with the installation rules of the unit. </li></ul><h2>  Reasons for replacing bearings </h2><p>  The process of replacing a bearing is a complex and time-consuming process.  It provides for the complete dismantling of the device.  Therefore, before changing the bearing on the Samsung washing machine (6 kg) (on the drum), the culprit of the breakdown must be correctly identified.  For this, it is necessary to pay attention to such signs of unit operability: </p><ul><li>  sound changes during the execution of various options; </li><li>  poor-quality performance of spinning clothes; </li><li>  leakage under the lower base of the housing; </li><li>  the formation of play during the rotation of the drum of the machine. </li></ul><p>  If you do not replace the bearings on time, more complex breakdowns may occur: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  destruction of the seats of the parts, which will lead to the failure of the tank; </li><li>  mechanical damage to the shaft connected to the spider mounted on the drum. </li></ul><h2>  Tools required for repair work </h2><p>  To replace the bearing on a Samsung washing machine, you will need: </p><ul><li>  A set of hand tools with screwdrivers and wrenches. </li><li>  The hammer is metal. </li><li>  <span>Cold chisel.</span> </li><li>  Pliers or other types of wiring tools. </li><li>  Lubricant </li><li>  A hermetic substance having a high resistance to high temperatures. <div class="photo" data-original="www.hometips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the bearing on a Samsung washing machine 6 kg on a drum" class="if uuid-3066949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3066949.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Recommendations of repair masters </h2><p>  When performing repair work on replacing the bearing on the Samsung washing machine, you should pay attention to some recommendations of specialists in the repair of such equipment: </p><ol><li>  Lay out the removed parts, separating them at the location. </li><li>  Record the removal procedure. </li><li>  To eliminate the problem of finding the desired fastener during assembly of the machine, unscrew the fasteners after removing the part and return to the seat and tighten it slightly. </li><li>  Carefully carry out all work on detaching parts to avoid mechanical damage. </li></ol><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  These are mandatory activities that must be completed before changing the bearing on the Samsung WF F861 washing machine, or any other model.  The dismantling process can only be started after the following conditions are met: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Determine the place where repairs will be carried out.  To do this, you must have free access to technology, as well as free space to accommodate dismantled parts. </li><li>  Disconnect the unit from electrical power. </li><li>  Block the water access to the device by setting the water tap in the ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù position. </li><li>  We disconnect from all communication systems. </li><li>  Install the washing machine in a prepared place. </li></ol><h2>  Alternately removing the washing machine housing panels </h2><p>  Owners of modern technology often have a question about how to change the bearing on a Samsung Diamond washing machine (6 kg).  This is a fairly popular model, affordable for almost everyone.  Start dismantling as follows: </p><p>  1. Removing the top panel. </p><p>  The master will: </p><ul><li>  by using a screwdriver, unscrew the bolts located on the rear side of the housing; </li><li>  carefully slide the panel and remove it. <div class="photo" data-original="www.searspartsdirect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the bearing on a Samsung washing machine 4.5 kg" class="if uuid-3066987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3066987.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  2. Disconnecting the control panel. </p><p>  To do this, you must: </p><ul><li>  Remove the drawer for detergents.  To do this, pull it out and press on the latch located in the middle cell of the tray. </li><li>  Unscrew the two screws arranged on the plane of the control panel. </li><li>  Unscrew the three self-tapping screws, which are the fastening of the internal base.  They are located on the metal frame of the unit. </li><li>  Remove the screws that connect the control unit to the front panel and the instrument housing. </li><li>  Pull the control panel in one direction (towards you), and the dispenser tank in the opposite direction.  As a result, the dispenser will disconnect from the base. </li></ul><p>  Do not completely disconnect the control unit.  You can leave it on the plane of the case, since changing the bearing on the Samsung washing machine (4-5 kg) is quite possible without completely dismantling it.  It will not interfere with the removal of the tank from the housing. </p><p>  3. Removing a narrow panel.  It is located at the bottom of the case on the front side. </p><p>  4. Removing the front cover of the housing. </p><p>  It is necessary: </p><ul><li>  Remove the screws that secure the inner plane of the base where the powder container is installed. </li><li>  The rubber cuff arranged between the round bases of the hatch and the drum must be removed.  To do this, bend the rubber part and slightly hook the clamp using a screwdriver.  Remove it and put it back to the removed parts. </li><li>  Unscrew the fasteners arranged on the front of the case (3 pcs at the top and 4 pcs at the bottom). </li><li>  Delete the panel.  The process of disconnecting the panel from the housing must be carried out with extreme caution in order to exclude mechanical damage to the plastic heck. </li><li>  Disconnect the electrical connector from the door lock element. </li><li>  Set aside the removed panel. <div class="photo" data-original="subir.pw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the bearing on a Samsung washing machine 6 kg" class="if uuid-3067017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3067017.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Component Disconnection Process </h2><p>  Having finished the process of removing panels, we proceed to the next stage of disassembling the machine: </p><ol><li>  We disconnect the connecting hoses from the inner base of the dispenser by loosening the metal clamps. </li><li>  We remove the counterweight by unscrewing the fixing screws.  Attention should be paid to the heavy weight of this element. </li><li>  Dismantle the water level sensor connected by a rubber hose to the base of the dispenser.  We remove the clamp mounted on the rubber hose, which will free the part from the hose. </li><li>  We disconnect the pipe, which is the connection between the tank and the dispenser element. </li><li>  We remove the balances, arranged on the plane of the tank.  It is necessary to unscrew the six bolts with the socket wrench. </li><li>  We carry out the detachment of the pipe from the tank, arranged in the lower plane of the body.  It connects the tank to the drain pump, from which we also disconnect it. </li><li>  We remove the horizontal metal profile located in the upper part of the body.  To do this, unscrew several fasteners. </li><li>  We remove the back cover by unscrewing the screws with a screwdriver. </li><li>  It is necessary to disconnect the contacts of the heating device (TEN) using electrical pliers. </li><li>  We disconnect the tank shock absorbers and carefully remove the tank from the body. <div class="photo" data-original="mattgadient.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the bearing on the washing machine &quot;Samsung wf f861&quot;" class="if uuid-3066970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3066970.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  The process of removing the drum from the tank </h2><p>  To perform the separation of the tank, it is necessary to position it so that in the upper part there is a pulley, which is also subject to dismantling.  But first, you need to remove the drive belt from the electric motor and the pulley and disconnect the tank from the motor by unscrewing the fasteners of the motor.  Only after performing these steps we unscrew the bolt installed in the center of the pulley using a hexagon.  Then we remove the pulley using the method of insignificant scrolling of the part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.how-to-repair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the bearing on a Samsung Diamond washing machine 6 kg" class="if uuid-3066956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3066956.jpg"></div><p>  We remove the clamps, divide the tank into two parts and remove the seal installed between them.  One of them will be equipped with a drum.  We knock out the shaft using a hammer, and remove the drum from the part of the tank. </p><h2>  How to change the bearing on a Samsung washing machine (5 kg) on ‚Äã‚Äãa drum </h2><p>  You can purchase new parts at retail outlets or in specialized stores.  But before changing the bearing on the Samsung washing machine (3-5 kg), it is necessary to choose the right size of components correctly.  The best option will be the presence of parts that have fallen into disrepair.  And also should be replaced immediately bearings and seals.  The latter are purchased in accordance with the size of the previous part. </p><p>  Before changing the bearing on a Samsung washing machine, first of all, it is necessary to inspect the shaft, the spider and the landing seats for mechanical damage.  If the parts do not have any flaws, we clean them of dirt accumulated during their operation.  We remove the gland, using a slotted screwdriver, proceed to the removal of worn bearings.  The outer bearing is knocked out first when using a special puller or chisel.  In the case of using a chisel, it is necessary to install it on the rim of the part and apply uniform blows with a hammer in order to prevent distortion of the part.  These actions will remove it from the landing slot.  The inner bearing is knocked out in a similar way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sparesonweb.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the bearing on a Samsung washing machine" class="if uuid-3066940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3066940.jpg"></div><p>  We carry out technical work for the installation of new parts: cleaning the seats from contamination, processing with WD-40, applying grease. </p><p>  We proceed to install unused bearings in the seats.  We install first the inner, and then the outer bearing.  Details are installed only smoothly and all the way in the seats.  The grease sealed with grease is placed on the upper bearing base. </p><p>  We return the drum and shaft to the previous place, in the plane of the tank part, and carry out the process of joining its parts: apply sealant to the edge of the base of one of its parts, put a seal between them, and install the mounting lugs. </p><p>  We are assembling the washing machine.  On this repair work aimed at changing the bearing on the Samsung washing machine is over.  You can test a repaired appliance by starting a quick wash cycle. </p>
