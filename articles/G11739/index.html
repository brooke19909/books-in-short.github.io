The courtyard of the property is also attractive.  The developer created it on the principle of "yard without cars."  The underground parking is created in two levels, it holds 193 cars.  Inside the house there is a high-speed elevator.  The complex is also thought out from the point of view of young parents.  The closed territory makes children's games safe; on the ground floor there are rooms for strollers.  That is, the developer even took care of the little things that make life very easy.  This applies to niches for air conditioners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD caramel Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2229525.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Overall impression of the complex </h2><p>  Buyers note that LCD "Caramel" (Moscow) is very well planned.  When creating a project, the developer took into account current trends, as well as the properties of the latest materials.  According to the designers, the construction of the building successfully combines granite and glass, as well as a composite that is used for volume panels and facade cladding.  Thanks to this, the house looks amazingly stylish, functional and comfortable.  Living in such a house is very pleasant.  Many customers say that they dreamed about such a house and are very happy with their purchase. </p><h2>  Types of apartments </h2><p>  Housing in this complex is characterized by spacious and roomy rooms.  No wonder the construction belongs to the business class.  Responses LCD "Caramel" is called one of the most successful modern projects.  The developer chose the district very competently, designed a functional building, which made the complex desirable and attractive for the widest audience.  The complex provides </p><ul><li>  40 one-room apartments; </li><li>  30 two-room apartments; </li><li>  30 three-room apartments; </li><li>  11 four-room apartments. </li></ul><p>  Finishing at the initial stage from the developer is not provided.  The layout is free, no partitions.  The cost of apartments is from 14 to 50 million rubles.  Of course, if you purchase housing after the repair, the cost will be much higher.  Judging by the reviews, one-bedroom apartments are considered the most successful.  They are large enough, if desired, the area can be planned into three rooms.  Moreover, their prices are average in the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD caramel Savelovskaya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2229517.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Installment plan </h2><p>  RC "Caramel" (Savelovskaya) provides an installment plan with an initial payment of at least 30% of the price of the apartment.  This offer is directly from the developer.  It is convenient to those that have virtually no overpayment, but the timing is very limited.  Therefore, most often customers resort to the service of the bank.  The company cooperates on a lending program with OJSC Kredobank.  Details can be found if you contact the sales department. </p><p>  Each apartment has a technical passport and registration document.  A notarized contract of sale is concluded with the buyer.  This provides for the transfer of ownership from the developer to the buyer.  After that, he has every right to independently sell it or rent it out.  Customer reviews emphasize that the document flow in the company is delivered very well.  All operations are carried out quickly, and competent managers are always ready to answer all questions. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Buying an apartment in Moscow is a dream of many people, as well as a profitable investment.  And if the house is located in a quiet area with developed infrastructure and good ecology, then this is just a dream.  One of the best developers in the capital offers a modern, comfortable complex that takes into account all the needs of residents.  Apartments in this complex are especially suitable for young families.  The proximity of parks allows you to spend time with children in the fresh air, and the convenient location of gardens and schools removes unnecessary burdens from parents.  RC "Caramel" is the best choice for those who are looking for a little more than just their apartment. </p>
