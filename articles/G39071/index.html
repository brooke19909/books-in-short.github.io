    <h2>  Short description of the reservoir </h2><p>  In the seventies, there was a need for technical water supply and water improvement of the city.  The Svisloch River helped to resolve these issues.  For this, the construction of the dam was started.  The flowing reservoir, its area is more than 2 square meters.  km  The depth of the reservoir is different, the largest is six meters. </p><p>  In the middle of the mirror surface there are four small islands with forest plantations.  In these thickets there are a large number of forest birds.  On the surface of the reservoir, you can often see ducks, swans and geese, which are happy to feed vacationers. </p><p>  Not the only body of water in these environs are Drozdy (Minsk).  <span>The Zaslavskoye reservoir</span> is located very close to it.  Between themselves they are connected by a channel.  This place is often used for water sports.  There are equipped beaches along the coastline, as well as boat stations where you can rent water equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="swiss river" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155681.jpg" width="600"></div>

On each of them cabins for changing clothes, benches for rest, umbrellas and fungi are installed.  On the beach number 5 and number 8 put showers in which you can rinse after the swim.  Each vacationer here will have a great time and find himself a suitable occupation among their great variety.  Convenient sun loungers for relaxing will allow you to sit on the shore of a pond, take a sun bath and enjoy the warm breeze. </p><p>  In the cafe ‚ÄúShish kebab yard‚Äù you can enjoy aromatic kebabs.  Those who prefer outdoor activities can play <span>beach volleyball.</span>  Playgrounds are organized for children at the Drozdy pond (Svisloch River), where the kids will spend time playing interesting games.  You can also take a walk among man-made grottoes and waterfalls.  After an intense rest in such a picturesque place, everyone will have a large number of photos for memory. </p><p>  One of the beaches is located right in the city, which can be reached on the Avenue of Favorites in just a few minutes.  For the convenience of visitors, there is a car park near the shore. </p><p>  After the construction of the Minsk-Arena, the reservoir was to become a unique place for recreation and a pearl for urban residents.  But in fact, it was not possible to fully refine the coastline.  It is divided into a civilized (for recreation) zone, a wild (for walking) and one on which the human foot has not stepped at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackbirds Minsk reservoir" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155686.jpg" width="500"></div>

After the completion of the construction of the Minsk-Arena, it became easier to get to it.  There is public transport to the destination. </p><p>  For example, beach number 2 is located directly in the city.  This place is especially popular with the townspeople.  The explanation is very simple: just take a trolley bus (route number 10), and after a few stops you will find yourself in a pond.  Many buses also come here: No. 1, 44, 119s, 133, 136. The stop at which you need to get off is called Minsk-Manege.  Then literally walk 500 meters along Tikhaya Street, and now there is the reservoir of Drozdy. </p><p>  To the beaches No. 5, 6, 7, 8 there are two bus routes (44 and 136).  You need to exit at the "School" stop.  After that, go along Parkovaya street to the coastline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thrush reservoir how to get there" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Despite everything, this pond is a favorite place in the summer for tourists and for ice fishing in the winter.  In total, about ten species of fish live in the reservoir, but most often there are crucian carp, bream, bleak, perch, ruff. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the Drozdy reservoir is flowing, fishing on it is difficult.  Fishermen have the opinion that anyone who can catch fish in this pond is considered a professional. </p><p>  By the way, this reservoir is perfect for family holidays: adults will increase their professionalism in fishing and cooking, and children will enjoy <span>games in the fresh air</span> and aromatic soup. </p>
