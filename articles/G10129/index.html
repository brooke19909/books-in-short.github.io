It‚Äôs not a secret for anyone that various situations can happen during this, including road accidents.  Therefore, the car owner must have insurance. </p><p>  Any driver faced a problem when, when trying to get insurance payment, the insurer refused to provide payment due to the loss of the commodity value of the vehicle.  Most of all, owners of expensive cars face this situation, which can lose up to 30 percent in value.  In order not to get into a difficult situation, each driver must know how to get TCB in compulsory motor liability insurance. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the activities of insurance companies are regulated by law, nevertheless there are a lot of pitfalls in it, which provide many options for loopholes for unscrupulous insurers.  As practice shows, it is possible to resolve the issue of insurance payments through the court, but not all motorists know how to do this. </p><h2>  general information </h2>

On the one hand, this is not surprising, because a new car costs significantly more than the one that was in an accident, but on the other hand, the car owner loses the amount of monetary compensation in the event of an insured event.

According to the current legislation, only <span>real damage</span> resulting from the accident is subject to compensation, and after the car is repaired, it ceases to be so.  So how do you get full compensation in the case of TCB for compulsory motor third party liability insurance? </p><h2>  In what situations is TCB expected to be paid? </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that to receive payment for the loss of the commodity value of a vehicle is far from possible in all cases. </p><p>  To do this, you need to satisfy several criteria: </p><ul><li>  not be responsible for the accident; </li><li>  the amount of damage received should not exceed 400 thousand rubles; </li><li>  the age of the vehicle should not exceed 5 years if a car is of foreign manufacture, and 4 years for Russian cars; </li><li>  machine wear should not be more than 35%. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that the conditions for the payment of TCB under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance are similar, as for hull insurance.  Therefore, if you do not satisfy at least one of the items listed, then you can not count on the payment of monetary compensation. </p><h2>  How is TCB calculated? </h2>

After the completion of the examination, the company issues a document stating the exact amount of the repair, taking into account the technical condition of the car. </p><h2>  How to receive payment on TCB? </h2><p>  The main problem of receiving insurance payments under TCB is that insurers, by law, are not required to make them.  All insurance companies refer to the legislation, which says that only real damage resulting from the accident is subject to compensation.  Therefore, before going to court, it is necessary to understand whether it makes any sense to bring the case to trial.  It is very easy to determine this if you compare the current market value of new and broken cars of the same brand. </p><p>  Next, you must complete the following steps: </p><ul><li>  submit to the insurance company an application for TCB for CTP, a sample of which can be obtained from the insurer; </li><li>  if the insurance company refuses to compensate for the damage, then it is necessary to undergo an independent examination to evaluate the performed repair work; </li><li>  prepare a statement of claim and the necessary package of documents for the trial. </li></ul><p>  As practice shows, in most cases the courts take the side of the motorist. </p><h2>  Application </h2>

    <p>  If, when calculating the TCB for CTP, it was found that the cost of the repair work exceeds 400 thousand rubles, which the insurance company is obliged to pay in accordance with the current legislation, the rest of the compensation is borne by the person responsible for the accident. </p><h2>  Forfeit </h2><p>  To date, a separate provision for the penalty in the event of a delay in compensation for the loss of the commodity value of the car is not provided, and any problems associated with it are resolved in a standard manner.

The insurance company has 20 calendar days to reimburse TCB under compulsory motor liability insurance. </p><h2>  When repairing a service station </h2>

    <p>  It is important to understand that no insurer will voluntarily indemnify, therefore, this problem will have to be resolved through a court according to the standard scheme that was described earlier.  Do not be afraid of litigation, because, as practice shows, in most cases the insurer wins. </p><p>  But only those motorists whose vehicle wear level does not exceed a certain threshold can count on receiving payments.  For CASCO policies, it is not more than 35 percent, and for compulsory motor liability insurance - 40%. </p><h2>  A few tips and tricks for getting TCB </h2><p>  The process of receiving payments in case of loss of the commodity value of the car is very complicated, since this goes against the interests of the insurance company, which will try to refuse them to the client by all possible means.  In this article, step-by-step instructions were described in detail, by observing which, compensation for damage can be achieved. </p><p>  Here are some more general tips and tricks that will be useful to drivers who have encountered a TCB: </p><ul><li>  If the amount of damage incurred on TCB exceeds the limit of insurance payments specified in the contract, then compensation for the remaining amount can be requested from the person who caused the accident. </li><li><strong></strong>  Accidents occurring as a result of a collision with green spaces and some types of buildings also fall under the category of insurance cases with TCB. <strong></strong></li><li><strong></strong>  According to new changes in legislation, TCB compensation can be obtained if the car was damaged at the hands of hooligans not only on the roads, but also in the yards. </li><li>  If an accident was recorded using the European protocol, then TC compensation can be obtained if there is a photo and video from the scene. </li></ul>
