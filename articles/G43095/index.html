    <p>  Although you can see it from almost every corner of the city, so you definitely should not worry that you will get lost for some reason.  You can get to it by metro, bus or taxi, but still, to feel the greatness, it is better to walk from the Louvre or Concorde Square. </p><p>  This impressive structure, together with the antenna, reaches a height of 324 m. It was built in 1889, when the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution was celebrated.  During the World Exhibition, an entrance arch was required.  For this purpose, a tower was erected.  No one suspected that this particular design would become famous throughout the world as a symbol of the French capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many people know about the restaurant on the second platform.  It is called Jules Verne.  However, tourists should pay attention: to visit this unusual institution, a table must be booked in advance. </p><p>  <span>The Eiffel Tower in Paris</span> (a photo of it is presented in the article) also has reduced copies that were built in Las Vegas, Copenhagen, Guangzhou, Slobozia, Varna and some other cities of the world. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2. Where is the Eiffel Tower?</strong>  <strong>What does it look like and what can be found inside?</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the city where the Eiffel Tower is located" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/279914.jpg" width="600"></div>  The construction process of the famous tower took a record short time - only 2 years.  How did this succeed?  According to experts, the construction of this complex technical structure so quickly turned out to be possible only through the use of new construction methods.

    <p>  We had to work on the artistic appearance especially carefully.  The 4 columns of the lower floor are connected, forming an arched vault on top, on which the first platform is located.  A second pyramidal tower is installed on it, the arch of which is the support of the second platform.  She, in turn, is the support of the third platform with a lighthouse and a dome.  At the top of the building is a favorite observation deck for tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the tower was built, it was a tremendous success.  In fairness it should be noted that there were also dissatisfied.  They claimed that a huge metal structure would negatively impact the city‚Äôs image.  However, even today she surprises and delights those who see her for the first time. </p><p>  Restaurants, observatories (meteorological and astronomical), a physical office, a lighthouse and an observation deck - all this is located in an amazing tower that has become a symbol of Paris. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3. Where is the Eiffel Tower, Or what you did not know about the design so far</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eiffel Tower Paris photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/279913.jpg" width="600"></div>  First of all, one cannot fail to mention the fact that the Eiffel project initially envisaged the construction of a tower that was supposed to stand for only 20 years.  But today, after more than a century has passed since its construction, it is still in its original place and causes admiration.  By the way, by the time the construction was completed, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world.  The engineering design is very complex: during installation, 18 thousand 38 elements made of wrought iron had to be connected.

    <p>  After the tower was erected, amazingly brave people repeatedly jumped from it.  I do not mean people with a mental disorder or suicides, not at all.  They are rather lovers of extreme sports.  For them, the city where the Eiffel Tower is located is primarily associated with the conquest of another height and setting another personal record. </p><p>  At first glance, it is difficult to imagine that the tower is painted once every 7 years.  And this is done manually using ordinary brushes.  But not everything is so prosaic.  Thanks to the use of three shades - from darker at the bottom to light at the top - to the bottom observers it seems to be monotonously colored. </p>
