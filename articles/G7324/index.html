Along with large hypermarkets, there are communication stores where you can purchase equipment.  For example, you can buy an expensive phone and pay no more than a few thousand rubles a month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ictworks.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile phones" class="if uuid-3157248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157248.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the conditions of installments in the "Euroset" and the features of its design.  But first, it‚Äôs worth clarifying what is more profitable: a usual loan or the ability to make payments on a monthly basis.  What is the difference between these methods of buying mobile phones? </p><h2>  Which is better: installment plan or loan </h2><p>  If you get a standard loan, then in this case, as a rule, the overpayment will be greater.  In installments, customers are available goods with a total value of more than 3,000 rubles.  After this, an agreement is drawn up with the bank, which is a partner of the communication salon.  As a rule, then the buyer can pay the purchase amount over a rather long period: from 6 months to 3 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbc.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installment purchase" class="if uuid-3157260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157260.jpg"></div><p>  Installment is an interest-free loan.  The client will also cooperate with a bank that is ready to deposit money in favor of a particular product by installments.  In this case, the purchase price is divided by the crediting period.  Interest may be, but they are usually minimal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Installment conditions in Euroset may vary depending on the specific financial institution that issues the funds for the purchase.  Today, this mobile phone salon cooperates with the largest banks.  Consider the features of their terms and conditions of the Euroset. </p><h2>  Home Credit Bank </h2><p>  In this case, the installment conditions in Euroset on the phone are quite flexible.  The client can repay the loan for 10 months, 2 or 3 years.  A down payment is not necessary.  In the total cost, you can include not only the smartphone itself, but also accessories for it, services or additional paid software. </p><p>  But here, according to the installment plan in Euroset, the purchase price should be at least 1,500 rubles, but not more than 80,000 rubles.  If we talk about the commission, then it is practically reduced to zero.  For example, when buying a phone under the terms ‚Äú0-0-10‚Äù, the full cost of the goods must be paid in full for 10 months.  The standard overpayment in this case should be about 28%, but due to the fact that the seller makes a discount on the goods, no commission will have to be paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="af.reuters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home loan" class="if uuid-3157253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157253.jpg"></div><p>  If you issue a loan under the terms "0-0-24", then the payments will stretch for 2 years.  The bank itself in this case gives money at a rate of 18.83%, and the seller - a discount of 17.5%.  Accordingly, the overpayment will be almost imperceptible.  If you buy the goods with installments for 36 months, then the overpayment will be 16.6%, taking into account the discount from Euroset. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, if you study in detail the installment conditions for Euroset smartphones, you should pay attention that such a program does not apply to all models, but only to some products from Samsung, ZTE or Sony.  The list should be clarified before purchase. </p><h2>  "Post Bank" </h2><p>  Considering what conditions of installments in the "Euroset", it is worth paying attention that the mobile phone salon is also cooperating with this institution.  In this case, there are three programs.  According to the first, the goods are provided in installments for 12 months without down payment.  Interest combined.  This means that the first 3 months the overpayment is 46%, and the next - 7.5%.  However, the seller provides a discount of 12%. </p><p>  Installment terms 0-0-24 Euroset are relevant only for Samsung phones.  The client can repay the entire amount of the goods for 2 years.  In this case, the overpayment will be minimal.  The bank itself will take a commission of 8.14%, and the store will provide an 8% discount. </p><p>  It is also possible to get installments for 36 months.  In this case, the annual rate will be from 7.5 to 16.5%, and the discount on the mobile phone salon will be 12%. </p><h2>  OTP Bank </h2><p>  In cooperation with this financial organization, the installment conditions in Euroset will be more diverse.  There are 4 programs at once.  They do not require a down payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="OTP Bank" class="if uuid-3157255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157255.jpg"></div><p>  For example, you can receive goods in installments for 10 months.  In this case, the initial cost will be reduced by 12%, and the overpayment will be only 28.7%.  When concluding a contract for 1 year, the discount for a cell phone is the same, but the commission increases slightly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When buying with payments for 24 months, the initial cost of the goods decreases by 16.5%.  The commission is 34.4%.  It is also possible to get a phone in installments for 3 years.  The seller‚Äôs discount in such a situation reaches 16.5%. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that such programs are flexible in terms.  For example, a client can immediately make 50% of the cost of goods, then the final overpayment will decrease even more. </p><p>  However, if you are interested in the installment plan in Euroset on an iPhone, then this option will not work.  OTP Bank provides loans only for products of Meizu and Samsung.  If you want to get exactly the iPhone, then it is recommended to consider the following financial institution. </p><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  This is perhaps the only partner in the mobile phone salon who is ready to provide their services for any product.  But in this case we are talking about a targeted loan, and not about installments.  Nevertheless, the bank's offers are quite profitable. </p><p>  A standard loan is provided for 6-24 months with an overpayment of 27-36%.  The amount of commission depends on whether the initial payment will be made or not. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russia-ic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfa Bank" class="if uuid-3157251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157251.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can be provided with installments </h2><p>  If we talk about the conditions and registration of installments in the Euroset, then they are standard.  The borrower must have a civil passport in his hands, which will act as the main identity document.  You will also need a driver‚Äôs license, pension certificate, passport or SNILS.  However, if cooperation is planned with Post Bank, then a second document is not needed, just a passport. </p><p>  Another condition is that the client of a banking institution must be registered in the Russian Federation.  If we are talking about Home Credit Bank, then the borrower must live in the region where the bank branch is located. </p><p>  Installments are granted only to those who have reached the age of majority.  Get a loan does not work for people over 70 years.  Also, most banks require confirmation of their solvency.  To do this, you must provide a work book with the appropriate entry. </p><p>  At the conclusion of the contract, you must specify the correct data.  If necessary, a bank employee should be able to contact the borrower.  In some financial institutions, a prerequisite is the provision of a telephone number for relatives or other persons who can be called by representatives of a financial institution if the client does not pick up the phone. </p><h2>  Experience and income </h2><p>  Not all banking institutions are interested in this.  Basically, loans are small, so the conditions are not as stringent as when obtaining large loans.  Nevertheless, in order to draw up an agreement with Home Credit Bank, you must confirm that the client has been working in one place for more than 3 months.  At the same time, the borrower's income must be at least 6,000 rubles (in some cases, this indicator can be increased to 10,000 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="dfly.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salon &quot;Euroset&quot;" class="if uuid-3157257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157257.jpg"></div><p>  Other organizations are not so demanding.  This is another plus installment plan. </p><h2>  It's important to know </h2><p>  There are several recommendations that can be called general for any transactions with financial institutions.  For example, you need to understand that an employee of a mobile phone salon only deals with filling out an application to the bank.  If the manager of a financial organization changes the terms of the transaction and raises the annual rate, he must notify the borrower.  Only after all the conditions are agreed, you can sign the contract. </p><p>  If the client decides to pay the full amount ahead of time or, conversely, delays in payments, the store discount is also recounted.  This is important to take into account so as not to be surprised at large overpayments, etc. </p><h2>  Reviews about installments of "Euroset" on phones and conditions </h2><p>  Basically, customers are satisfied with the possibility that the goods can be purchased on favorable terms and not save the entire amount for the purchase of an expensive phone.  This is convenient, and the interest is not so high.  Also, many are advised to immediately include in installments additional accessories.  This will not greatly increase the purchase price and save you from future costs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chelorg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buying a phone" class="if uuid-3157258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3157258.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the minuses, then, as a rule, the discontent is caused only by the fact that many banks offer similar services only to certain models of phones or other equipment.  Also, when drawing up a contract, many advise to clarify whether insurance products are included in it.  It is better to refuse them so that the final amount of the overpayment does not increase.  Since the contracts are standard, similar services are included in them by default.  However, this does not mean at all that they cannot be excluded. </p><p>  In all other respects, mobile phone shop customers are satisfied with such acquisitions.  Monthly payments allow you to make a purchase not so significant for the budget.  Therefore, the financial condition of customers is not much affected. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  When signing any loan agreement, you need to carefully study all its conditions and each item separately.  Sometimes additional options are indicated in the documents, which, if desired, can be disabled.  There is no point in overpaying for unnecessary services.  For example, when buying a phone there is absolutely no need for additional insurance.  It is beneficial only with large loans. </p>
