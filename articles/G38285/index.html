Other names - the city of Christ, the Cross Mountain, the Mountain of Christ, the city of the Cross.  This is one of the places where a very significant relic for Christianity is stored.  Namely, the Cross of Jesus.  But this is not only a place for pilgrimage, but also a beautiful natural landscape that pleases the soul. </p><h2>  General Description of Cross Mountain </h2><p>  This mountain is a large Bulgarian spiritual center, attracting thousands of pilgrims from all over the world every year.  Mount Krestova (or Christ) is located in Bulgaria.  It is located in a mountainous region in the Middle Rhodopes, near the village of Borovo.  Its height is more than 1.5 km above sea level.  Cross Mountain has a whole monastery complex.  This Christian monastery is located at around 1,545 meters. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross mountain" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1191487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The nearest town - Asenovgrad - is located forty-five kilometers from this hill.  The monastery is confined to a fragment of the cross hidden underground, on which Jesus Christ was crucified.  In addition to all this, the Cross Mountain is located in a very picturesque place.  Her photos are especially good in the fall, when all the surroundings to the horizon, as if in gold, are covered with yellow foliage.  The monastery is located in a beautiful meadow in the middle of the forest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cross of the lord </h2><p>  The name of the mountain is associated with, perhaps, the main relic of Christians - the Lord‚Äôs Cross.  This cross, on which Jesus was crucified, according to legend, was hidden by the enemies of the Christian faith.  Only thanks to the desperate efforts of the Holy <span>Equal to the Apostles Helena was</span> it possible to find the missing relic.  A certain Jew, Judas, pointed to the place of a buried cross.  It turned out that the enemies not only threw a cross into the cave, throwing it with various debris and earth, but also erected a pagan temple on this site. </p>

    <p>  The Christians managed to get the Cross, destroying the pagan shrine and digging it from the ground.  Together with the Cross, two other crosses lay there.  It was possible to find out on which of the crosses the Savior was crucified by applying crosses to the body of a hopelessly sick woman.  Only the third cross healed her, and it was declared authentic. </p><p>  Subsequently, the Cross of the Lord showed other miracles of healing and even resurrection from the dead.  The found shrine was demonstrated in the city square.  In order for everyone to see him, the Cross was raised high above their heads.  As part of this historic event, the <span>feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is celebrated.</span> </p><h2>  Traditions of Mount Krestovoi </h2><p>  Particular veneration of this place is connected with the legend that a part of the historical cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified was buried on a mountain, underground.  It is believed that this relic has powerful healing power.  Mountain monks recorded in their chronicles many healings that happened to believers on top of the mountain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the holy place several chapels were erected.  The first of them is dedicated to the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the rest to the disciples (Apostles) of Christ. </p>

    <p>  In the XVII century, Mount Krestova began to have an Orthodox monastery, but in the same century it was destroyed by Muslim fanatics who carried out the violent Islamization of the population.  Many monks were killed.  Despite this, the worship of Mount Cross did not stop. </p><p>  Mount Krestova also has a healing consecrated spring, it is located near the chapels. </p><h2>  Stolen and Found Cross </h2><p>  Shortly before World War II, <span>Tsar of Bulgaria Boris</span> III presented the monastery with a cross weighing 66 kilograms (the weight of the cross is twice the <span>age of Christ).</span>  Apparently, the Bulgarian crown was not very rich, since the donated cross consisted of iron.  However, this fact did not save the monastery from robbery - during the war the cross was stolen.  The logic of the robbers who stole the iron cross, which was not particularly valuable on the market, is incomprehensible. </p><p>  Be that as it may, after the war, instead of stolen, a new cross was erected, already weighing 99 kilograms.  And after that they managed to find the old one by some miracle, and now it is stored in one of the chapels.  Human rumor ascribes to the newfound cross a special healing power. </p><h2>  Special days </h2><p>  The largest number of pilgrims comes to the monastery complex between 13-14.09 of each year.  September 13, the day of the veneration of John Chrysostom, tens of thousands of tourists come to stay at the All-night Prayer before the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.  This day is especially revered by the monks because of the legends of the monastery about the part of the Cross buried on the mountain. </p><p>  In the monastery complex you can stay for the night, the monks willingly answer any questions.  Entrance to the territory is free.  There is also a church store where you can buy literature and icons. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The road that leads to the complex is Asenovgrad-Smolyan.  It can be reached by car or taxi.  From Asenovgrad to the mountain about 45 kilometers. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross mountain description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1191490.jpg"></div>
