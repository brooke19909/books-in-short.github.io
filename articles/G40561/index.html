  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The bus station of St. Petersburg on the embankment of the Obvodny Canal</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The northern capital, called Northern <span>Venice, St. Petersburg</span> is alluring and beautiful, but sometimes you feel like leaving your house, taking a bus and traveling, exploring something new, seeing new places, cities or maybe even new countries.  One of the means of transport by which this wish can be fulfilled is the bus, largely due to the proximity of the city to the Russian border.  Any resident of the city knows to buy a ticket and hit the road, will allow the bus station of St. Petersburg on the embankment of the Obvodny Canal. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.9135886" data-lng="30.357778300000064" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/5/1/3/9513.png"></div><p>  The easiest way to get to it will be by metro: the violet line, the Obvodny Canal station. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  It was opened in the spring of 1963 and was then called Bus Station No. 2. It is currently the only bus station in St. Petersburg - the Northern Bus Station was opened in May 2007, but it is located in Murino, actually outside the city. </p><p>  Over the years the bus station has existed, its throughput has been increased from twenty to one hundred and sixty buses per hour.  This was mainly due to the modernization carried out in 2001-2003. </p><p>  Now bus communication connects more than seventy destinations - among them regional, interregional and even international.  The most popular destinations are Vyborg, Novgorod, Pskov, Northern and Tallinn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The complete reconstruction of the bus station in St. Petersburg was a gift to the city for its 300th anniversary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stingynomads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Divorce bridge over the Neva" class="if uuid-2863366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104539/2863366.jpg"></div><h2>  Where can I go? </h2><p>  If we talk about the possibility of traveling abroad, then from here you can go to the capital and just the cities of countries such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova.  In addition, you can also get to the Republic of Karelia, Novgorod and Pskov regions, Stavropol Territory. </p><p>  And with the help of the <span>bus station in St. Petersburg,</span> you can visit Vyborg and look at the famous castle, towers and houses of the Swedish, medieval, national romantic and Soviet periods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saint-petersburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The bus moving along the route to St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2863360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104539/2863360.jpg"></div><h2>  Why choose a bus? </h2><p>  A bus has a number of advantages over a train or plane.  The first and foremost is, of course, the price.  A trip by bus will cost several times cheaper than flying by plane or traveling by train.  For example, a <span>trip to Tallinn</span> (October 2018) will cost 4,500 rubles if you choose an airplane as a means of transportation;  2000 rubles, if you choose seats on the train;  and at 880 rubles if you choose a bus.  At the same time, the journey by bus takes two or even three hours less than by train. </p><p>  The second reason is phobias.  Yes, you can say as much as you like that planes fall less often than cars get into accidents, but to find a person who is afraid of flying is much easier than to be afraid of buses. </p><p>  These reasons are caused by the fact that even now the bus station in St. Petersburg remains quite popular. </p>
