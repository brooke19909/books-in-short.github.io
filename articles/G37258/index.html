It is not surprising, because in order to implement your idea, you will not need so much material, especially if it concerns the reverse decoupage of a bottle.  To create an interesting, unique decoration for the home, you just need nothing: a glass bottle, acrylic paints, a printed picture and several small details for decoration, of which amateurs have plenty to create something unique with their own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Delicate print on napkins" class="if uuid-3048807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048807.jpg"></div><h2>  Bottle decor </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at this interesting round of creativity - bottle decoupage. </p><p>  As we managed to notice, decoupage of a glass bottle is the most common way to create a new home decoration.  Most bottles of alcoholic drinks (champagne, cognac) have an interesting shape, throwing away these just does not raise a hand.  But to put it on an empty shelf is not so interesting.  Decoupage comes to the rescue, with it the container can be turned into a real masterpiece of handmade.  Using the decoupage technique, craftswomen can make a new, interesting vase or simply an unusual element of decor from a simple glass bottle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siurpriz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter landscape outside the window" class="if uuid-3048809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048809.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage Basics </h2><p>  There are several options for working in the decoupage style: direct and reverse.  A line is created very simply.  On a bottle (plate, casket, vase), previously coated with the desired color, varnish, etc., various images cut from bright napkins or prints are glued in turn, in accordance with the author's idea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reverse decoupage of a bottle - the method is a little more interesting and differs from the first one in that a drawing is first applied to the container, and then background layers of acrylic paints.  As a result, an interesting, bright pattern is visible through the glass.  And if you pour water into a bottle or jar, the image comes to life, gaining volume. </p><p>  Interesting, isn't it?  Let's find out what we need to create such an interesting bottle decor - reverse decoupage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bottle with a landscape" class="if uuid-3048866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048866.jpg"></div><h2>  Material for the master class </h2><p>  To create a decor with a reverse decoupage with a window, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Glass bottle; </li><li>  napkins with an interesting motif or printed image; </li><li>  acetone and cotton pads; </li><li>  adhesive tape or electrical tape; </li><li>  acrylic paints; </li><li>  acrylic matte varnish; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  brushes; </li><li>  elements for decoration. </li></ul><p>  And here is what masters of the technique of reverse decoupage of bottles with a window advise: to create an original, beautiful decoration for your home, choose the most interesting bottles that are in harmony with the design of your room.  Think in advance what result you want to get.  Collect an approximate picture from napkins or print on a regular printer.  That is, pre-determine the image on the bottle, plan the rest of the decor and prepare the material. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait on the bottle" class="if uuid-3048798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048798.jpg"></div><h2>  Bottle processing and drawing </h2><p>  So, let's start creating a new home decor.  We begin our workshop on the reverse decoupage of a bottle with processing the main part - the vessel itself.  Rinse the bottle thoroughly inside and out, get rid of labels and stickers, remove any glue.  Dry the bottle, place it with its neck down so that all the drops will drain. </p><p>  The surface of the glass bottle must be treated with acetone in order to surely remove traces of dirt and grease.  This is an extremely important part of the work: it is necessary to wipe with acetone with special care so that the wipes and paint adhere tightly and subsequently do not crack. </p><p>  Prepare in advance the drawing that you plan to put on the bottle.  This is a napkin or an ordinary printed drawing, cut it out by removing excess parts.  Often, interesting napkins with vivid images for decoupage are sold in needlework stores.  Separate the bottom, white layer of the napkin.  Try on the image, then smear the place with glue (not sparing), lean the napkin with the image inward and with a dense brush, smooth out all the folds and bumps. </p><p>  To make the picture inside the bottle bright and not get lost on the general background of acrylic paints, which will subsequently cover the entire bottle, it is better to cover the image with a dense layer of white paint.  When the glue dries a little, apply white paint over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cloth, but without protruding once again beyond the edges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage with a wolf" class="if uuid-3048819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048819.jpg"></div><h2>  Bottle decor </h2><p>  Half of the case of reverse decoupage is completed, it remains to create a general appearance of the bottle.  To make the picture inside look appropriate, use the same colors of acrylic paint in the decoration of the bottle that are present on most of the image. </p><p>  In addition, so that the selected pattern is visible, a window must be made on the bottle.  Covering the bottle with paint, you can leave an arbitrary window opposite the picture or make its clear edges with tape or tape.  Make a window of the required size out of the segments. </p><p>  Next, paint the bottle without going beyond the edges of the tape.  If the paint layer does not seem very dense to you, stains and highlights are visible, let it dry a little and cover the bottle with another layer. </p><p>  In addition to the main color, various patterns and patterns suitable for the overall composition and design of the room can be applied to the bottle. </p><p>  Remove the electrical tape, you get a perfectly smooth window.  All that remains is to decorate the window with ornate patterns, frames or other interesting decor elements.  Decorate your bottle with various stickers, patterns.  Do not forget about the bottle cap, it is also desirable to cover it with paint and mask it with various figures or bows. </p><p>  The decoration is ready.  Fix the layers of paint with varnish, and when it dries, glue with a gun all the other necessary elements to create a complete composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea bottle" class="if uuid-3048867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048867.jpg"></div><h2>  Reverse Decoupage Ideas </h2><p>  Let's see what other ideas a decoupage craftswoman can offer.  See how you can create a cozy composition with a window.  Small houses with pipes from the neck of the bottle look delightful, perfectly complement the composition of the sprigs of beads, enlivening the decor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bottle houses" class="if uuid-3048827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048827.jpg"></div><p>  But such bottles can be a pleasant gift or decoration for the home for the New Year.  How cozy they look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter bottle" class="if uuid-3048858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048858.jpg"></div><p>  If you add water to the bottle, they come to life, the image becomes more voluminous.  And what will happen if you fill the decorated bottle with light? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magic house" class="if uuid-3048863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3048863.jpg"></div><p>  This is such a magical lamp.  It seems to be filled with magic. </p>
