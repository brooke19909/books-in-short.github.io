  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Production of methane in home and laboratory conditions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Methane is a colorless gas that burns with a blue flame, the main structural component of natural (77-90%) and associated gases is explosive. </p><p>  Methane production </p><p>  The specified gas is formed due to methane, as well as other types of fermentation of various <span>organic compounds</span> under the influence of the bacteria <em>Cellulosae metanicus</em> : </p><p>  (6105) n + n2 - 34 + 32. </p><p>  Methane is sometimes called <span>swamp gas,</span> because it is formed by methane fermentation of organic substances at the bottom of natural reservoirs.  In addition, methane is formed in the ruminants of the ruminants and intestines of animals during the fermentation of plant food.  A huge amount of methane is formed during pathologies - atony of the pancreas, toxic dyspepsia, feeding poor-quality feed. </p><p>  Methane makes up a third of the total mass of the pancreas.  When rotting manure of farm animals, a large amount of methane is formed, which is used to heat livestock buildings with the help of special plants. </p><p>  The production of methane through thermal processing of oil, natural gases, coking and hydrogenation of coal (27‚Äì38%) gives significant volumes.  This gas forms the basis of the atmosphere of some planets (Jupiter, Titan, Saturn). </p><p>  Getting methane at home </p><p>  To obtain the indicated gas, it is necessary to take a little soil from the bottom of the swamp and place it in a jar, then fill it with water.  Next, the dishes are tightly corked and placed in a warm and dark place.  After a few days, you will notice the appearance of small bubbles on the surface of the water.  Gas from the can can be vented using a vent pipe. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Laboratory methane production </p><p>  As a rule, it is synthesized from sodium acetate by the Dumas reaction.  10 g of the mixture, which consists of one part of sodium acetate and two parts of soda lime (saturated solution of sodium hydroxide with calcium oxide in a ratio of 1: 1), is added to a dry test tube.  The tube is closed with a stopper with a <span>gas tube</span> and fixed in a tripod.  The mixture is heated.  It should be noted that the tube is first heated, and then the mixture.  Methane, which is formed in this case, is first lowered into a test tube with water, then, in turn, into test tubes filled with <span>solutions of potassium permanganate</span> and iodine with <span>potassium iodide.</span> </p><p>  Methane is formed due to the thermal hydrolysis of sodium acetate with alkali: </p><p>  sodium acetate + sodium hydroxide - methane + sodium carbonate </p><p>  Ethylene Production from Methane </p><p>  Ethylene is an important raw material for the production of polystyrene and polyethylene.  Modern industrial methods for producing ethylene are based on vapor-phase cracking of light oil fractions.  A promising alternative to this method could be the production of ethylene from methane.  Unlike oil, natural gas, the main structural component of which is CH4, is regarded as a renewable source of raw materials.  In this case, the reaction takes place at a temperature of 500-9000 degrees in the presence of O2 and oxides of manganese or cadmium.  The resulting gases are separated by absorption, deep cooling, and distillation under pressure. </p><p>  Under laboratory conditions, ethylene is prepared by ethanol dehydration and ethane dehydrogenation.  The obtained ethylene can be used for the synthesis of ethanol, polyethylene, ethylbenzene, vinyl chloride, antifreezes (substances that reduce <span>the freezing point of water</span> in motors) and other organic compounds.  In medicine and veterinary medicine, ethylene is used as a narcotic drug, in crop production - to accelerate the ripening of fruits (oranges, lemons, tomatoes, bananas, grapefruits, etc.). </p><p>  Methane use </p><p>  In addition to the fact that methane is a valuable fuel, it is also a raw material for the production of <span>methyl alcohol,</span> chloroform, formaldehyde, plastics, etc.  Acetylene and other compounds are synthesized from methane. </p>
