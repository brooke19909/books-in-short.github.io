There are two powerful whirlpools, known since ancient Greek times and described in Homer's poems "Iliad" and "The Adventures of Odyssey." </p><p>  The width of the strait is 3.5 km, two powerful funnels are formed due to the rotation of water masses at great depths at current speeds during <span>high and low tides</span> up to 10 km / h.

    <h2>  Churches of Messina </h2><p>  The original <em>church of Santa Maria Annunziata</em> is one of the most ancient monuments of Messina (Sicily).  Built in the 12th century on the site of a pagan temple, it is an example of a mixture of architectural styles, combining North Norman forms, an Arabic dome, arches and columns of the Byzantine style, and oriental ornaments.

    <h2>  Palaces </h2><p>  <em>Monte di Pieta Palace was</em> built in the 18th century according to the project of the Jesuit architect N. Masuccio, who set out to create a residential building opposite the church of Santa Maria della Pieta, built on the ruins of the church of San Basilio.  The building is located in the old part of the city, after the earthquake of 1908 and the military bombing of 1943, it left the lower floor, and from the church there is only a facade with alternating windows and niches and a baroque balcony.  The courtyard opens onto a gentle slope, which was decorated with a staircase leading to the cemetery of the church of Santa Maria della Pieta. </p><p>  Thanks to the restoration work, the building has become a symbol of ancient messianic architecture and is often used for cultural events and holidays of the city. </p><p>  <em>Dzanka Palace</em> , which is today the town hall, was previously one of the palaces decorating the harbor of Messina (Sicily).  After the destruction of 1908, a neoclassical palace was restored in its place, which received its name in honor of the architect A. Dzank.  The interior of the building is decorated with numerous works of art dedicated to the historical dates of the city and memorable events, as well as part of the ancient Greek wall. </p>
