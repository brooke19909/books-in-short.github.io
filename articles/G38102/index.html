    <p>  If you want to give something interesting to your lover or husband on February 23, then a candy tank is best.  Such a gift is not only a symbol of masculinity, it will also become a real surprise for the sweet tooth. </p><h2>  Master class, the basis of the tank </h2><p>  To make such a gift, you will need to take two cardboard boxes, scotch tape, special packaging paper, a <span>stationery knife,</span> twelve pieces of chocolate medals, glue, green and brown corrugated paper. </p><p>  A large cardboard box will be the base for your tank, and a small box will be a tower.  If you make a tank of sweets, then wrap the boxes with tape and then wrap them in brown paper. </p><p>  Your tank will need tracks.  To do this, cut two long strips from the foam, which are the same size as the edges of the box.  These strips are wrapped in corrugated paper and chocolate medals are glued on top.  And you can also stick small chocolates, then your craft - a tank of sweets - will look even better.  Now the tracks are glued to the box.  For strength, you can attach them with fishing line or sewing thread, or you can use yarn for knitting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A tank made of sweets, made with your own hands, is a good idea for a gift from sweets.  Making it yourself is not difficult. </p><h2>  Ready tank </h2><p>  Making the barrel of your tank.  To do this, take a piece of cardboard, turn it into a tube, wrap it with beautiful paper, you can color.  The barrel can be trimmed a bit to make it even. </p>

    <p>  Now we begin to fill our tank of sweets with our own hands.  To do this, you can take small sweets such as "Bird's milk" or "Cow." </p><p>  We carefully put the candies into large and small boxes, connect them to each other, then glue the barrel to the tank.  Paste with sweets and the tank outside.  So your tank of sweets is ready, you can now present it to your loved one. </p><h2>  Guitar </h2><p>  Gifts made of sweets are the best souvenir, and also suitable if you want to do something nice for your loved one.  Such a gift will cause your relatives a complete delight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candy tank workshop" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/727595.jpg" width="247"></div>

For example, guitars. </p><p>  If you know how to make a tank of sweets, then it will not be difficult for you to create a guitar.  To do this, take a large piece of cardboard, apply a regular guitar to it, circle its outline with a pencil.  Cut a figure out of cardboard.  Then, colored paper can be glued to the cardboard blank. </p><p>  We take three to four kilograms of sweets in wrappers, glue them to the cardboard base of the guitar.  Strings for it can be made from elastic or from ordinary strong thread. </p><h2>  Bouquet of sweets </h2><p>  If a tank of sweets and the same guitar are more suitable as a gift to a man, then a woman and a girl will like the ‚Äúbouquet‚Äù with sweets more.  In the case when you want to impress a lady of your heart with an amazing gift, it makes sense to make such a bouquet. </p><p>  First, take a piece of polystyrene foam and cut a strip out of it, which is then inserted into a glass or a jar.  Gifts from sweets are formed using skewers that are attached to sweets.  Then the sweets on top are wrapped in beautiful puff pink paper.  This paper should take the form of a rose. </p>

    <p>  Note that you must have sharp and durable skewers that can withstand the weight of both candy and flower.  They need to be inserted into a basket in which the bottom is made of foam.  And inside the bouquet you can plant a teddy bear or a bunny, or you can also a bottle of champagne.  Candy gifts made in this way look very original. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A pineapple </h2><p>  If you have already prepared a tank of sweets, and you want something else, then it's time to make a pineapple from sweets.  It is not so difficult to make it, and at the same time it will be a very beautiful and original gift for a birthday, New Year, March 8th and other holidays. </p>

    <p>  The starting materials for work are an ordinary champagne bottle (or you can get a plastic bottle from Fanta), about eighty pieces of chocolates, <span>duct tape</span> and a glue gun.  So, the tails of the candies stick together, then glue is also applied to them.  With the help of PVA glue, all the candies are glued to the bottle, you can add scotch tape for strength. </p><p>  We take a ribbon-aspidistr and from it we cut out the ponytails for pineapple.  You can make ten to fifteen ribbons, all of them are inserted into the neck of the bottle.  The more such stripes are inserted into the bottle, the more your composition will look like a pineapple.  And so that the similarity is great, you can tie the neck of the bottle with jute ropes. </p><h2>  Candy machine </h2><p>  Your imagination will help you come up with the best option for decorating a holiday gift.  If you want to give a gift to a child, then a candy machine will be a very appropriate option.  But an adult will also be happy with such a gift. </p><p>  To create such a machine, you will need not only candies.  You will need to find or purchase a cardboard box, toothpicks, adhesive tape, wire, natural fabric.  You will need a glue gun and eight packs of sweets, you can take Dolci sweets. </p>

    <p>  First, draw a pattern on paper, then cut it out with scissors and transfer it to cardboard.  We connect the cardboard parts with tape, then we paste over the driver's seat.  You can do this with corrugated paper.  The edges of the machine are reinforced with wire, and a piece of wire is stretched from edge to edge.  Then we fix the fabric on it, which will decorate the car and close it. </p><p>  Approximately on the same principle as the tank made of sweets, a master class on the manufacture of which we have already studied, the machine is also made.  Instead of wheels, <span>chocolate wrapped medals are</span> glued. </p><p>  You also need to make side pads, they are made of corrugated paper.  The headlights will be two round candies, instead of the steering wheel we attach cookies.  If you know how to make a tank of sweets, then making a typewriter will not be difficult. </p><p>  We pack the finished machine in cellophane, and you can give a gift. </p><h2>  Candy doll </h2><p>  Gifts made of sweets are different.  Any girl will like a candy doll.  Try to make such a gift yourself. </p><p>  You do not have to buy a new doll in the store.  You can find one of the Chinese toys, which looks like a Barbie doll, and make crafts from it.  In complexity, this toy is the same as a tank of sweets.  When creating such a toy, you can show all your handicraft skills. </p><p>  In addition to the doll, you will need a small piece of foam, a different fabric, you can take some pieces of knitwear.  If you want the skirt to be fluffy, and with flounces, then take pieces of silk or satin.  You will need more Moment glue and threads. </p>

    <p>  We have already studied what can be made from sweets.  We will try to diversify our knowledge.  We make a cone of foam, in it we cut a hole for the doll.  Insert the doll into the foam. </p><p>  We wrap the foam ‚Äúskirt‚Äù with fabric or corrugated paper, which you like best.  You can attach it with glue or paper clips.  Can be decorated with beads and beads. </p><p>  Also, from the fabric or from paper, you need to make a bodice of the dress, you can make it a sundress.  Try to make the junction of the bodice and skirt invisible.  We make paper roses, insert candies in them.  Fasten to the dress. </p><p>  For the doll, you can make roses and a small umbrella.  The more flowers, the more elegant it will look. </p><h2>  Candy tree </h2><p>  This option is the most versatile.  You can give it to anyone, regardless of gender and age. </p><p>  <span>Decorative trees</span> will appeal to your guests no less than a tank of sweets.  A tree with sweets or a money tree is suitable for any interior. </p><p>  To create such a masterpiece you will need a small flower pot, a metal stick, polystyrene foam, glue, various fabrics, for example, chiffon and chintz, small scissors, toothpicks, sucking candies on a string.  If you want money to come to your home, then it makes sense to make a <span>money tree</span> that will become a talisman in your interior. </p><p>  Chocolate coins in gold wrappers should hang on the money tree.  You can decorate it with ordinary coins, but they should shine. </p><h2>  Tree making </h2><p>  <span>The tree trunk is</span> created from thick wire, which is folded into several layers.  From above it turns into threads, you can take ordinary woolen. </p><p>  From corrugated paper we make flowers in which candies or chocolate medals are put.  Cut out the petals from this paper, wrap them on a pencil so that they get a curved shape.  Three petals are pinned to a toothpick, it turns a rose.  Several of these roses are attached to a tree trunk. </p><p>  To make your money tree the most spectacular, it is recommended to wrap it with golden ribbons and cut leaves from foil to decorate it.  To improve the energy of the tree, it is recommended to tie a red ribbon to it. </p><p>  Gifts from sweets can be very different, it is important to show imagination when creating them.  If you create your gift with the help of candy candies, then it will last longer, and you can enjoy it longer.  Gifts from chocolates should be consumed almost immediately after their delivery, so that they do not deteriorate. </p>
