He was called at a turning point.  Petrograd was already in the hands of the rebellious peasants and workers.  At the same time, the Winter Palace, in which the <span>Provisional Government was</span> sitting <span>,</span> remained unreached.  This information is known from the general school course.  In the framework of the educational program "History (Grade 9)", the formation of Soviet statehood is described in a rather concise way.  The key moments of the process are identified in chronological order, each critical event is evaluated.  Next, we consider the features that accompanied the formation of Soviet statehood.

    <p>  Thus, the formation of Soviet statehood, <span>governing bodies</span> and authorities was proclaimed by the Second Congress.  It formulated the general principles of organization and laid the foundation for a new administrative system. </p><h2>  The role of the Left Social Revolutionaries </h2><p>  After the seizure of power, the Bolsheviks sought to expand the social base.  To this end, they held talks with the leading Left Social Revolutionaries about the conditions under which the latter would enter the Council of People's Commissars.  At a meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, a compromise resolution was approved in early November.  It emphasized that the agreement of the socialist parties is possible only if the Second Congress is recognized as the sole source of power, the program of the new government in the form in which it was expressed in decrees.  In December, these negotiations ended, and as a result, a <span>coalition government</span> was created <span>.</span>  The alliance with the Social Revolutionaries made a great contribution to the formation of Soviet statehood, especially in the first months after the revolution.  With the direct participation of representatives, a Declaration on the Rights of the Exploited People and Workers at the Third Congress was developed and approved.  This document proclaimed Russia the Soviet Republic.  The Socialist-Revolutionaries, together with the Bolsheviks, unanimously voted to end the activities of the <span>Constituent Assembly.</span>  This decision made it possible to remove the formal obstacles that slowed down the formation of Soviet statehood.  In short, the alliance with the Socialist Revolutionaries made it possible to solve a key managerial task - to unite representatives of workers 'and soldiers' deputies.  This association took place at the Third Congress in January 1918, where a new composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was created.  It was attended by 129 Social Revolutionaries and 160 Bolsheviks.  However, this alliance did not last long.  The Brest Peace Treaty was soon ratified, but the Social Revolutionaries opposed.  As a result, in mid-March 1917 they left the government.  In July, the Social Revolutionaries rebelled, which, however, was quickly suppressed.  The break of the union reflected the processes taking place in society, which led to the growth of civil tension.  This confrontation, of course, left its mark on the formation of Soviet statehood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the formation of Soviet statehood" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Administrative staff </h2><p>  The end of 1917 - the beginning of 1918.  marked by the replacement of the former authorities with new ones.  The apparatus of the people's commissariats and other administrative structures were created.  At the end of October 1917, the workers 'and peasants' militia was formed.  The Cheka was included in the structure of the Council of People's Commissars - a commission that carried out the fight against sabotage and counter-revolution.  At the beginning of December 1917, the Council of National Economy was formed.  This body was supposed to establish management of the country's economy by coordinating the activities of existing economic people's commissariats.  In addition to the police and the Cheka, the fleet and the army acted as integral elements of the new statehood. </p><h2>  Description of the new government </h2><p>  The Bolsheviks were based on the worldview of their leaders.  After the seizure of power, they considered it paramount to break the old state machine.  The Bolsheviks believed that the control system was outdated and could not solve the advanced tasks of our time.  At the same time, they admitted the likelihood of preservation and subsequent use of certain elements of the previous administrative mechanism.  The managerial inexperience of the new organs was offset by organizational skills and revolutionary enthusiasm.  A huge variety of approaches to the implementation of managerial tasks is noted in the clerical work and the structure of the people's commissariats.  The number of new organs was also unstable.  Some drug addicts lasted 2-3 months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the formation of Soviet statehood plan" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1052499.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Features of establishing local authority </h2><p>  It happened both peacefully and armed suppression of counter-revolution.  The legal basis for eliminating the power of representatives of the former government was contained in the above Address, proclaimed at the Second Congress.  In district and provincial cities, the transition to a new government was relatively painless.  This was due to the fact that central authorities could send representatives to them.  Things were somewhat more complicated in the Zemstvo administration.  This was due to the large number of local authorities. </p>

    <p>  Local Councils, not being able to replace the city and zemstvo structures, tried to use them in resolving the most pressing and urgent local issues.  The Socialist Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks led these bodies (before the break of the alliance). </p><h2>  Summary of Information </h2><p>  The training course entitled "Formation of Soviet Statehood (Grade 9)" is described above.  The table below summarizes historical information. </p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="535"><p>  <em>Second All-Russian Congress</em> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="267"><p>  Composition </p></td><td valign="top" width="267"><p>  625 deputies: </p><ul><li>  Left Social Revolutionaries - 179; </li><li>  Bolsheviks - 360. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="267"><p>  Key decisions </p></td><td valign="top" width="267"><p>  Decrees: </p><ol><li>  "About the earth." </li><li>  "About the world." </li></ol><p>  Proclamation of the Republic. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="267"><p>  Authorities </p></td><td valign="top" width="267"><p>  SNK - Sovnarkom led by Lenin. </p><p>  VTsIK - Central Executive Committee under the control of Kamenev. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The central government took care to spread its influence on the ground as soon as possible.  During the first months, the Soviets had a wide range of powers.  They were supported by military units.  In April 1918, a decree was approved, according to which hospitals, institutions, units, stocks of property and warehouses were transferred to the governor military commissars. </p><p>  In many cases, local councils did not have regular communication with the central office.  This allowed them to be sovereign masters in the territories under their jurisdiction. </p>
