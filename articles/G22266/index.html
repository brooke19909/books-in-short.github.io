Legnica is best known for the ancient castle of Messrs. Piast.  A monumental building was erected in the distant 1149 and is included in the list of the oldest palaces in the country.  The founder of the castle is Prince Henry, nicknamed the Bearded, who chose natural stone as the material for the construction of the fortress.  At that time, this was considered an innovation, since the palaces were still built of wood.

    <p>  Piast Castle resisted the Tatar-Mongol raids that took place on Legnica from 1241.  From this period the fortress passed into the possession of the lords Piast, who were part of the family of rulers of the Silesia region.  This family was interrupted in 1675, after which the Austrian monarchs became the new owners of the castle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the Second World War, Piast Castle was destroyed by artillery attacks of the Red Army.  The fortifications were rebuilt again in 1969, after which the object was transferred to the care of the Ministry of Education.  Today, the architectural monument looks like one of the most attractive places for tourists who arrive in Legnica. </p><h2>  City Park </h2>

    <p>  The history of Legnica city park begins in the 14th century.  Its founder is the Polish prince Boleslav III.  It was he who received the right to own these lands in 1316, after which he decided to plant a picturesque grove here.  Later in the park appeared the so-called labyrinths of trees. </p><p>  In 1811, a natural spring with healing water was discovered in the park.  Today, a pavilion rises above it, where wellness procedures are held. </p><p>  At the end of the XIX century, a man-made pond with water lilies was arranged on the territory of the park, which was immediately chosen by local residents.  Flocks of waterfowl populate the pond annually. </p><p>  Today, the central city park of Legnica provides visitors with a wide range of secluded scenic spots where you can relax on benches in a relaxed atmosphere, admire architectural sculptures, recharge your batteries with the energy of nature.  There are also children's, sports and entertainment venues, a whole mass of paths laid for runners and cyclists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cathedral </h2>

    <p>  In the XIV century, the building underwent reconstruction.  During the work, the church was significantly expanded.  As a result, Legnica (Poland) received a massive cathedral of impressive height, which was consecrated by the names of the martyrs Paul and Peter. </p><p>  The external walls of the building are decorated with numerous bas-reliefs.  In particular, on the north side of the cathedral there is an image of the kings bowing to little Jesus, which is an extremely rare plot for buildings decorated in the Gothic style. </p><h2>  Glogovskaya Tower </h2>

Initially, the tower did not have an entrance passage, but was only used as a hill for the defense of Legnica.  To do this, gear rails with openings were arranged here, through which the perimeter was monitored and attackers were fired.

    <p>  At the end of the 19th century, the upper platform of the Glogovskaya tower was covered with a four-pitched tiled roof.  An opening was formed in the thickness of the building, through which the crews began to pass.  Otherwise, the design and architecture of the structure remained almost in its original form. </p><h2>  Museum of copper </h2><p>  The cozy town of Legnica (Poland) is known for its unique museum complex, whose expositions are represented by copper products from different eras.  Today, the audience is invited to order about 30,000 items that have historical value.  The exhibits are concentrated in an old building decorated in the Baroque style.  The museum has several branches located outside the city. </p><h2>  Legnica (Poland): how to get there? </h2>
