That is why, for the New Year's chores in families with small children, the search for a carnival outfit is added to the list of important tasks. </p><p>  A few years ago, the appearance on the matinee of a superhero caused general delight, but today there are so many such costumes that you want originality.  <span>The suit of a knight</span> in this case is what you need! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knight costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1065134.jpg" width="309"></div>

    <p>  About how to choose the right fabric, how to develop a pattern and sew all the elements of the outfit, and will be discussed in this article.  If you follow the proposed plan, an original knight costume will come out, which Grandfather Frost will definitely notice and, possibly, will mark with a special gift for the brightest robe. </p><h2>  The main details of the costume </h2><p>  First you need to figure out what elements of the costume must be present in the outfit.  Firstly, these are basic clothes: pants and a <span>long-sleeved T-shirt.</span>  They can be sewn specifically for the costume or use what is in the wardrobe. </p><p>  <span>The knight's costume</span> must be with a cloak.  Accessories such as armor, a belt, a helmet and boots will be a great addition.  And of course, what is a knight costume without a coat of arms?  This element must be present on the chest of the hero and his cloak. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A little bit about fabrics and colors </h2><p>  Presenting a knight costume for a boy, you should decide on the color scheme.  This hero is very courageous and strict, but because the abundance of colors will harm the image.  Everything should be done in restrained tones. </p><p>  So, for example, for armor it is best to give preference to steel-colored fabric.  It can be brocade or other silver-colored material.  Pants can be made of soft knitwear in both dark and light natural shades.  Beige trousers in combination with a burgundy velvet cloak will look perfect.  Or black pants with a rich blue or bottle tint. </p><p>  Be sure to choose a bright fabric for the coat of arms.  Best if it will be the color of silver or gold.  A knight's costume for a boy must be with a sword or blade.  And to make it convenient for the child to have fun at the matinee, you should make a leatherette belt with special fasteners for weapons. </p><h2>  How to sew a shirt </h2><p>  To quickly sew a knight's jacket, you should take the fabric, fold it in half with the front side inward, measure the distance from the wrist to the wrist with outstretched hands and measure this value by folding the fabric, adding 6 cm to bend the sleeves.  After you need to measure the circumference of the chest and abdomen and place a greater value in the middle of the already delayed segment.  In this case, add 5 cm to a loose fit. </p><p>  Next, use the ruler to lower the verticals from all points.  From the extremes by 7 cm, and from others by such a distance so that it reaches the level of the length of the product plus a twist.  Next, draw the neck in the drawing.  Do not make it too big.  It is better to make an incision on the chest so that the head crawls, and after processing the throat with an <span>oblique trim,</span> leave 15 cm of free ends of the tape for tying.  Next, it will remain to draw the side sections of the sleeves and sides, in the corners after processing them you need to make notches so that the seams are not pulled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To create a spectacular carnival costume "Knight", you should sew such a shirt from a white satin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knight costume for boy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1065136.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <h2>  How to sew pants </h2><p>  Knightly pants should be beautiful and comfortable in the first place.  A knit fabric such as supplex or oil is suitable here.  If this is a children's knight costume, you can use cotton cloth.  Sewing such is easy.  Construction can be done directly on the fabric.  It is bent face inward along the canvas.  Thus, two trouser legs will come out without external side seams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knight costume for children" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1065135.jpg" width="500"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  It should only be ensured that the tissue was 6 cm more than the girth of the upper leg of the child.  It is this measure that is laid aside first in the fold, adding 5 cm allowances. </p><p>  The second measure is ¬Ω of the thigh circumference plus an increase of 5 cm. It is placed in the middle of the first delayed segment. </p><p>  The third measurement is the height of the seat, the value of which is lowered from the bend perpendicular to both ends of the product from the extreme points of a larger segment.  The same perpendiculars are lowered along the borders of the hips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carnival costume knight" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1065151.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, draw the middle seams with half the trousers.  They should fall along the borders of the thigh line and, sharply curving, go to the borders of the girth of the upper part of the leg. </p><p>  After this, you should draw the side internal cuts of the legs and their bottom, taking into account the hem.  The final stage is the design of the top of the trousers.  In front, the top cut should be about 3 cm lower. </p><h2>  Armor and Cloak </h2><p>  For armor, in addition to fabric, a thin synthetic winterizer will be required, which will make the details more massive.  Armor for the chest and back is a sleeveless jacket that is not sewn along the side seams.  To make it, you need to draw the necessary shape directly on the fabric, cut the same workpiece from sintepon and lining.  The neck of this element also does not need to be made large.  It is better to make an incision from the back.  After that, all three parts are folded in the following sequence: the lining and the main fabric facing each other, and a synthetic winterizer over the base.  Before processing, it is better to chop them with needles and lay a line along the contour of the slices, with the exception of the neck.  After the armor, you need to turn out and process the throat with an oblique bandage of the appropriate color. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a knight costume" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1065148.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Then you can do real miracles: laying a line on the armor, decorate various patterns. </p><p>  The helmet is also better to sew a multilayer.  Its pattern is a strip of fabric along the circumference of the head with laid tucks from one edge, so that the product closes with the corner up. </p><p>  To sew a cloak, you should combine two rectangles of the required size from velvet and lining, stitch along the contour, leaving a small hole for turning out, collect elastic on top and sew on ribbons. </p><h2>  Coat of arms - the main decorative element </h2><p>  How to make a knight costume real?  Of course, use the coat of arms!  He should be given special attention.  Can be printed on <span>thermal transfer paper,</span> transfer the pattern to the fabric of the cloak and armor.  And for more experienced craftswomen, a variant with a fabric application is suitable.  Having cut out the pattern from non-loose fabric, it should be glued with a cobweb to the base of the armor or cloak, and then stitched along the contour. </p>
