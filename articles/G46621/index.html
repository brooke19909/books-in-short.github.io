Three crises of the Provisional Government</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  1917 was a very difficult and responsible year for Russia.  Events unfolding in Petrograd were of great importance for the future future of the country.  Bread riots, demonstrations, rallies against military operations, and as a result, Emperor Nicholas II was overthrown, more precisely, he abdicated the throne.  Thus ended the rule of the Romanov dynasty.  The first Provisional Government was formed.  Its chairman was Prince George Lvov.  The Provisional Government presented Russia with a Declaration by which political prisoners received amnesty, a reform of local self-government was carried out, but the most important thing is civil liberties. </p><p>  This article will examine the <span>crises of the Provisional Government of</span> 1917; a table for a better understanding of the material will also be presented.  The fact is that, despite all their efforts, the new government could not cope with the discontent of the people.  People were determined to change their lives, the process was started, and just like that it could not be stopped.  This topic is taught to students in history classes in grade 9, so it will be useful for them to study, and adults to refresh the events of those years. </p><p>  All actions took place back in 1917.  In total there were 3 crises of the Provisional Government.  It should be remembered that the cause of all the crises was the impact of the Bolshevik party, as well as the refusal of the government to solve the pressing problems of society (social and agricultural).  In general, it is difficult to independently understand such a topic as the crises of the Provisional Government-1917, the table will have undeniable benefits in the awareness of the material.  Consider the successful and unsuccessful moments in the politics of the Provisional Government - in the table below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Grade 9 history chart: Provisional Government crises.</em>  <em>The policy of the new government.</em> </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 702px; height: 143px;"><tbody><tr><td>  Success </td><td>  Failures </td></tr><tr><td>  Establishment of an exhaustive list of democratic freedoms </td><td><p>  Russia's participation in the war </p></td></tr><tr><td>  Proclamation of the Republic </td><td><p>  Agrarian question </p></td></tr><tr><td>  Democratic Electoral Law </td><td><p>  No election to the Constituent Assembly </p></td></tr><tr><td>  Abolition of the death penalty </td><td><p>  Return of the Death Penalty </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  We see that the new government was trying to change something, but that was not enough. </p><h2>  The first crisis of the Provisional Government </h2><p>  On April 18, a note by the Minister of Foreign Affairs (he was Milyukov) gave rise to the first crisis.  The document spoke of the need to be faithful to allied obligations, but nothing was said about indemnities and annexations.  At that time, it turned out that a democratic Russia and its democratic government were waging an aggressive and imperialist war, although for a year and a half since the war went on in Russia.  This was the main mistake of Milyukov.  The Bolsheviks took advantage of it and provoked the masses at demonstrations with their thoughts and teachings. </p><p>  On March 22, thousands of people took to the streets in Petrograd.  Several demonstrations were held simultaneously.  The slogan of the first demonstration was: ‚ÄúWe support the Provisional Government!‚Äù  The slogans of the second demonstration: ‚ÄúDown with Guchkov and Milyukov!‚Äù, ‚ÄúA world without annexations and indemnities!‚Äù  And also the third, separate rally was made by the Bolsheviks with the slogan: "Power - to the Soviets!"  They handed out ten rubles to all participants in the demonstrations (very much like modern rallies), and later the Bolsheviks tried to claim that they were not responsible for the rallies, which supposedly became a free expression of the opinion of the masses.  It is very sad that the demonstrations were armed clashes and even victims. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There were difficult times in Russia.  Members of the Provisional Government had several alternative ways out of this situation. </p><h2>  First way </h2><p>  The idea was to resign and transfer power to the Soviets.  Most of the Provisional Government considered this to be too dangerous, as it could lead to the Civil War, and this simply could not be allowed. </p><h2>  Second way </h2><p>  This path was proposed by Kornilov.  According to his plan, it was required to take advantage of the situation using the Bolshevik slogan ‚ÄúDown with the legitimate government!‚Äù  as an occasion to disperse the Soviets, to kill or imprison extreme left radicals.  Let strict discipline reign in the country, both in the army and in production.  It was necessary to eliminate dual power.  The crisis of the Provisional Government (March-July 1917) can be considered indefinitely, this is a curious and vivid topic.  Despite the fact that the death penalty was abolished in March 1917, it was proposed to reintroduce it to establish strict rule.  The liberals were terrified of such proposals.  Kornilov went to the front. </p><h2>  First coalition government </h2><p>  It was the turn of the provisional coalition governments of Russia in 1917.  The first <span>coalition government was created,</span> in which there were six socialist ministers.  The post of Minister of War took Kerensky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The crises of the Provisional Government of 1917, the table of which is presented in the article, were also aggravated by the economic crisis.  The Provisional Government did not manage to restore order in the country, to raise transport and industry to the proper level, and the army and cities were not provided with food products.  At this time, the authority of the Bolsheviks grew, as did their number. </p><p>  <em>The crises of the Provisional Government of 1917 (table)</em> </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 503px; height: 127px;"><tbody><tr><td>  Events of 1917 and alternatives. </td></tr><tr><td><p>  1.

Lenin‚Äôs words aroused support among ordinary people, but Chernov‚Äôs speech, which spoke about the long preparation and publication of the law on land, did not produce the proper excitement. </p><h2>  The First All-Russian Congress of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies </h2><p>  This congress was held in June 1917, at which the Bolsheviks received only 105 seats out of 777. However, their leader Lenin made himself clear.  He promised that thanks to the party order would prevail in the country, without a civil war, agricultural and working issues would be resolved. </p><p>  <em>Scheme: crises of the Provisional Government in 1917</em> </p>

    <h2>  The brewing of the second crisis of the Provisional Government </h2><p>  On June 10, the Bolsheviks decided to hold a demonstration under their slogan to strengthen authority.  However, this decision was banned at the congress, and a general demonstration was held in support of the Provisional Government.  They supported the offensive at the front, scheduled for June 18, 1917.  The crisis of the Provisional Government came again, since most of the demonstrators carried the slogans of the Bolsheviks.  It became clear that soon the Bolsheviks would try to seize power.  Everything was aggravated by the fact that the offensive at the front failed, inflation grew.  The national question began the collapse of Russia.  Ukrainians, Finns, etc., demanded independence and autonomy. </p>

    <h2>  The July crisis of the Provisional Government </h2><p>  These events took place from July 3 to 4.  During this period, the cadets left the government, refusing to consider the independence of Ukraine.  Controversial was the issue of sending a machine gun regiment of the Petrograd garrison to the front, the soldiers took to the streets of the city.  Sailors who arrived from Kronstadt supported the armed workers.  The performance was commanded by the Bolsheviks.  The demonstration was bright, loud, with sonorous slogans.  Demonstrators demanded the end of the war, desired the power of the Soviets, peasants demanded land. </p><p>  The troops loyal to the government tried to stop the Bolsheviks, but to no avail.  Power gradually passed into their hands.  Armed soldiers, workers, sailors led the Bolshevik party. </p><p>  The Council meeting took place in the <span>Tauride Palace,</span> which was surrounded by demonstrators.  The Minister of Agriculture tried to communicate with the people, but he was simply captured.  The Bolsheviks almost seized power, but Lenin refused to finish the job, because he was afraid that he would not be able to control the process and hold this power for a long time.  The July crisis of the Provisional Government was quite serious. </p>

    <h2>  The outcome of the July demonstration </h2><p>  Loyal to the government troops began the hunt for the Bolsheviks.  Many went underground.  Members of the Provisional Government were seriously opposed to the Bolsheviks.  Vyshinsky signed an order to arrest the head of the Bolsheviks.  It was officially stated that he was suspected of having ties to the Germans. </p>

    <p>  It was not an easy time when crises of the Provisional Government occurred.  Additional materials, various historical studies today allow us to safely say that the accusation of Lenin was legal, since the Bolsheviks really took money from the Germans.  Only the question of time remains open, that is, when exactly did they begin to take them - at the beginning of the war or from 1916.  The amount received from the Germans is also unknown.  How many millions of German marks the Bolsheviks received for their revolution, whether Lenin personally accepted them, what conditions for receiving money is unknown.  They still argue whether the <span>Brest Peace</span> is connected with receiving this money or not.  However, it is clear that in any case the money was serious.  The accusation against Lenin was never considered, he managed to hide first in Petrograd, and then in Finland.  The rebel regiments were disbanded and disarmed.  The death penalty for disobedience at the front was restored. </p>

    <h2>  The power of the Bolsheviks.  Third crisis </h2><p>  The August crisis of the Provisional Government was the last.  The Bolsheviks perked up and, in spite of everything, again organized an uprising and seized power by armed means.  The decision was made at the 4th party congress.  It was in early August 1917, Stalin was one of the main speakers.  Let's take a closer look at how it all happened. </p><h2>  The Kornilov rebellion </h2>

    <p>  On August 27, Kornilov opposed the interim government, in response he was recognized as a rebel.  In Petrograd, <span>martial law was</span> introduced <span>.</span>  The Bolsheviks called on the people to repulse the rebels, the Red Guard detachments were created.  It all ended on September 2.  Kornilov and his followers were arrested. </p><h2>  Arrest of the Provisional Government </h2><p>  However, Kornilov‚Äôs speech showed a split in the ruling circles, from which the Bolsheviks won.  They took advantage of the war in order to gain power.  On October 24, the Decree on the closure of all the newspapers of the Bolsheviks was published, they were closed at 5.00, several hours passed, and they again returned to the Bolsheviks.  October 25, the rebels occupy the Nikolaev (Moscow) station, at 6.00 - the State Bank, an hour later - the Central Telephone Station, at 13.00 - the Mariinsky Palace. </p>

    <p>  At 18.00 all the forces gathered at the Winter Palace, an hour later an ultimatum was announced to the government, then they started firing from the Aurora.  At 2 a.m., members of the Provisional Government were arrested, and power passed to the Soviets. </p><p>  Thus, we see that in total there were 3 crises of the Provisional Government.  Pay attention to the table below, it will help to understand the material. </p><p>  <em>The crises of the Provisional Government of 1917. Scheme-table: reasons for the victory of the Bolsheviks</em> </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  1. The government did not solve the social and agricultural problems. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  2. The Constituent Assembly is not convened. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  3. Loss of respect for the Provisional Government. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  4. Lenin's promise to solve all problems. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Scheme of the Bolsheviks coming to power </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  1. The interim government does not solve the problems of Russian society </td><td>  2. Dissatisfaction with power is growing. </td><td>  3. The Bolsheviks promise to solve all problems by coming to power </td><td>  4. Rebellion </td><td>  5. Victory of the Bolsheviks </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The year 1917 was difficult for the people.  The interim government made many mistakes, which itself helped the Bolsheviks to take its place.  Lenin, however, correctly headed for victory, knew how to motivate people and tactfully present information.  The path of the Bolsheviks was difficult and thorny, but they had their own beliefs and goals.  The situation of 1917 shows once again that ideology is a very big force, the main thing is that it be in the safe hands of competent and honest people acting with good intentions. </p>

    <p>  We note once again that the Bolsheviks helped to win: this is a difficult social situation in the country, the wrong policy of the government, as a result of which its credibility, competent and beautiful public speeches of the leader of the proletariat, the ability to convince and motivate the people fell.  If the Provisional Government tried to solve the problems of the people, didn‚Äôt tighten its policies, didn‚Äôt return the death penalty, didn‚Äôt get involved in the war, solved the agrarian and social problems, didn‚Äôt have a Kornilov uprising, then the Bolsheviks could not have made a coup . </p>
