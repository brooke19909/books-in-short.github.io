This place has always been at the center of various transformations of both historical and urban planning order.  The area was constantly rebuilt and underwent redevelopment.  Its current appearance was formed already in the mid-90s of the last century, and there is no certainty that it was formed completely and forever. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manezhnaya square" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247316.jpg" width="502"></div>  Manezhnaya Square, Moscow

    <p>  Throughout the twentieth century, the square played a significant role in the life of the capital.  In <span>Soviet times,</span> <span>military units</span> and columns of heavy military equipment were built on it for a parade march along <span>Red Square</span> on November 7 and May 1.  In many ways, even the appearance of the square was formed precisely for this function.  The Bolsheviks without unnecessary ceremony cleared its territory from a significant part of the architectural and historical heritage of past centuries.  Manezhnaya Square freed itself from everything that impeded the holding of military parades.  Muscovites should be grateful to them for the fact that the red brick building of the Historical Museum, which also stood across the movement of military equipment, remained in its place.  The finale of the Soviet era itself is directly related to the square.  She did not pass the revolutionary events of the 90s.  Many remember the grand rally in the winter of 1991.  The number of those who came to Manezhnaya Square to support the upcoming changes in the country is not even calculable.  Rallies at this place are held to this day quite often.  Only the venue for them was significantly reduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manege fountain" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247314.jpg" width="480"></div>  Since the mid-90s, the area was a construction site, and heavy construction equipment worked on it around the clock.  Manezhnaya Square underwent significant restructuring.

    <p>  What happened as a result of the reconstruction of the square </p><p>  The main object, which was built here in the 90s, was the Okhotny Ryad shopping complex, which in a completely organic way corresponded to the new era.  Commerce instead of military parades and political rallies.  We should pay tribute to the authors of the shopping center project, they tried to minimize the damage to the historical appearance of the city from the construction of their facilities.  The complex is largely located underground, and only lighting structures extend along the historic facade of the Manege. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manege Square Moscow" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247315.jpg" width="502"></div>  Many conflicting opinions cause various decorative elements of the design of the shopping complex and the adjacent territory.  In particular, the fountain on Manezhnaya Square, which has become quite popular with tourists.  People like to be photographed against its background, and connoisseurs of Moscow antiquity unanimously note the absurdity of sculptural compositions and their inconsistency with metropolitan architectural traditions.  But it is possible that in a hundred years the Tsereteli circus horses will become classics.  Something similar happened in Paris, whose inhabitants did not like the Eiffel Tower.
