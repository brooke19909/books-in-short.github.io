    <h2>  Sri Lanka: monthly weather and climate in Sri Lanka </h2><p>  The old name of the island is Ceylon.  And that's it.  Unless a newborn baby drank Ceylon tea.  Sri Lanka supplies the whole world with leaves from which a fragrant drink is brewed.  The climate on the island is ideal for ripening tea bushes.  The weather in Sri Lanka for months, according to those who have visited this country, almost does not change.  Year-round air temperature ranges from + 28-30 degrees.  The exception is mountainous areas.  There in winter, the temperature drops to ten degrees with a plus, which only makes the tea more aromatic.  Well, the water off the coast of the island is warm all year round: +26 ¬∞ C.  Geographers define Sri Lanka's climate as a tropical monsoon.  This means that the island has two seasons: the rainy season and the dry period.  At the same time, ninety-five percent of the precipitation falls in the summer months.  But in general, the rainy season is longer and lasts from May to the end of October.  And from November to April, the weather is clear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Between Two Monsoons </h2><p>  But not everything is so simple on the island of Sri Lanka.  Monthly weather is often independent of dry or wet periods.  The fact is that from November to mid-spring, northeast winds dominate the island.  For lovers of a calm sea, reviews are advised to look for beaches on the southern and western coasts of Sri Lanka.  But avid surfers, on the contrary, will find a steady wind and a high wave at the northeastern tip of the island. </p><p>  From April to the end of October, Sri Lanka falls under the influence of the Western monsoon.  Therefore, in the summer, everything changes.  Cloudless weather and calm are set on the east coast.  And this, mind you, in the so-called rainy season, which scare people travel agencies.  Reviews say that choosing a suitable beach will not be any problem.  Sri Lanka is thousands of kilometers of soft coastal sand framed by coconut palms on one side and coral reefs on the other.  Forbes magazine's ranking included two local beaches - Bentota and Tangalle (before Weligam) - among the top ten in all of Asia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka Monthly Weather" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1010370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Winter Sri Lanka: monthly weather </h2><p>  The central mountain range determines that the southwestern and northeastern coasts have the same climate in the same period.  The weather is far from temperature fluctuations.  Even in January, at the resorts the air warms up to +30 degrees.  It‚Äôs cold only in the mountains.  In the village of Nuwara Eliya, it is recorded +16 in the afternoon, and at night the temperature drops to +10 degrees.  In winter, experienced travelers are advised to relax on the southwest coast.  In December, the rainy season there already ended, although the sky is no, no and squirts with an unexpected downpour.  But precipitation takes place mainly at night and do not poison the rest.  When planning a trip for December 2015, we recommend that you preview the monthly weather forecast in Sri Lanka in advance.  January pleases with an abundance of sunny days.  The ocean is never calm, but in the middle of winter, swimming is not a tough competition with the waves.  In February, partly cloudy and even rains are possible.  The ocean can often storm.  But small bays provide shelter for lovers of a calm sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka monthly weather rainy season" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1010368.jpg" width="600"></div>

Monthly weather here is inter-monsoon.  This means that in March the ‚Äúdry season‚Äù begins in the northeast, and the ‚Äúwet‚Äù season in the southwest.  Rains are possible throughout the island, especially when the sun is at its zenith.  But this, assure reviews of vacationers, short showers.  In April, it rains more and more often in the south-west, and the sea is stormy.  This has little effect on temperature.  During the day, the thermometer rises to +34 degrees, which, with 100% humidity, is fraught with a jump in blood pressure.  The total rainfall in mid-spring is 250 mm.  In May, according to reviews, showers are almost uninterrupted in the capital of the republic of Colombo and Galle.  But the Central massif reliably shelters the north and east of the island from rains.  There, only 1,500 mm of precipitation falls annually, while on the opposite side this figure reaches five thousand millimeters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka Monthly Weather Forecast" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1010369.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summer </h2><p>  Nature does not have bad weather.  And this saying is especially suitable for a <span>paradise island</span> lying in tropical latitudes.  What is the weather in the state of Sri Lanka for months?  The rainy season in the summer is not as bad as it is painted.  In June, there is almost no rainfall in the northeast of the island, and the sea is calm.  Rains happen, but not this is troublesome, but high humidity - 96%.  In July, there is more rainfall, and the mountains can no longer serve as a reliable shelter from the increasing monsoon.  But it rains for a short time - from fifteen to thirty minutes.  This is usually evening hours.  But the wind is weak, and the clouds are average.  In August, there is generally less rainfall.  Even in the wettest part of the island, 150 mm fall out.  But the ocean is restless.  ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù The tourists console. ‚ÄúJumping in the surf is a great pastime.‚Äù </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka monthly weather and climate Sri Lanka" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1010371.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autumn </h2><p>  Going to the island in September is like playing roulette.  It may rain for days or not for weeks.  Humidity also jumps from one hundred percent to fifty.  The weather in Sri Lanka for months in the autumn remains unpredictable.  Sometimes a monsoon may appear in October.  In any case, reviews are advised to choose the southwestern coast of the island for relaxation.  And in November, the "dry season" begins.  Prices are rising, peaking on Christmas holidays.  Precipitation if it falls, then at night.  Reviews claim that there is no better time for a vacation in Sri Lanka than November-December. </p>
