  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Men's hat with knitting needles: master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year there are more and more people trying to understand the basics of knitting.  And all because such things are rapidly gaining enormous popularity.  However, learning how to distinguish between loops and performing original patterns is not enough to link the conceived product.  For this reason, we have prepared the material presented below.  In it, we will talk in detail about how to knit a men's hat with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Features of preparation </h2><p>  Making a really worthwhile product is quite difficult.  And all because such work requires serious preparation.  First of all, you need to choose a suitable style.  For men it is better not to consider something too tricky.  The ideal option for the stronger sex is a classic hat or beanie hat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting hat" class="if uuid-2927245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2927245.jpg"></div><p>  When the model is approved, it is recommended to draw it on a piece of paper.  After that, pick up a pattern for knitting needles.  Men's hat is traditionally knitted with a regular elastic band.  Single or double looks best on similar products.  Having determined the desired pattern, we select yarn and a tool for it.  Knitting threads can be used any.  However, professional knitters advise to choose more relaxed ones for men's products, for example, gray, brown, blue or black. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Perfect knitting needles </h2><p>  Experienced craftswomen can endlessly talk about a good instrument.  But for beginners it is difficult to independently understand the meaning of this concept.  Therefore, further we will indicate the most important nuances regarding knitting needles.  And even inexperienced knitters can master a man's hat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit for men" class="if uuid-2927253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2927253.jpg"></div><p>  So, how to choose the perfect tool: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to decide on the pattern.  For a clear, it is better to use knitting needles equal to the thickness of the thread.  If you want to make the now fashionable effect of elongated loops, we recommend knitting needles that are two or three times the diameter of the thread. </li><li>  You can choose any material from which the tool is made.  But experts advise giving preference to metal.  Such knitting needles provide better glide, they are more convenient and faster to work. </li><li>  You should also consider for which product tools are needed.  If you want to make a seamless men's hat with knitting needles, you need hosiery.  And for knitting hats with an even cloth - ring. </li><li>  When a suitable tool is selected, it should be carefully inspected.  Ideally, the tip should be sharpened well and no defects should be present. </li></ol><h2>  Measurement Rules </h2><p>  To perform a quality product, you need to correctly take measurements.  To do this, you need an elastic centimeter and a leaf with a pattern.  You will also need a pencil with which we will fix important parameters.  When everything you need is at hand, we proceed to take measurements.  We measure the head of the person himself or his hat.  We need the following parameters: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The circumference of the head or the length of the lower edge of the cap. </li><li>  The distance from one ear to the other through the crown divided by two, or the distance from the lower edge to the ‚Äúdome‚Äù of the cap. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cap" class="if uuid-2927264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2927264.jpg"></div><h2>  Convert centimeters to desired units </h2><p>  Experienced knitters can determine by eye how many loops are required to set.  For beginners, this skill will come with time.  First you need to master the technology of converting centimeters into loops and rows.  To do this, you need to knit a 10 x 10 cm sample. The main thing is to use prepared yarn and knitting needles in it.  After that, we carefully consider how many loops and rows turned out in the sample.  Then divide the head circumference by ten centimeters and multiply by the number of loops in the fragment.  So we find out the number of loops needed to dial.  Next, divide the height of the product by ten centimeters and multiply by the number of rows in the sample.  As a result, we determine the length of the cap in rows.  Now we can start knitting a men's hat with knitting needles according to the description proposed later. </p><h2>  How to tie a classic hat </h2><p>  Having dealt with the necessary parameters, we take knitting needles, yarn and study the technology of the selected pattern.  Then we proceed to translate our ideas into reality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urban-research.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a hat" class="if uuid-2927254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2927254.jpg"></div><p>  First, we gain the calculated number of loops.  Then moving back and forth, we knit ten to fifteen rows of elastic.  For a single, you need to alternate one front and the wrong loop.  And for a double, do the same, but with two loops of each kind.  When the desired gum height is reached, go to the main pattern.  If the needlewoman decided to knit a men's hat with an elastic band over the entire length, we continue to alternate the purl and front loops until ten rows remain until the end of the product. </p><h2>  How to make a "dome" caps </h2><p>  Both professional knitters and beginners agree that the most difficult stage in the implementation of any cap is the one that we are exploring in the current paragraph.  However, if you strictly follow the technology, you will still be able to knit the top of the product the first time.  So that the reader does not get confused in the actions, we offer a detailed and step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  First of all, eight should be subtracted from the total number of loops.  They should stay at the end. </li><li>  Then divide the remaining by ten. </li><li>  As a result, we find out how many loops you need to reduce in each row to make a smooth "dome". </li><li>  Now let's get to work.  The main thing is to reduce the loops evenly.  That is, at regular intervals. </li><li>  When eight loops remain on the knitting needles, we break off the main thread, stretch through the loops and tie.  Then we hook inside out. </li></ol><h2>  How to tie a hat with a lapel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="knit-pick.ecrater.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for men how to make" class="if uuid-2927261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2927261.jpg"></div><p>  A huge number of men of different ages prefer a different model of the studied product.  Experienced knitters will be able to understand the technology of making knitting caps for men in the photo.  For beginners, we offer instructions: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to dial the calculated number of loops. </li><li>  Then knit an elastic band.  The main difference between this option and the classic hat is that it is decorated with a double elastic band.  Therefore, we knit not ten to fifteen rows, but twice as many - twenty to thirty. </li><li>  And only then go to the main pattern. </li><li>  We tie the product, based on the technology described in the previous paragraph. </li></ol><h2>  How to tie a beanie hat </h2><p>  According to most knitters, this option is the easiest way to complete the cap.  However, it is better to knit on hosiery knitting needles.  Its main difference from the classic hat is that the product seems to be great to its owner.  That's just not because he had to be carried to the elder comrade.  This model is a new fashion trend.  It can be knitted with a single elastic band or highlighted with a cuff.  But it is not recommended to choose complex patterns for her.  In general, if you want to knit a really <span>fashionable men's beanie hat with</span> knitting needles, experts advise you to complete the entire product with front stitch.  That is, on the one hand, knit facial loops, and on the other, purl.  Then the bottom edge will be slightly wrapped, and the product itself will be exactly the same as that shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for men" class="if uuid-2927248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2927248.jpg"></div><p>  So, such a cap is performed according to the previously studied technology: </p><ol><li>  We collect loops. </li><li>  We knit a flat cloth with front stitch. </li><li>  When the last ten rows remain, we begin to reduce the loops. </li><li>  Finally, we break off the thread, fix and hide from the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  So we figured out how to knit a men's hat with knitting needles.  This is completely uncomplicated.  However, the craftswomen offer a completely elementary option.  For him, we collect the number of loops equal to the height of the cap, knit the number of rows equal to the circumference of the head, and close the loops.  We connect the product at two seams and wear it with pleasure. </p>
