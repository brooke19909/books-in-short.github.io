    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Dovmont (Prince Pskov) was the son of Mindovg and the brother of Wojshelk, according to some sources, and according to others - a relative of Troyden.  He himself was from Lithuania and owned the Nalshan lot.  According to one version, Dovmont was married to the sister of his wife Mindovg.  The Bykhovets Chronicle states that he was married to the sister of Narimont's wife.  According to chronicles, Dovmont was directly involved in the murder of Mindovg in 1263.  He later <span>fell out of favor</span> with Voishelk.  The latter in 1264 was considered the most powerful prince in Lithuania. </p><h2>  Appearance on Russian soil </h2><p>  In 1265, Dovmont left Lithuania and went to Pskov.  At that time, the city was going through quite difficult times.  Recently, Alexander Nevsky died.  The new ruler, Prince Yaroslav, possessed neither the strength nor the talents that his older brother had.  His power has not yet been finally established - the Novgorod eternals did not want to recognize him as master.  <span>The Grand Duke</span> put the governor of Svyatoslav, his son.  He no longer thought about strengthening the borders, but about strengthening the power of the ruler over the city.  So Prince Yaroslav bequeathed to him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the city needed a warrior who was able to protect people from the Order, Lithuania and was not bound by any obligations with the great ruler.  The choice of the people fell on Dovmont.  Nothing connected him with Lithuania, and here he was not a stranger.  Many Lithuanian rulers then came from the Slavs, and their native language was Russian. </p><p>  The appearance of Dovmont in the annals contains a fairly short record.  The scripture says that Wojskelk captured Lithuania, and his brother fled with his squad.  In the church he was baptized and received the name Timothy.  Dovmont became the new ruler of the city.  Until his death, he was bequeathed to protect people and borders.  The sword of Dovmont became famous.  Later, all warriors were blessed to exploit them.  After 200 years, he was solemnly handed over to the son of Vasily II the Dark - Yuri. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian generals" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1244863.jpg" width="211"></div>

    <h2>  Capture of Polotsk </h2><p>  Dovmont (Prince Pskov) led the squad and the "three ninety" military husbands.  David Yakunovich was with them, with the Lithuanians - Luke Litvin.  The army made its way imperceptibly through the <span>dense forests,</span> stretching from the river.  Great to the Dvina.  For the sudden capture of the large and strong Polotsk, Dovmont would not have had the strength.  However, he managed to capture the wife of Gerden and the children.  Having captured rich loot along the way, he left Polotsk.  All the carts managed to be transported through the Dvina, while Gerdena gathered allies.  Across the river, Dovmont stopped and released the prey and prisoners in Pskov with part of his warriors.  Soon the Lithuanians appeared.  The guard notified Dovmont on time.  He gathered cavalry and unexpectedly hit the Lithuanians.  Enemies did not even have time to take order.  So with little blood (only one Pskov was killed) Dovmont won his first victory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New trip </h2><p>  In 1267, the Russian generals moved to Lithuania.  Border areas of the state were ravaged.  The Lithuanians not only failed to protect their lands, but also did not gather in pursuit.  According to the chronicles, Novgorodians and Pskov fought a lot in that year, and arrived with production and without loss.  For a long time there were no such bloodless and successful campaigns abroad.  Lithuanians for a long time stopped their raids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Dovmont Timofey Pskov" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1244864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Peace" with the Germans </h2><p>  Frightening Lithuania, Dovmont (Prince of Pskov) decided to join the great army in the fight against the crusaders.  The reason for the battles was the actions of Danish knights, who settled in the coastal cities of Rakovor and Kolyvan.  They greatly impeded the trade of Novgorod. </p><p>  In the winter of 1268, Russian commanders with their troops gathered at the walls of the city.  The militia was also going.  They were commanded by <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> (posadnik) and Kondrat (thousand).  According to the chronicles, the army numbered about 30 thousand people.  The Germans sent ambassadors to conclude peace.  By agreement, they pledged not to help the Rakora and Kolyvan people ‚Äî the people of the king.  This suited Novgorodtsev, since the Danish knights were the main target.  For the Russian army, it was important to split the Germans.  In January, the 23rd (1268), the warriors moved to Rakovor.  They walked slowly to Narva - three weeks.  The governors gave people rest while they were on their land.  Without fighting, the army crossed the border.  The knights themselves in the field did not dare to leave, but hid behind the tower walls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The battle with the German army </h2><p>  February 17, the army stopped at the river.  Kegoli.  In the morning, a German army suddenly appeared nearby.  She lined up in an ominous "pig."  The signed peace was thus violated by the Germans themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="timofey dovmont" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1244865.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Russian regiments adopted the usual order - the brow.  In the center stood a militia, and on the right and left sides there were horse squads.  Nevsky built the army in the same order in front of the Battle of Ice.  However, such a construction was also known to the Germans.

    <p>  Dmitry Pereyaslavsky, who was the leader of the Russian army, placed a relatively small Tver squad on the left, and took the remaining horse regiments to the right wing, so that the blow from this side would be unexpected and strong.  Here he himself stood up.  In the right wing was Dovmont (Prince of Pskov). </p><p>  The beginning of the battle was like the <span>Battle of the Ice.</span>  The Germans crashed into the Russian "brow".  The Novgorodians fought under the heavy onslaught of the enemy.  The losses were large, but the Germans were not able to break through the "brow".  As a result, the knightly ranks scattered, and each fought one by one.  On foot Novgorodians tore them from their saddles.  Then the Tver squad of Mikhail entered the battle on the left.  For the Germans, however, this was not a surprise.  Reserve troops left to meet Mikhail.  Then, on the other hand, cavalry entered the battle: Pskov, Vladimir, Pereyaslavl.  This blow was so unexpected and powerful that the knights began to retreat in a panic.  They managed to escape from the complete defeat, as another German army began to approach.  Russian squads had to stop the chase in order to rebuild.  However, the Germans did not dare to attack.  The battlefield, covered with corpses and covered in blood, frightened them so much that they, standing on the other side of the field, stood there until dark.  At night, the knights left.  The sent Pereyaslav patrols did not find them in either 2, 4, or even 6 hours of travel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dovmont sword" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1244866.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Feuds </h2><p>  Dovmont did not participate in internal conflicts, although many rulers tried to lure him to their side.  A difficult time has come in Russia.  The rulers began to fight for reign in Vladimir and throughout the earth.  The great ruler was the eldest <span>son of Alexander Nevsky</span> Dmitry.  However, his middle brother, Andrei, went to him.  He bought a <span>label</span> from Khan Tudamengu <span>to reign</span> in Vladimir. </p><p>  Mounted Tatar troops of Alcheday and Kavgadyi went to Russia to put Andrei on the throne.  The chronicles say how the soldiers scattered across Russian soil in search of Dmitry.  However, they did not succeed in seizing him, because with his close boyars and family he took refuge in Koporye, where his treasury was stored.  Here Dmitry wanted to sit out the invasion and build up strength.  He counted on the support of the Novgorodians, with whom he fought against the knights.  However, they betrayed him and intercepted him along the way.  Having demanded that Koporye be handed over to the governors, they captured the daughters of Dmitry and the boyars close to him with children and wives. </p><h2>  The participation of the Pskov prince in internecine wars </h2><p>  The Novgorod garrison was located in the <span>Koporye fortress</span> ; Dmitry‚Äôs people were detained in Ladoga.  He turned out to be abandoned and exhausted.  And at that moment Dovmont joined the feud for the first and only time.  At the same time, he sided with the weakest.  For what reason this was done, it is not clear to the end.  Perhaps the former military brotherhood played a role, maybe kinship (Dovmont was Dmitry's son-in-law), or perhaps the Pskov prince saw in the exile the only warrior who could protect the earth from numerous enemies.  In any case, he promptly entered Ladoga, freed all the people. </p><p>  After a while, Dmitry again sat in Vladimir.  And four years later, for the first time in the history of Russia, he defeated the Horde army.  It is believed that the first "right battle" with the Mongol-Tatars occurred only in 1378 on the river.  Woof.  But it happened much earlier.  In 1285, an entry was made in the annals that Prince Andrei Gorodetsky brought the Tsarevich from the Horde to his elder brother Dmitry.  However, the latter gathered an army and drove the Tatar-Mongols from Russian land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskov in the 13th century" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1244867.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  The last year of Dovmont's life </h2><p>  In 1299, at night, the German knights quietly crept up to the city.  They retreated through the stockade and went into the sleeping streets.  The watchmen were killed with thin knives.  The first to notice the Germans were the Kromsky dogs.  The trumpet roared immediately, the bell rang.  Pskovians fled, arming themselves, to the walls of the city.  A ruler with governors appeared on the tower.  He watched his people die in a posad.  The defense of cities at that time was carried out according to certain laws.  If the enemies were under the walls, then the gate cannot be opened. </p><p>  The city was considered the main thing, not the posad, so it was better to sacrifice the last than to give the first.  However, Dovmont went against the rules.  The gates opened, and cavalry flew out of them.  In the dark, it was difficult to make out who was where.  They recognized their Pskov by their white undershirts and the cries of women and children.  Aliens were distinguished by the gleam on their helmets, ringing armor.  The warriors shot down the Germans, letting the fugitives pass, backed away slowly, waiting for them to enter the gate.  As a result, many were saved, but a large number of people died.  In the morning, Dovmont saw how slowly the enemies surround the city.  They did not think that the ruler would dare to go to battle with them.  However, this is exactly what Dovmont did.  The infantry ran out of the gate first, followed by the cavalry.  From the mouth of Pskov, the ship's army hastened.  The German knights could not resist, rushed to run from spears and swords, jumped into the water, ran to Usokha, climbed the hills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="feats of dovmont" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1244868.jpg" width="550"></div>  The Pskovs celebrated a new victory, not knowing yet that it would be the last for Dovmont.

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  Surrounded by love and gratitude of the townspeople, Dovmont slowly faded away.  It seemed that he had given all his strength in the final battle.  In the annals, however, it is said that perhaps he was overtaken by a disease - that year many people died.  On May 20, the body of Dovmont was laid in the Trinity Church.  Soon he was called a saint for valor.  The sword with which Dovmont did not part his whole life was put over the coffin. </p>
