One way to replenish a card account is to deposit cash.  You can carry out such an operation by replenishing not only your cards, but also the cards of third parties.

You must have a passport with you.  To carry out the operation, you will need to inform the bank employee of the card number to which the transfer will be made, as well as the amount and name of the person to whom the card belongs.  Actions in this case will be as follows. </p><ol><li>  Visit the bank‚Äôs office and pick up a ticket with a number in the terminal of the electronic queue by choosing ‚ÄúMoney transfer‚Äù in the menu. </li><li>  Wait for an invitation to a specialist through the autoinformer and fill in the payment details. </li><li>  Give the specialist money. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="blog.payoneer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to top up a sberbank card by card number" class="if uuid-3194657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194657.jpg"></div><p>  This card replenishment method is relevant for people who do not have a valid account with a financial institution.  Considering the type of transfer, a transaction fee of 1.75% will have to be paid for the operation.  The minimum amount of commission in Sberbank is 50 rubles, the maximum - will not exceed 2 thousand rubles.  Urgent transfers can be made with the same commission, but its minimum amount will be in this case 150 rubles, and the maximum - 3 thousand rubles. </p><p>  It is worth noting that each bank has its own tariffs for transfers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Third Party Banks </h2><p>  How to recharge a card without a card, it is important to find out in advance.
