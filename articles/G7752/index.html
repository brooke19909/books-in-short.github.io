    <p>  Once upon a time on the banks <span>of the Kotorosli River,</span> in a place called by the people of Strelka, there was a city hippodrome.  However, in 2009, they decided to set up a new park as part of the city day improvement program.  For the implementation of the project, funds from the city budget and attracted investments were used.  Famous people participated in the planting of the first trees, in particular Valentina Tereshkova and <span>Boris Gryzlov.</span>  Helped greening the park of the 1000th anniversary of Yaroslavl and ordinary residents and visitors, as well as representatives of neighboring regions.  In the recreation area there are flower beds donated by neighboring regional centers.  But the most interesting is the gift of the famous sculptor Zurab Tsereteli - a large statue of a bear, a symbol of the city. </p><h2>  Monument to the 1000th anniversary of Yaroslavl </h2>

In the curved bas-relief you can see Prince Yaroslav the Wise (the founder of the city), an ancient chronicler, an Orthodox priest, a woman with a child, and warrior warriors.  The majestic stele, like the park surrounding it, is dedicated to the 1000th anniversary of the city.  The embankment offers scenic views of the historical ensemble in Korovniki.  Around the monument there are paths and flower beds, there are enough benches for rest.  The park and the monument to the 1000th anniversary of Yaroslavl are one of the youngest sights of the city, but despite this, even today they can be safely included in the number of its main symbols. </p><h2>  Interesting places in the park </h2><p>  The grand opening of the new recreation area took place on September 9, 2010, the day before the start of the general celebration of the City Day.  The park of the 1000th anniversary of Yaroslavl on the Kotoroslnaya Embankment turned out to be quite large and beautiful, its total area is about 30 hectares.  There are no tall old trees here yet, but seedlings planted for the opening will surely cover us with their branches in a few decades.  But there are enough places for active and passive recreation, as well as paths for walking.  The park is very beautiful, it has figuratively planted flower beds, including a flower arrangement depicting the city coat of arms.  For young guests in the recreation area there are modern areas with a safe cover, and for young people there are areas for skateboarding and roller-skating.  Visit the park of the 1000th anniversary of Yaroslavl is only for the sake of admiring the fountains.  There are several of them.  There are musical and light ones among them, changing their repertoire with the onset of darkness. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the new park </h2>

    <p>  To find this cozy and incredibly beautiful relaxation area is not difficult.  The park is located in the Kirovsky <span>district of the city of Yaroslavl,</span> on the embankment of the Kotorosli River.  Many townspeople really like this place.  It is worth visiting for tourists who have several hours left for a leisurely walk.  Residents of Yaroslavl believe that the recreation area looks most attractive in the summer during the fountain season.  In winter, not all tracks are cleaned, and a walk here may not be entirely pleasant.  The park of the 1000th anniversary of Yaroslavl is a great place for exploring city attractions and photo shoots.  Of course, among the city residents there are those who do not like this place after improvement, but they are in the minority.  And this means that, if possible, it makes sense to come here in person and take time to get acquainted with this object. </p>
