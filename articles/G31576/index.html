    <p>  The food in the establishment is excellent, guests are served a large number of fruits and vegetables, traditional slices, hot drinks and much more.  Nobody will be hungry here.  For those who like to eat well, there is an additional breakfast, so in this regard it is very difficult to remain unsatisfied.  Unfortunately, the Internet catches rooms very poorly, so watching movies in the rooms is a rather dubious pleasure.  For the weekend, a huge number of people are populated in the hotel, so sometimes it is very noisy.  For the money taken for accommodation, the hotel Prague Populus 3 * (Prague) really offers good conditions. </p>
