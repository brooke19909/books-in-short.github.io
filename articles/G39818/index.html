After all, living in one of the hotels, the guest can use the infrastructure of the whole resort town - its many pools, bars, attend various entertainment events, etc.  If the complex has an all-inclusive program, then tourists can also appreciate the quality of food in various hotel restaurants in the territory. </p><p>  As a rule, such resort towns are filled with hotels of different stars.  The guests of the ‚Äútriples‚Äù win, but those who have paid a tidy sum for the ‚Äúfive‚Äù are displeased that someone uses a chic infrastructure for less money.  But in the case of the Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace 4 * hotel, which we will describe here, this will not happen.  After all, his neighbor is Viva Dominikus Beach 4 *.  Both components of the complex are located at an equal distance from the sea, to be precise - on the first line.  Let's see what services and rooms Viva Dominicus Palace offers to tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vivadominicuspalaceresort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace - pool" class="if uuid-3225712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225712.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The closest town to the resort is La Romana.  This is the southern coast of the island of Hispaniola, and it is washed by the Caribbean Sea, not the ocean.  Therefore, the water here is warmer, and there are almost no waves.  The nearest settlement to Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace 4 * - Bayahibe (Dominican Republic).  This is a small fishing village with several shops, including a large MIA supermarket, pharmacy, ATM, fruit and fish markets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But there is everything necessary for a quality vacation in the hotel complex.  Both hotels grabbed most of Dominicus Beach - one of the most beautiful on the Caribbean coast.  There are three international airports in this island country.  The hotel is just 12 minutes from La Romana Air Harbor.  From Punta Cana and Santa Domingo - from one and a half to two hours. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.349334" data-lng="-68.8290523" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/5/5/17655.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  If you stand with your back to the sea, then Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace 4 * will be on the right (at the pier), and Viva Dominicus Beach on the left.  The complex has a single territory, so it is impossible to find the border between the hotels.  The difference between the Palace and the Beach is only in the fact that the last hotel has few buildings, and vacationers are mainly settled in bungalows.  There is also a small cottage village called "Viva Village".  But it is located away from the sea. </p><p>  The Viva Dominicus Palace described here consists of several three-story buildings built in the colonial style.  The last large-scale repair was carried out in 2015, so that everything on the territory shines with novelty.  The garden between the buildings is simply mesmerizing.  Tourists in the reviews say that at first it seems like he was in Eden.  Walking along the alleys among the marvelously smelling flowers, now and then you come across iguanas, turtles, chipmunks.  Special attention deserves a large pond with pink flamingos.  Tourists recall that they loved to feed ducks and goldfish.  Upon check-in, guests are given a map of the huge complex.  And in the territory, so that people do not get lost, there are road signs everywhere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace 4 *" class="if uuid-3225710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225710.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace 4 * is proud of its name "environmentally friendly hotel."  In the construction of three-story buildings, only natural materials such as stone and wood were used, and bungalows were built from corals.  Landscape designers have tried to ensure that these buildings blend harmoniously with the landscape.  All rooms have either balconies or terraces isolated from each other with direct access to the green lawn or garden. </p><p>  The rooms on the ground floor are ideal for older people and families with children.  The hotel has two rooms, fully adapted for people with disabilities, namely wheelchairs.  Most guest rooms are categorized as superior rooms.  They overlook the garden or pool.  But there are buildings, from the numbers of which you can see, albeit not frontally, the sea. </p><p>  If you want to see the water surface not from the balcony, but lying directly on the bed, you need to book Superior ocean front.  This room in size and comfort does not differ from a simple superior room (27 sq. M.).  You will find even better service in the junior suites.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch premises is larger, and they consist of a bedroom and a living area, enclosed by a beautiful carved screen.  But tourists warn that junior suites have a view of both the sea and the garden.  Therefore, when booking, you must pre-specify the orientation of the windows of the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotel-dominican-republic.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace 4 * - rooms" class="if uuid-3225729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225729.jpg"></div><h2>  What is in the rooms of Viva Wyndham Dominicus Palace </h2><p>  Photos of rooms of all categories show pleasant light interiors with stylish decoration.

There is a spacious wardrobe with a large number of hangers and shelves, a huge and very comfortable bed, covered with clean linen.  The bathroom has a shower, hairdryer.
