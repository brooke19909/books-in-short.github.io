    <p>  This is a salt lake, on the coast of which there is a village with the beautiful name Pearl.  Shira is a resort where there are many camp sites and resorts for children.  In the southeast of the lake basin, the <span>Khakassky Reserve</span> begins <span>.</span>  On this site, the reserve captures part of the lake and the river with the mysterious name Dream. </p><h2>  Discovery of the lake </h2><p>  The famous explorer Pallas mentioned this lake in the scientific literature.  The discovery of the healing properties of this reservoir is associated with the gold miner Z.M.  Tsibulsky.  When he mistakenly shot his dog while hunting, her body was left in the sand by the splashing waters of the lake.  His surprise was great when the animal returned home on its own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shira lake" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1214644.jpg" width="585"></div>  It has been suggested that the dog entered the water and its wounds began to heal.  After this incident, they began to say that the lake cures all diseases.  Soon Tsibulsky rented a lake in the second half of the 19th century for 25 years, in the summer he stayed with his family.  The healing properties and geological structure were investigated by the physician P. M. Popov and I. G. Savenkov.  At the end of the 19th century, Shira Lake was at the disposal of the state, officials, nobles, merchants, other noble people and wealthy peasants came here to be treated.
