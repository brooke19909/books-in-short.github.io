The hotel is seasonal, opens in May, and closes in mid-winter.  This Greek "treshka" can <span>give odds to</span> many Egyptian and Turkish "fours."  Just do not confuse it with another hotel, which is called the same, but is located on another island.  Lito 3 * (Crete) is also a small family hotel located near the sea and intended for a beach holiday.  Here we will first of all tell you about what tourists think about the Rhodes hotel.  Briefly describe another hotel, which is located on the island of Crete.  So it will be possible to determine the similarities and differences between these resort complexes. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Hotel Lito 3 * is located very close to the airport of the island - some five kilometers away.  In addition, the sea is very close to it, and the <span>city ​​of Rhodes</span> is quite accessible.  The distance from it to the hotel is approximately the same as to the airport.  Traveling from the arrival terminal to the resting place by bus takes about forty minutes.  The hotel itself is located near the famous Gulf of Ischia.  The village of Ialysos is a few kilometers from here.  But the terrain is not at all deserted.  Whatever direction you go from the hotel, you will everywhere see shops, shops, cafes and taverns for every taste and budget.  This area is located in the west of the island, so the sea here is Aegean.  This means that there is always a breeze, not very hot, and there are often waves at sea.  In addition, from here, in good weather, you can see the mountains of neighboring Turkey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rhodes: Ialyssos and Ischia </h2><p>  Mount Filerimos separates the beautiful fertile valley from the sea.  Part of it are the districts of Ialysos and Ischia.  These are the most popular resorts on the island among windsurfers, lovers of hiking and cycling, and generally active tourists.  In addition, there are excellent beaches for Aegean, inexpensive cafes and restaurants, many different nightclubs and party places.  Since these areas "flow" into each other, the Lito Hotel is often referred to as Lito Rodos 3 * Yalissos.  In the center of Ialyssos, you can see the beautiful church of St. Nicholas with ancient frescoes.  There are many ancient ruins here.  In particular, on the top of Mount Filerimos is the acropolis - Achaea, where you can see the ruins of temples from the time of Doric Greece.  In these sanctuaries, Zeus and Athena were once worshiped.  There are many beaches in this area, but not very many people.  Therefore, having some mobility, you will always find a place where you can sunbathe comfortably. </p>

    <h2>  Food in Lito Hotel Rhodos 3 * and other places </h2><p>  The price includes a buffet breakfast.  In the mornings - good yogurt, sausage and feta cheese, pastries.  Especially delicious local baklava.  Compared to breakfasts in France or Italy, which mainly offer coffee with croissants, very good.  In addition, here you can visit the bar, where you will be offered excellent drinks, both alcoholic and not.  And the local restaurant specializes exclusively in Greek cuisine.  Opinions of vacationers on food were divided.  Some are advised to eat exclusively at the hotel, while others eat in different places.  In principle, the system by which tourists are fed at this hotel is designed to have breakfast here, and then go for a day to travel around the island.  However, there are vouchers with the option of "all inclusive" (lunch, breakfast, dinner and bar).  Then in the morning you are fed at this hotel, and for lunch and dinner you go to the neighboring Beliar Hotel.  In this case, you can use its territory and the pool at the same time.  Of the cafes located near the hotel, they recommend a point in the neighborhood, to the right of the entrance - inexpensive and with a Russian menu and free coffee.  But in Ischia, all the taverns are good - you will be served first-class and will be given a huge portion.  If you buy wine or beer in a supermarket, then in the evening you can calmly sit at tables in a restaurant and drink - no one will forbid you!  Please note that after eleven in the evening almost all establishments, except for bars, close in the vicinity. </p><h2>  Sea and pools </h2><p>  If you came here to sunbathe and swim, then you have absolutely nothing to regret.  Before the snow-white sand at the sea surf from your home only a few tens of meters.  You just need to cross the road.  The sea is closer from here than from the "fives".  <span>There is a pedestrian crossing</span> on the left, near the neighboring Sheraton Hotel, and an underground one on the right, at the Rhodes Palace Hotel.  Since all the beaches on the island are municipal property, sun beds and umbrellas will have to pay.  But nobody regrets it.  Everywhere perfect cleanliness, even on the sun loungers there is no sand.  In some places there are pebbles.  But away in the water is a very soft and delicate sand.  There are always waves, and the sea is not very salty.  Tourists leave only positive reviews about rest on the local beaches.  Lito 3 * also has an outdoor pool with a fenced children's area.  Here, mostly guests from Europe are sunbathing.  The pool has a varying depth - from one and a half meters to three.  Therefore, here you can not only swim, but dive too much.  Sun loungers and umbrellas by the pool are free. </p>

    <h2>  Brother in Crete </h2><p>  Our hotel has a namesake on another island.  Hotel Lito 3 * (Crete) is a good place for families.  This hotel is located by the bay of <span>Agios Nikolaos,</span> one hundred and fifty meters from the beach of Navaria.  He is family-friendly, with a minimum of staff.  The hotel is also located on a slope overlooking the sea.  From it is much further to the beach than from the Rhodes "Lito".  However, due to its location, almost all rooms have a sea view.  In its architectural style, this hotel is somewhat reminiscent of a hotel in Rhodes.  However, it is smaller in size - it has only fifty rooms.  Here they practice the all inclusive food system.  A pool with umbrellas and sunbeds is also present.  An elevator goes through the rock from the beach to the reception.  Air conditioning is also paid, but, unlike the Rhodes "Lito", you can’t do without it, since Crete has a completely different weather and the rooms are very hot.  Good food in Lito 3 * <span>(Crete).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> mention wonderful lamb, Greek salad, fish.  However, the guests of the Rhodes “Lito”, who eat at the Beliar, say that the food there is simply divine, and if those who did not include food in the package want to eat there, such an opportunity is provided.  The breakfasts at both hotels are almost identical.  The Rhodes  Lito ’has its own territory, while the Cretan has almost none.  Agios is also within walking distance.  The beaches in Crete, unlike Rhodes, are small. </p>
