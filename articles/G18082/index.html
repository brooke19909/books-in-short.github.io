If there is a child in the house, then such work can be safely entrusted to him. </li><li>  The drawing is laid aside until it dries completely. </li><li>  During this time, you can do other useful work.  The remaining white sheet folds in half.  The outer side is decorated with a blue background, for which blue watercolor paint is used. </li><li>  Then, after the background has dried, you need to draw a tree branch.  Here you will need a thin brush and watercolor.  If you are not sure that everything will turn out beautifully the first time, then you can create a sketch of a branch using a simple pencil. </li><li>  Using a hole punch, butterflies are created from a multi-colored pattern in the quantity in which they are needed. </li><li>  There comes a turn of hot glue which will fix butterflies on a tree.  It is applied on the back of the workpiece, in the center. </li></ol><p>  DIY birthday card is finished. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a beautiful birthday card" class="if uuid-2319607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319607.jpg"></div><h2>  Original gift with flowers </h2><p>  Many women like flowers, so why not please your loved one with an original gift?

It will serve as a blank for the postcard.  If for some reason the size or shape does not suit you, then you can use the scissors to work on the edges. </li><li>  Stepping back from the top edge two centimeters, it is necessary to make two cuts, they will serve as the boundaries indicating the collar of the shirt. </li><li>  On the second sheet, which is the back of the card, a strip having a collar width is cut off from above so that this part can stand out against the main background. </li><li>  The incised strips must be folded to the central part and glue applied to the fold line so that the corners remain intact. </li><li>  After completing work on the base of the postcard, it remains to make a tie.  It is recommended to do it in contrast. </li><li>  The required length is measured on the selected sheet of paper, and then a rectangular shape is cut out. </li><li>  The resulting workpiece is fixed under the collar so that the lower part remains free. </li><li>  At the last stage, you need to attach the buttons, and the card is ready. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="make a birthday card out of paper" class="if uuid-2319611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2319611.jpg"></div><p>  There are a huge number of options and instructions on how to make birthday cards with your own hands.
