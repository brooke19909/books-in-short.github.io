Lift pass - what is it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If this is your first time arriving at a ski resort, the offer to purchase a ski pass can be bewildering.  Therefore, today we will tell you why it is needed, how to use it and how much it costs.  So, ski pass - what is it?  Nothing but an electronic pass, to which we are already accustomed today.  Each in the purse has a number of plastic cards that allow you to visit various institutions and use ATMs.  So here, a chip is built into it, on which information is written about the owner, the validity period, about the amount that the tourist has. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski pass what is it" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640458.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to use it? </h2><p>  We figured out the concept of a ski pass, that this is a small plastic card is now understandable.  To get on the lift, you need to attach it to the turnstile, so the data will be read from it.  This not only ensures the convenience of payment, but also the safety of tourists.  For example, the turnstile will not miss a child on a dangerous track for experienced skiers. </p><p>  Suits for skiers have long included pockets on their sleeves.  It is enough to put your hand to the validator, and your photo, age and gender will appear on the screen.  Therefore, you won’t be able to ride yourself by buying a children's ski pass.  What does it give?  There is less chance of losing the card, because now you do not need to get it out of your pocket, and more control.  For intentional violation of the rules (using someone else's card) it can be picked up and canceled.  Therefore, before traveling, be sure to check that everyone takes their own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Keep in mind that the validator times out every time you use the ski pass.  What does it mean?  If you have passed the turnstile and had to return for some reason, then again you can only go through a certain period of time.  It can be 10 or 20 minutes, so it is done so that several people do not ride at one ski pass at the same time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski passes Krasnaya Polyana" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640537.jpg" width="428"></div>

    <h2>  How much does a ski pass cost? </h2><p>  Differently at each resort.  Depends on the season, zone and its duration.  Ski passes for individual age groups also vary.  Most often, the discount applies to children's, student cards, as well as for those who are over 60 years old.  If the ski region is large enough (as is the case with Krasnaya Polyana), and unites several regions, then you can accordingly buy different ski passes.  What does it give?  If the card is designed for a specific area, then you can only ride on its territory. </p><p>  However, if you are a good skier, then it can be boring to spend every weekend riding from the same slides.  Then you can take a pass for the entire region.  Duration may also be different.  Minimum is half a day, and maximum is the whole season.  Calculate depending on your needs and love for <span>skiing.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the resorts of Krasnaya Polyana in connection with the holidays prices have risen significantly, so skiers go to the trick.  Having paid 2600 rubles for a subscription and dashed off, they resell it to those who wish to ride "for inexpensive".  This is usually 1300 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski passes rose farm" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Krasnaya Polyana </h2><p>  Today it is one of the fastest growing ski resorts.  Everything attracts tourists here: an abundance of snow, a peculiar relief, a picturesque forest, a special climate.  Such a combination is difficult to find elsewhere in the world.  Krasnaya Polyana includes several ski resorts, so tourists have a great choice.  In addition, each resort includes a number of tracks of varying degrees of complexity and length.  There are different ski passes.  Krasnaya Polyana is just the name of the village and the slope where the ski resorts are located.  Naturally, they compete with each other, including in pricing policy.  But in the near future it is planned that universal ski passes will appear.  To do this, Krasnaya Polyana should unite all resorts under its wing, create a single information center and information site.  There are all prerequisites for this; today the union of Rosa Khutor and Alpiki is planned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi ski pass" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640561.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  "Mountain Carousel" </h2><p>  This resort for lovers of skiing at all levels consists of 3 stages of a gondola lift.  There are calm, training and extreme tracks.  It is very interesting to watch experienced riders here: they go down very narrow tracks with sharp turns.  In addition, there is dangerous skiing off the track, with rocks, huge departures and rides into the forest.  A ski pass for the whole day (until 23:00) for an adult will cost 1800 rubles, and for a child - 1000. </p><h2>  Lift pass "Rosa Khutor" </h2><p>  This is the youngest and most modern resort in Krasnaya Polyana.  After the closure of Alpiki (upon completion of the reconstruction, it will become part of the Rosa Khutor), it became the most interesting place for skiing.  Modern lifts, 72 existing slopes for skiers of any training.  You can choose a variety of ski passes.  Rosa Khutor offers a standard rate for one day for an adult - 1850, and 1000 rubles for a child.  Group rates look much more interesting, for example, a ski pass for 2 consecutive days (5 people) costs 3,400 rubles.  There are family, sightseeing and the most favorable, seasonal rates.  A ski pass for the whole year costs 42,000 rubles for an adult and 22,000 for a child. </p><p>  It should be noted that on New Year's holidays all resorts raised prices significantly.  Upon their completion (by January 15, 2015), the cost of skiing on the slopes decreased by a third.  So until March 31 they will be unchanged.  But in the spring it will be possible to visit Sochi with an even greater discount.  Ski pass promises to reduce the cost by another 20%.  Thus, the tariff will remain until the end of the season, namely until mid-May. </p><h2>  Bukovel for beginners and professionals </h2><p>  This is the largest ski <span>resort in Ukraine,</span> it is recognized as a successfully developing and very promising.  This is not surprising, because here you can have a great rest both in winter and in summer.  In total, 57,000 meters of prepared tracks and 16 lifts were laid here.  In order to use the ski lift on the territory of this huge resort, it is necessary to use ski passes.  Bukovel is a real city of winter entertainment, where the season lasts from November to May, and the air temperature keeps about -3.  A definite plus is the low cost of rest.  Ski passes can be purchased for a period of 3 hours to 10 days.  The standard daily rate is 600 UAH, and there is no additional markup on holidays and weekends.  There is no way to transfer your card from hand to hand, it is the property of the buyer.  Especially for “larks” there are special discounts, from 7 to 9 in the morning you can buy a ski pass with a discount of 20 to 40%, depending on the season.  It is advisable to arrive early, because the queue can be quite impressive, and until 8.59 you just do not have time. </p><p>  Additional services include equipment rental, as well as dog sledding and snowboarding.  For children and adults, there are various spa centers, games rooms, cafeterias, saunas and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski passes bukovel" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640544.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ski Dombay </h2><p>  This is a famous resort in the North Caucasus.  In 2014, a fashionable novelty came to Dombai.

Yoke and trailers - this is a separate conversation, price and prices.  The cost of one trip starts from 100 rubles, so if you are not going to ride all day long, this is a very affordable option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dombai ski passes" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640553.jpg" width="600"></div>
