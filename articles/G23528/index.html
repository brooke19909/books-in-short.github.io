  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Management Development: Milestones and Milestones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Management is the science of enterprise management.  This is one of the youngest sciences, which finally formed at the end of the twentieth century, although the history of the emergence of management is replete with examples of organizations that existed in ancient times and survived, and even flourish today.  An example of such a linear structure is the Catholic Church in Rome, in which there is a clear hierarchy of subordination. </p><p>  The history of the emergence of management is closely connected not only with the <span>industrial revolution,</span> but also with the managerial ideas of political economists William Petty, Adam Smith, David Riccardo and Utopian socialist Robert Owen, who noticed, appreciated and identified the large role of the human factor in production. </p><p>  But the history of management development is experiencing the most important moments at the beginning of the twentieth century and, until today, only 8 stages have passed. </p><ol><li>  He laid the foundation for management as a science by F. Taylor, writing the work ‚ÄúPrinciples of Scientific Management‚Äù, in which he clearly demonstrated the importance of system analysis in enterprise management for its success. </li><li>  Further, the teachings of F. Taylor were picked up and improved by A. Fayole, P. Urvik, D. Mooney, and P. Sloan.  In connection with their activities, the history of management development was marked by a new theory that clearly sets out its functions and principles. </li><li>  The third stage is ‚Äúneoclassical‚Äù, when the sociological concept of the adoption of group decisions is tested.  Here, E. Mayo, the founder of the school of "human relations," joins the above scientists. </li><li>  Two decades that span the 1940-1960s of the twentieth century, managerial thought is steadily evolving and improving the theory of management, adding to it the achievements of psychology and sociology. </li><li>  The history of the development of management at this stage marks the transition of managerial thought to the use of information technology achievements, which at this time reach their peak of popularity.  D. McGregor sets out and substantiates his theory about the direct impact of the manager‚Äôs attitude on subordinates on the results of their activities. </li><li>  The stage of the 1970s - 1980s of the twentieth century was marked by the theories of I. Ansoff, G. Salanchik and Porter, which revealed the meaning of various management methods and techniques, as well as the establishment of relationships between the internal environment of the organization and the external environment. </li><li>  At the seventh stage, the history of management development was marked by revolutionary discoveries in Japan and other developed countries in the field of diverse organizational structures, which are very important management methods. </li><li>  And the last stage, starting in the 90s of the twentieth century, continues to this day.  The main trend of management is the creation of an <span>organizational culture, the</span> democratization of management, the participation of workers in management. </li></ol><p>  The history of management development in Russia begins at the beginning of the twentieth century and also happens in stages. </p><ol><li>  The beginning was laid by I. Semenov, and A. Paykin, who made a course of lectures on the organization of NOT in enterprises. </li><li>  In 1920, the laws of NOTs were finally formulated by scientists of the St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute and the Moscow Higher Technical School. </li><li>  The year 1935 introduced the law of organizational sum into the theory of management, the author of which was O.A.  Yermansky. </li><li>  In 1950, F.R. Dunaevsky proved that one manager can manage a certain number of employees. </li><li>  The end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century is the period of transition of Russian management to various ways of optimizing <span>management activities.</span> </li></ol><p>  The current history of the development of management in Russia is associated with total computerization, as well as the humanization and democratization of management activities. </p>
