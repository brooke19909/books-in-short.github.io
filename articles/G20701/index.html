Tips for Beginner Knitters</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitting a scarf is a very convenient job for beginner knitters to master the first skills of craftsmanship and at the same time to make something useful and necessary.  Knowing the truth that there are never many scarves, that this is a necessary and universal thing in the wardrobe, you can knit a lot of different scarves, thin, lace, thick and warm, for warmth and decoration.  Therefore, learning to knit, creating unique accessories, is simple and profitable, especially since <span>scarves are knitted</span> and crocheted. </p><p>  The very first scarf is best knitted with a simple viscous, facial and wrong loops.  If you knit one front and one <span>wrong loop,</span> and in the next rows knit as the loops are located, you get a scarf knitted with an elastic band.  You can only knit the fabric with facial loops; such a pattern is called a ‚Äúrope‚Äù or <span>garter stitch.</span>  <span>Having connected the scarf with</span> smooth knitting (1 row with facial, 2 row with purl loops) and pulling it slightly, you will get an original accessory twisted into a ‚Äúsausage‚Äù.  In a word, even a beginner knitter will be able to experiment and show imagination. </p><p>  When the work comes to an end, the question always arises: how to finish knitting?  First of all, the loops must be ‚Äúclosed‚Äù, i.e.  to form the edge of the knitted product.  This is done very simply.  There are two simplest methods of ‚Äúclosing‚Äù loops. </p><p>  <strong>How to finish knitting a scarf</strong> </p><p>  First trick.  You have knitted a scarf of the required length and want to complete the job.  After knitting the last row, loops remained on the left needle.  We take the right free knitting needle and knit not one, as usual, but immediately two extreme loops with the front loop.  Then we put the loop that formed on the right knitting needle back on the left and again knit the two extreme loops together with the front.  So we knit until one last loop remains on the right knitting needle.  Then we break the thread from the ball, stretch it through the loop and tighten.  The result was an even, closed edge of knitting.  When closing the loops, do not pull the thread, knitting them, try to do it as freely as possible, otherwise the edge of knitting will turn out to be tight.  Closing knitting with an elastic band, the loops must be knitted with the front and the wrong, alternating them.  Knit the two extreme facial loops with the front, and the wrong ones with the wrong ones.  Otherwise, the edge will be stretched and ugly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second way.  Instead of the right knitting needle, we take a knitting hook and, grabbing the two extreme stitches from the left knitting needle, knit them together.  So repeat to the very end.  In the last loop we pass the tip of the thread and tighten it. </p><p>  <strong>How to finish knitting a scarf.</strong>  <strong>Decoration Techniques</strong> </p><p>  An evenly closed edge of knitting can be left as is.  How to finish knitting a scarf using various decorative techniques?  The easiest is to make long fluffy brushes.  For brushes 12-15 cm long, the wool from which the scarf was knitted is cut into identical segments, about 25-30 cm long. The longer the brushes, the more beautiful.  These segments are collected in bundles that are sufficiently voluminous, bent in half, then a thick knitting hook is inserted into the extreme <span>edge loop of the scarf</span> , grabs the loop of the bundle, is pulled through the knitted fabric and the ends of the bundle are threaded through the loop, the loop is tightened.  The result was a brush.  The same brush is made on the opposite end of the scarf.  Between the extreme brushes at the same distance along the entire edge of the scarf stretch the brush. </p><p>  You can decorate the edge of the scarf with a fur ribbon.  Cut a thin ribbon from a piece of fur, or buy a finished fur trim in a store and thread it in a spiral along the edge of a knitted scarf. </p><p>  Scarves are decorated with pompons made of wool and fur.  Making a fur pompom is very simple.  To do this, a circle is cut out of a piece of fur, along the very edge of this circle from the seamy side, lay small stitches with a needle and thread, then pull the thread, put cotton or synthetic winterizer into the hole and pull the thread to the end.  The pompom hole is carefully sewn with secret stitches.  These pompons make up the entire edge of the scarf, or they pull the edge together and sew one pompom on. </p><p>  How to finish knitting a scarf using crocheted jewelry?  Simple and very beautiful ornaments are obtained from ordinary thin ribbons tied with crochets.  The first row - they knit a chain of air loops of about 15-20 cm. The second row - a single crochet is knitted in each air loop of the chain.  <span>How to finish crocheting?</span>  To fix the last loop, the thread from the ball is cut, the end is threaded into the knitting loop and the thread is tightened.  Knitted thin ribbons by themselves are twisted by a spiral.  Spirals sew like brushes along the edge of a scarf. </p>
