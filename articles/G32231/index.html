    <h2>  Historical chronicle </h2><p>  Before exploring the sights of Braslav, it is important to familiarize yourself with the history of the city.  In the IX century, on the site of Braslav there was a settlement of Krivichs and Latgals.  Subsequently, it turned into the center of the village.  Various historical chronicles indicate that the name of the city was first mentioned in 1065.  Then it sounded like Bryachislav and Bryachislavl - according to the name of the Prince of Polotsk, whose name was Bryachislav Izyaslavich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XIV century, the sights of Braslav and, accordingly, the city itself are part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  First, it was owned by Prince Gediminas, and then his heir Yavnut.  In the fall of 1500, Braslav was granted <span>Magdeburg Law,</span> which Sigismund I confirmed 14 years later. During the XVII-XVIII centuries, numerous military operations were carried out on the territory of the settlement.  As a result, the city was badly damaged and even several times was completely destroyed. </p><p>  In 1918, the city was occupied by Kaiser troops, and from 1922 to 1939 it was part of Poland.  In 1939, Braslav became part of the Byelorussian SSR.  Today the city is listed as an independent Republic of Belarus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Braslav Belarus sights" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1367159.jpg" width="433"></div>

The Roman Catholic Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary is one of these temples.  This architectural monument was erected in 1824, and in 1897 it was expanded and rebuilt in accordance with the Neo-Romanesque style. </p><p>  An interesting fact about this attraction is that the first Catholic church was mentioned in the XV century.  It was a wooden cathedral located on Castle Hill.  But the church was regularly destroyed and rebuilt, and in 1794 it was completely burned to the ground.  A new stone church was built just in 1824. </p><p>  They decided to rebuild the building of the Catholic Church because it was too small to accommodate all parishioners on its territory.  That is why at the end of the XIX century the religious building was enlarged and expanded. </p><p>  During the Soviet Union, the church was closed and even once converted into a warehouse for storing grain.  But thanks to the parishioners, the cathedral still managed to be defended, and today it is used for its intended purpose. </p><h2>  An interesting fact about Braslaw </h2><p>  The city has a hospital building, the history of which is directly related to Dr. Stanislav Narbut.  The city of Braslav in Belarus has always been considered one of the centers in which medical services are best developed in the country.  The hospital, which was mentioned above, at one time was one of the best. </p><p>  Of interest is the obelisk monument erected in honor of Narbut, and the medical institution, and, in fact, the person of this gentleman.  The white obelisk, equipped with a lantern, is installed on the peak of Castle Hill.  In the history of the city, Stanislav Narbut played a peculiar and vibrant role.  This man was known as a talented doctor and an active public figure.  The hospital, called Narbutovskaya, was erected only thanks to him. </p><p>  The hospital building has an intricate architecture.  One-story building erected from red bricks and placed on a foundation erected from ashlar.  The appearance of the hospital is equated with fortresses: in the center of the main facade there is a portal with a gable shield.  It is decorated with small tetrahedral turrets.  Today this building is not exploited.  But tourists come here to admire its architecture and visit the famous doctor‚Äôs apartment next door. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Braslav city in Belarus" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1367156.jpg" width="500"></div>
