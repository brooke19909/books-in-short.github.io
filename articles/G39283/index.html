    <h2>  Grace period </h2><p>  The grace period allows the cardholder to use the card limit for free for a specified period.  Basically, all banks adhere to the rule that the grace period applies only to non-cash transactions.  VTB 24 is a little more perfect in this matter.  The bank allows you to use the interest-free period, even if the money was withdrawn in cash.  Thus, the <span>grace period</span> applies both to funds that were spent by bank transfer, and to the money withdrawn.  The number of days in the grace period is 50. The countdown starts on the first day of each month.  Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the grace period can be less than fifty days. </p>
