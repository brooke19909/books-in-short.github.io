They talk about the heroic history of peoples, contain a number of interesting facts, around which there is much debate.  Artists, sculptors and architects perpetuate heroes in stone and canvas, and writers, poets and playwrights beat stories in their works. </p><h2>  Mythical creatures, fabulous animals and monsters. </h2><p>  Ancient man was in fear of the power of the forces of nature.  These forces embodied various images of monsters and animals, which were a product of human imagination. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, such creatures combined parts of the human and animal body.  The tails of fish and snakes, wings and beaks of birds, hooves, tails and horns of domestic animals emphasized the disgust of the monsters.  Most of them were residents of the seabed, swamp mud, and dense forests.  These habitats personified their dark essence. </p><p>  But not all monsters are terrible, among them there are quite wonderful inhabitants of fantastic worlds.  Mostly they are half-people, but sometimes among them there are absolutely fantastic creatures that are not like a beast or a human being. </p><h2>  Half-human half-goat from antiquity </h2><p>  The largest number of such half-humans is characteristic of <span>Greek mythology.</span>  They were endowed with superpowers and attributed to them various insidiousness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Pan - good forest god </h2><p>  Initially, the god Pan was one of the most ancient Greek gods.  Lord of the forests, shepherds and protector of herders.  Despite the fact that Pan was honored in Argos and Arcadia, where animal husbandry was actively developed, he was not included in the pantheon of the Olympic gods.  Over time, he becomes just the patron saint of wildlife. </p><p>  His father was the powerful Zeus, and his mother was the nymph Dryope, who fled when she saw a son of unusual appearance.  Half-human half-goat Pan was born with goat hooves and a beard, and the <span>Olympic gods</span> were surprised and laughed when they saw the son of Zeus on Olympus. </p>

    <p>  But the god Pan is good.  To the sound of his flute, herds graze peacefully and nymphs dance merrily.  But there are a lot of rumors about him.  Tired after round dances, it is better not to wake him up, because Pan is quick-tempered and can frighten a person or send him a good sleep.  Greek shepherds and herders honored Pan and appeased him with gifts in the form of wine and meat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Satire </h2><p>  Satyr - outwardly half-human half-goat.  A creature of an athletic physique with goat legs, hooves, tail and horns.  In Greek mythology, he personifies the forest lord of fertility. </p><p>  What does a half-human half-goat look like?  Photos of paintings by famous artists depict satyrs surrounded by forests, playing flutes.  They were considered the embodiment of male power.  They get drunk, chase forest nymphs and seduce them. </p><p>  The half-human half-goat is endowed with the power of wild animals, and human morality and rules are alien to him.  They could often be seen surrounded by Dionysus, the <span>god of winemaking</span> and fun. </p><p>  In the traditions of other nations, there is also a half-man half-goat.  What is the name and personality of the creature? </p><h2>  Ochocchi </h2><p>  In Georgian folk tales there is a story about a hunter who met at night in the forest with a humanoid creature.  It is called Ochochochi.  This is an evil deity, the worst enemy of hunters and gatherers. </p><p>  Ochochochi - a huge evil monster, covered with thick red hair.  A sharp hump sticks out of his chest in the form of an ax, with which he cuts opponents.  Ochochochi was immortal, and not a single hunter could kill him.  Some Georgian families still naughty children scare this character. </p>

    <h2>  Krampus </h2><p>  This is a half-man half-goat in Western European mythology.  He is the Christmas hero and antipode of Santa Claus, a frequent guest of the winter holidays who punishes naughty children.  This creature quite often scares children today. </p><p>  Legends of Krampus are associated with the onset of cold weather and the reduction of daylight hours.  Most often, stories about these evil and treacherous creatures can be heard in Germany, Austria and Hungary.  The image of Krampus, despite the menacing and frightening appearance, is associated with the Christmas holidays. </p><p>  In Western Europe, this deity even came up with a whole holiday - "Krampusina."  This fun and kind action sets people up for a good holiday mood.  People dressed in hides of krampus with horns appear on the streets.  They are hung with all kinds of loud attributes - bells and pieces of iron, create noise, play with children and adults. </p><h2>  Half-human half-goat in mythology - is it the devil? </h2><p>  In the Christian religion, the image of a creature with the characteristics of a goat is considered the personification of the devil and is credited with the most negative qualities.  During the Middle Ages, the image of the satyr was transformed into the image of a devil.  Artists of antiquity portrayed these creatures as musicians picking grapes and making wine. </p><p>  The image of a half-human half-goat smoothly migrated to modern tales and traditions.  And it is associated not only with evil and negativity, but also with fertility and fun. </p>
