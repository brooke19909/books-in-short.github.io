Theft prevention systems</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The anti-theft sensor is a device that is used in many areas of human activity.  A variety of designs and constructions makes it possible to use them for reliable protection against theft of almost any product.  Most often, the anti-theft sensor is used in the sale of elite alcohol and clothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sasecure.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustomagnetic sensor" class="if uuid-2856903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2856903.jpg"></div><h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  The principle of operation of the device is simple.  It is fixed on the product with a cable or needles - it all depends on the type of anti-theft sensors.  Thanks to the strong mount, the thief will not be able to remove the device without a special device.  If there is an attempt to take the goods out of the store, the antenna will receive a signal from the sensor.  As a result, a theft alert will work. </p><p>  When choosing an anti-theft sensor, the following factors should be considered: </p><ul><li>  device compatibility with products; </li><li>  the dimensions of the exit from the store or the passage near the checkout; </li><li>  the relevance of using reusable sensors; </li><li>  the cost of equipment, supplies and installation; </li><li>  permissible level of interference at the installation site of the security device; </li><li>  guarantee of reliability of use; </li><li>  sensor shielding level by the human body and metals; </li><li>  detection coefficient; </li><li>  level of security system operation. </li></ul><p>  There are several types of anti-theft sensors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="theft detector" class="if uuid-2856900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2856900.jpg"></div><h2>  Goal </h2><p>  Installations, which can be seen in many stores, are anti-theft gates.  They are special frames located near the exit of the trading floor.  Anti-theft gates can be triggered in up to 95% of cases of illegal removal of goods.  They are especially effective along with video surveillance. </p><p>  Typically, stores use two mounts: </p><ol><li>  At the exit.  In this case, the cashier, when paying at the cash register, removes labels, tags or deactivates them. </li><li>  In the aisle between the ticket offices.  The cashier will not deactivate the tags, but carry them outside the facility.  The buyer receives the product with active labels.  It is worth remembering that they can work in other outlets.  This is a significant minus.  The advantage is saving labor and time for the store employee, and there is no need to purchase tag removal equipment. </li></ol><p>  It is important to note that the operation of the gate can be ruined by adjacent cables, electrical appliances, metal structures and even light bulbs.  That is why it is recommended to install anti-theft systems at a sufficient distance from such objects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.concepttag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anti-theft systems" class="if uuid-2856907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2856907.jpg"></div><h2>  Theft prevention systems </h2><p>  Studies have shown that at a self-service store the percentage of thefts reaches 3% of the total turnover.  For this reason, trade enterprises, supermarkets, shops and hypermarkets, including the presentation hall, simply need comprehensive protection against theft. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Anti-theft systems for stores are a set of solutions that are aimed at minimizing losses from theft, both by customers and employees in the trading floors.  If we talk about the design, the anti-theft system may include the following equipment: </p><ul><li>  anti-theft gate; </li><li>  stickers; </li><li>  tags </li><li>  Sensors </li><li>  devices for decontamination or removal; </li><li>  video surveillance and registration devices; </li><li>  survey mirrors; </li><li>  product protection devices on shelves and racks; </li><li>  mechanical devices; </li><li>  touch devices with alarms and so on. </li></ul><h2>  Electromagnetic sensors </h2><p>  These devices work in about 70% of cases of theft.  This is considered a fairly high indicator, which indicates their reliability.  A distinctive feature of this technology is that it makes it possible to apply various labels.  Thus, it will be possible to avoid the effect of "getting used to" the security system to specific indicators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.concepttag.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of anti-theft sensors" class="if uuid-2856910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2856910.jpg"></div><h2>  Acoustic sensor </h2><p>  A device of this kind is manufactured using acoustomagnetic technology.  It is considered an effective solution.  These sensors are ubiquitous because they have a high success rate.  Response efficiency reaches 95% of cases of attempts to illegally remove products from the store.  Products are distinguished by high levels of immunity to interference - thieves will not be able to drown the goods in any way or carry them in the Faraday cage.  A characteristic feature of acoustomagnetic technology is a very small percentage of false positives.  This is due to the fact that the system will only respond to 4 consecutive identical pulses. </p><h2>  RF sensors </h2><p>  It should be said about radio frequency technology that it is very often used.  This point is explained by the fact that this is a good solution due to the high response rates - up to 90%.  In addition, RF sensors have an easy working principle and low cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.catalyst-direct.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anti-theft labels" class="if uuid-2856921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2856921.jpg"></div><h2>  Labels </h2><p>  These stickers are considered the main component of the product protection system in self-service stores against theft.  Anti-theft labels found their purpose in the labeling of products, which are located on shelves with a special magnetic chip.  It is important that when using such labels, you can hide the protective layer on the sticker from the eyes of intruders.  It is possible to apply a barcode or use a false barcode. </p><p>  Compared to reusable plastic tags, labels are used one-time, as they are almost impossible to remove and do not spoil.  During the payment process, the cashier deactivates using a special device. </p><p>  Labels are: </p><ul><li>  <em>Radio frequency.</em>  <em>Among</em> them there are different types of stickers, namely rectangular, round and square shapes.  They are made of all kinds of films, paper.  In addition, they introduced the RFID tab, consisting of an antenna and a chip.  Some are marked with a product barcode or certain information about it.  This characteristic makes radio-frequency labels practically indispensable both for protection against illegal removal of products and for automation of accounting processes of goods sold.  Sometimes RF labels have a false barcode already printed.  In addition, there are specific stickers for frozen products, characterized by high stickiness.  Products operate at a frequency of 8.2 kHz. </li></ul><ul><li>  <em>Acoustic magnetic.</em>  These products operate at a frequency of 58 KHz and are capable of functioning with contact and contactless readers.  They are used in appropriate type of protective systems.  Acoustic-magnetic stickers contain 2-3 metal plates that form a magnetic circuit. </li></ul><ul><li>  <em>Electromagnetic</em>  <em>They</em> are selected with the help of specialists, since they do not always fit anti-theft equipment.  Their operating frequency reaches 25 kHz.  Stickers are used in conjunction with other electromagnetic devices.  The principle of operation is as follows: a poorly noticeable magnetic strip is applied to products that, falling into a magnetic field, provoke the appearance of sound vibrations.  Stickers have a transparent base and are almost invisible to consumers.  In addition, a barcode can be applied to them.  Such products are different - deactivated and deactivated.  They are often exploited when marking metal goods. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="d-techinternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anti-theft gate" class="if uuid-2856913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2856913.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Anti-theft systems with sensors are reliable devices for protecting retail outlets.  Naturally, they do not protect 100%, however, even the presence of frames at the outlet of the store can minimize the amount of unauthorized removal of goods. </p>
