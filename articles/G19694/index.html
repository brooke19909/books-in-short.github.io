However, not everyone knows what the program of festive events will be, where the Christmas trees will be installed and where exactly it will be possible to go to have fun from the heart on the night of December 31 to January 1. </p><p>  It must be emphasized that the main highlight of the New Year celebration in the Belarusian capital is the creation of an atmosphere of laughter, joy and fun.  Everyone can plunge into it with his head.  New Year's Eve in Minsk is an interesting holiday option for those who like loud fireworks and noisy companies.  This is the same abroad, but only without language barriers and visas.  Wide avenues, always fresh produce, <span>stork nests</span> on telegraph poles - all this splendor is an excellent prerequisite for creating a festive mood.  In general, in the Belarusian capital you will feel like a long-awaited guest.  What should you remember if you intend to celebrate the New Year in Minsk?  Firstly, do not spend the whole night from December 31 to January 1 in a hotel room eating delicious dishes and watching television programs.  This, of course, is also an option, but it is by no means the most-most.  It is better to go outside and see the grandiose scale of the holiday with your own eyes. </p>
