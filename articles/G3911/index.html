It is much more pleasant to receive an original presentation.  A gift created with care and love will show your respect for the hero of the day.  How to decorate a gift box with your own hands, we will consider in more detail later in the article. </p><p>  There are many options for wrapping packaging with fabric, textured or plain colored paper, wallpaper or cut out elements from photographs.  It is interesting to decorate the craft with beads or rhinestones, quilling stripes, lace and satin ribbons.  Bows and flowers look spectacular on the sides and lid of the product. </p><p>  Anyone can decorate the box with their own hands, using elementary methods, for example, gluing with different types of paper and strengthening horizontal stripes around the perimeter.  It is much more difficult to decorate the craft with a cloth, and cover the lid with flowers from satin ribbons.  However, if you wish, you can learn how to make cardboard or tin boxes in the ways described below. </p><h2>  Flower on the cover </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to <span>decorate the box with your own hands with</span> colored paper and quilling stripes.  It is easy to glue the outer surface of the package, it is enough to accurately measure all sides of the box, draw a drawing of the pattern on a large sheet of colored paper or wallpaper.  It is best to use plain sheets to clearly see the pattern of quilling strips on the cover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box with quilling stripes" class="if uuid-3092488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092488.jpg"></div><p>  Strips of 3 colors are used for drawing.  Yellow skeins are gathered around the edge of the tape by tight winding, and the end is glued to the last turn with PVA glue.  Petals and leaflets are created with less tension on the strips when wound, and then squeezed with two fingers on one or both sides at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For symmetrical decoration of the cover, determine the location of the center point and attach a yellow skein to it, smearing the glue directly on the end of the part.  Then place the petals around it.  Between them beautifully place contrasting skeins, and on all corners - leaves. </p><p>  So even a schoolboy can decorate the box with his own hands.  Therefore, if you are a novice master, then try decorating with this easy option. </p><h2>  Shoe boxes </h2><p>  In the dressing room or in the closet, shoe boxes glued with fabric or colored print paper look aesthetically pleasing.  Strips with a floral pattern or with peas are perfectly combined.  It is advisable to choose harmoniously combined colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful shoe boxes" class="if uuid-3092465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092465.jpg"></div><p>  Pull a thick satin ribbon across the entire side.  You can decorate the shoe box with your own hands in a horizontal bow with a glue gun.  Decorate all the boxes in one style, then arrange them in the cabinet in order to reduce the size of the package. </p><h2>  Burlap Decoration </h2><p>  Recently, masters use natural fabrics and hemp rope for decoration.  Burlap is a coarse and dense fabric made from hemp or jute fibers.  Despite this, it goes well with lace stripes and pearl beads. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bagging" class="if uuid-3092470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092470.jpg"></div><p>  How to decorate a gift box with your own hands is clearly seen in the sample shown in the photo above in the article.  It is most convenient to paste over the surface with burlap using an adhesive gun.  On the lid, pull a strip of wide lace and attach a thin string of pearls.  The remaining beads are glued at an equal distance from each other. </p><p>  Wrap the side of the cover with a white satin ribbon, and secure the edges with a horizontal bow on the front side.  Glue a half-bead with a small brush of simple threads on its center bandage. </p><h2>  Polyurethane decor </h2><p>  An exquisite casket can be made out of a simple corrugated cardboard box, all that is needed is to paste over the entire surface of the package with beautiful colored paper with floral print.  In the corners, glue the legs of polyurethane, and after the cover edge is carved with lace, add a delicate rose on the front side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polyurethane" class="if uuid-3092457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092457.jpg"></div><p>  Add a chic thin strip of beads along the bottom edge of the box.  In the center of the lid, glue the oval-shaped plate with carved edges with hot glue.  The final touch is the manufacture of roses from satin ribbons that will decorate the top of the newly made casket. </p><h2>  Ribbon weaving </h2><p>  The cover of a decorative gift box made by weaving from satin ribbons looks original.  To conveniently perform the work, the edges of the tape need to be fixed with something.  They can be attached with a glue gun to the end part on one side.  Weaving is done in a checkerboard pattern, with each time carefully aligning all the strips of the tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon weaving" class="if uuid-3092477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092477.jpg"></div><p>  When the weave reaches the edge of the opposite side, the tape is attached to the end of the lid.  The ends of the material are hidden under a strip of lace and a beautiful two-color bow with beads in the center.  Place a bead in the middle of each flower on a lace ribbon. </p><h2>  Box with handles </h2><p>  If you do not know how to decorate the box with your own hands, carefully consider the photo of the next sample.  Both the lower part of the product and the lid are covered with a delicate pink cloth.  However, the volume and roundness of the craftsmanship form adds a layer of synthetic winterizer, with which cardboard is glued before being decorated with a fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="exquisite box with tulle" class="if uuid-3092517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092517.jpg"></div><p>  A layer of white tulle with embroidery is stretched over the main fabric.  The sides of the box around the perimeter are lined with stripes of lace, gathered along the upper side with stitches.  It turns out frills in several rows.  On the cover, place many decorative elements: bows and flowers from a satin thin ribbon, as well as several roses from tulle.  Sew beads or sparkly pebbles in the frame at the center points. </p><p>  Interesting look handles that add the similarity of crafts with a suitcase.  Large beads are strung on the wire, and the edges on the back of the box are strengthened by twisting. </p><h2>  Satin Ribbon Embroidery </h2><p>  A real work of art will be the craft, if you decorate the box with your own hands by embroidery from thin satin ribbons.  Work is mainly done on the cover.  The lower part of the product is pasted over with a cloth both outside and inside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with satin ribbons" class="if uuid-3092520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3092520.jpg"></div><p>  To design the lid you will need a sheet of synthetic winterizer, satin ribbons of different colors and widths, a decorative edging and small ornaments: beads, beads, a dragonfly made of fabric on a wire basis. </p><p>  The first step is to circle the box lid on the fabric.  This will be a template on the inside of which you need to embroider a pattern.  All the nodules are hidden on the back of the craft.  When the flowers are made, a sintepon sheet is first glued to the surface of the lid, and fabric with embroidery is pulled onto it.  Attach a carved edging along the edge, and cover the sidewall with any fabric matched to the tone. </p><p>  We examined how to beautifully decorate the box with our own hands in different ways.  Making gift wrapping is a fascinating and creative activity, therefore, certainly, every lover of needlework will like it. </p>
