    <h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  The circus in Tyumen appeared so long ago that no one can name exactly the year when this happened.  Some local historians claim that the Tyumen saw the first performance of gymnasts in a big top as early as 1839.  However, if we talk about a permanent circus, the building for him was built in 1897.  Then the capital‚Äôs artists arrived in the city, whose performances were sold out.  After 3 years, the famous trainer A. Durov toured in Tyumen, and an unprecedented miracle was demonstrated - cinema. </p><p>  Own circus troupe in the city appeared in 1910.  She performed in a purpose-built building, which was heated in winter with the help of two large furnaces.  Since then, and until the October Revolution, a trip to the representation of magicians, jugglers, gymnasts and trainers has become for residents the most popular form of family leisure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  March 14, 1921 Tyumen circus was nationalized by the decision of the local executive committee.  He retained this status to this day. </p><h2>  Old circus in the city of Tyumen </h2><p>  In 1932, a major building was built in the city for performances by a local troupe.  The decision was made after the expert commission reported on the danger of collapse of the roof of the old building.  The new building hospitably opened its doors to the Tyumen for almost 70 years.  Over the years, the circus on Pervomaiskaya hosted tours of the most famous groups from all over the USSR, and then the post-Soviet space.  Unfortunately, in 2001, heavy snow caused damage to the roof of the building.  In addition, it was clear that for a long time it did not meet modern requirements, it was problematic to organize tours for artists, for the attractions of which it was necessary to install a complex props developed on the basis of the latest technologies. </p>

    <h2>  New circus </h2><p>  In 2002, the circus in Tyumen (TGTs) received a new building.  His project was developed under the guidance of the famous architect I. Litovka.  The spacious building in a modern style surpasses most Russian circuses not only in its attractive and presentable appearance, but also in its technical equipment.  It offers spectators spacious halls, clean buffets, large wardrobes and lobbies with a beautiful design.  Particular attention in the new circus is given to conditions for keeping animals.  For them, office and household premises, a special kitchen, as well as a spacious stable and elephant are provided.  In addition, to ensure the comfort of the furry, feathered and tailed artists of each species, a special temperature regime is maintained. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The circus in Tyumen has a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã5425 square meters.  m. Its total capacity is 1,600 people.  The diameter of the arena is 13 meters.  On its dome is a huge shiny metal ball, which, like the entire structure, glows at night.  That is why the photo of this building in the dark is most often chosen to decorate tourist avenues dedicated to Tyumen. </p><p>  On the site in front of the circus are bronze statues of famous Soviet clowns: Yuri Nikulin, Pencil and Oleg Popov. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the circus (Tyumen, address: Pervomaiskaya, 15) is located in a new building, so there are no complaints about the comfort of the audience, buffets and lobbies.  Judging by the reviews of the residents of the city, they are satisfied with the performances of both the main troupe and the touring artists.  Those who have been to other circuses also note the grooming of animals and the magnificent presentation of performances. </p><p>  As for the parents of the guys who attend the circus in Tyumen for the first time, they are very pleased with the lack of performance.  It is usually difficult for kids to focus on what is happening in the arena for several hours, especially in the evening. </p>

    <h2>  Circus (Tyumen): performances </h2><p>  Programs at TGCs change quite often.
