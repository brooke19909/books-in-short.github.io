    <p>  Vietnam is very elongated in the submeridional direction.  The temperature difference between the northern and southern regions of the country can sometimes reach 10-12 degrees. </p><p>  The embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is located in Moscow.  It is located on Bolshaya Pirogovskaya street, house 13. There are also consulates in this distant <span>Asian country</span> in Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg. </p><h2>  Official name: Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  <span>The political system</span> and administrative division of the country </h2><p>  The name of the country is very ancient.  It was first mentioned in the book of the poet Khiem, written back in the 16th century.  The geographical toponym consists of two words: <em>viet</em> (Viet - the indigenous and main people of Vietnam) and <em>nam</em> , which means "south", "southern".  The full and official name of the state is today: Socialist Republic of Vietnam. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country is divided into 58 provinces and five major cities with a similar legal status.  Is Vietnam a Monarchy or a Republic?  According to the state system, the country is a republic.  The main (and only legal) political party in the state is the Communist Party of Vietnam.  The Vietnamese, by the way, call it short and concise: the party. </p><h2>  History of Vietnam </h2><p>  It is worth noting that until the middle of the twentieth century, the state of Vietnam in its modern borders did not exist.  For a long time, the country remained dependent on France.  During World War II, Vietnam was captured by Japanese troops.  At the same time (in August 1945), an uprising led by Ho Chi Minh took place in Hanoi.  At a rally of 500,000, he solemnly announced that a new independent state had emerged in southeast Asia - the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. </p>

    <p>  However, Vietnam did not stay sovereign for long.  Since Japan officially lost the Second World War, its troops were disarmed.  The territory of Vietnam was occupied by the armies of several states at once - China, England and France.  The new government of Ho Chi Minh signed a number of agreements with the French side, but it soon became clear that the French intended to restore their rights to Vietnamese territory.  At the end of 1946, Vietnam entered a phase of war, which lasted on its territory for almost thirty years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Initially, the troops of Ho Chi Minh "went into the woods" and fought exclusively guerrilla fights.  But later they managed to go on an active counterattack.  The so-called First Indochina War ended only in 1954 with the signing of the Geneva Agreements, which fully recognized the independence of the young state. </p><p>  Soon a new round of military aggression began in Vietnam.  Another important geopolitical player, the United States, intervened in the situation in southeast Asia, the goal of which was to limit the spread of communist ideas in the Asian region.  With direct American support in the south, the Republic of <span>South Vietnam</span> was formed with the capital in the city of Saigon.  In turn, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV), which was actively supported by the Soviet Union, decided to use force to annex its southern territories.  Thus, on a small patch of Asian land, in fact, two superpowers of the planet came together in a real war. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Vietnam War</span> lasted until the mid-70s.  DRV, with the strong support of the Soviet troops and through the active actions of its partisan detachments in the south of the country, was able to win this war.  The long-awaited merger of the North with the South and the formation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam took place in July 1976.  The city of Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of an outstanding Vietnamese military commander. </p><h2>  Socialist Republic of Vietnam: sights and tourist potential of the country </h2><p>  A country not spoiled by tourists - that‚Äôs how you can characterize a young republic.  What is attractive in this state?  First of all, it is the unique nature, diverse landscapes, unusual architecture and hospitality of the Vietnamese themselves. </p><p>  The capital of Vietnam, Hanoi, will appeal to any European accustomed to large cities, cozy parks and modern buildings.  But in the city of Hue, you should definitely go to lovers of antiquity.  Here the traveler is met by beautiful pagodas, imperial palaces, the ruins of ancient fortresses.  But in Ho Chi Minh City (former Saigon), you can fully feel the flavor of the ancient East Asian city. </p>

    <p>  Fans of wildlife, as well as a relaxing, peaceful holiday should definitely visit the mountain resort of Dalat. </p><h2>  Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum </h2><p>  The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is located in Hanoi and is a whole architectural complex consisting of five objects.  The ideological leader of the Vietnamese, as you know, did not live to see the unification of the country for which he fought.  The construction of the mausoleum in his honor began in 1973. </p><p>  Today, anyone can climb up to the second floor of the grand building and look at Ho Chi Minh lying in a glass coffin.  The complex also houses the Presidential Palace and the President‚Äôs wooden house. </p>

    <h2>  Mekong Delta </h2><p>  Another place in Vietnam that all tourists love is the Mekong Delta.  Here you can feel the essence and exotic of local life in all its glory.  The channel of the Mekong River, when flowing into the sea, forms hundreds of narrow branches.  For the Vietnamese, this place is as holy as the Dnieper for the Ukrainians or the Nile for the Egyptians. </p><p>  Some tourists come here for a day or two, while others stay here for a week to calmly swim through the canals and explore the wildest corners of the local landscapes.  In the Mekong Delta, travelers are attracted by locals' houses, floating markets, exotic fruit plantations, and the island that produces real coconut sweets. </p>

    <h2>  Dalat and Mount Longbyan </h2><p>  Dalat is one of the best and most popular resorts in Vietnam.  But in the city itself, you should definitely visit Longbyan Mountain.  From its top offers a wonderful view of Dalat, bright green hills and pastures. </p><p>  The mountain is a thirty-minute drive from the resort and looks like a chain of five peaks of volcanic origin.  The height of the highest of them is 2400 meters.  You can go to the Longbyan viewing platform, but the highest peak can only be reached on foot. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  On <span>the Indochina Peninsula,</span> on the shores of the South China Sea, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is located.  The sights of this amazing country are rarely mentioned in popular guidebooks.  But this makes them even more attractive for tourists and travelers who are ready for new discoveries. </p><p>  Ancient temples, stunning nature, hospitality and hospitality of the Vietnamese - that‚Äôs why it is worth going to this state.  The Republic of Vietnam has not yet been spoiled by tourists, and therefore is looking forward to each of its guests. </p>
