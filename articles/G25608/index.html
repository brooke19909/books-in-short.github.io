    <p>  In modern pedagogy, a new and resonant term has recently appeared - a <strong>competency-based approach to teaching</strong> .  What is meant by it? </p><p>  First you need to consider what does the word "approach" mean?  This term is often used equivalently to the word "method".  But, nevertheless, he has a broader understanding.  The approach implies the existence of a whole complex of interconnected ideas, principles and methods that contribute to the solution of a particular problem.  Here, an important role is played by the understanding of socio-economic, philosophical and psychological-pedagogical prerequisites.  The stages and mechanisms ensuring the achievement of the set goals should be clearly worked out. </p><p>  In pedagogical practice, many time-tested approaches and methods have gained wide popularity.  These include traditional approaches that focus on obtaining strong knowledge, their systematic nature, personal orientation of students and the complex relationship of these approaches.  <strong>The competency-based approach</strong> refers to modern developments that went into teaching practice at the end of the twentieth century.  Such are situational, informational and some others.  They have not yet reached their completion and have not received a full scientific justification.  Although they are quite widely recognized. </p><p>  <strong>The competency-based approach</strong> first appeared in the 80s of the last century.  In the beginning, it was about the competence of the individual and the competencies that were to become the goal and result of education.  It was understood as "deepening knowledge", "mastering skills" and "the ability to use skills."  But later this concept expanded more and more, and now in pedagogy they are already talking about a holistic approach of this type in education. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at the <strong>competency-based approach</strong> in modern professional education, its goals and content.  After all, this is not a tribute to the latest fashion, but a reality caused by the socio-economic and educational prerequisites of recent years, when the market economy has fully declared itself.  Nowadays, completely different requirements are presented to a modern specialist, which were not taken into account in old programs for training specialists.  These requirements are not strictly related to any particular discipline.  They are distinguished by universality, the ‚Äúover-subject" nature of the knowledge gained.  Their formation requires, rather, new <span>pedagogical technologies</span> than new programs.  Such requirements are called ‚Äúover-professional‚Äù, basic qualifications in one literature, and key competencies in another. </p><p>  Key competencies can be very diverse.  They are put forward by life itself.  These can be ‚Äúcross-cutting‚Äù skills: working on a computer, the ability to search for information, mastery of the basic concepts of economics and business, an understanding of the environment, command of foreign languages, the basics of legal knowledge and marketing skills.  These include commercial skills, knowledge of sanitary and medical aspects. </p><p>  These key competencies are, conditionally, the first of two areas that highlight the <strong>competency-based approach</strong> .  It is considered as the education of the personal qualities of specialists necessary for activities in a number of different professions. </p><p>  Another direction implies the presence of <span>professional skills</span> and abilities that have the property of wide transfer.  In both cases, these competencies must meet two basic criteria, such as generalization and functionality. </p><p>  <strong>The competency-based approach in higher education</strong> implies the formation of specialists without fail: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ knowledge of the basic principles of operation of enterprises; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ possession of the main legal knowledge base; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ knowledge of the principles of existence in the current conditions of competition and possible unemployment; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ willingness to change the profession, and, if necessary, the scope of activity; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ creativity of thinking; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ communication skills; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ teamwork experience. </p><p>  Not in the last place is such a property of a human character as self-awareness and self-esteem. </p>
