What do the national symbols of the country look like?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of Kiribati is one of the most remote countries in the world.  It is surrounded by other dwarf states of Oceania and is more than 2.5 thousand kilometers away from all continents.  It would be possible to describe the republic with the phrase ‚Äúparadise place‚Äù, where there is a lot of sun, fruit, beaches and palm trees, but this place also has sad pages of history.  What is the coat of arms and flag of Kiribati?  What is displayed on the main symbols of the country? </p><h2>  Some general facts about the country </h2><p>  The Republic of Kiribati simultaneously belongs to the Micronesian and Polynesian regions.  It includes 33 small islands, 20 of which do not have a permanent population.  All of them are atolls and are formed due to the vital activity of coral polyps.  The islands of Kiribati are very scattered, the distance between the extreme points of the country is about 4 thousand kilometers. </p><p>  This territory has long been inhabited by the peoples of Oceania.  In the XVIII century, the British discovered these lands and in the next century made them their colonies.  During World War II, the Japanese occupied them briefly.  Here, off the island of Taraba, one of the most fierce battles between the Japanese and American naval forces took place.  After the territory of the islands returned to British control again, freeing it only in 1979. </p><h2>  Flag of Kiribati </h2><p>  Modern state symbols of the republic appeared immediately after independence from Great Britain.  The Kiribati flag was completely copied from the coat of arms proposed by the artist Arthur Grimble in 1937.  It is quite minimalistic, but it says a lot about the spirit of the country and its natural features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The flag of Kiribati shows a bright red sky with a golden sun, half peeking out from the horizon.  The luminary of enormous size, rising from across the sea and illuminating the sky in red, is a typical picture for a country located near the equator.  Its 17 rays symbolize the island of Banaba and the islands of the Gilbert archipelago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flagpedia.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiribati flag" class="if uuid-2571766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2571766.jpg"></div><p>  A golden bird flies over the sun.  This is a frigate that lives in tropical and subtropical regions.  The bird is a symbol of many island states.  Among the inhabitants of Kiribati, it is associated with freedom and power. </p><p>  Below are wavy blue and white stripes, alternating between each other.  Blue lines indicate the waters of the Pacific Ocean, washing the territory of the country.  Three white stripes symbolize the three groups of archipelagos that make up it: Phoenix, Line and the Gilbert Islands. </p><p>  The flag of Kiribati was also used in colonial time.  But then it was a miniature.  It was placed on a blue background on the right side.  To the left of the flagpole was a thumbnail of the UK flag as a sign of its protectorate over the islands. </p><h2>  Coat of arms of the republic </h2><p>  With the exception of some details, the coat of arms looks the same as the flag of Kiribati.  It is enclosed in a quadrangular shield with a rounded base and depicts a red sky, blue-white waves, a golden sun and a bird. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Indolences, "><img itemprop="image" alt="coat of arms of Kiribati" class="if uuid-2571765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2571765.jpg"></div><p>  At the bottom of the heraldic shield is a gold ribbon with the motto of the republic.  It says Te Mauri Te Raoi Ao Te Tabomoa, which is translated from the language of Kiribati as "health, peace and prosperity." </p>
