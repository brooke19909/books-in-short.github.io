  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Sunny City": reviews, location, infrastructure, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  St. Petersburg is the northern capital of our country, a huge multi-million megalopolis, whose residents do not cease to need housing.  Currently, the city is being actively built up; new residential buildings and entire microdistricts appear, in which all the necessary conditions for a comfortable life are created.  The bright representative of such projects, in turn, is the Solar City LCD.  Feedback from the first customers will help us identify all the exceptional features of the project and determine how suitable it is for modern residents of the metropolis, whether it will be able to meet their expectations. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  If you are looking for a complex in a beautiful green area - you should definitely pay attention to the residential complex "Sunny City".  Reviews about him are so enthusiastic that he attracted our attention.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project lies in creating a certain balance of charms of urban and suburban life, which all residents of a millionaire dream of. </p><p>  A modern, dynamic quarter with all the necessary infrastructure, immersed in the greenery of parks and squares - all this LCD "Solar City".  The responses of the first buyers indicate that they were primarily impressed by the scale of the project and the unique author‚Äôs architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny city" class="if uuid-3181951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181951.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  So, the complex will consist of 5 monolithic-brick buildings from 5 to 12 floors.  Such technology guarantees strength, endurance and provides an aesthetic appearance.  Ventilated facades give all buildings excellent heat and sound insulating properties, increasing the energy intensity of all structures in the Solar City complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews of the first tenants who have arrived have focused on the amount of utility bills.  Even in winter, in severe weather conditions, the amount of heating fees was significantly lower than in other new buildings in the city.  At the same time, it was warm and homely inside the apartments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny city residents reviews" class="if uuid-3181954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181954.jpg"></div><p>  All houses have high-speed, noiseless elevators.  The front door is decorated using first-class materials, and a wheelchair is also equipped, where residents can leave their belongings necessary for walking.  Access doors are equipped with a modern access control system, which excludes the penetration of unauthorized citizens, which can become a threat to residents. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It was no coincidence that the Krasnoselsky district of St. Petersburg was chosen for the construction of the complex.  Today it is considered the greenest, so it is great for families with young children, so in need of clean air and a place for walking.  In this regard, your dreams will definitely be embodied in the LCD "Sunny City".  Responses of residents - the best confirmation of this.  Many fell in love with the project even at the stage of liberating the territory under construction, just visiting the place once. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Every modern resident of the metropolis dreams of fresh air, greenery, so there are so many Petersburgers who buy cottages far from the city.  So what, from an environmental point of view, can "Sunny City" offer?  Reviews say that the situation here is considered favorable for various groups of the population. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flower beds are planted next to each house, trees and shrubs are planted.  Yards are completely isolated from cars, and therefore not polluted.  Across the block is Polezhaevsky Park, where you can relax and play sports.  There are enough playgrounds for children.  Reviews of the "Sunny City" also focus on the proximity of the Gulf of Finland, providing the area with clean air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd sunny city reviews" class="if uuid-3181953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181953.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments and their layouts </h2><p>  Studios, one-, two- and three-room apartments of various sizes - the number of rooms of the residential complex "Sunny City".  Residents' reviews confirm that the layouts are represented by a variety of species.  You have the opportunity to purchase an apartment so popular today in the European layout, which implies an excellent solution with functional kitchen-living rooms, an additional bathroom for guests and a wardrobe for storing things and various household utensils. </p><p>  All apartments, regardless of area, have a balcony or loggia.  Moreover, the developer left the tenants the right to organize the internal space of their home at their own discretion, including moving the walls and combining several apartments into one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="78.house" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny city housing estate reviews" class="if uuid-3181961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181961.jpg"></div><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  If you are not ready to burden yourself with a lengthy and costly repair, buy an apartment in the village of "Sunny City".  Reviews say that all real estate is rented with a full fine finish, that is, it is completely ready for living. </p><p>  Two-chamber double-glazed windows of European manufacture are installed in the apartments, all balconies and loggias are glazed and insulated, high-quality plumbing is installed, communications are connected, the walls are papered, the laminate is laid on the floor.  Each apartment has an entrance and interior doors. </p><p>  Residents are quite satisfied with their quality.  These are not those thin door leafs that can be pierced with one blow.  In a word, the finish is made with high quality, using modern materials and unique technologies.  After receiving the keys you only need to bring furniture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="village sunny city reviews" class="if uuid-3181965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181965.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It is planned that on the territory of the complex all necessary conditions will be created for the most comfortable life.  The first floors of the buildings will be reserved for commercial infrastructure.  There will be shops, pharmacies, bank branches, beauty salons, laundries and much more.  The developer assures that residents will not be deprived of entertainment facilities. </p><p>  And what about social infrastructure facilities?  At the moment, you can talk about it only based on the plans of the developer.  And they are really grand.  In total, according to the plan, 11 kindergartens of various kinds will be built in the district.  By the way, the first is already handed over and brings up the first kids. </p><p>  The project also plans to build four schools.  The first will open in 2019.  In the distant plans, the construction of clinics and a large medical center, but in the next 5-10 years, residents should not even dream of.  They will have to use those located in another area, experiencing some discomfort. </p><p>  What the residents of the complex can already observe today is modern playgrounds and sports grounds where children play and frolic from morning till night.  It is hoped that the developer will fulfill its promises and really build a comfortable complex. </p><h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  What could be better than the assessment of those who have already managed to call in the complex?  So, summing up, I would like to note that the residential complex "Sunny City" is another project from the housing construction giant Setl City.  This gives certain guarantees and, of course, protects the potential buyer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd sunny city residents reviews" class="if uuid-3181956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181956.jpg"></div><p>  The location and layout of the apartments are perhaps the main advantages of the complex.  Residents themselves confirm that the rooms in the apartments strive to form a regular rectangle, which allows each square meter of space to be used.  Those who managed to settle in the first-stage buildings are impressed, or rather, pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fine finish.  There is no need to change or redo anything.  Everything is simply and tastefully decorated. </p><p>  But there is another side to the coin.  After all, not all promises were fully realized.  First of all, the area is currently very poor in infrastructure, and in some areas it is completely absent.  Fortunately, the developer put his own objects into the project, but they will be put into operation only by the time the construction is completed. </p><p>  Transport and road junctions are also not in good shape, collecting huge traffic jams in the morning and evening.  Given that there is no metro station nearby and is not planned, residents have no alternative.  And from an environmental point of view, the area is not as ideal as it is presented.  After all, only 250 m is a huge industrial zone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sanktpeterburg.bezformata.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children's sunny city reviews" class="if uuid-3181975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181975.jpg"></div><p>  Definitely, the project is worthy of attention, it is one of the best and most promising in the city, but it can become really comfortable and convenient for residents only by the time the construction is completed.  Be sure to visit the construction site to personally assess the progress of construction and its scope. </p>
