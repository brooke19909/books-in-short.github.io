There are several beautiful legends on this subject, but the impetus for the development of the settlement was the fact that these lands were inherited by the daughter of Baron A. G. Stroganov, Princess V. A. Shakhovskaya.  Varvara Alexandrovna submitted a request to the Perm State Chamber for the construction of a cast iron and ironworks, which was approved in 1785.  From this day, in accordance with the history of Lysva, a countdown of his age is carried out. </p><p>  The blast furnace began to work in 1787, which contributed to the growth of the population and the development of the plant and the settlement next to it.  At first, the workers' settlement was called the same as the enterprise - Lysvensky Plant, later the historical name - Lysva was returned. </p><h2>  Unicorn stamp </h2><p>  The great industrial dynasties of the Stroganovs, Shakhovskys and Shuvalovs played an important role in the history of Lysva and the Perm Territory.  The last of the owners, <span>Count Shuvalov,</span> drawing attention to the need to develop not only the plant, but also the settlement, invited people who transformed the village to the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nashural.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merchant House" class="if uuid-3092484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3092484.jpg"></div><p>  Since 1898, buildings have been built here, which today are architectural monuments and attractions of the city.  It was then that a unique regular park was laid, later named after A.S. Pushkin.  A school was opened in which the children of workers and employees of the enterprise studied "industrial art". </p><p>  Thanks to the activities of Shuvalov, the quality of products has significantly improved, it has become in demand on the international market.  In 1900, participation in the Paris exhibition brought medals and even greater popularity to the products of the plant, which had a positive effect on the history of Lysva. </p><p>  The family coat of arms of the Shuvalov family was decorated with a galloping unicorn, which, as a guarantee of the quality of its products, began to appear on the brand of products.  Lysven enterprise still uses such a stigma. </p><h2>  1914 strike </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, a railway line was laid in these parts, which allowed to increase the supply of plant products both domestically and abroad.  The number of workers in this region also grew.  The events that stirred up the country in 1905 did not bypass the Perm region.  In 1914, there was such an event in the history of the city of Lysva: the workers staged a mass uprising, putting forward certain requirements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="reki-ozera.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lysvensky pond" class="if uuid-3092486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3092486.jpg"></div><p>  Soviet historians qualified this event as a protest against mobilization in the army, sent to the front of the First World War.  Later studies clarified that the requirements were purely economic in nature.  The list included an increase in wages, a reduction in the working day to eight hours, the abolition of fines, the improvement of working conditions, and so on. </p><p>  The mobilization announced at that time only added to the list additional payments for draft workers.  After partially satisfying the requirements, people began to return to the workshops. </p><h2>  Soviet history of Lysva </h2><p>  During the revolutionary events of 1917, Lysva, for whose enterprises there were fierce battles, repeatedly passed from hand to hand.  As a result, both the plant and the workers' settlement had to be restored.  In 1919, rolling production began, the production of dishes began, and the first open-hearth furnace produced products in 1922. </p><p>  Lysva became the city in 1926, and the mining plant of Count Shuvalov became the largest enterprise in the industry.  During the war years of the 40s, the enterprise was the only one that soldier's helmets.  In addition, of course, there was a whole list of military products that Lysvensi produced and sent to the front.  For the fulfillment of all state tasks, the plant was awarded government orders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nashural.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Factory Products" class="if uuid-3092483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3092483.jpg"></div><p>  A beautiful and useful part of the history of the city of Lysva in the Perm Territory was the famous enameled dishes.  The issue was started in 1913, it was sent for export, exhibitions, festivals, presented to honored guests.  Today it is an industrial brand of the city.  After the war, several more enterprises of heavy and light industries were opened.  Schools, hospitals, and cultural institutions were built. </p><h2>  The cultural life of modern Lysva </h2><p>  The drama theater, opened in 1944 on the basis of the Ivanovo Theater, evacuated to these parts, deserves special words.  Today it is the only professional cultural institution of such a plan in the Perm region.  Guided by A. A. Savin, the theater significantly expanded its repertoire, began to participate in festivals and tours, and gained fame in the country.  Today the theater bears his name. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uraloved.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Lysva" class="if uuid-3092472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3092472.jpg"></div><p>  Since 2009, the Lysva - Culture Deposit program began in the city, accompanied by the restoration of significant facilities.  The house of Count Shuvalov, which was in disrepair, is being restored, the Holy Trinity Church, located in the center, works on improvement and landscaping are being carried out everywhere. </p><p>  Of several city museums, the most interesting and unusual ones should be noted.  These are the Helmet Museum and the Enamelware Museum. </p><h2>  Sights of Lysva </h2><p>  The history of Lysva and photos of its significant objects speak of the deep roots of this city.  The monument to Count Shuvalov, erected in 1908 on the initiative and at the expense of workers and employees of the plant, was created by architect L.V. Sherwood.  A self-confident person stands leaning on a stone and looking around in a businesslike way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": -, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Shuvalov" class="if uuid-3092485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3092485.jpg"></div><p>  After the revolution, the count‚Äôs figure was demolished from the pedestal and drowned in a pond.  A statue of V.I. Lenin was installed on an empty pedestal.  An exact copy of the monument to Shuvalov, which reappeared on the old pedestal, was made by sculptor I.I. Storozhev in 2009. </p><p>  A regular city park, founded at the beginning of the 20th century on the site of a wasteland, today is one of the favorite vacation spots of citizens.  The tree planting was attended by schoolchildren, students of vocational schools and local residents.  He supervised the work according to a strictly marked plan A.V. Zanuzzi, senior forester Lysva. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pushkin Park" class="if uuid-3092479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3092479.jpg"></div><p>  The opening of the park was timed to the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty.  Over the years, the park changed, arbors, statues, shields with visual agitation appeared and disappeared here.  In 1937, a bust was set up for A.S. Pushkin, and the park was given his name.  Today it is a monument of regional importance, preserving the layout created by A.V. Zanuzzi. </p><h2>  Dam is factory </h2><p>  The history of Lysva is closely connected with factory production, and any mining plant in the XVIII century used the energy of falling water to operate the mechanisms.  So he needed a dam.  In 1787, such a structure blocked the channel of the Lysva River, the accumulation of water in the pond began.  Four windows were left in the dam: two for dumping excess water, two for factory needs.  Water was supplied to the blast bellows through a wooden pipeline. </p><p>  Today, the pond and dam are monuments of regional importance located in the city center.  On the shore of the pond there is a children's park, and its shores were chosen by fishermen and vacationers. </p>
