Their heroism is captured in prose, poetry, films, performances, monuments.  Orders and medals that have been preserved in old caskets under a pile of papers remind the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the glorious battle path of their grandfathers. </p><p>  More than one generation of Soviet schoolchildren, with bated breath, listened to the lively stories of veterans.  The country could thank its heroes only by noting their exploits with worthy rewards. </p><p>  Among the many differences, the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree was considered the main one.  Today, his list of awards is approximately three million.  Everyone dreamed of him - from the ordinary to the army general. </p>

    <h2>  How did the order appear? </h2><p>  In order to raise morale in 1942, Stalin put forward the initiative to create the Order for Military Valor.  Sketching was entrusted to two artists: Kuznetsov and Dmitriev.  As a result, the <span>Supreme Commander</span> was presented with two works from each. </p><p>  Kuznetsov‚Äôs layout went into revision, but the inscription was taken from Dmitriev‚Äôs sketch.  On a white background bordering a ruby ‚Äã‚Äãcircle with a sickle and hammer, the phrase: ‚ÄúWorld War II‚Äù is present.  The inscription so harmoniously fit into the general view that this entailed the decision to rename the insignia in the Order of the Patriotic War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The award has a number of unique characteristics: </p><ul><li>  The first order of the USSR, which appeared during the war. </li><li>  The list of those awarded the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree included both people and military units, settlements, enterprises and institutions. </li><li>  For the first time, the award had two degrees. </li><li>  The only award until the end of the 70s of the XX century, which did not give up after the death of the awarded. </li><li>  The first precedent, when certain feats for presentation to the order were indicated in the statute. </li><li>  For the first time in the USSR, a block was used to secure the order. </li><li>  The most numerous award.  The list of candidates approved for the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree in 1985 exceeded two million people. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to this, the order is still the most outstanding sign of the Great Victory. </p><p>  The decree on the establishment is dated May 1942.  Twice the order underwent changes - in June 1943 and in December 1947. </p><h2>  Statute of the Order </h2><p>  Paragraphs of the statute definitely prescribe thirty combat feats, for which it is possible to get on the list of those awarded with the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree. </p><p>  Such people could include military personnel of any rank.  The order is considered the second oldest.  Attaches to the right on the chest. </p><h2>  Appearance and description </h2><p>  What does the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree look like.  In the photo present in the article, you can see what this award represents.  This is a star covered with ruby-colored enamel, between whose rays golden flashes diverge.  They also form a star.  In the middle of the award are a sickle and a hammer made in gold.  It is written on the white enamel border: ‚ÄúPatriotic War‚Äù, the words below are shared by a small golden star. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Crossed rifle and saber are visible on the golden flashes behind the enamel star.  To cover them, the oxidation method was used. </p><p>  After a detailed review of the award in the photo and reading the description, the question naturally arises: "What is the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree made of?" </p><p>  The main materials are silver and gold.  All non-enamelled and non-oxidized parts are gold plated.  Weight is about 33 g. Silver accounts for approximately 17 g, gold for 8 g. Diagonal swing is 45 mm. </p><p>  On the reverse side there is a pin with a nut, with which the award is attached to clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 1 degree" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31216/733937.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <h2>  Types of Order </h2><p>  The award is presented in two main forms: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The first existed from the moment of approval until the middle of June 1943.  The end of the ray of a ruby ‚Äã‚Äãstar had an eyelet on top.  A block was fixed on it.  Burgundy moire stretched into the horizontal slots.  On the block on the back there is a pin and a washer for fastening. </li><li>  The second appearance appeared a year later, after changing the order according to which orders bearing the form of a star are worn.  In this regard, the suspension block was abolished, and the mount was placed directly on the back of the order itself.  By the same decree, it was allowed to wear <span>order straps</span> in the usual form and field. </li></ol><p>  It will be interesting and useful to dwell in more detail on each view. </p><h2>  Order on the block </h2><p>  It consists of 4 parts: two stars, a sickle and a hammer, a block.  The elements are riveted.  The eyelet on the tip of the beam is integral with the order. </p><p>  The number is applied manually.  The convex letters "Mint" were applied to the puck in two lines. </p><p>  Orders with a block were made in three versions: </p><ol><li>  Suspension block height 18 mm.  It is directly attached to the ear of the insignia with a wire soldered to it.  On the back of the golden star is a pin located vertically. </li><li>  Suspension block height 21.5 mm.  For fastening with the order an additional ring appeared.  The rest corresponds to the first option. </li><li>  In all respects corresponds to the second option, excluding the pin on the back of the star made of gold. </li></ol><h2>  Pin Mount Order </h2><p>  The order of this species has a fundamental difference from the previous one.  The shoe was removed, and there was no need for a loop on the beam.  The round washer has a circumference of 33 mm, without inscriptions.  Stars are fastened with a nut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of the Patriotic War 1 degree 1985 list" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31216/733908.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  The hole on the back is larger and has three jumpers.  The numbers were applied manually.  The stamped stamp of the Mint was placed on top. </p><p>  The order on a pin mount has 4 options for the location of the mark and jumpers. </p><h2>  Redeployment of orders </h2><p>  The rewards have changed outwardly over time.  The Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree did not escape such a fate.  If the reward of a regular soldier did not correspond to reality, it was changed to a new one.  When re-issuing, the previous <span>serial number was</span> saved <span>.</span> </p><p>  A big re-release took place on <span>the</span> eve of <span>the Victory Parade.</span>  Participants were given awards of a new sample. </p><h2>  Duplicates </h2><p>  Obtaining the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree in return for the lost is an exceptional case.  Fell under it: war, elements and unavoidable circumstances. </p><p>  The duplicate had the serial number of the original, after which the letter ‚ÄúD‚Äù was added.  It was allowed to be applied manually or by stamp.  Labeling depended on the year of manufacture.  There is an assumption that not all duplicates have the letter "D". </p><h2>  Knights of the Order </h2><p>  During the Second World War, the awarding took place approximately 350 thousand times.  Until 1985 - 20 thousand times. </p><p>  On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Victory, it was decided to use the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree in 1985 again.  The list of awarded veterans was impressive. </p><p>  Today, the number of awards is approximately two and a half million. </p><p>  The order was handed out literally in the trenches from the very moment of its appearance, without dragging out the paperwork with the design for a long time.  This was done to raise the morale of soldiers and an example to follow. </p>

Criclius was destined for the first order of World War 1 degree.  He replenished the list of awards only a year later.

    <p>  About the exploits of those awarded this order are composed of poems and songs.  Heroes are glorified in prose and memoirs of war veterans.  It is impossible to list all by name: there are a lot of them.  But some need to be reminded. </p><p>  Eighteen orders of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree were received by fighters sung in the famous song about Nameless Height.  They fought to the death, repelling the attacks of a company of German soldiers, without retreating, and held on to their positions.  Only two survived.  This feat was appreciated by the government. </p><p>  In 1942, during the defense of Stalingrad, terrible battles were fought.  It was especially important to prevent the Germans from joining the Red October factory.  Steel was poured there for the production of military equipment.  An ordinary soldier Mikhail Panikakh at the cost of his life blocked the way for the tank.  For this feat, he received a worthy reward, unfortunately, posthumously. </p><p>  Everyone remembers the unprecedented feat of the <span>Hero of the Soviet Union</span> Gastello.  Three crew members who died with him received the Order of World War 1 degree.  Their surnames: Burdenyuk, Skorobogaty, Kalinin. </p><p>  This order is not in vain considered special.  In 1977, eight years after her death, Epistinia Stepanova was awarded.  She raised nine sons, and they all died fighting for their <span>homeland.</span>  <span>Mother,</span> steadfastly survived the bitterness of loss, like no other worthy of a reward. </p><p>  The order received more than 600 anti-fascist foreigners and the Czech village of Sklabin. </p><p>  In addition, they were awarded orders of the 1st degree: </p><ul><li>  7 military units for valor shown in battles; </li><li>  80 enterprises that have made a significant contribution to helping those fighting at the front; </li><li>  3 editions of the newspaper, whose dedicated work illuminated the course of the war and supported the fighting spirit of the soldiers; </li><li>  39 cities in the USSR. </li></ul><p>  All who received a high award, by their actions, and sometimes their lives, brought closer the day of the Great Victory.  Among them there are those who have been awarded the Order more than once. </p><h2>  Multiple Cavaliers </h2><p>  Despite the severity of the statute, which determines the possibility of receiving an award, there were people who repeatedly proved their right to the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree. </p>

During the reign of Stalin, many worthy people were undeservedly deprived of honors, and some were declared enemies and traitors. </p><p>  At the end of the fifties they decided to correct this mistake.  Award sheets for the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree were issued.  The award list included not only Soviet citizens, but also foreigners.  Residents of other states, as far as possible, helped the wounded soldiers who entered the territory of the enemy.  Sheltered, treated, risking their lives. </p><h2>  Order for the 40th anniversary of Victory </h2><p>  By a significant date, the government decides to adequately mark the heroes of the occasion.  The Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree in 1985 was received by all veterans who remained alive and had at least one military award. </p>

    <p>  The order was cast in its original form, but still there are differences.  Which ones?  First of all, materials.  What is the Order of the Patriotic War of 1 degree 1985 made of? </p><p>  Due to the huge number of those awarded, they decided not to use gold.  For the manufacture of silver.  Separate details, to give the award an appropriate look, gilded.  In all other respects, the award is no different.  It has a number and an inscription: ‚ÄúMint‚Äù.  An order book is attached to the order. </p><p>  It is a pity that every year the number of WWII veterans is rapidly decreasing.  Age, disease, old wounds take their toll.  Now these people are rarely seen on the streets of cities on their most important holiday.  Very soon, the time will come when there will be no one to share living memories with descendants.  Flowers and congratulations in the form of soldier triangles will not find recipients ... And even when the last of them leaves this world, the memory of their feat will remain for centuries. </p>
