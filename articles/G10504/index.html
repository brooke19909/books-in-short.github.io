    <h2>  Talea Beach Hotel 3 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Since for many tourists, when planning a trip to a particular country, it is very important to find out the opinions of people who have already vacationed here, we summarized the comments of our compatriots about their vacation at the Talea Beach Hotel (Crete, Greece).  In general, we can say that many travelers did not regret their choice at all.  But we offer to learn more about everything. </p><p>  So, most of all, our compatriots appreciated the location of this hotel complex.  Within walking distance from it there are a lot of shops, restaurants, taverns, cafes, bars, shops, etc.  The distance to the nearest beach is only a few tens of meters.  As for the rooms of Talea Beach Hotel 3 * <span>(Crete), reviews</span> vary.  So, someone was completely satisfied with the unpretentious furniture, simple repair and, although not new, but quite working equipment.  Someone claimed that in their rooms there were cockroaches, and the windows did not have a very picturesque view of the walls of the neighboring building.  Moreover, the administration‚Äôs complaints about insects in the rooms did not give an adequate reaction from the hotel staff. </p><p>  As for the work of the staff, with rare exceptions, there were no complaints against the employees of Talea Beach.  Rather, on the contrary, some of our compatriots note the willingness of the hotel staff to help.  Many were pleased with the quality of housekeeping, as well as the honesty of the maids.  So, several cases were noted when guests forgot wallets with large amounts of cash in the rooms.  Upon their return, they found everything safe and sound, despite the fact that the maids had been in the room. </p><p>  A real stumbling block when studying hotel reviews is the issue of nutrition.  Talea Beach Hotel 3 * was no exception to this rule.  So, some tourists (and especially those of our compatriots who are not the first time vacationing in three-star hotels in Greece) were quite pleased with the variety of menus and the quality of food.  Other vacationers (for the most part those who had previously rested in Turkey or Egypt) considered the choice of dishes rather meager and monotonous.  Also, some discontent was expressed by tourists who settled in the hotel in the evening.  They hoped that they would be given dinner at the hotel, but the administration did not offer them such a service.  Therefore, travelers had to go outside the hotel and have dinner in a tavern or restaurant. </p><p>  I liked the vacationers' beach near the hotel complex.  Everyone was satisfied with the fine sand, the gentle entry into the water without stones, the mass of water entertainment, as well as the beautiful and warm sea.  Tourists, who were a little embarrassed by the large number of holidaymakers on the beach, always had the opportunity to move to neighboring beaches. </p><p>  From travelers who came to Talea Beach with children, there are positive reviews about the animation, designed for the youngest guests.  So, the hotel has a daily mini-club for children of different ages.  According to them, the kids were very pleased. </p><p>  In general, most Russians were quite satisfied with the time spent in the three-star hotel complex ‚ÄúTalea Beach‚Äù in Cyprus (Greece).  They do not exclude the possibility of coming to this hotel again, and also plan to recommend it to their friends and relatives. </p>
