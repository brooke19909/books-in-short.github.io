It is composed of essays and philosophical reflections regarding the events of a difficult period in the history of Russia, known as the Time of Troubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ucrazy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ivan timofeev temporary" class="if uuid-2471066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2471066.jpg"></div><h2>  Ivan Timofeevich Semenov (Ivan Timofeev) </h2><p>  According to some reports, the author of "Temporary" Ivan Timofeev saw the light in 1555, in the city of Moscow.  His father from service people, his son, having reached adulthood, also followed in his footsteps.  This happened at the end of the reign of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, when he was enlisted as a clerk in the Pushkarsky Order.  In the service, he was notable for considerable zeal and by the age of 43 received the position of clerk. </p><p>  He possessed prudence and the ability to analyze, thanks to this, in the general hierarchy of sovereign people, he occupied one of the first places and a high position among employees of the Pushkarsky Prikaz.  Under Tsar Boris in 1604, he was instructed to conduct a battle near Bryansk with the army of False Dmitry I. But this did not bring any result due to the transition of the Bryansk governor to the side of the impostor. </p><p>  Sovereign clerk Ivan Timofeev returned to Moscow and took up his former business.  False Dmitry I, who reigned on the throne, did not trust him.  But Vasily Shuisky, having come to power, on the contrary, entrusted him with the defense of Moscow from the army of Ivan Bolotnikov.  And then he sent to Novgorod to help local governors in organizing resistance with the help of hired Swedes, who should defend the city from False Dmitry II.  In 1611, the Swedes changed Vasily Shuisky and captured Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="temporary 2" class="if uuid-2471069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2471069.jpg"></div><h2>  "Temporary" by Ivan Timofeev </h2><p>  The events of the Time of Troubles - the changing rulers, the discontent of the Russian population, tired of the temporary workers, the ongoing squabble, intrigues in the ruling elite - made an indelible impression on Ivan Timofeev.  Presumably after the events described above, he began to lead his "Temporary".  It has survived to the present day and is of undeniable value, since this is the testimony of an eyewitness, to some extent a participant in the events. </p><p>  Being religious, the clerk, the author of the Temporary book about the events of the Time of Troubles, considered all events from the point of view of Christian dogmas.  He explained the causes of the Time of Troubles in the Russian state from the point of view of the sinfulness of the people living in it.  The ‚Äútemporary book‚Äù is divided into chapters, each of which describes a certain ruler. </p><p>  He characterized all the political events of that time, described the current situation on major issues, outlined the political principles of the Time of Troubles.  With the ability to analyze, he sets forth original judgments and his own interpretation of events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moskvityanin.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="temporary clerk Ivan Timofeev" class="if uuid-2471055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2471055.jpg"></div><h2>  Tsar Ivan the Terrible </h2><p>  The ‚Äútemporary book‚Äù by Ivan Timofeev begins with the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible, whom the clerk describes primarily as a successor to a noble family, originating from Rurik.  He also notes his unwavering faith and compares his gift of leadership with the gift of the commander Alexander of Macedon, but at the same time he marks him as a furious king. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He sees God's punishment over the Russian people, which is predetermined by the death of Tsarevich Dmitry, she interrupted the family of Ivan Kalita.  This is the time of interregnum.  He considers Russia to be the only Orthodox country in the world, so he calls the <span>death of Ivan the Terrible a</span> tragedy.  Describes the joy of the enemies of the country and the bitterness of all Orthodox. </p><p>  Nevertheless, he treated some features of the formidable king without approval.  With his anger, Tsar Ivan the Terrible led people into confusion, he could beat a man, send him to foreign lands.  Due to the ruin of Novgorod, according to Ivan Timofeev, he, as an ax, divided the country into two parts, which predetermined the Time of Troubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kakprosto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ivan timofeev temporary" class="if uuid-2471053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2471053.jpg"></div><h2>  Tsar Fedor Ivanovich </h2><p>  The next chapter of the ‚ÄúTemporary Book‚Äù of the deacon Ivan Timofeev is dedicated to the son of Ivan the Terrible, he describes him as the antipode of his father.  This is a righteous king who "rules quietly and serenely."  He says that people under his rule lived peacefully and were engaged in labor.  <span>This prosperity</span> came exclusively through the prayers of the dean sovereign, who prayed day and night for Russia. </p><p>  In this chapter of the Temporary Book, he, analyzing the situation and appearance of random people at the throne, such as Godunov, comes to the conclusion that Tsarevich Dmitry did not die himself, his death was arranged by order of Tsar Boris, who dreamed of taking the throne.  Timofeev's point of view is very limited by a certain framework and does not give a complete picture of the political situation that has developed in the state.  He simply voices a certain version that was in existence at that time.  He does not cite any specific facts, limiting himself to his conclusions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sovereign clerk ivan timofeev" class="if uuid-2471059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2471059.jpg"></div><h2>  Tsar Boris Godunov </h2><p>  Together with False Dmitry, Ivan Timofeev calls him random persons and impostors.  He characterizes the king and man.  She is very unflattering.  He tells of his accession to the throne and an attempt to secure his family for him.  Despite the fact that Boris Godunov was very good with the clerk and trusted him, reviews about him are not entirely flattering.  This may indicate the impartiality of his judgments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="from a temporary book by Ivan Timofeev" class="if uuid-2471078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2471078.jpg"></div><h2>  Impostor False Dmitry </h2><p>  From the "Temporary Book" of Ivan Timofeev, you can read what he calls his "hackle."  For him, this man is renounced of God.  Here you can read about the state of the country during the Time of Troubles and the version that all these troubles and misfortunes are due to perversity that hit the ruling class.  This is a punishment and test of the Russian land. </p><h2>  Tsar Vasily Shuisky </h2><p>  The fifth chapter is devoted to him, in which are inserted two small articles dedicated to his nephew Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, whose death Ivan Timofeev was very upset, accusing her of Vasily Shuisky, saying that he did it out of envy, since his nephew was a man much more worthy of his uncle to take the throne. </p><p>  The narrator indicates that ancient customs are violated, church rites are not performed as diligently as before.  Therefore, the connection with the higher power that punishes the apostates is broken.  This applies more to the ruling class. </p><p>  In a short story ‚ÄúOn the Thief's Escape from Khutyn‚Äù, the author tells about the liberation of the monastery of St. Varlaam of Khutynsky.  Here he talks about the <span>patriarch Germogen.</span>  This priest, while in Polish confinement, did not abandon the struggle against the invaders, appealing to the Russian people with calls to fight against the conquerors. </p><h2>  Final part </h2><p>  In it, he writes about who was the true ruler, who is false.  Using an example of a short period of time, he showed true and fake rulers.  According to him, a true ruler can only be one in whose veins noble blood flows.  It is the origin that can become the measure that will determine whether a person is worthy to be the ruler of the state or not.  After all, this is the will of the Lord, and all that is against is sin, leading to confusion. </p><p>  With respect and love, he writes about the Russian people, considering him to be chosen, since he is protected by higher forces.  He is proud of his land, mourning for the troubles that fell on her.  In the chapter ‚ÄúOn the Widowhood of the Moscow State‚Äù, he says that Russia, like a woman left by her husband, is ‚Äúpossessed and flowed by her slaves,‚Äù divisible and perishable by lot without her husband-king. </p>
