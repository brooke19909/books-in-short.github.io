  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of residential real estate in Samara: primary and secondary</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The implementation of new housing in Samara has not yet been able to gain sufficient momentum.  Nevertheless, secondary housing here is in much greater demand.  For those who want to buy an apartment in Samara, <noindex>  <span>www.bn.ru</span> </noindex>  offers to understand the situation on the Samara real estate market. </p><h2>  Secondary housing market </h2><p>  The secondary market is the set of owners who want to sell their own residential real estate. </p><h3>  Advantages </h3><p>  These apartments interest potential buyers in that the transaction is conducted without intermediaries.  In this case, you can always evaluate the location of the house and the area, examine the apartment carefully from the point of view of the repair carried out in it, the safety and reliability of communications, and the like.  You can even talk with your neighbors to find out if the current owners had any difficulties with housing. </p><h3>  disadvantages </h3><p>  Resellers are usually quite old, dilapidated houses.  In addition, there is a likelihood that the apartment was unlawfully redeveloped.  Also, such an apartment always has its own ‚Äúhistory‚Äù, sometimes not very good.  Sometimes, even after the completion of the purchase and sale transaction, owners who disagree with this and own a certain share of the property may appear. </p><h2>  Primary housing market </h2><p>  Primary housing refers to apartments in buildings at various stages of construction. </p><h3>  Advantages </h3><p>  Among the advantages of primary organizations, there are modern layouts, an increased area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments, and the use of the latest building materials and technologies.  A significant advantage is that such housing can be bought at different stages of construction.  Moreover, the earlier the contract is drawn up, the cheaper the apartment is in the end. </p><h3>  disadvantages </h3><p>  The disadvantage of such a purchase is the opportunity to see the apartment only in the project.  There is a risk that the house will not be completed due to the ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù of the project.  Sometimes various technical problems arise, for example, untimely commissioning of the elevator, lack of water, cable communications, telephone, Internet due to repair. </p><p>  As of the end of 2013, the difference in the cost of housing in Samara amounted to approximately 5,000 rubles.  Cost sq.m.  primary housing is 44 500 rubles., secondary - 49 800 rubles.  If you calculate the cost of the whole apartment, then this difference will be quite significant. </p><p>  However, not everyone can buy the apartment you want.  That is why potential buyers tend to choose a secondary property, because the worse the condition of the housing, the cheaper it will be.  According to many, first of all, you need to get a roof and walls, and the rest will come. </p><p>  In turn, developers are constantly developing favorable conditions for acquiring their apartments in a mortgage. </p><p>  In any case, it is difficult to give an unambiguous answer as to which housing is better in each particular case - primary or secondary. </p></div></article>
