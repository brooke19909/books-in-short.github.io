TOP 10 most beautiful places on the planet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our planet is beautiful.  And the more a person travels, the more he is convinced of it.  But to visit all the beautiful places, cities, lagoons and natural sites, all life is not enough.  It is difficult to make a rating of "Top 10 most beautiful places on the planet."  And what can serve as a criterion?  Aesthetic flair in people is different.  In addition, there are man-made landscapes, the view of which is breathtaking.  This, for example, tulip fields in Holland, flower plantations in Provence, Hitachi Park near the Japanese city of Hitatinaka, broken in 1991 on the site of a former military base, or the Rhine Valley with its medieval castles and vineyards.  But we still chose the top ten dizzying landscapes that everyone should like.  In this article we will list the most beautiful places on the planet with a description of them and photos.  Do you agree with the rating below? </p><h2>  Big blue hole </h2><p>  This unique natural phenomenon is invariably present in all lists of the most beautiful places on our planet.  Perhaps he does not always occupy the first line.  Not far from the Yucatan Peninsula, along the coast of the Caribbean Sea, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef stretches for 700 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most beautiful places on the planet" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1047609.jpg" width="600"></div>  On the site of the underwater coral ridge Lighthouse, Jacques Yves Cousteau discovered the Blue Hole.  The phenomenon is administratively owned by Belize and is located a hundred kilometers from the coast of this Latin American country.  The hole is a perfectly round hole with a diameter of 305 meters and a depth of 120 m. Among the azure of shallow water, it seems a dark blue pupil.  Alas, the most beautiful places on the planet are often the most inaccessible.  You can admire the hole from the air.  But in order to fully enjoy the beauty of this phenomenon, you need to immerse yourself in it - in the most literal sense of the word.  If you are a professional diver, an unforgettable sight will open for you.  The walls of the <span>karst funnel are</span> surrounded by stalactites, and huge groupers, stingrays and lemon sharks inhabit this ‚Äúcave‚Äù.

Geyser Fly is a thermal and permanent source at the eponymous ranch in the US state of Nevada. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful places of the planet" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1047618.jpg" width="600"></div>  This beauty arose ... by mistake.  In 1916, the rancher wanted to cut a well.  But in his zeal he reached the geothermal pocket.  Boiling water began to dissolve mineral rocks and in 1964 came to the surface.  Now the geyser throws three jets of water to a height of one and a half meters.  Cyanobacteria, algae and calcium carbonate stain the liquid in fancy colors.  Unfortunately, few can <span>see this</span> beauty.  And not because the ranch is located in the impregnable mountains.  No, the geyser, which occupies the second position in the ‚ÄúTop of the most beautiful places on the planet‚Äù, is located 30 km from Gerlach and very close to the R34 road.  But the ranchers carefully hide their wealth and let only those whom they wish look at it.  All attempts to redeem the territory in order to make the passage to the geyser accessible to the public have not yet been crowned with success.

    <h2>  Crystal river </h2><p>  The official name for this aquatic artery is Ca√±o Cristales.  But the local tribes that live in the jungle of Central Colombia call it the ‚ÄúRiver of Five Flowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãor ‚ÄúEscaped from Paradise‚Äù.  Many <span>beautiful places on the</span> planet are in the tropics.  But Ca√±o Cristales is the most original river. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most beautiful places on the planet" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1047619.jpg" width="600"></div>  Its waters are really colored in red, green, yellow, black and blue.  So they do the inhabitants of the river - algae.  A rainbow flows through the foothills of the Amazon rainforest.  You can get to this natural phenomenon with a guided tour of the Serrania de la Macarena National Park.  The tours last four days and are held from June to November, during the period of rapid flowering of algae.

The government of this country anxiously protects natural attractions, creating national parks and reserves.  The Colorado River itself is very picturesque.  But there is in its channel such a section, which, bending, forms the shape of an ideal horseshoe.  To look at such beauty is best from a bird's eye view - from the helicopter.  A Colorado bend is located in <span>Arizona,</span> near the town of Page, eight kilometers below Lake Powell and the Glen Canyon Dam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most beautiful places of the planet photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1047620.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Arizona wave </h2><p>  To see this natural phenomenon, you need to be lucky and win the lottery.  Why?  Because these mountains are formed from ancient sand dunes about two hundred million years ago.  Under the influence of winds and rains, the ridge acquired a truly unearthly landscape.  However, the excessive presence of people here can be destroyed by soft sandstone.  Therefore, only twenty people are allowed here per day.  Ten vouchers are raffled online four months before the tour, and another 10 the day before on R89.  This highway runs close to the already mentioned Page.  It just so happened that these most beautiful places on the planet - the bend of Colorado and the Martian landscape of the Arizona wave - are located nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most beautiful places on the planet with a description" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1047629.jpg" width="600"></div>

This natural object was discovered recently - in the two thousandth year.  And then the Mexican city of Chihuahua became known not only as the birthplace of the Chihuahua dog breed (Chihuahuan).  When laying a new mining tunnel, we stumbled upon an underground cavity filled with water.  Its depth is three hundred meters.  But not because of this, the cave was in the Top 10 "The most beautiful places on the planet."  The photo shows the giant ray-shaped crystals that grew on the walls of the underground halls.  Some of them reach a size of fifteen meters.  And most interestingly, these crystals formed in the aquatic environment.  For several hundred thousand years, selenite (a type of gypsum) settled on the walls of the maze.  Tourists are not allowed into the cave, because the temperature in it is +60 <sup></sup> , and the air <span>is saturated with</span> hydrogen sulfide <span>vapors</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Top beautiful places on the planet" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1047632.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Saline Salar de Uyuni </h2><p>  The facility is located near the high mountain lake Titicaca.  It is named for the nearby town of Uyuni (Bolivia).  It is the largest dry lake in the world.  But not because of the size it fell into the rating "The most beautiful places on the planet."  A huge field is covered with small crystals of salt.  They shine so much in the desert sun that you can‚Äôt do without goggles.  But that is not all.  Tourists are taken to look at the salt marsh during the rainy season, which lasts in Bolivia from November to March.  Then this natural attraction again turns into a shallow lake.  But a high concentration of salt gives water the properties of a mirror.  Reflecting sky merges with the horizon.  <span>Indescribable beauty!</span> </p>

    <p>  Later, the lake is covered with salt crust.  Water erupts outward in small cone-shaped volcanoes.  The city of Uyuni is also famous for the Fishing Island (Isla de Pescadores).  In fact, this is an oasis in which eight-meter cacti grow, whose age sometimes reaches up to a thousand years.  And the coast of the salt flats is surrounded by a forest of stones.  Fancy sculptures created by rains and wind. </p><h2>  Spotted Lake Klluk </h2><p>  Three seasons a year is the most common body of water.  And only in the hot summer, the expanse and the shores of the lake turn into the most beautiful places on the planet.  This reservoir has the highest concentration of sodium, calcium, magnesium sulfate, titanium and silver in the world.  When summer heat sets in, the upper layer of water dries up.  Minerals form multi-colored islands - ‚Äúice floes‚Äù that float on the surface of the lake, and you can walk on them.  Imagine!  The color of such icebergs depends on the predominant substance.  The facility is located near the city of Osoios <span>(British Columbia),</span> in Canada, near the border with the United States. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top of the most beautiful places on the planet" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1047667.jpg" width="600"></div>  Europeans gave the reservoir the name Spotted Lake, which is a literal translation of the name given to the object by the Okanagan Indians.  For them, Kliluk is still a sacred place.  After all, the waters of the lake heal wounds.  The indigenous population bought a pond and does not allow whites to it.  You can admire the lake only from afar - from the highway.

    <h2>  Enchanted Well </h2><p>  If the Canadian lake is included in the Top 10 "Beautiful places of the planet Earth" only in the summer, then this attraction reveals its magic only for an hour and a half a day.  After all, there is an enchanted well at the bottom of an 80-meter cave.  The water in it is so clear that you can see the bottom to the smallest detail.  But the well is deep - thirty-seven meters!  At the bottom lie trees and branches that fell into the cave many years ago.  The well opens its spell from half-past ten to noon.  Then the sun's rays penetrate the cave. </p>

    <p>  As if by wave of a fairy wand, everything - a pond and the walls of an underground cavity - is illuminated by a magical sapphire light.  This phenomenal natural site is located in the Chapada Diamontina National Park in northeast Brazil.  Due to the fragility of the eco-system, access to the well is strictly regulated. </p><h2>  Marble Caves </h2><p>  And closes the list of "The most beautiful places on the planet" lake, lying on the border of Argentina and Chile.  It has three names at once.  The Argentines call him Buenos Aires, the Chileans call General Carrera, and the local tribes of the Indians call Chelenko, which means "Lake Storm."  The name is very good, because the climate here is harsh, mountainous.  But the lake is teeming with fish, especially trout and salmon.  The most beautiful and original corner is located on the Chilean side.  These are Marble Caves. </p>
