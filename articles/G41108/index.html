Place and date of execution of the Decembrists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For nearly 200 years, <span>the Decembrist uprising has</span> attracted the attention of historians.  A huge number of scientific articles and even dissertations on this topic have been written.  What explains this interest?  The thing is that historically the Decembrists in Russia were the first to dare to oppose the tsar‚Äôs power.  It is interesting that the rebels themselves began to study this phenomenon, they analyzed the causes of the uprising on Senate Square and its defeat.  As a result of the execution of the Decembrists, Russian society lost the very color of enlightened youth, because they came from noble families, glorious participants in the 1812 war.  The uprising influenced the fate of talented poets.  So, A. S Pushkin, due to communication with members of secret societies, was sent into exile. </p><h2>  Who are the Decembrists </h2><p>  Who are the Decembrists?  Briefly, they can be described as follows: they are members of several political societies fighting for the abolition of serfdom and the change of state power.  In December 1825, they organized an uprising that was brutally crushed. <br>  5 people (leaders) were put to shameful execution for officers.  The Decembrists-participants were exiled to Siberia, some were shot in the Peter and Paul Fortress. </p><h2>  Reasons for the uprising </h2><p>  Why did the Decembrists revolt?  There are several reasons for this.  The main one, which they all, as one, reproduced during interrogations in the Peter and Paul Fortress - the spirit of free thought, faith in the power of the Russian people, tired of oppression - all this was born after a brilliant victory over Napoleon.  It is no accident that 115 people from the Decembrists are participants in the Patriotic War of 1812.  Indeed, during military campaigns, liberating European countries, they never met the savagery of serfdom.  This forced them to reconsider the attitude of ‚Äúslaves and masters‚Äù to their country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="executions of the Decembrists" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/871842.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was obvious that serfdom had outlived itself.  Fighting side by side with ordinary people, communicating with them, future Decembrists came to the conclusion that people deserve a better fate than slavish existence.  The peasants also hoped that after the war their situation would change for the better, because they shed blood for the sake of their homeland.  But, unfortunately, the emperor and most nobles firmly held on to serfs.  That is why from 1814 to 1820, more than two hundred peasant uprisings erupted in the country.  The apotheosis was a rebellion against Colonel Schwartz Semenovsky Guards Regiment in 1820.  His cruelty to ordinary soldiers crossed all sorts of borders.  Activists of the Decembrist movement, Sergei Muravyov-Apostol and Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin, were witnesses of these events, as they served in this regiment. </p><p>  It should also be noted that a certain spirit of free thought was instilled in most of the participants by the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum: for example, its graduates were I. Pushchin, <span>V. Kyukhelbeker,</span> and freedom-loving poems by A. Pushkin were used as inspirational ideas. </p><h2>  Southern Decembrists Society </h2><p>  It should be understood that the Decembrist movement did not arise out of nowhere: it grew out of world revolutionary ideas.  Pavel Pestel wrote that such thoughts go ‚Äúfrom one end of Europe to Russia‚Äù, even cover such mentally opposed Turkey and England. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="executed Decembrists last names" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/872154.jpg" width="538"></div>  The ideas of Decembrism were realized through the work of secret societies.  The first of these are the Union of Salvation (Petersburg, 1816) and the Union of Welfare (1918).  The second arose on the basis of the first, was less conspiratorial and included a larger number of members.  In 1820, it was dissolved because of a divergence of views.

Southern society had more reactionary views: in order to establish a republic, they proposed killing the king.  The structure of the Southern society consisted of three departments: the first, along with P. Pestel, was headed by A. Yushnevsky, the second - S. Muravyov-Apostol, the third - V. Davydov and S. Volkonsky. </p><h2>  Pavel Ivanovich Pestel </h2><p>  The leader of the Southern Society, Pavel Ivanovich Pestel, was born in 1793 in Moscow.  He receives a brilliant education in Europe, and upon returning to Russia begins his service in the Page Corps - especially privileged among the nobles.  The pages are personally acquainted with all members of the imperial family.  Here, for the first time, the freedom-loving views of young Pestel are manifested.  Having brilliantly graduated from the Corps, he continues to serve in the Lithuanian regiment with the rank of Ensign of the Life Guard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pavel pestel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/871469.jpg" width="348"></div>

    <p>  During the war of 1812, Pestel was seriously injured.  After being cured, he returns to service, bravely fights.  By the end of the war, Pestel had many high awards, including golden <span>award weapons.</span>  After World War II, he was transferred to serve in the Cavalier Guard regiment - at that time the most prestigious duty station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  While in St. Petersburg, Pestel learns about a certain secret society <span>(Salvation Union)</span> and soon enters into it.  The revolutionary life of Paul begins.  In 1821, he led the Southern Society - in this he was helped by magnificent eloquence, a wonderful mind and the gift of persuasion.  Thanks to these qualities, at one time he achieved the unity of views of the Southern and Northern societies. </p><h2>  Pestel Constitution </h2><p>  In 1923, the Southern Society program, compiled by Pavel Pestel, was adopted.  It was unanimously adopted by all members of the association - future Decembrists.  Briefly it contained the following points: </p><ol><li>  Russia should become a republic, united and indivisible, consisting of 10 districts.  Public administration will be carried out by the People‚Äôs Council (legislatively) and the Sovereign Duma (executive). </li><li>  In resolving the issue of serfdom, Pestel proposed immediately abolishing it, dividing the land into two parts: for peasants and for landowners.  It was assumed that the latter will lease it for farming.  Researchers believe that if the reform of 1861 to abolish serfdom went according to Pestel‚Äôs plan, the country would very soon have embarked on a bourgeois, economically progressive path of development. </li><li>  The abolition of the institution of estates.  All the people of the country are called citizens, they are equally equal before the law.  Personal liberties and the inviolability of the person and home were declared. </li><li>  Tsarism was categorically not accepted by Pestel, so he demanded the physical destruction of the entire royal family. </li></ol><p>  It was assumed that "Russian Truth" would enter into force as soon as the uprising ended.  It will be the main law of the country. </p><h2>  Northern Society of Decembrists </h2><p>  Northern society begins to exist in 1821, in the spring.  Initially, it consisted of two groups, united later.  It should be noted that the first group was more radical, its members shared the views of Pestel and fully accepted his ‚ÄúRussian truth‚Äù. </p><p>  The activists of the Northern Society were <span>Nikita Muravyov</span> (leader), Kondraty Ryleev (deputy), the <span>princes Obolensky</span> and Trubetskoy.  Not the last role in the Society was played by Ivan Pushchin. </p><p>  The Northern Society operated mainly in St. Petersburg, but it also had a branch in Moscow. </p><p>  The path of unification of the Northern and Southern societies was long and very painful.  They had fundamental disagreements on some issues.  However, at a congress in 1824, it was decided to begin the process of unification in 1826.  The uprising in December 1825 destroyed these plans. </p><h2>  Nikita Mikhailovich Muravyov </h2><p>  Nikita Mikhailovich Muravyov - comes from a noble family.  Born in 1795 in St. Petersburg.  Received a wonderful education in Moscow.  The war of 1812 found him in the rank of college registrar at the Ministry of Justice.  For war, he escapes from home, makes a brilliant career during the battles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decembrists briefly" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/871476.jpg" width="210"></div>

    <p>  After World War II begins to work as part of secret societies: the Union of Salvation and the Union of Welfare.  In addition, he writes a charter for the latter.  He believes that a republican form of government should be established in the country, only a military coup can help this.  During a trip to the south he met P. Pestel.  Nevertheless, it organizes its structure - the Northern Society, but does not break ties with like-minded people, but, on the contrary, actively cooperates. </p><p>  He writes the first version of his version of the Constitution in 1821, but it did not find a response from other members of the Societies.  A little later, he will reconsider his views and will release a new program proposed by the Nordic Society. </p><h2>  Constitution of Muravyov </h2><p>  The constitution of N. Muravyov included the following positions: </p><ol><li>  Russia should become a constitutional monarchy: the legislative branch is the Supreme Duma, consisting of two chambers;  the executive is the emperor (concurrently, the supreme commander).  Separately, it was stipulated that he did not have the right to start and end the war on his own.  After a maximum of three readings, the emperor was to sign the law.  He had no right to veto; he could only postpone the signing in time. </li><li>  Upon the abolition of serfdom, the land of the landowners shall be left to the owners, and to the peasants their plots, plus 2 tithes to each house. </li><li>  The right to vote is for land owners only.  Women, nomads and non-owners were removed from him. </li><li>  Abolish the institution of estates, level them all with one name: citizen.  The judicial system is one for all. </li></ol><p>  Muravyov was aware that his version of the constitution would meet fierce resistance, and therefore foreseen its introduction with the use of weapons. </p><h2>  Preparing for the rebellion </h2><p>  The secret societies described above lasted 10 years, after which the uprising began.  It should be said that the decision on rebellion arose spontaneously. </p><p>  While in Taganrog, Alexander I dies. Due to the lack of heirs, the next emperor was to be Constantine, brother of Alexander.  The problem was that he secretly abdicated the throne at one time.  Accordingly, the board passed to the youngest brother, Nikolai.  The people were in turmoil, not knowing about renunciation.  However, Nicholas decides on December 14, 1925 to take the oath. </p><p>  The death of Alexander became the starting point for the rebels.  They understand that it‚Äôs time to act, despite the fundamental differences between the Southern and Northern societies.  They were well aware that their time to prepare well for the uprising was disastrously small, but they thought it was criminal to miss such a moment.  That is how Ivan Pushchin wrote to his lyceum friend Alexander Pushkin. </p><p>  Gathered on the night before December 14, the rebels are preparing an action plan.  It came down to the following points: </p><ol><li>  Appoint Prince Trubetskoy as commander. </li><li>  Occupy the Winter Palace and the Peter and Paul Fortress.  A. Yakubovich and A. Bulatov were appointed responsible for this. </li><li>  Lieutenant P. Kakhovsky should have killed Nikolai.  This action was to be a signal for action for the rebels. </li><li>  Carry out campaigning among the soldiers and incline them to the side of the rebels. </li><li>  Convince the Senate to swear allegiance to the emperor was entrusted to Kondraty Ryleev and Ivan Pushchin. </li></ol><p>  Unfortunately, not everyone thought of the future Decembrists.  History says that traitors from their midst reported on the impending rebellion to Nicholas, which finally convinced him to appoint the oath to the Senate on the early morning of December 14th. </p><h2>  Rebellion: how it went </h2><p>  The uprising did not follow the scenario that the rebels planned.  The Senate manages to swear allegiance to the emperor before agitation. </p>

    <p>  However, regiments of soldiers in combat order were built on Senate Square, everyone is waiting for decisive action on the part of the leadership. <br>  <span>Ivan Pushchin</span> and Kondraty Ryleyev arrive there and assure the imminent arrival of the command, Prince Trubetskoy.  The latter, having betrayed the rebels, sat in the tsarist General Staff.  He could not carry out the decisive actions that were required of him. </p><p>  As a result, the uprising was crushed. </p><h2>  Arrests and court </h2><p>  In St. Petersburg, the first arrests and executions of the Decembrists began to take place.  An interesting fact is that the trial of those arrested was not dealt with by the Senate, as expected, but by the Supreme Court specially organized by Nicholas I for this case.  The very first, even before the uprising, on December 13, Pavel Pestel was arrested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="place of execution of the Decembrists" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/384969.jpg" width="600"></div>  The fact is that shortly before the uprising, he accepted A. Mayboroda, a member of the Southern Society, who turned out to be a traitor.  Pestel is arrested in Tulchin and taken to the St. Petersburg Peter and Paul Fortress.

    <p>  Mayboroda wrote a denunciation to N. Muravyov, who was arrested on his own estate. </p><p>  Under investigation were 579 people.  120 of them were exiled to hard labor in Siberia (among them Nikita Muravyov), all were shamefully demoted to military ranks.  Five rebels were sentenced to death. </p><h2>  Execution </h2><p>  Turning to the court about a possible method of executing the Decembrists, Nikolai notes that blood should not be shed.  Thus, they, the heroes of World War II, are sentenced to shameful gallows. </p><p>  Who were the executed Decembrists?  Their names are as follows: Pavel Pestel, Pyotr Kakhovsky, Kondraty Ryleev, Sergey Muravyov-Apostol, Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin.  The verdict was read out on July 12, and hung on July 25, 1926.  The place of execution of the Decembrists was long equipped: a gallows with a special mechanism were built.  However, there were some overlays: three people fell off their hinges and had to be hung up again. </p><p>  The place in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where the Decembrists were executed - its crownwork.  There is a monument, which is an obelisk and a granite composition.  It symbolizes the courage with which the executed Decembrists fought for their ideals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="executed Decembrists last names" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/871490.jpg" width="600"></div>  Their names are carved on the monument.
