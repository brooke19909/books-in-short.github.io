    <h2>  Types of products and their main parameters </h2><p>  This element of the lambrequin is a semicircle with folds.  Swag consists of a middle, two shoulders and has a depth.

    <p>  The work at each stage may differ slightly, but in general the scheme always remains approximately the same. </p><h2>  Size calculation </h2><p>  To make swags with your own hands (patterns according to the finished template or independent constructions), you need to correctly determine all the parameters of the product.  The calculation can be carried out using equations or a drawing on a scale. </p><p>  If you are supposed to have a lambrequin (swag), you need to know: </p><ul><li>  the length of the cornice; </li><li>  half the length of the lower sag (arc of the hanging edge); </li><li>  depth, that is, the distance by which it "hangs" from the top line. </li></ul><p>  All this needs to be simply measured by a window or a scale diagram. </p><p>  If the lambrequin will consist of several swag, you will have to do some calculations.  Suppose the length of the cornice is 3.6 m, and you want to arrange 4 swags that overlap the adjacent one by 1/3.  This is the minimum intersection value.  If you do without them, you need to divide 3.6 m by 4. In the case of overlapping parts, three overlays of 1/3 occur, that is, in fact, this is the size of one swag, so the length of the cornice is divided by 3. The size of the element is 1 , 2 m. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For symmetrical swags, a pattern of half the product is built, which is superimposed on a double folded fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself swag patterns" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/687928.jpg" width="234"></div>  For asymmetric, a single workpiece is performed, but the dimensions of each part, if there are several, must be calculated in advance.

    <h2>  Scheme </h2><p>  It is worth making a rule to make sketches of future lambrequins.  This helps to choose the best option for the arrangement of elements and their proportions in accordance with the size of the window, cornice, curtains.  The scheme is best performed on a scale, for example, 1:10.  In this case, a three-meter lambrequin on paper will be 30 cm. </p><p>  If you adhere to this rule, it will not be difficult for you to find out any size of the component of the lambrequin.  To do this, you just need to measure it with a ruler or calculate the number of cells of <span>graph paper</span> and multiply by the scale value. </p><p>  You can perform all the construction on the computer in a <span>graphical editor</span> or a specialized program NanoCad, which allows you to get drawings, patterns of curtains and their components with dimensioning. </p><h2>  How to make swag without a pattern </h2><p>  Want to make a round pelmet?  DIY swabs are easy to make.  For beginners, you can offer this option: </p><ol><li>  Fold a square of light <span>tissue (organza,</span> veil) diagonally and mark the middle fold. </li><li>  Take the rail on which mark the width of the swag, the middle and the shoulders.  Hang the fabric observing an angle of forty-five degrees.  To see the center, hang a weighting compound. </li><li>  Carefully shape and secure the first fold with pins.  Make a "roller" measuring about 10-15 cm. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew swags with your own hands" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/687936.jpg" width="200"></div></li><li>  Perform all other folds, maintaining symmetry and the same distance between them. </li><li>  Cut off the excess fabric and often pin the top edge along the crease line. </li><li>  <span>Work the</span> bottom with an <span>oblique inlay</span> or in another way. </li><li>  Sew Velcro or curtain tape on top. </li></ol><p>  Getting flat folds for the first time may not be so easy, but worth the effort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to build a pattern </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to cut off a lot of excess tissue, you should use another method to sew the swags with your own hands.  Patterns will help cut the finished part and already form folds from it. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut swag with your own hands" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/687921.jpg" width="225"></div><br>  The following constructions are performed:

In the second option, you don‚Äôt have to connect anything, but you will need to spend additional money. </p><h2>  How to cut swag with your own hands </h2><p>  So, you have chosen a template or built it yourself, cut out of paper.  Now the most important thing is to correctly position the parts on the fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew swags with your own hands patterns" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/687930.jpg" width="200"></div>  This is done diagonally.

Secure both ends of the fabric with pins. </li><li>  Begin to form folds from the first from the middle, securing each with pins.  Try to get equal elements.  If necessary, you can correct the work. </li><li>  When the result suits you, trim the excess fabric from the bottom edge. </li><li>  Take a basting thread along the wide side of the folds, then along the narrow one. </li><li>  Remove the swag from the stick, cut off the excess from the top edge, leaving 2-3 cm for processing the seam. </li><li>  Process the middle and bottom of the swag with a slanting inlay. </li><li>  On the machine, go through the seams on each side of the folds. </li></ol><p>  The product is ready for assembly. </p><p>  There is another version of this jewelry - with a perpendicular shoulder.

    <p>  This element is characterized in that the folds are not collected on the cornice line, but remain arranged in a vertical <span>line perpendicular</span> to it.  The lambrequin of several such swags arranged in series looks very beautiful. </p><p>  The principle of operation corresponds to the previous one.  The difference is in the pattern of the product and the method of assembly.  Folds are formed not on a stick, but on a surface on which it is convenient to fasten their vertically arranged edges.  When they are formed, pass on both sides with a basting thread, remove from the surface and grind. </p><p>  So do with each swag, then connect them one with the other and sew them into a ready-made lambrequin. </p><p>  So, you have learned several ways in which you can make swags with your own hands.  Patterns are better to use ready-made, but it is easy to build them yourself.  Always try to perform the scheme and preliminary calculations, as well as use patterns that already have folds. </p>
