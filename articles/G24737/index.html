    <h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Victor Cherokov was born on November 10, 1907 in the territory of modern Azerbaijan, in the village of Ordubad.  The head of the Cherokoff family was a judge, and his mother a housewife.  In total, the couple had three children: Victor - the eldest.  Before the revolution, the family often moved due to the work of their father.  They spent a long time in Georgia and Poland.  In 1917, Victor‚Äôs father receives an appointment near Baku, where he goes.  But on the road he becomes ill with typhus and dies suddenly.  Without a breadwinner, the family has to move to Tiflis.  The post-war devastation, as well as the death of his father, hit the Cherokoff finances.  With three young sons, Ksenia Ivanovna is trying to literally survive.  Therefore, young Victor has to work since childhood as a porter, loader, assistant at the mill.  Despite the terrible situation of the family, the eldest son still manages to enter the Naval School. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service start </h2><p>  Studying for Victor was quite difficult, because he had a good school base.  The most difficult thing was given him the exact sciences: physics, mathematics, drawing.  But in 1930 he graduated from college with the rank of commander-driver.  He is sent to serve on the Baltic Fleet.  There, just 2 years after arrival, he becomes the division commander. </p><p>  After 6 years, Victor improves his qualifications by entering the command faculty at the Clement Voroshilov Academy.  Its completion allows you to take the position of brigade commander. </p><h2>  The beginning of World War II </h2><p>  With the outbreak of the war, Cherokova, together with his unit, is transferred to the Ivanovo rapids on the Neva.  Already in the summer of the 41st brigade conducts hostilities, supporting the defense of the Red Army with fire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Cherokee Navy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1104147.jpg"></div>  In the autumn of the same year, Cherokov was transferred to the Ladoga Flotilla.  It was created for the first time only in 1939 and covered the Soviet offensive on Finland.  After the end of the <span>Finnish war</span> , a peace treaty was concluded, according to which the USSR was obligated not to place its weapons on Lake Ladoga.

    <p>  After the start of World War II, the flotilla was restored.  It consisted mainly of mobile ships and boats, which were supposed to defend the lake and the adjacent territories.  For almost the entire 1941, the Red Army retreated under the onslaught of German troops.  The ship Cherokova supported the infantry with fire, and later evacuated the surrounded units.  In late summer, the Nazis launched an operation to destroy the Ladoga Flotilla.  For more than a month, bloody battles continued on the water and adjacent islands, the onslaught of the Germans forced them to leave their positions.  On September 10, the evacuation of fighters began.  The soldiers surrounded on Rahmansaari Island could not be evacuated.  The enemy offered to surrender, but the Red Army decided to fight to the last and died only when all the cartridges were over. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, Shlisselburg fell, and the Germans completely surrounded Leningrad.  The command demanded an urgent break through the ring.  The besieged in the city were in a desperate situation, so the operation plan was prepared in record time.  Weather conditions were not taken into account, as well as the total superiority of the enemy.  The attack on the siege troops of the Germans was supported by the Ladoga Flotilla.  But for the above reasons, it was unsuccessful.  The landing party suffered huge losses, and the ships had to retreat. </p><h2>  Leningrad blockade </h2><p>  During the siege of the city, the only supply route was Lake Ladoga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vice Admiral Cherokee" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1103550.jpg" width="600"></div>  Admiral Cherokov in his memoirs described the terrible position of the "road of life."  His flotilla delivered supplies to the city and evacuated civilians.  In severe weather conditions and under constant raids by fascist aviation, each sortie could be the last.  Nevertheless, ships delivered tons of food daily and transported hundreds of people.

    <p>  Six months later, in addition to air raids, attacks from the water began.  The Ladoga flotilla showed its resilience, having repelled many attacks by German, Finnish and Italian ships.  In January 1943, Cherokov participated in the offensive, the purpose of which was the release of Leningrad, which ended in success.  In the winter of 1944, Admiral Cherokov was awarded the <span>Order of Ushakov</span> for military merit and demonstrated qualities <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Further operations </h2><p>  In the spring and summer of 1944, an offensive against Finland began.  The Ladoga flotilla participated in the landing operation.  It had a very important goal - to seize a bridgehead on the coast, so that a further offensive could be developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="White Sea naval flotilla" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1103558.jpg" width="600"></div>  The operation was extremely successful for the Soviet fleet.  During an unexpected landing for the enemy and subsequent battles, the loss of the Navy was only 2 boats.

    <p>  After this, the flotilla surrounded the Kurland enemy group in Latvia.  Many operations were led by Admiral Cherokov.  The Navy played an important role in the heavy battles that lasted until the end of the war. </p><h2>  After the war </h2><p>  After defeating Nazi Germany, Cherokov was transferred to Arkhangelsk, where the White Sea naval flotilla was based. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="for you Leningrad" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1103559.jpg" width="400"></div>  After 10 years, Vice Admiral Cherokov retired.  He lived in Moscow and taught at the university.  Later he wrote the famous book ‚ÄúFor You, Leningrad!‚Äù, Which described in detail the heavy battles for the city.  Victor Sergeyevich died on February 21, 1995.
