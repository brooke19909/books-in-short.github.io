    <h2>  "Lazy" steam </h2><p>  So, the mop, in the common people "lazy", is nothing more than a banal T-shaped stick, on which they put on a rag designed to mop the floor.  Hands, it, of course, is more reliable and cleaner, but with the help of an old device, it is definitely easier.  And what does ‚Äústeam‚Äù mean?  This is where the highlight lies, allowing you to realize all the power and charm of progress.  Designers combined a mop and ... boiling water.  The floor is not completely washed with boiling water, of course, but with something close to this approximate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mop steam h2o mop x5" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10813/339461.jpg?1392833407460" width="327"></div>

It is in this condition that it is fed to a mop rag.  As a result, you wash the floor without the use of chemicals, and get an excellent result, since <span>hot water</span> (even if its condition at that time is very conditional) has the ability to dissolve fats and kill germs.  The properties of hot steam are fantastic.  These are exactly the characteristics of a steam mop. </p><p>  Customer reviews on this subject, however, are not so rosy.  Is it weird?  Perhaps, and yet it is.  And the reason is banal.  Those who are engaged in the promotion of new products on the market, slightly overdid the advertising PR campaign.  As a result, consumers are misled on many points. </p>

    <h2><br>  Advertising myth number 1 </h2><p>  For example, leaflets claim the ability of a device to collect spilled liquid.  However, to cope with a similar problem at the proper level can only an ordinary rag.  After all, the devices do not have a reservoir for collecting water.  Although, in fairness, I must say that steam vacuum cleaners have already appeared in the product lines of some large household appliance companies that can simultaneously remove dirt and collect the remaining liquid.  In particular, Karcher offers for sale the Karcher SV 1902 model - this is a <span>washing vacuum cleaner</span> and a steam mop.  Reviews of consumers who have tested this unit in operation are excellent: only cumbersomeness can be noted among the shortcomings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Myth number 2 </h2><p>  The next myth created by advertisers is the ability to collect dirt, wool and other garbage.  There is some truth in this statement.  Running on any surface with a damp cloth, we can collect garbage, but not all, but partially.  For example, we wipe the kitchen table after dinner with a damp cloth, but we sprinkle the crumbs that have gathered around it on our hands.  The situation is also with the device in question.  If you want to mop the floor to a shine, then you need to collect dirt and small crumbs in advance.  Then the result will be excellent.  But after the preliminary garbage collection, an ordinary mop will brilliantly cope with this task. </p><h2>  Myth number 3 </h2><p>  Exactly the same situation is with regard to spots that the unit, according to advertisers, is able to clean.  If something is spilled on the carpet that cannot stain, but only requires cleaning with a damp cloth (kefir, soup, etc.), then it will certainly help you.  But to wipe off stains from coloring liquids (tea, coffee, wine, etc.) will be very difficult. </p>

In principle, to what has been known for a long time: to believe is good, but to think is better.  Before trusting sellers, think about what you learned at school.  The banal knowledge of physics and chemistry will help you to separate the grain from the chaff.

    <h2>  Claims </h2><p>  The next complaint made by buyers to sellers is the fragility of devices.  Those who have already purchased the units claim with one voice that their appearance is too fragile.  The answer to this statement is simply indecent: demand creates supply.  As a result, a huge number of fakes appeared on the market, bribing low cost, but not meeting any standards.  Here you can give only one piece of advice: trust trusted suppliers.  And remember: avaricious pays twice! </p><h2>  Reality </h2><p>  Now consider the models that are in greatest demand.  Thanks to the telemarket, the most popular was the mop steam H2O Mop X5.  If you take the purchase appropriately, that is, do not expect from it what it is, in principle, not capable of, we can safely say that the device is an ideal combination of price, quality and design.  A stylish device that allows, if necessary, to separate the heating tank with water (steam generator) and carry out cleaning on other surfaces (for example, a sink or window sill). </p><h2>  Perfect windows and floor </h2>

White plastic windows look completely unattractive when black plaque and dirt remain in the corners and joints.  The steam generator can handle this without difficulty.  You just have to collect a dirty puddle with a dry clean rag.  Also, the unit will easily clean the windows themselves.  Without chemistry and rubbing, you can easily achieve a fantastic shine, and the H2O Mop steam mop will help you with this.

    <p>  Customer reviews analyzed by us are very diverse.  But the main reason for the appearance of unflattering comments, full of indignation and indignation, lies in the inadequate perception of the most ordinary device.  He is not capable of miracles!  Unless the mistress herself is a sorceress.  This device is compact and ideal for cleaning small rooms. </p><p>  If you have a large family, small children, and in addition shaggy pets, it is better to give preference to powerful units.  However, if all homeworkers are accustomed to keeping order, then a steam mop is ideal for easy cleaning of the apartment. </p>

Many steam generators produced by venerable manufacturers are equipped with steam mops.  Visually, this device resembles a vacuum cleaner, but it does not suck, but treats the floor with steam and rubs it with a rag.  Due to this mechanism of operation, the surface acquires an ideal appearance - without streaks and smudges.

    <h2>  Environmentally friendly and economical </h2><p>  Recall the positive points.  During the cleaning process, you do not use chemicals (they simply are not needed) - this is one time, the procedure requires a small amount of water - two.  But there is one caveat.  Despite the claims of manufacturers, plain tap water is not suitable for these units.  They very soon fail.  Use only distilled water.  Moreover, its consumption is not so great, and it can‚Äôt afford you. </p>
