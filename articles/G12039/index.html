    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This item, as a rule, causes great concern for those travelers who plan to relax in the hotel on an all-inclusive basis.  As for the Ephtalia Marine Resort, here, according to our compatriots, the food is organized at a very decent level.  So, practically round-the-clock guests have the opportunity to eat in one of the restaurants and snack bars of the hotel. </p><p>  The main restaurant is open buffet style.  The selection of dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, judging by the reviews of tourists from Russia, is very wide.  In addition, the restaurant has a children's table.  Visitors always have the opportunity to try dishes of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, snacks, fruits and vegetables, pastries, sweets.  During the day, vacationers can eat fast food and enjoy ice cream.  There are also bars serving a wide selection of drinks for every taste. </p><p>  As for restaurants, where you can order a meal on the menu (a la carte), most of our compatriots do not recommend spending time on them.  According to them, the choice of dishes here is practically no different from the main restaurant, and it takes a long time to wait for the order.  However, for a change, you can still go here once. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Hotel Eftalia Marin Resort 5 *, according to travelers, is located very close to the sea.  The beach can be reached in 5-7 minutes.  The path runs through the tunnel.  The beach here is large enough, sandy, equipped with a sufficient number of sun loungers and parasols for all vacationers.  So, according to tourists, there is no need to pre-occupy sunbeds.  There is also a bar on the beach where you can refresh yourself with a drink and a snack.  The only minus some tourists call sunset in the sea.  It is quite rocky, so you need to be careful, especially if you go swimming with children. </p>
