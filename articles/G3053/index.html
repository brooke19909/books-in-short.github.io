  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bose speakers - popular models, their pros and cons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This article will be useful to those who are looking for high-quality, but inexpensive, portable speakers for listening to music anywhere and anytime.  Below are some representatives of Bose products: medium and small speakers, suitable for both the role of a small station for the home, and for a small-sized device that is easy to take with you on a picnic or on a camping trip.  Each of the proposed products is accompanied by a description, having studied which, any reader will be able to highlight for themselves both the advantages and technical defects of the devices. </p><h2>  Bose SoundLink III </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portable bose speaker" class="if uuid-3143647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/3143647.jpg"></div><p>  Bose products have always stood out from numerous competitors due to an extremely practical approach to the manufacture of their products.  Each conditional unit produced by this company is designed not only to please customers with its appearance, but also to perform its work efficiently: sound good, work as long as possible on one battery charge, and be convenient to operate.  The SoundLink III column clearly demonstrates that in a minimalistic and simple case made in the shape of a simple rectangle, qualities that are really important for portable speakers are hidden, which significantly level the modest appearance.  If we completely ignore the appearance of the device and go to the facts, then in the end the buyer will receive: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Very reliable and practical case made of metal and high-strength plastic. </li><li>  The ability to continuously enjoy quality music for 14 hours without recharging the battery. </li><li>  Powerful speakers with excellent sound quality in all sound ranges. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="meganannblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bose mini speaker" class="if uuid-3143655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/3143655.jpg"></div><p>  However, for all its advantages, the Bose SoundLink III column has one very significant drawback - for all of the above advantages, I had to pay the weight of the device, equal to 1 kilogram 370 grams. </p><h2>  Bose SoundLink Mini </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobudi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bose speakers" class="if uuid-3143640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/3143640.jpg"></div><p>  A kind of younger brother of the above device can be considered a Bose Mini column.  The design of this representative of the Bose family can no longer be called bulky and heavy: with a weight of 670 grams, its body fits quite comfortably in the palm of an average person, and due to the rectangular geometry with rounded edges, holding the column in your hand is very convenient.  The miniature version retained the practicality and simplicity of the design, but, most importantly, it is as strong and reliable as the full-sized brothers.  All because its body is made of high-strength aluminum - the company does not save on materials and guarantees customers high quality.  Among other things, the Bose Mini column has "acquired" an extremely useful innovation - a docking station for wireless battery charging.  Simply put the column on a special stand and the charge will immediately begin.  By the way, you can charge the device directly from the power supply. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bose SoundLink Color </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sweetwater.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bose speakers" class="if uuid-3143634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/3143634.jpg"></div><p>  If someone does not like the gray tones and the heavy weight of the devices presented above, Bose has a great alternative in the form of a portable Bose SoundLink Color speaker.  In this small, flask-sized, colorful case, everything that is necessary for outdoor enthusiasts is hidden: </p><ol><li>  Thanks to the plastic case, the column weighs quite a bit. </li><li>  Because of its flat form factor, it fits comfortably in a backpack or bag and does not take up much usable space. </li><li>  The capacity of the built-in battery allows you to maintain the performance of the speaker for 8 hours. </li><li>  The process of recharging the device is carried out through a standard micro-USB cable, which allows you to charge it on the road or outside the house using a portable battery. </li></ol><p>  A functional stylish speaker will be a great addition to, say, a friendly outing on a nature or a holiday in the open air, where you simply cannot live without music. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Bose is one of the few manufacturing companies whose products are first of all qualitatively assembled, while the design is deliberately simplified in favor of reducing the cost of the technical process and expanding the functionality of the final product.  In addition, the company pleases with a variety of assortments, both within the framework of all manufactured products and in its individual directions, whether it be portable speakers, stereo and acoustic systems, radio tape recorders or headsets.  In any case, if someone needs to get something high-quality and inexpensive to listen to music, the Bose column is an excellent choice. </p>
