    <p>  Family houses, to the taste of some reviewers, are less comfortable.  But they will appeal to those who came to rest with the kids. </p><p>  Graht (economy rooms) are designed for unpretentious guests who like to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù around the territory most of the time.  Reviewers caution future guests at Orange Hotel: Do not rush to choose these rooms.  They are not much cheaper, but much less comfortable than others: they are in a damp basement under the houses, they have a small window under the ceiling. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists respond to food like this: ‚ÄúOften, a lot, pretty well, but not at all for gourmets.‚Äù </p><p>  They note the presence of queues, problems with the tables.  In addition, if the dishes run out, they will no longer be reported.  By the end of the meal, the selection of dishes is rather meager.  Cleaning the trays begins 15 minutes before the official end.  Many dishes, according to reviews, are pepper-salted. </p><p>  Vacationers testify that the hotel hosts themed dinners daily, where guests are offered to sample dishes from different countries.  Russian cuisine is usually represented by borsch and dumplings. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the "buffet" system, according to some vacationers, is far from ideal, here, tourists say, it is easy to "turn into a bun", because it is difficult to defeat the temptation to constantly chew something.  All kinds of snacks are available throughout the hotel. </p><p>  The alcohol at Orange is varied, but local, rather weak.  Maybe the authors of the reviews are thinking, it‚Äôs for the better.  At the hotel you will not see drunk anywhere. </p><p>  Free sale of alcoholic beverages: until 00.00, then only at a disco under the pool (up to 2.00), but in a more limited assortment. </p><p>  The restaurants in the hotel catered for by appointment.  The authors of the reviews note a pleasant atmosphere and service in an Italian restaurant with tables near the sea.  But the local cuisine, in the opinion of some vacationers, is ‚Äúabout nothing.‚Äù </p><h2>  About service </h2><p>  Tourists report that, despite the constant number of holidaymakers and overwork, the hotel staff regularly clean the rooms, maintains perfect cleanliness in them and on the territory. </p><p>  There is never a glitch in the cleaning of rooms, vacationers say, cleaning is done regularly, there is nothing to complain about. </p><h2>  Wellness </h2><p>  Vacationers call the spa a very pleasant one, but the prices for massage at the Orange Hotel, when compared with other places in Kemer, are considered very high. </p><p>  The indoor pool is spacious, elongated.  Some tourists note that the water in it is not always warm. </p><p>  The stones in the Turkish bath are, according to reviews, not too warm.  But there are two good saunas that support a different temperature regime and a steam room. </p><p>  They also recommend visiting two gyms. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beach and the sea are close.  The sea is very clean, but all the beaches are narrow, covered with large pebbles.  According to them, hotel guests share, it is inconvenient to walk, as pebbles cut their legs.  On the beach there is a small pier with a bar.  During the day you can buy french fries, beer and other drinks. </p><h2>  Contingent </h2><p>  Most vacationers at the Orange Hotel are Russians, many living from Kazakhstan and Ukraine.  The contingent is mainly young people whose average age is about 27 years. </p><h2>  Hotel rest </h2><p>  Vacationers celebrate the wonderful work of the hotel animators who work all day, conducting dances, sports, clowning and other entertainment. </p>

    <p>  Especially often tourists note the presence of unusually beautiful girls-dancers.  Many vacationers are unable to take their eyes off them.  But girls are strictly forbidden to flirt with guests. </p><p>  In the evenings, as expected, children's animation takes place at Orange, after which the time comes for a colorful costume dance show, and then pleasant live music sounds and a disco takes place on the pier.  Those who wish can go to sit in the cafe.  From midnight, the fun is transferred to the basement under the pool and lasts up to 2 nights, after which the audience, "left on their feet", "migrates" to the cafe.  The most persistent rest of the night can be spent at the bar at the reception. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the hotel resembles a real living anthill.  But the employees are quite capable of this. </p>
