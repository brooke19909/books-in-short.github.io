  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stages of Scientific Research</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>Scientific research</strong> is the process of studying and cognition of reality, the relationships between individual environmental phenomena and their laws.  Cognition is a complex process for the <span>consciousness of people.</span>  It, in fact, represents a movement towards more accurate and complete knowledge.  This path is possible to go through scientific research. </p><p>  In the field of applied sciences or technology, the <strong>stages of scientific research</strong> are distinguished, which must be consistently passed in the course of studying certain problems. </p><p>  Most often, seven consecutive steps are distinguished, each of which characterizes the stages of scientific research.  In a short version, the <strong>structure and stages of scientific research</strong> look like this. </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to <strong>determine the problem</strong> .  This stage consists not only in finding a problem, but in a clear and precise formulation of the research objectives, since the course and effectiveness of the entire study largely depends on it. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, it is required to collect and process the initial information, to think over methods and means of solving problems. </p><ol><li>  At the second stage, it is necessary to <strong>put forward and then justify the initial hypothesis</strong> .  Usually, the development of a hypothesis is carried out on the basis of formulated tasks and analysis of the collected initial information.  The hypothesis may have more than one option, of which then you need to choose the most appropriate.  To clarify the hypothesis of the working order, experiments are conducted that allow a more complete study of the object. </li><li>  The third stage is a <strong>theoretical study</strong> .  It consists in the synthesis and <span>analysis of the basic</span> laws that give <span>basic sciences</span> in relation to the object under study.  At this stage, there is a further extraction with the help of the apparatus of different sciences of additional, new, yet unknown laws. </li></ol><p>  <span>The goal of research</span> at the theory level is to generalize phenomena, their relationships, </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  obtaining more information to substantiate the working hypothesis. </p><ol><li>  <strong>Experimental studies</strong> continue the theoretical <span>stage.</span>  <span>An experiment</span> as an established scientific experience is the most complex and time-consuming part of the study.  Its goals may be different, because they depend on the nature of the entire study, as well as the sequence of its implementation. </li></ol><p>  In the case of the standard course and order of the study, the experimental part (experiment) is carried out after the stage of theoretical study of the problem.  In this case, the experiment, as a rule, confirms the results of theoretical hypotheses.  Sometimes after conducting an experiment, hypotheses are refuted. </p><p>  In some cases, the order of the study changes.  It happens that the third and fourth stages of <span>scientific research</span> are interchanged.  Then the experiment may precede the theoretical part.  Such a sequence is typical for exploratory research, when the theoretical basis is insufficient to advance hypotheses.  In this case, the theory is intended to generalize the results of experimental studies. </p><ol><li>  <strong>Analysis of the results</strong> and their comparison.  This stage implies the need to compare the theoretical and experimental stages of scientific research in order to finally confirm the hypothesis and further formulate conclusions and the consequences arising from it.  Sometimes the result is also negative, then the hypothesis must be rejected. </li><li>  <strong>Final conclusions</strong> .  The results are summarized, conclusions are formulated and their compliance with the original task. </li><li>  <strong>Mastering the results</strong> .  This stage is typical for technical work.  It is a preparation for the industrial implementation of the research results. </li></ol><p>  These seven steps reduce the main stages of scientific research, which must be passed from the working hypothesis to the implementation of the research results. </p>
