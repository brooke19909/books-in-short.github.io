What was the reason for such an incredible popularity of the device?  We will talk about this in this article. </p><h2>  Reasons for huge demand </h2>

    <p>  The phone at the time of the release was really unique in terms of functionality.  To potential buyers, he could offer more than competitors in the same price category.  A separate aspect was the battery of Siemens C65, which provided a good battery life.  Due to several factors, among which was the functionality previously indicated by us, the German manufacturer of mobile phones managed to secure for a long time the sales of the corresponding model at a really high level.  More specifically, the company achieved maximum efficiency from them for almost two years.  This is a very good indicator that you should pay attention to. </p><p>  Siemens C65, whose photo you can find in the article, has established itself in the mobile phone market much better than other C-series sequels.  It is, for example, about C62 or C60.  These devices are rightly considered to be nothing more than intermediate solutions that were created by engineers of the German company as prototypes.  This is how Siemens employees tried to find something that would really satisfy the needs of a larger audience.  Compared to competitors from other companies, they did not stand out in anything special, which automatically forced potential buyers to turn their backs to more noticeable devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  C65 as a means of salvation </h2>

    <p>  The model was liked by a huge number of people, there was a demand for which, most likely, the German manufacturer did not even count on.  But few people know that the Siemens S65 was a kind of <span>point of no return.</span>  In theory, only a new, perfect model could save Siemens from a decline in sales.  And that happened.  Why so? </p><p>  The thing is that the C65 has contributed to the level of sales in the budget segment.  It is interesting that the characteristics of the phone have changed a considerable number of times.  Initially, the device had only three megabytes of memory, which were allocated at the discretion of the owner of the device.  The latest feature update has raised the bar to 11 MB.  Nevertheless, only 6 megabytes are available to the user from this volume. </p><h2>  Subtotals </h2>

    <p>  So it turns out that Siemens C65, the characteristics of which are given in the article, is, so to speak, a hybrid of the two older models.  This, of course, is M65 and CX65.  Nevertheless, there are some differences that allow you to position the phone as partly an independent solution.  They are hidden in a simpler design.  By the way, the functionality of the infrared port has also been reduced in comparison with previous models.  In general, almost all changes, with the exception of memory, are negative.  The screen has become noticeably smaller, and the camera demonstrates the worst quality of images.  However, there is something in the phone that made many potential buyers cast their vote in his favor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design and appearance features </h2>

    <p>  Of course, the design is traditional for the company, and this was to be expected.  As for the materials of manufacture, the engineers and designers of the company, apparently, did not bother much.  We can say that plastic is not just inexpensive - it is precisely emphasized inexpensive.  This can be especially well observed if you examine and feel the back panel of the phone.  Perhaps, through the use of such a move, Siemens employees tried to point out the difference between the corresponding model and its closest neighbors.  But it should be said that, despite this, the model looks very, very attractive. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2>

    <p>  Her appearance pleasantly surprises the eye.  In the manufacture of used a combination of two types of plastic - glossy and matte.  It is interesting that the company managed to save on manufacturing materials, but this in no way affected the appearance and practicality of the application.  It is simply impossible to say anything definitively and unequivocally on this subject, because there are advantages and disadvantages to such a design solution.  Nevertheless, we can point out that the quality of materials is comparable to that of many similar devices of this class, and our model can only lose on this parameter except for the ‚ÄúMotorola S650‚Äù. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  There should not be any complaints about the model in this regard.  Repeatedly, experts conducted tests that showed that there is no backlash of panels, the device does not creak in the hands and does not emit extraneous sounds.  By the way, the panels can be removed.  To do this, you just need to use a small key, which can be found in the package. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  With a physical size of 28 by 28 millimeters, its resolution is 130 by 130 pixels.  In fact, this means that the user will be able to see 7 text lines on the display, as well as one service line.  With color rendering, everything is in order, the screen displays up to 65 thousand colors.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using STN technology.  In this case, we can say that in its class the phone has just an excellent screen, perhaps even the highest quality of all.  And if according to the materials of manufacture he loses to Motorola, then here by no means.  And of course, he will not yield to the older models of the company.  If the work of the screen in the room does not differ much, then in sunlight on the street the difference becomes simply enormous. </p><h2>  Display disadvantages </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the engineers of the company failed to completely get rid of all the problems associated with the screen.  Although it behaves noticeably better in the model than analogues of other companies, fading in sunlight becomes noticeable and noticeable.  Here, the size of the screen itself plays a significant role.  It is smaller than other phones, and therefore fading becomes more critical.  The engineers of the German company could not understand this, so they took certain countermeasures that allowed returning the bowl to an equilibrium state.  As such a solution, it is possible to change the contrast settings. </p><h2>  Other functions </h2><p>  The user can rummage a little more on the menu to look at other settings and opportunities which phone software provides him.  Among them there is the possibility of changing the font size.  However, for the devices of the German manufacturer, this is rather a tradition than luxury.  After increasing the contrast, the problems with fading in sunlight will disappear almost completely, and increasing the font will help to solve this problem one hundred percent.  Such a combined solution will allow you to comfortably read text from the screen in any conditions. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, what characteristics will this phone remember?  The device belongs to the middle, budget class.  It works in the cellular networks of the GSM generation.  The lithium-ion battery is rated at 600 milliamps per hour.  In this case, standby time can reach 250 hours, in continuous talk mode - 6 hours.  A screen with a resolution of 130 by 130 pixels displays about 65 thousand colors.  Dimensions in three-dimensional space: 105 (in height) by 45 (in width) by 16 (in thickness) millimeters.  Weight - 86 grams.  Program for firmware Siemens C65, which is required to download software to the device, is available on the official website of the German manufacturer. </p>
