It was specially built ten kilometers from the city so that the sound of aircraft engines does not interfere with the inhabitants.  Since then, the resort has grown and liners have become less noisy.  The airport was repeatedly reconstructed in accordance with European standards.  The last one took place in 2011, when a new terminal was opened.  Since that time, all international flights are made through it.  And if you take into account that 80 percent of all passenger traffic arriving at the resort are foreign tourists, this is a lot.  But there are only two lanes for takeoff and landing (both 3000 meters long).  Therefore, they are very busy, especially in the summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alicante how to get from the airport" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/818274.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Elche Alicante (airport): services </h2><p>  This air terminal is equipped to international standards.  If we talk about a new terminal, then there is everything that a traveler may need: comfortable waiting rooms in the common area and for passengers who have passed passport control;  cafeterias, restaurants and bars;  souvenir stalls, newsstands and, of course, duty-free shops.  There is also wireless Internet access, although for a fee (you must purchase a card with a code).  Both terminals have ATMs and currency exchange points.  You can buy or exchange tickets on the spot: air carrier branches opened their representative offices right at the airport.  The information service is available in English, Spanish and Valencia.  If arriving at Alicante airport late in the evening, travelers can spend the night in hotels near the hub, for example, in the Holiday Inn Express, Ibis Budget or other hotels.  VAT is returned after a lengthy procedure.  First you need to put a stamp on the store receipt (arrivals hall, ground floor, VAT Refund office).  Then you should go up to the second floor of the hub and find the door that says Global Exchange. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alicante airport spain" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/818252.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Elche? </h2><p>  Alicante is an airport located ten kilometers from this city.  In Valencia, the name is written as Elx, so look out for a bus with such a sign.

The fare costs one and a half euros.  Travel time is about half an hour.  City bus number 1B runs from Elche to the beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLos Arenal del Sol. </p><h2>  How to get from Alicante airport to Benidorm and other cities of Valencia? </h2><p>  Cute white cars with a green Radio Taxi Elche lettering on their side will cost you around 25 euros just for a trip to the nearest city.
