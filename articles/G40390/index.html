    <h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel is located on the Greek island, which is called Corfu.  Fortunately for numerous tourists, planes fly to this island.  Moreover, from many large cities of the Russian Federation, flights can be non-stop.  For example, from Moscow to Corfu can be reached in about three hours, and from St. Petersburg in four.  At the same time, the cost of a flight from the capital of Russia will be about three hundred dollars per person.  Upon arrival at the island's airport, you can reach the hotel by bus or taxi.  Taxi is a more comfortable option, and when you consider that the distance from the airport to the hotel is only 5 km, then it is not too expensive in relation to a bus trip.  You can also use the paid service called transfer, which is provided by the Oasis Corfu Hotel 3 * (Corfu island, Perama). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oasis corfu hotel 3 about corfu perama" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621588.jpg" width="600"></div>
