How many slides in the Saratov "Limkor"?  Based on reviews and photos, there are only two for adults and one for children.  The first is called "Kamikaze."  A straight and steep descent from this yellow slide causes an adrenaline rush.  Children are allowed on it, but only accompanied by adults.  The second slide is called the Black Hole.  It is a dashingly twisted blue pipe through which a skater in complete darkness slides into a 1.8 meter deep pool.  Water park "Limkor" (Saratov) is two-level.  On the second floor there is a zone for children.  It consists of a pool 60 centimeters deep and a small slide, on which even the most timid kids will not be afraid to go down.  Recall that the water in the pools is very warm.  The temperature is maintained there all year round + 26-29 degrees.  Water park indoor.  Therefore, the air temperature is also approaching + 30. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park limkor saratov reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1941825.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  All the water in the Limkor water park (Saratov) passes through a chlorinated purification system, which is helped by bactericidal lamps.  Before going to the pools and slides, the visitor must wash in the shower.  The water park also has comfortable locker rooms designed for men and women.  Reviews claim that they are clean and warm.  But on weekends, when the complex is crowded, there can be a crush in the locker rooms.  For storage of values ​​special lockers-safes are provided.  Visitors put their clothes in personal lockable cells.  Guests who visited here in winter complain that such a cabinet, alas, is not able to accommodate a fur coat, boots and hat.  Safety on slides and in pools is vigilantly watched by rescuers.  In the water park, nurses are constantly on duty, who can provide emergency assistance in the event of a fall and other incidents.  But, reviews say, the floors near the pools are convex, imitated under pebbles.  This complements the feeling of relaxation on the seashore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquapack limkor saratov price schedule" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1941818.jpg" width="600"></div>

Visitors dedicate their reviews to its relaxation area.  It includes two Jacuzzis, where the water temperature is always maintained at + 38 ° C, a sharko shower, a pool with hydromassage and a counter-current, three Finnish saunas and two Turkish hammams.  You can have a meal in a cafe on the second level of the water park.  If the children don’t feel like splashing around anymore, they can conquer the “iceberg rock” by discovering the skills of a climber. </p><h2>  Water park "Limkor" (Saratov): schedule, prices </h2><p>  The sports complex works seven days a week.  Nevertheless, the water park is closed for cleaning pools and grounds, as well as for the prevention of night rides.  The last visitors are asked to leave at ten in the evening.  And already from ten in the morning the water park opens its doors again.  What is the cost of admission to the water park "Limkor" (Saratov).  Visitors call the prices too high.  A regular adult ticket on weekdays costs (for August 2017) 1,200 rubles, and on weekends - 1,300. Children from four to six years of age pay 600 and 650 rubles each.  respectively.  But, knowledgeable people say, you can buy a ticket to Limkor at half price.  If you have a birthday, grab a document proving this.  From time to time, coupons can be purchased at the water park website.  With them, the ticket also costs half the price.  But what visitors did not like at the water park was their attitude towards people with disabilities.  On the one hand, there is a discount for them.  On the other hand, the rules stipulate that people who have “clearly visible injuries that can cause fright or injure the psyche of the bulk of visitors will be denied access to the water park.”  Surprisingly, no one has yet filed a lawsuit against such discrimination against persons with disabilities. </p>
