More often it is simply called Frankfurt.  The city is located on the banks of the River Main, where for a long time there was a crossing (Furt).  Once upon a time, these lands were inhabited by Franks.  And so the name of this city happened - the crossing of the Franks on the River Main. </p><p>  Today we take a virtual trip and explore Frankfurt and the surrounding area.  The sights of this ancient city will certainly interest you, and you might want to see them with your own eyes. </p>

    <p>  And nature lovers can enjoy the beauty of the city forest, breathe in the cleanest air and completely escape from the hustle and bustle of the modern city. </p><h2>  An airport </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists begin exploring this city from the airport.  Nor will we break this tradition. </p><p>  The size of all guests arriving in the city, airport is impressive.  Frankfurt has the third (in terms of passenger flow) hub in Europe.  He only gives way to the airports of Heathrow (London) and Charles de Gaulle (Paris).  Frankfurt International Airport, passing over fifty three million annually, is ahead of the capital, located in Berlin. </p><p>  In terms of cargo transportation, it can be considered second after Charles de Gaulle Airport.  This air harbor has several names.  But officially it is called the Rhine-Main Airport.  He has a double.  It is a more modest sized <span>Frankfurt-Hahn Airport.</span> </p>

Many tourists are interested in the history of this German city.  That is why they go first of all to the Alt-Sachsenhausen quarter, however, and many sightseeing routes in the city begin from this place. </p><p>  The name of this area translates as "Old Saxon houses".  Cozy narrow streets, small villas and fairs on Saturdays - all this is to the liking of conservative Germans.  This area is also popular because there are many pubs, taverns, restaurants serving all famous beers, and for starters, of course, the famous <span>German sausages,</span> shanks with sauerkraut. </p>

    <p>  I must say that the Germans are not too picky in their gastronomic predilections, however, they honor traditions that apply not only to beer, but also to cider.  Locals call it a golden elixir, and the apples from which it is prepared are royal.  To understand and appreciate the culture of drinking this delicious drink, it is better to come here in early August.  At this time, a fun and colorful Cider Festival takes place here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Roemer Square </h2><p>  Frankfurt's most beautiful square got its name in honor of a building in which Italian merchants stayed in ancient times.  The Roemer Square is decorated with magnificent half-timbered houses (XVI century).  Here is the town hall with three exquisite Gothic facades.  They are decorated with statues of emperors Charles IV, Maximillian II, Ludwig II, Frederick Barbarossa.  The center of the square is a symbol of the city - a statue of the goddess of justice. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  The historic sights of Frankfurt amaze with their grandeur.  The cathedral is dedicated to Emperor Karl the Great and St. Bartholomew.  It was laid in the 9th century.  In this unique building, the emperors of Germany were elected according to the laws of the <span>Golden Bull,</span> it was here that they were crowned in the period from 1562 to 1792. </p><p>  The cathedral has preserved priceless masterpieces of art dating back to the Gothic period.  For example, the altar "Sleeping Mary" (XV century.).  In the gallery today are genuine benches of the XIV century and amazing frescoes, which experts attribute to the middle of the XV century, depicting scenes from the life of St. Bartholomew.  Climbing 328 steps up, you can admire the picturesque panorama of the city.  Like many of Frankfurt's sights, the cathedral was restored in 1994.  The works were dedicated to the 1200th anniversary of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Church of St. Justin </h2><p>  The oldest building in the city is located in the Hoechst district.  The basilica is one of the oldest in Germany.  St. Justin's Church was built in 850.  In the Middle Ages, it was expanded by adding Gothic choirs, an altar and side chapels.  A little later it was painted with murals depicting Christ and the scene of the crucifixion.  In different historical periods, the temple was supplemented with new elements of decoration: the Empire Chair of 1812, wooden figures of saints, a baroque cross. </p><p>  In the appearance of this church, elements of Carolingian architecture are clearly visible: arches, Corinthian capitals of arcades, nave.  Behind the church is a magnificent garden with flowers and various medicinal herbs. </p>

    <h2>  Europaturm </h2><p>  This is a modern landmark of the city.  The tower is located on Ginnheimer Stadtweg, four kilometers from the Imperial Cathedral.  Its height is 337.5 meters.  Locals rarely call it a tower.  They prefer the second name - ‚ÄúGinheim Asparagus‚Äù.  It also indicates the quarter where it is located - Ginnheim. </p><p>  The tower began to be built in 1974.  The well-known German architect Johannes Morla led the work.  Five years later, it was put into operation.  At that time, the height of the tower was 331 meters, and it was the highest in Germany.  After the <span>fall of the Berlin Wall</span> (1990), this status was transferred to the <span>Berlin TV tower.</span> </p><p>  The foundation of the structure lies at a depth of 18 meters, at the foot the diameter of the tower is 20 meters, to the top it decreases and is already 11 meters at the upper gallery.  In 2004, after the introduction of digital satellite television broadcasting, the antenna was replaced, which increased the structure in height.  This was done using a helicopter.  Since the antenna weighed more than six tons, the work was carried out in four stages. </p><h2>  Museum of Natural History </h2><p>  It will be interesting to visit both adult guests of the city and young travelers.  The Senckenberg Museum is located in the vicinity of Frankfurt.  Today it is the largest institution engaged in research and teaching activities.  On its territory with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout six thousand square meters, the most complete collection of interesting exhibits in Germany that tells about the appearance of life on Earth is collected. </p>

    <p>  The Museum of Natural History boasts a huge number of dinosaurs and other inhabitants of our planet that have disappeared now.  One of them is placed on the emblem of the museum.  The collection of ancient animals of huge sizes is considered the largest in Europe.  In it you can see the 18-meter skeleton of the diplodocus - this is the largest exhibit of the museum. </p><p>  The order of several thousand insects totals the department of this species.  And in the exposition of birds there are about two thousand stuffed animals. </p><h2>  Buildings of the New and Old Opera </h2><p>  These sights of Frankfurt occupy a special place in the life of the city.  The old building was built in 1880.  The author of the project was Richard Luke, but during the Second World War it was completely destroyed and until the end of the seventies of the last century the locals sadly called it ‚ÄúThe Beautiful Ruins of Germany‚Äù.  In the early eighties of the last century, the building was restored, and within its walls classical music again sounded.  Today opera performances are held, as a rule, in the building of the New Opera, and in the old building there are only festive concerts. </p>

    <h2>  Goethe House and Museum </h2><p>  This is the main object of the city associated with the name of the great master.  In 1749, a poet was born in this house.  Goethe spent his childhood and youth there (until 1765).  Four-storey house, made in the late Baroque style. </p><p>  During the war (1945), the building was destroyed, but by 1951 it was rebuilt, recreating the furnishings of middle-class houses of 18th-century Frankfurt residents.  Next to the house is the Goethe Museum.  This is a small art gallery that is dedicated to German-speaking artists who created during the time of Goethe. </p>

    <h2>  Palmengarten </h2><p>  The Frankfurt Palm Garden was opened in 1868.  Today it is a huge botanical garden, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout twenty-two hectares.  On its territory there are greenhouses, a lake with bamboo thickets that resembles the landscapes of China, an alpine hill rises in the neighborhood, gardens with trees, shrubs and grasses are laid out.  The palm garden in Frankfurt is famous for its abundance of flowers.  They delight with magnificent flowering and aromas almost all year round.  As soon as one variety fades, a new one is planted in its place, which pleases guests with a riot of colors. </p>
