    <h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  The future Chinese dictator Yuan Shikai was born in 1959 in the village of Zhanjun, located in Chenzhou (Henan) Prefecture, in a family of hereditary military men.  His parents were fairly wealthy people, so they gave their son a decent Confucian education.  At the same time, he did not show much zeal in his studies, but he was fond of horse riding and traditional martial arts.  As a result, Yuan Shikai twice failed to pass the imperial exam and decided to become a soldier, hoping to at least make a career like that, especially since there were many famous military leaders among his clan members. </p><h2>  Military career </h2><p>  At the end of the 1870s, Yuan Shikai joined the Anhui army, commanded by commander Li Hongzhang, and was seconded to Korea as part of it.  There he managed to show his talent as an organizer, which did not go unnoticed.  As a result, Shikai was appointed envoy of the <span>Chinese emperor</span> in Seoul, but in fact he headed the local government, which, along with other factors, caused concern for Japan.  The outbreak of the war led to the defeat of the Qing Empire, which had to think about how to modernize its armed forces.  General Yuan Shikai was appointed to lead the creation of the new Beiyang army on the German model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the death of Li Hongzhang in 1901, he also received the post of governor of Zhili.  This was followed by other appointments made by the Dowager <span>Empress Cixi,</span> who only strengthened the position of Shikai. </p><h2>  Participation in reforms </h2><p>  During the first decade of the 20th century, Yuan Shikai played an active role in almost all the reforms carried out in the camp, including the creation of the Ministries of Education and the Police.  He achieved such power that in 1908 the Dowager Empress, anticipating her imminent death, ordered the general to be executed.  However, the future dictator acted extremely wisely: he transferred all his powers to the newly appointed regent - the underage emperor Pu Yi - and left for voluntary exile in his native village. </p>

    <h2>  Presidential election </h2><p>  In 1911, an anti-government uprising broke out in many regions of the country.  To suppress it, Yuan Shikai needed help.  He was called to the capital and appointed prime minister.  During this period, chaos reigned in the country, and every day more and more provinces passed under the power of Republicans.  Yuan Shikai quickly orientated and began to play a double game.  As a result, he agreed on the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty, which he served for many years, and was elected the first president of Republican China.  A special coin was immediately issued.  Yuan Shikai on it was proclaimed the founder of the republic, although it was not one.  The politician did not stop there, as his plans included the creation of a new dynasty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  China during the presidency of Yuan Shikai </h2><p>  In 1915, the <span>Republic of China</span> was the scene of the struggle of the great powers and leaders of the local clans, who sought to snatch a bigger piece for themselves.  Then Yuan Shikai, whose biography is a story of a constant ascent to ever new political heights, decided to become the sole ruler of China.  To do this, he dissolved the National Assembly and proclaimed himself the president for life.  Shikai then proceeded to create the Chinese Empire. </p><p>  Although his goals were very good, and he proclaimed his goal to achieve peace and stability, the situation of the people under his rule deteriorated even more than during the Qing Dynasty.  As a result, uprisings broke out again in the regions. </p><p>  The indignation of the Chinese reached its limit when Yuan Shikai convened a popular assembly, which invited him to become emperor and establish a new dynasty.  The dictator at first modestly refused, but then generously agreed to ‚Äúyield‚Äù to the request of the Chinese people. </p>

    <h2>  The end of the dictatorship </h2><p>  It soon turned out that Yuan Shikai‚Äôs policies only worsened the state of affairs in the country.  It was extremely unpopular among the Chinese, since the new "emperor" generously distributed state lands to his relatives, allowed her to plunder the treasury and destroyed dissidents.  In addition, the dictator tried to get closer to foreign monarchs and even arrange the marriage of his daughter with the deposed emperor Pu I. </p><p>  Feeling that he would not succeed in retaining power as a monarch, on March 22, 1916, Yuan Shikai announced the abolition of the monarchy and that he again took the post of president for life. </p><p>  The dictator died on June 6, 1916 from uremia.  His death plunged the country into even greater chaos, culminating in the unification of the Celestial Empire under the auspices of the Kuomintang party. </p>

    <h2>  A trace in numismatics </h2><p>  For a short period of his reign, the dictator managed to issue banknotes with his image.  He ordered the creation of stamps to the Italian Luigi Giorgi.  Soon the first coin was minted.  Yuan Shikai on it was depicted in full military robes in a European manner.  Its face value was equal to one dollar.  The material used was gold, silver and copper (trial versions).  Moreover, the coins of the first type were rather souvenir ones.  They were dedicated to the foundation of the republic and were intended for presentation purposes. </p><p>  At the end of 1914, silver coins with a face value of 1 yuan (dollar), as well as 10, 20 and 50 jiao (cents) came into circulation.  In Tianjin, 5 yuan of gold were also minted.  On the reverse of this coin, a dragon was depicted.  It is interesting that the Chinese immediately dubbed the new coins ‚Äúfat heads‚Äù, since the ‚Äúemperor‚Äù was a rather obese person.  The weight of coins with a face value of 1 dollar was 26.7-26.9 grams, so gold options are a priori very expensive. </p>

    <p>  Now you know who Yuan Shikai was.  The "Dollar" (China) of his reign is a welcome acquisition for collectors.  However, today there are many cases where, under the guise of originals, they tried to sell skillful fakes. </p>
