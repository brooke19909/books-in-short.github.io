    <p>  However, there are still many nuances regarding the distribution of the 4G signal in Russia, which companies have yet to solve.  In this article, we will talk in more detail about where (at the time of writing), the Internet is available in LTE format, what is its speed, how you can connect this service, and what tariffs the operator offers its customers. </p><h2>  Briefly about 4G </h2><p>  First of all, we‚Äôll talk in more detail about what fourth-generation communication is and what features the LTE connection format has. </p><p>  So, as we know, there are 2G, 3G and 4G Internet.  These formats were named after the word generation, which translates from English as ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù.  Now it becomes clear why the wireless Internet transmitted via mobile communications is called second, third or fourth generation networks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the quantitative identifier, it is easy to guess how the mobile Internet evolved.  If at first there was a GPRS-format, which still worked on old Siemens and Nokia phones with a keyboard, then a bit later smartphones with 2G appeared.  Of course, this type of connection was considered revolutionary because of its speed and the ability to exchange large amounts of data. </p>

    <p>  This was followed by 3G, which became even faster.  If in the second generation networks the user has the opportunity to exchange messages by mail and on social networks, browse websites and do other similar work, then with 3G you can download media files, listen to music and watch movies. </p><p>  LTE, or 4G-network, has even greater capabilities, because it makes it possible to download multimedia content even faster.  In terms of access speed, it can be compared with the home Internet (at least if it provides Beeline 4G network). </p><h2>  Devices </h2><p>  Since 4G belongs to the category of mobile Internet, it is easy to guess that it interacts primarily with portable gadgets, such as tablets and smartphones.  In addition, you can use LTE-Internet using stationary computers and laptops.  True, this requires a special, developed by <span>Beeline</span> <span>4G modem.</span>  Tariffs applicable to services provided for a stationary PC are slightly different from mobile ones.  However, more on that later.  We will only say that the package of services provided for a PC is larger, which means a little more expensive than the same service intended for a portable gadget. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, we can confidently say that the list of devices capable of receiving an LTE signal is quite extensive (or even unlimited). </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  What are the conditions for using the Internet in a 4G connection format?  Beeline has developed several fixed-cost service packages.  This is done so that the client can independently determine how much data he would like to order and how much in the end he is willing to pay for their use. </p><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that all packages are divided into two groups - those that include only the amount of Internet traffic (they are designed for tablet computers, as well as USB modems for desktop PCs), and those that are bundled along with mobile communications.  In particular, they are called "All for ...", and by connecting them, the subscriber can count on a range of services from Beeline (4G). </p><p>  The price of a package depends primarily on the amount of data, as well as on the capabilities that the subscriber receives.  Below we present the characteristics of each of the indicated packages. </p><h2>  "All for 200" </h2><p>  Let's start with the most basic and affordable tariff, which combines both mobile services and portable Internet.  So, as the name implies, the cost of the package is 200 rubles per month.  No additional fees for connecting the service or its service will be charged.  This is the final payment, which allows you to use the option. </p>

    <p>  The amount of data that is offered to the subscriber is 1 GB.  In principle, for the inactive user of a smartphone this traffic will be enough for communication on social networks, work with mail and, possibly, an irregular search for information in Google.  Of course, you need to clarify that for the operation of the service you need a <span>4G smartphone.</span> </p><p>  Beeline, within the framework of this tariff, also offers unlimited calls within the network, as well as special tariffing of other services.  Since this does not concern the main topic of our article, we will not go into details. </p><h2>  Other "All for ..." </h2><p>  In addition to the package for 200 rubles, the operator also has kits for 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2700 rubles.  They, in fact, are similar to the basic option, with the exception of the amount of data allocated. </p><p>  In particular, for 400 rubles the user receives not 1, but 2 GB per month, additional minutes and SMS messages for free (in a fixed amount).  For 600, the operator provides 5 GB per month (there will be enough traffic for smartphone owners who periodically go to online games and like to listen to music from the Internet).  The ‚ÄúAll for 900‚Äù tariff will give you the opportunity to get 7 GB on a prepaid basis, and 12 GB on your smartphone on a post-pay basis (this is enough even for fans of TV shows). </p><p>  Finally, packages for 1,500 and 2,700 rubles offer the user 10/20 and 15/30 GB for post- and prepayment, respectively.  Of course, they require a 4G smartphone (Beeline provides an additional package of messages and minutes to talk). </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  In order to activate one of the mentioned tariffs, you need to log in to the 4G service‚Äôs Internet service cabinet (Beeline has developed a separate menu for its users).  You can also call the phone number listed on the tariff description page (it includes a unique identifier with which you can automatically, following the instructions of the robot, order the appropriate service).  Finally, you can always contact the sales department. </p><h2>  Internet forever + Highway </h2><p>  An alternative line of tariff plans is the Internet forever service in conjunction with Highway. </p><p>  Where there is a 4G coverage zone, Beeline offers tablet owners a free traffic package of 200 megabytes.  In addition to it, the user is obliged to take the "Highway" service for 4, 8, 12 or 20 GB.  As you can see, the data packets for the Internet on a tablet device are larger than those that are intended for spending by a smartphone.  And this is logical, because on the tablet, subscribers tend to spend much more traffic. </p>

    <p>  The cost of packages varies from 400 to 1200 rubles per month.  As you can see, this is an order of magnitude cheaper than the "All for ..." plans, since mobile communications are not provided here. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Service activation is carried out by the same method as described above.  That is, the subscriber is given the opportunity to contact the operator and ask him to connect the tariff he likes in manual mode (note that you need to call from the SIM card to which you want to activate the option, so you have to remove it from the tablet).  You can also activate the service on the Internet using your personal account or by sending a short request with the combination indicated on the package description page. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  A very important role in the quality of the services provided is how widespread 4G coverage is.  Beeline, according to reports on the official website, is trying to maximize the area in which the Internet signal is available in the format of fourth-generation networks.  However, even a person far from telecommunications, it is clear that this is far from simple.  The company is forced to constantly invest new money so that more and more residents of remote regions can use high-speed Internet. </p>

    <p>  Although not as fast as we would like, but still the 4G zone is gradually increasing.  Beeline only connected the largest cities to its LTE network, while smaller settlements are forced to be content with 3G Internet, or even a slow 2G.  Alas, nothing can be done with this.  Our country has too much area for one mobile operator to provide a sufficiently strong signal on it. </p><h2>  Check Beeline 4G coverage </h2><p>  For greater convenience of subscribers' work with services, the company has developed a special Internet service.  It is presented in the form of a map of Russia, on which territories under the signal of different connection formats are indicated, including: 4G, WiFi.  Beeline, as you know, creates its own network of fixed Internet transmitters on the streets so that its subscribers can use the services of wireless access for free or at a moderate cost. </p><p>  Authorization is performed using a mobile phone, and deductions for working with the service are carried out from the subscriber‚Äôs account.  As for informing users, on the mentioned map everyone can find out where the nearest coverage area is.  4G "Beeline", of course, also detailed on it.  Here you can also find the addresses of service centers and stores of the company. </p><h2>  Signal distribution </h2><p>  Some LTE Internet subscribers take advantage of the services of an operator in order to provide their other devices with access to the network.  In particular, this also applies to stationary devices (laptop or personal computer, consisting of a system unit and a monitor).  This is done when you have a 4G WiFi Beeline router. </p><p>  You can buy it in the salons of communication - there will be no problems with this.  At the same time, such a device with a USB output can be connected to a computer with any operating system without the need to make additional settings.  Everything is simple and easy - plug the Beeline (4G) router into the USB hole, and high-speed Internet at a reasonable price appears on your PC.  With it, you can perform work tasks on your device without having to think about whether you will find another WiFi point or not. </p>

    <p>  In addition, there is no need to pull extra wires to connect to the network.  The signal acts everywhere, wherever you are (provided, of course, that there is a 4G coverage area).  <span>Beeline WiFi router,</span> in addition, provides its owners with high speed signal transmission.  Customer reviews indicate that with a good signal level on a computer, you can watch a movie or download a video, chat on Skype, and more.  There is even the opportunity to enjoy online games (connection allows you to do this). </p><p>  You can purchase a Beeline 4G router in a specialized store, which is also available for visitors to the company's official website.  Difficulties in buying a device should not arise. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Finally, in addition to praise and listing the merits of the services from the "yellow-black", it is time to provide you with some feedback from subscribers.  It is desirable, of course, to identify negative ones in order to find flaws in the Beeline service.  This is what we did. </p><p>  Most of the feedback given by users can be described as positive - people are satisfied with the signal strength, the cost of services, various ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù from the operator in the form of promotions and special offers.  However, there are also dissatisfied subscribers who are not happy with a number of points.  Someone complains, for example, of a faulty statistics system.  Like, the allocated amount of data (say, a package of 10 GB) can disappear without a trace, even if you completely disconnect all devices from the Internet. </p>

    <p>  The second common complaint is advertising reviews.  Subscribers note that the company that supplies the Internet too often and intensively displays its sponsorship videos on the screen of a tablet or laptop.  This is annoying, but getting rid of intrusive materials is impossible. </p><p>  Subscribers also note that when switching to a more expensive tariff plan, the connection speed remains the same, although money is debited in large volumes. </p>
