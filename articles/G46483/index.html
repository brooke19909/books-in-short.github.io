But if you first decided to get down to business, then you need to practice in advance.  Now many are interested in what kind of art it is, how and from what modules are made, how to assemble them together to give a shape a certain shape. </p><p>  In the article we will tell you in detail how to do this craft step by step.  These photos will tell you the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich snowman is better to make, how to decorate it so that the character looks festive and really becomes a decoration of the room. </p><h2>  How to make modules </h2><p>  To find out how the origami of a snowman is created, let's figure out how to make the modules themselves, because without them you won‚Äôt succeed.  If you decide to practice, then take a plain white paper for an A4 printer.  It needs to be folded in half until a small rectangle of the size you need is formed, and then cut all the folds with scissors.  Get a lot of blanks.  The next step is the painstaking work of folding them into modules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an origami module" class="if uuid-2681770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2681770.jpg"></div><p>  For an origami snowman, you need at least 1000 pieces, so it is better to prepare the modules in advance and put them in a box.  How to make them is clearly visible in the diagram in the photo above.  The rectangle bends in length in half, then folds in width in half.  Then lower the side corners down so that they meet in the middle of the side.  Bottom should be the opening edges.  Turn the work over to the back side and the triangular corners are bent on the hanging parts from one and the other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then you need to lift the resulting inverted trapezoid up and carefully smooth all the folds with your hand.  It remains to fold the module in half so that the pockets are on the outside.  Other modules will be inserted into these holes to form the desired part.  If you learn how to make figures and assemble modules among themselves in different ways, then you can spend money and purchase thick origami paper in the stationery store.  The snowman will turn out to be more voluminous and larger, and the details will go a little less. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  So, the modules are prepared, you can start connecting them together.  Next, step by step, consider how to make a snowman out of paper.  To do this, you need to be able to connect the modules.  How this is done can be seen in the photo below.  We take two modules and assign them to each other with the back sides.  The right angle of the triangles should lie on the surface of the table.  The third module connects them together.  To do this, insert the corners of the first row lying next to each other in the pockets of the third module.  The remaining two corners will look away and for the time being remain out of work.  It turns out that two rows are laid out right away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assembly diagram of parts together" class="if uuid-2681772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2681772.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we add another module to the first row, inserting its corner into the pockets of the third part protruding towards the side, located in the second row.  Thus, a long line of two rows is built.  You can raise the workpiece one more row up for better fastening.  The principle is the same everywhere.  When you get a long strip of modules connected together, the workpiece is gently bent until a circle is formed.  The edges are connected by another second row module. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then the snowman‚Äôs blank of paper is flipped so that the corners stick up.  You need to act carefully so as not to ruin the structure.  You need to put on the modules deeper, then the workpiece will keep its shape well. </p><h2>  Rising up </h2><p>  A voluminous paper snowman can consist of two or three balls.  If you put the models on top of each other in a circle, you get just a tall cylindrical pipe.  But we need the figure to first increase in size and then decrease, then visually it will seem that the snowman really consists of balls attached to one another. </p><p>  How to do it?  In each next row, the number of modules increases by 1 piece.  This additional module is simply inserted between the parts of the underlying row, and the next row is already lined up in more corners.  Then the action is repeated, and another module is inserted, thereby expanding the ball.  When the desired size is reached, then the reduction in the number of parts begins.  In each next row, one module is skipped.  So do 2 or 3 rows to highlight the bottleneck between the balls.  The next ball is performed similarly. </p><h2>  How to decorate a snowman origami for children </h2><p>  For the figure of the resulting character you need to make a hat.  It can be an ordinary bucket assembled from modules of a different, contrasting color.  You can attach a cylinder hat made of colored paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bulk paper snowman" class="if uuid-2681692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2681692.jpg"></div><p>  In a narrow place between the balls, tie a thin satin ribbon of bright color.  It remains to add small details: hands, nose, mouth and eyes.  You can make eyebrows, as in the photo of a modular origami snowman above.  Details are cut out of paper and fixed with PVA glue.  The nose is made of a cut out circle, rolled up in radius by a tube.  Trim the bell with scissors and also attach to the "face" of the character. </p><h2>  Snowman in a hat with a pompom </h2><p>  After making the main figure of the snowman, they collect a hat from modules of light and dark green colors, make a row of contrasting orange paper between them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman in a hat with a pompom" class="if uuid-2681763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2681763.jpg"></div><p>  The scarf is cut out of red felt sheet.  At the edges, cut the "noodles" with scissors, as on this product.  You can decorate it with purchased snowflakes made of paper or foil.  Everything is perfectly glued on felt.  The remaining parts are made by felting.  If you are unfamiliar with this method of needlework, you can replace them with paper or make from knitting threads. </p><h2>  Multi-colored snowman </h2><p>  In order not to think about what to make additional elements from, you can create them with modules of a different color.  Already when building rows, consider where to insert the black modules for buttons on the lower ball. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to assemble a snowman from modules" class="if uuid-2681699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2681699.jpg"></div><p>  At the top, place a black mouth of several adjacent reinforced modules.  In the center, through 2 rows, insert nose modules of red or orange color, through 1 row symmetrically insert the black details for the image of the eyes.  The hat is made in the same way as a bulk snowman made of paper. </p><p>  Let's look at how to collect "bagels" around the neck and hats of our character.  This is done simply.  The modules are fully inserted into each other, that is, two corners of one are inserted into both pockets of the other.  It turns out a long "sausage", which is carefully wrapped around the snowman's neck and connect the beginning and end of the workpiece together. </p><p>  Try your hand.  As you can see, making origami is not difficult, but very exciting.  If you decide to try to collect the figure of one character, then after working on it, immediately take on something else.  Happy creative endeavors! </p>
