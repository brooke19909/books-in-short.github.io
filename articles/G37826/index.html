    <p>  2-seater deluxe rooms cost about the same - 150-160 thousand rubles for 2 weeks.  The conditions are similar, except that a terrace with sea views is added. </p><h2>  Family rooms </h2><p>  Now a few words about the rooms of the Port Nature Luxury Resort Hotel Spa 5 * (Turkey), designed for three or more guests.  So, 3-bed apartments with sea views for two weeks will cost 224,000 rubles.  Of the conditions - a balcony with a beautiful sea view, minibar, kettle, flat-screen TV, shower, hairdryer, bathrobe, wake-up service, bathroom ... Basically, the conditions are the same as in standard apartments, or in deluxe. </p><p>  Family rooms (4 beds) will cost approximately 282,000 for 2 weeks.  These apartments usually have 2 large double beds.  Also, guests wishing to book this option may be offered connecting rooms. </p><p>  In principle, the only difference between the apartments is the number of places and the design.  But all rooms look cozy, expensive and beautiful. </p><h2>  Important information </h2><p>  When booking a room, you should know that, in accordance with the laws established and adopted by the local authorities, people who have not reached the age of 18 are not provided with alcohol - so if a person looks younger than his adult age, it is always advisable to have some some sort of identity card. </p><p>  Late check-out and early check-in may be paid - no need to be surprised.  Water slides, like the pier, can be closed due to bad weather conditions.  Smoking in accordance with Turkish law is prohibited indoors.  And if parents go to the water park with their children, then they should remember that the kids should always be accompanied by adults. </p><p>  The hotel has a good reputation, and all of the above conditions are a guarantee of safety and good relaxation for guests. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and comments about the placement </h2><p>  And now a few words about what Port Nature Luxury Resort Hotel Spa 5 * reviews leave about the hotel.  Tourists at this hotel are satisfied with a lot - and positive comments are direct confirmation of this.  Firstly, chic rooms.  Comfortable, with modern new furniture, everything is beautifully decorated, cozy - so that I did not even want to leave the apartment. </p><p>  They cleaned the rooms regularly, and not superficially, but honestly.  Visitors claim that the best option for those who like to take a nap and sleep well at night will be the apartments in the fourth, third and second buildings.  All because they are further from the pool.  And there it is constantly noisy - animation staff is working, entertaining the children.  By the way, guests also mention this.  In particular, those who visited the resort with children.  They say that a kids' club is something amazing, the children are satisfied, they certainly do not have to be bored in these places.  And babysitting is a separate issue.  People who want to relax, but cannot go on vacation without children for any reason, should not worry about their peace.  Nannies are real professionals who will take care of children at a time while adults will rest. </p>
