  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legalization of real estate or what is a real estate cadastre?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To date, registration of real estate in the state cadastral register for Russian citizens is an optional procedure.  But, according to the leaders of the cadastral chamber, soon almost all residents of the country will have to draw up their property without fail.  But before talking about the legalization of real estate, consider what the cadastre is, and what is the federal cadastral chamber responsible for? </p><p>  Note that the real estate cadastre is a register of documents that stores information about the state and value of real estate.  There are also such varieties of cadastre as: land, forest, water cadastre, etc. </p><p>  It should be noted that the cadastre is maintained in every country in the world.  In other words, it is an accounting or assessment of a condition, land or <span>real estate.</span>  This is a set of documents that carry information about the owner of the property, about the quality of the land, location and more. </p><p>  <span>The real estate cadastre is</span> controlled by the current legislation of the country.  Each immovable object must be included in the state register, but, unfortunately, many country houses and other are not included in it. </p><p>  BTI - bodies that control and implement the real estate cadastre.  They have all the information on the apartment or house, their condition, location, cost, configuration and owner.  The BTI issues certificates on the technical condition of the property. </p><p>  All transactions with the sale of real estate, without fail, go through the BTI.  Also, registration are held and rental agreements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Significant areas of work of the cadastral chamber </p><p>  First of all, we note that the federal cadastral chamber is a state (non-profit) institution that performs the functions of registration and technical control of capital construction objects.  Main functions: </p><p>  - Registration of objects on cadastral registration; </p><p>  - the <span>formation of cases</span> ; </p><p>  - providing information from the inventory; </p><p>  - storage of documentation; </p><p>  - maintaining cadastral maps. </p><p>  Today, the public cadastral chamber has expanded its list of cases, and they have become more specific.  The institution issues such documents as: </p><p>  - cadastral certificate; </p><p>  - <span>cadastral statement</span> ; </p><p>  - cadastral passport; </p><p>  - cadastral plan. </p><p>  With the advent of innovations in the law, the registration of the address of the copyright holder appeared.  If restructuring, land surveying or other actions will be carried out on neighboring land plots, the owner will be warned in advance about any changes on neighboring land plots. </p><p>  We will answer the exciting question of whether it is worth making the registration of real estate mandatory?  Of course, from the point of view of law, each property owner must understand his responsibility.  Legalization of all real estate objects without fail will bring the country one step closer to European standards.  But then the state will need to develop a strategy to identify violators and penalties for those who neglected this obligation.  But at the moment, such measures are not mandatory.  Soon, all <span>individuals and legal entities</span> themselves will carry out cadastral registration without establishing liability. </p><p>  In conclusion, we note that for the state, the real estate cadastre is the basis of taxation of citizens, i.e.  tax is paid to the state on every profit earned on any real estate transaction, whether it will be a sale or rental housing.  Which increases the state treasury and makes the payment of pensions, children‚Äôs, state salaries, compensations, more significant for Russian citizens.  In the future, this can significantly improve the standard of living in the country. </p>
