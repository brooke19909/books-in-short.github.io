This is especially true now, when many ailments appear in children.  Thanks to sports, the skeleton will be properly formed, and the muscles and joints will become strong.  Constantly engaged people practically do not get sick, have a huge supply of strength and excellent resistance.  But sport has a drawback - frequent injuries. </p><h2>  Insurance </h2><p>  <span>Sports insurance</span> for children protects adolescents from many adverse situations.  The guys are very mobile, active, they do an excellent job with many exercises.  But since the body goes through the stage of formation, the bones are not yet as strong as in adults.  Because of this, they may not withstand the load. </p>

    <p>  The conditions may be the same.  You can usually insure children who are already 2 years old.  And then not all companies insure kids at this age, because you can usually use the services from 3 years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Clearance procedure </h2><p>  Cases with children are different, so you need to arrange insurance.  The document is drawn up for a child from 2 years old if he attends a section.  If a company is selected, it is necessary to verbally discuss the terms of cooperation. </p><p>  It is important for parents to include in the contract those risks that really can be.  Sometimes absurd moments can be found in these documents, so you should check to see if real insured events are actually included.  After all, such a service is paid by the client. </p><h2>  Policy </h2><p>  When dealing with a company, an insurance contract must be drawn up.  An insured event arising after its execution is subject to compensation.  Even insignificant details missed during the preparation of the document can deprive payments. </p><p>  An athlete can get into an unpleasant situation: loss or damage to luggage, an accident, etc. But sports insurance for children involves protecting the child when traveling to other countries.  A company must pay for treatment even when restoration is performed abroad.  If, due to an injury, the child cannot be taken to a medical institution, the insurer will compensate for the trip. </p><h2>  Concept of contract </h2><p>  There is a clause that firms usually do not include in the contract.  It is the expenditure for the budget if the child needs treatment abroad. </p>

    <p>  The costs of staying in the country should be compensated by the company.  Many companies in such a way deceive customers, discussing some points only in words, but the contract does not contain such information.  Therefore, you must carefully read the contract.  To get a policy, you must submit: </p><ul><li>  birth certificate or passport; </li><li>  personal information; </li><li>  contacts; </li><li>  sports; </li><li>  information about the parents. </li></ul><p>  Only when the data is provided in full, it will turn out to issue a policy. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of the document may be different.  It all depends on factors such as: </p><ul><li>  kind of sport; </li><li>  insurance point; </li><li>  expiration dates. </li></ul><p>  Keep in mind that the price rises depending on the risks.  If there are many, then the contributions will be large.  The average cost of the policy is 700-1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Payouts </h2><p>  At standard cost, parents will be given an amount of about 100,000 rubles.  The maximum is determined by what kind of injury occurred.  It also affects the duration of the illness of the child.  Payments will increase if a disability was received due to injury.  But you need to consider that you need a lot of certificates that will confirm the insured event. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of insurance payment </h2><p>  It is important to follow the rules defined by the company.  For example, notification of a company about an event.  It should be clarified in advance how this should be done, because now it is possible to notify of the insured event by phone, Internet, or by letter.  To receive payments, it is necessary to fulfill all the conditions approved by the contract. </p><h2>  How to get the? </h2><p>  To receive payments, you must submit the following documents: </p><ul><li>  confirmation from the organizers, trainer, responsible persons; </li><li>  policy; </li><li>  account number for the transfer of funds; </li><li>  a document from a medical organization; </li><li>  personal documents and a statement. </li></ul><p>  If a child has acquired a disability during an insured event, then this must be confirmed.  Medical certificates must be certified.  With death, you need a certified document confirming this fact.  It is also required to provide the reason why the event occurred. </p><p>  Sports insurance is a must if the child is involved in sports.  The medicine is very expensive, and after serious injuries it is difficult to recover if there are no funds.  And thanks to insurance, all costs will be covered. </p>
