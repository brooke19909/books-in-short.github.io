    <p>  This religious building was first mentioned in chronicles in 1557, in those days it was still wooden.  Unfortunately, the church was not preserved in its original form, like many other sights: Voskresensk lost many buildings of architectural value.  However, when the temple burned down in 1881, it was decided to recreate it using stone as the main material.  Residents had to pay for construction work. </p><p>  The church was again destroyed after the revolution that happened in 1917, at the moment the building is only partially restored. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which temples to see </h2><p>  What other sights related to religion are worth seeing?  Voskresensk is the place where the church of <span>John Chrysostom</span> , built in 1761, is located <span>.</span>  During the construction, stone was used.  The temple is most interesting with the icon of Our Lady of Jerusalem, made in the Byzantine style.  She even attracts residents of other cities who arrive in Voskresensk to bow to her. </p>

    <p>  Manor Spasskoe managed to visit an orphanage, it happened in the difficult years of World War II.  The fire that took place in 1961 destroyed the central building, only the cellars survived.  Nowadays, the territory of the former estate is occupied by DOL ‚ÄúFlame‚Äù.  However, this attraction is still worth visiting for the sake of the "snake" gates that have survived to our days, located in the back of the park. </p><h2>  Manor Krivyakino </h2><p>  What else is worth seeing when visiting the city of Voskresensk, the sights of which are considered in this article?

    <p>  Princes Lieven - the last owners of the building, they belonged to them until the revolution.  Then the Krivyakino estate was confiscated by the Soviet government, and the former owners fled to Europe.
