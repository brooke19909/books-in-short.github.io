The most unpleasant thing is that they cannot be completely removed, and sticky stains appear in their place.  Many inadvertently use a clerical knife in the hope of scraping off the remnants of the glue base.  Such actions often lead to scratches, scuffs and other damage that spoil the appearance <span>of the window.</span>  It is better not to resort to such methods. </p><h2>  Soap </h2>

    <p>  And how to glue snowflakes on the window?  The most common way has come to us since the time of our grandmothers.  Then the jewelry was fixed with a soap solution or soaked <span>laundry soap.</span>  The back side of the snowflakes was rubbed with soap, then soaked in warm water and applied to glass.  This method is the simplest.  Snowflakes can be easily removed from the surface of the window by wetting them with water.  The remaining soap is also easy to wipe with a damp cloth.  Then it remains only to wipe the glass surface dry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Water </h2>

    <p>  How to glue snowflakes on a window with water?  A similar method is also effective.  However, fastening with water is very unreliable, since this deforms the paper.  Without a strong adhesive backing, it is tuberous and does not last long on glass.  A light breath - and the snowflake will fly and spin.  The only condition that the decoration, glued with water, nevertheless rests on the glass, is the thinnest paper.  If you make the product from tracing paper or similar material, then due to its small weight it will not fall from the glass. </p><h2>  Detergent </h2><p>  And how to glue snowflakes on the window so that they hold well?  Often used an aqueous solution of <span>detergent for dishes</span> or shampoo for hair.  To do this, a few caps of soapy substance are added to a glass of water.  After that, a snowflake is dipped in a solution and applied to glass.  If the fastening strength is insufficient, then the concentration of the agent should be increased. </p><h2>  Kissel </h2><p>  Another grandfather method is gluing snowflakes with jelly.  For this, it must be welded strong and thick, cool.  Apply snowflakes on the back and attach to the window.  After drying, the decoration will hold tight.  Removing a snowflake is also not difficult.  Residues on the glass surface can be easily removed with water or detergent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scotch </h2>

    <p>  How to stick snowflakes on a window using duct tape or tape?  Small thin strips must be applied to the tops of the pattern and fixed on the glass.  This fastening method is durable, but if the room lacks ventilation and the windows often fog up, the condensate will easily wash off the glue on the tape.  A snowflake can fly away when you first blow a draft.  To prevent such a nuisance, you can pre-make the decoration of the most thin paper or tracing paper.  However, it is considered more durable to apply a regular snowflake to a <span>double-sided tape</span> attached in the middle of the decoration, as well as along its edges.  After the winter period, when it will be necessary to clean the windows, you can do this with a solvent, nail polish remover or acetone.  These products easily remove adhesive residues without staining. </p><h2>  Glue stick </h2><p>  How to glue snowflakes on a window with glue stick?  Almost everyone knows the answer to this question.  This method is most often used because of the ease of application.  First, glue should be held on the back of the snowflake, then attach it to the glass.  After waiting a bit, let go.  Snowflakes attached in this way hold for a long time, the pattern itself does not deform.  However, after the winter holidays, decorations are not easy to remove from the glass, after which fragments of glue remain.  It is difficult to wash it, but it will not cause any damage to the surface of the window.  A bit troublesome, but safe for glass. </p><h2>  Water soluble adhesive </h2><p>  It is recommended to fix snowflakes using water-soluble types of glue.  Clerical also copes quite well with this task.  A small amount is applied to the snowflake in several places.  Then applied to the surface of the glass.  When the glue dries a little, the snowflake can be released.  This mounting method is quite durable.  After the winter holidays, decorations are very easy to remove, and the remaining glue is easy to remove by simply washing the surface. </p><h2>  Toothpaste </h2>
