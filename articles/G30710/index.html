Many needlewomen knit it with a hook or knitting.  It is beautiful and unusual, and most importantly - completely unique, if you do it yourself. </p><h2>  sources of inspiration </h2><p>  At first glance, it might seem that finding a beautiful pattern for a coquette is not easy.  But each craftswoman in the collection has schemes for napkins and round tablecloths.  Taking a part from there, you can get a completely original part for a new dress or blouse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet round yoke" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913775.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  It is also fashionable today to knit clothes from motifs.  Round or square elements, like a mosaic, can be easily folded into different shapes, including for decorating a round yoke. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that crocheting a round yoke always starts from the neck, since expanding the fabric is much easier than narrowing it down.  At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that it does not get too bristled.  Strict adherence to the pattern will help to avoid such an annoying effect, in which the finished canvas should be in the same plane or the edges are pulled a little into the bowl.  But you should not tighten it strongly, since this can then limit the movement of hands in ready-made clothes. </p><h2>  Simple crochet round yoke </h2><p>  <span>Crocheting a dress</span> with a round yoke is not difficult.  To begin with, we recall the basics of knitting, in which patterns are built on the alternation of air loops and a crochet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We collect a chain of air loops.  Its length should be slightly less than the opening for the neck, since further weaving will slightly increase the size of the fabric.  We begin to knit the first row of <span>double crochet,</span> passing each of them into a loop from the dialed chain.  The second row is knitted in the same way, but it is already necessary to add several loops in it, knitting them from one point. </p>

    <p>  In the third row, alternate double crochet and 2-3 air loops.  At the same time, the columns are not knitted into each loop of the previous row, but also after 2-3.  This is like an element of fillet knitting.  We knit the fourth and fifth rows again with double crochet, not forgetting to add loops so that the fabric becomes round on the plane. </p><p>  We continue knitting to the desired size.  When the round yoke is crocheted, the master class on the creation of which we described, from it we start knitting the main fabric from below, from which the finished dress is then created. </p><h2>  Christmas tree coquette </h2><p>  A beautiful round crochet crochet is knitted in a circle from a slightly modified popular fan pattern.  We collect a chain of air loops multiple of five (plus two lifting loops).  In the twelfth from the edge of the loop we knit a crochet column.  Next, we make 3 air loops and after 5 in the chain of the first row we knit a ‚Äúfan‚Äù according to the scheme: 2 double crochets, 2 air loops, 2 double crochets.  Next - 3 air loops and a double crochet in the fifth loop from the ‚Äúfan‚Äù.  We continue knitting to the edge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dress with a round yoke" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/914863.jpg" width="507"></div>

In the place where the fans were, we continue to knit them in each row.  In the same place where there was a double crochet, we make a design of air loops - three times three loops.  In this case, we form an arc, the base of which is located just on top of a single column.  In all the next rows, the formed arch will serve as the basis for the same arch. </p><p>  The canvas is expanded by adding the number of double crochet columns in one ‚Äúfan‚Äù through a certain number of rows.  Thus, a round yoke crocheted at the top more narrowly than at the bottom will lie down beautifully and take the correct shape on the body in the future. </p><h2>  Loin roses </h2><p>  Fillet knitting is one of the most popular techniques.  She allows to create unsurpassed patterns and even plot pictures.  Therefore, it is not surprising that crocheting a round yoke has not passed by this technique. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the round shape in fillet knitting is a certain level of skill that is not always available to novice craftswomen.  But if you practice a little and understand the principles of knitting roundings, then this is nothing complicated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet round yoke for girls" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913771.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The sirloin yoke with roses does not fit in a circle, but across the canvas.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that its inner side is organically rounded.  The outer edge must be made of "filled" cells.  This will provide a clearer form of this part of the product. </p><p>  If you have certain skills in the technique of fillet knitting, then repeating the proposed pattern will not be difficult.  Only for work, it is best to first transfer it to a notebook sheet of paper and break it into cells (5 x 5) so as not to go astray in the process. </p><h2>  Knitting from bottom to top </h2><p>  The crocheted round yoke for the girl proposed in the diagram does not fit as described previously, from the neck, but vice versa.  This is her whole "highlight".  Its second feature is the number of loops in it does not change.  The result is quite lush sleeves and a wide neck, which can subsequently be pulled a little with a satin ribbon or decorative lace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet round yoke master class" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The scheme is simple to understand, so we will not describe it in detail, but only analyze the most difficult moments.  The second row in the diagram is represented by lush columns, which are indicated as if by two combined brackets.  It simply fits: we pull out the double crochet without knitting, make another double crochet and repeat the same action.  As a result, there are several loops on the hook that bind together. </p><p>  Crossed double crochet columns are made very simply: we knit the second column, returning 1 loop back in the previous row.  And the most difficult moment is the popcorn bar.  We knit it like a fan of four double crochets, take out the hook and pass it into the first loop of the resulting fan, grab the working loop and knit them together. </p><h2>  Baby dress </h2><p>  The following model is based on a rather interesting pattern, the knitting of which begins with the neck.  In every third loop of the base of the air loops, we alternate 5 double crochets and a picot of 5 air loops.  The next row is knitted in a checkerboard pattern: in pico we knit 5 double crochet, and in the third loop of the previous fan we make pico. </p>

    <p>  The canvas is expanded by adding 2 double crochets to the main fan.  It is worth noting that this pattern looks impressive on a relatively thick yarn.  Threads like "iris" for this will not work at all, since they are thin and you need to knit a lot more rows than <span>thick yarn.</span> </p><p>  Further, the dress itself is knitted with the same pattern, but this model provides for a small insert of single crochet columns, which is knitted immediately with a yoke.  Its width is not very large.  You can start knitting with a pattern approximately from the line of high waist.  The length of the skirt depends only on personal preferences. </p><h2>  Flirty motifs </h2><p>  An equally popular crochet technique is the creation of products from motifs.  At the same time, it is not necessary to carry them out according to any specific scheme, it is enough to simply develop a design and arrange the future coquette. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet round yoke" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/913774.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Round and eight-pointed motifs are best suited for these purposes.  Crocheting a round <span>yoke, the patterns of</span> which are different, begins with one flower.  We collect 10 air loops and connect them with a ring.  Next, we knit 8 double crochets for 3-5 air loops between them.  The next row consists of double crochet columns - 5 under each arch.  Then another number of columns with air loops between groups.  The result is a round flower, which will be the basis of the coquette. </p><h2>  Use cases for yoke </h2><p>  A beautiful and fashionable round crochet crocheted at home can be used in different models of clothing.  Most often, it is a part of knitted blouses, dresses and tops.  Well they are suitable for children's clothing. </p><p>  Even more interesting flirts look like an addition to unrelated things.  If you are going to sew a sundress, dress or blouse, it makes sense to decorate them with a lace yoke.  This will add elegance to such clothes and make them original and unique. </p>
