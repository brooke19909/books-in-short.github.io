"Vodnik" is not such.  However, here you can well counter the vacation.  In this article, we will describe what the ‚ÄúVodnik‚Äù water sports society (hereinafter GUS) represents.  Like any hotel or recreation center, it has its pros and cons.  In this article we do not advertise Vodnik, but strive to provide complete information about the conditions, accommodation and prices in it.  Should I go there with the children?  What is the infrastructure nearby?  Read about it below.  The decision is yours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeisk vodnik" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1833804.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of Vodnik </h2><p>  Once upon a time, when this town was not yet a resort, for those residents who had boats, a plot of land was allocated for garages for boats.  The territory was significant: eight hundred meters long and 80 m wide, and, most importantly, near the sea.  For a long time, this was of no value to the inhabitants of Yeysk.  Those who bought boats and registered them with the relevant authorities became members of the water sports cooperative.  They allocated a piece of the coast on which the garage was built (it is called "boxing").  But then the times changed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The owners of the garages felt for their gold mine.  After all, the land is actually on the beach!  By re-equipping their former garages, the owners were able to lure the spa guests at a significant part of the Yeisk recreation centers.  Vodnik very quickly turned from a cooperative of boaters and fishermen into a cottage village.  It is very popular among vacationers.  But there are some nuances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeysk recreation center Vodnik" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1833806.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Vodnik VSE (Yeysk)? </h2><p>  Living in a former garage - who will it seduce?  But not everything is so simple.  The owners rebuilt their mini-hotels, which is much more than that, more precisely, as far as the means allowed.  Someone had three-story mansions, but someone could only transform the garage into "human housing" a little.  But VSO Vodnik (Yeysk) did not break up.  By the efforts of the cooperative in 2004, the sewerage and water supply were brought to the cottage village, and garbage collection was arranged.  Soon, the usual urban infrastructure appeared in the form of shops (some of them work around the clock) and a cafe.  The only thing that is not yet available is parking.  Ironically, entry into the territory of former garages is permitted only by passes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Whole waterman" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1833809.jpg" width="600"></div>

Finding it is not difficult.  It is located right behind the Tornado Hotel.  Whatever the reviews about Vodnik (Yeysk), all tourists praise its location.  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov splashes an average of twenty meters from the threshold.  But the pebble beach of the former boat pier is not equipped.  Swimming on it is not recommended.  To the best sandy <span>beaches of Yeysk,</span> Detskiy and City, - five minutes of leisurely walk along the water's edge.  The epicenter of the resort‚Äôs evening entertainment is also close by.  There are a lot of shops and cafes around.  The central market is also within easy reach.  It is clear that with such an arrangement, cottages are very in demand.  You need to book them in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeysk vodnik prices" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1833808.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions in the houses of the cooperative "Vodnik" (Yeysk), prices for the summer of 2017 </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, in the cottage village many locals rent housing.  There are a total of sixty-two houses.  They are mainly in two floors, although there are one- and three-level.  You can rent an entire house, floor or room.  The latter are designed to accommodate from two to eight guests.  As a rule, these are rooms with private facilities, with a private kitchen and a terrace.  So that the tourist does not ring all the hosts, the cooperative has a website and a phone. </p><p>  What do the reviews say about the amenities in VSS Vodnik (Yeysk)?  Photo numbers correspond to reality.  It makes no sense to list the amenities in each of the 62 houses, especially since there can be rooms of various categories in one cottage.  But there are still certain standards of living.  These include a fridge, TV and split system.  Typically, rooms on the ground floor have a dedicated gazebo.  Guest rooms on the second and third levels are equipped with balconies or verandas.  Prices vary by room category and season.  The cost of living in economy class housing with shared facilities and a shared kitchen starts at 400 rubles per person per night.  At the beginning and end of the season, a room with amenities will cost one and a half thousand, and at the height of summer - up to 2500 rubles per room per day.  An entire house can be rented for 3000-4500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vodnik neusk photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1833807.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pros of staying at Vodnik </h2><p>  The main advantage of the cottage village is its location on the seashore.  You can sleep to the sound of waves, breathe iodine-rich air, admire the endless blue surface from the veranda.  No need to take a lot of clothes, going to Yeysk.  ‚ÄúVodnik‚Äù has the advantage that you can go to the beach directly in a bathing suit.  The village is surrounded by developed infrastructure of the resort.  Shops, discos, cafes are within walking distance.  You do not need any minibuses: everything is just a stone's throw from Yeysk.  Another plus is the very reasonable (unlike other bases) prices.  An indisputable advantage is that the owners do not bother you, as often happens when renting a home in the private sector. </p><h2>  Cons of living in Vodnik </h2><p>  Former boat boxes, and now houses, are very crowded.  Owners of private houses in the Yeysk resort ‚ÄúVodnik‚Äù are called the ‚ÄúIndian village‚Äù, ‚ÄúChinatown‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúShanghai‚Äù.  Your vacation will largely depend on the upbringing of your neighbors.  The owner of the house will not be able to restrain the cheerful company in the neighboring cottage - this is not his territory.  Also a minus is the lack of a single standard.  By the word "junior suite" the owners of the houses understand the most different levels of service.  When booking a room, you need to carefully study the photos, inquire about the availability of amenities, wi-fi and other things. </p>
