We must think that the next line will be called "Maxi."  Having at its disposal a four-core processor, a 4.5-inch display and the Android platform of the 6th version, the average Tele2 smartphone (price - 3190 rubles) looks very good compared to other budget devices.  Both phones, both mini and midi, will fit perfectly as a modern gadget from the lower price category. </p>

    <p>  So, the subject of today's review is the Tele2 smartphone.  Characteristics, design features, as well as advantages along with the disadvantages of the model, we will discuss below.  The opinions of experts in this field and the reviews of ordinary owners of an average smartphone from the mobile operator Tele2 will be taken into account. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  The purpose of the gadget, in principle, is understandable: to fill the budget niche in one of the most popular format scans of 4.5 inches and get additional clientele in your network due to a significant reduction in price and other different “goodies” from “Tele2” (phones / smartphones / prices / stocks, etc.), which come as if complete with a new device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, a diagonal of 4.5 inches is distinguished by its versatility in almost all scenarios.  This format can be described as "one gadget for all occasions."  Of course, this “dialer” doesn’t look so attractive against the background of 5.5-inch devices with a quicker “stuffing”, but this is completely different money, but in our case they paid for it and got it, that is, a Tele2 smartphone . </p><p>  Responses of owners note the presence of at least some kind of diversity in terms of color performance.  The ladies are especially happy with the white coloring, because the vast majority of the representatives of the fair half still prefer more cheerful and cheerful colors, as opposed to boring "male" colors. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  As for the cost, the Tele2 smartphone (the price is indicated above) can be purchased for an even more attractive amount if you take several months in advance of a monthly fee at a particular tariff.  In general, the gadget looks like a good budget solution for most regions where 2G and 3G networks work normally.  By the way, the Tele2 smartphone, alas, does not work in 4G networks, but this point cannot be called a critical flaw. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is packed in a decent box of cardboard.  On it you will see brief characteristics of the model, labels of various certificates of conformity and other less useful information. </p>

What other disadvantages does the “Tele2” smartphone come with?  User reviews indignantly note the absence of any headset in the box. </p><p>  Interestingly, the owners of expensive devices, the complete set of which can be called “all inclusive”, prefer to choose third-party high-quality accessories for the gadget, while the budget consumer uses only what is in the box.  And here we see only the charger, and even that is stupid. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  What rudiments of gadget design are present?  Metal sides, the original camera eye and the strict form of the whole structure.  A camera shifted to the corner looks much nicer than stuck in the middle.  Naturally, the extension of additional accessories and “clothespins” to the eye is practically not implemented, and it is not needed here: few people will want to indulge with third-party optics on the camera without autofocus and with a resolution of 3.2 megapixels. </p>

    <p>  The gadget turned out a little thinner than the previous Tele2 smartphone.  Characteristics of the case, which is interesting, vary greatly in fact and virtually.  If the official website of the operator indicates a thickness of 7.45 mm, then the real numbers are close to 10 mm (vernier caliper to help).  The same can be said about the weight of the device: on the site - 158 g, and in the manual - 130 g. If you estimate "on hand", then most likely the first figure is more objective.  Therefore, you need to choose some additional accessories more carefully on the Tele2 smartphone.  Owner reviews recommend choosing covers not virtually, but only with the gadget on hand, otherwise there is a high risk of getting either a hoodie or a gap on the cover. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a simple 4.5-inch TFT-matrix with a resolution of 854x480 pixels.  The density of points is quite tolerable for the budget model (218 ppi), and you can make out individual pixels if you take a closer look.  Particularly, pixelation is noticeable on maps and small fonts, the rest of the graphics seem to be handled by the Tele2 smartphone, which you are currently reviewing. </p><p>  A vertical change in the angle causes a strong distortion of colors, horizontal leads to a loss of gamma saturation.  The moment may be uncritical for the “egoists," but you can’t even look through the photos and watch the video in the company of one like-minded person. </p>

    <p>  The brightness of the display, in principle, is enough.  On a sunny day, you can read the data on the screen without any problems.  I was pleased with the automatic brightness adjustment, the display responds quickly and smoothly.  This quality was pleasantly distinguished by the Tele2 smartphone.  Owner reviews have repeatedly noted that even in "thoroughbred" gadgets this moment is not as well implemented as our respondent, therefore, there is no desire to manually adjust the brightness during work. </p><p>  Also pleased with the presence of a pre-installed proprietary package Mira Vision, which allows you to adjust the standard display settings with a wide variation.  A sensible thing, especially for TFT-matrices, characterized by "innate" blue.  Keep this in mind before setting up your Tele2 smartphone. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The venerable benchmark "Antutu" gave the device 14,534 points on its scale.  For current realities, of course, not enough even for most budget models.  Moreover, this “little” is noticeable even in the routine operation of the device without any serious loads of powerful applications. </p>

    <p>  The gadget has on its "board" only 512 MB of RAM, which is also not enough to perform most tasks.  The smartphone pulls unpretentious toys and plain software, but literally "chokes" on applications more seriously.  In addition, the interface differs, albeit by slight, but sagging, “brakes” and other lags, if you decide to quickly flip through or open something. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Despite belonging to the budget segment, the smartphone surprised by the “survivability” of the battery.  The gadget worked out for a full day quite confidently and did not ask for an outlet, moreover, with fairly active use.  During the night, the loss of charge was only 3% in standby mode.  Of course, many will say that this moment completely depends on the quality of the network coverage, but nevertheless, the modest battery consumption was very pleased.  In addition, there are additional settings and modes for even greater savings. </p>

    <p>  A good fly in the ointment here is the non-linearity of the indication of the remaining charge.  The first 15-20% of the capacity is consumed disproportionately long, while the device can spend 30% of the remaining battery for some five minutes. </p><h2>  Work impressions </h2><p>  Reviews indicate that spending time on the Internet, and social networks in particular, is not very comfortable.  In the most common mode of web surfing, a smartphone can "think" for a long time, even if you go through the internal pages of the site, and this is with all the stripes of the 3G network full.  This point, of course, is annoying, but if you do not jump from tab to tab, then you can somehow come to terms with this drawback.  Here, perhaps, the point is not that social networks are "difficult to lift."  The reason, most likely, lies in the abundance of new-fangled advertising garbage, which is poured by an endless stream on the Web, thereby loading even the resources fastest by the standards of the Internet. </p><p>  As for the sensitivity of the sensor, there are no complaints.  No calibrations, inaccuracies or other defects were found.  With speed in 3G networks, too, everything is in order: there are no technologies like HSPA + here, but the “ceiling” is quite encouraging - 3.5 Mbit for transmission and 14 Mbit / s for reception.  Communication without failures and other failures.  There are no complaints about the operation of wireless protocols.  Wi-Fi and bluetooth work equally well both on "noble" gadgets, and on our "Tele2". </p>

    <p>  The sound is more or less acceptable, although the characteristics of the speaker, even a budget one, could have been better.  The maximum volume is at a relatively high level, but there is little use for it: if you add sound by more than 70%, you can hear obvious distortions, sips and other cacophony. </p><p>  The diagonal of 4.5 inches is the most optimal for this kind of gadgets.  It seems that the difference is small in comparison with 4-inch models, but nevertheless, getting a finger into the letters when typing the same SMS is noticeably easier.  Naturally, on five-inch and more devices typing is even easier, but the dimensions of the latter, as well as prices, do not suit everyone. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  You can recommend the gadget to those who are looking for an inexpensive entry-level smartphone.  “Tele2-midi” is fully consistent with expectations and lives up to its value.  The advantages of the device include a very affordable price tag, a relatively fresh Android platform, good battery life and an acceptable appearance. </p><p>  Any special complaints, if you look at the price, it seems like no.  Of the more or less serious shortcomings, the reviews note a mediocre display on an outdated TFT-matrix, a small amount of RAM and very sad characteristics of the camera.  The rest is the usual budget "dialer". </p>
