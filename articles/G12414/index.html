Users respond to them mostly positively.  Of course, there are some disadvantages, however, they fully pay off with a low cost.  In 2016, a new model came out under this brand - Meizu U10.  We will review reviews about it a little later.  Her debut did not go unnoticed.  The main advantage of this line of gadgets is a modern attractive design.  The manufacturer prefers to select high-quality materials for the case, which, undoubtedly, is in consumer demand.  Naturally, cost plays an important role.  The novelty appeared on sale in two versions.  The option with two gigabytes of "RAM" and sixteen native memory is approximately estimated at $ 150.  The older modification (3/32 GB) will be more expensive at 17-20 dollars.  What opportunities will open to the owners of this model?  Were users not disappointed in another new product from China?  The answers to these questions can be found in this review. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015841.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Just note that the Meizu U10 32Gb smartphone - Gold, Silver, Black - received a lot of positive reviews thanks to its modern design.  Exactly the appearance of gadgets is a kind of "chip" of the manufacturer.  According to most users, this model was able to reach a new level.  The case is made of metal, which harmoniously connects to glass.  A chrome-plated frame runs along the perimeter.  She gives the smartphone a special appeal and elegance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that not only the front panel is decorated with 2.5D glass with rounded edges, but also the back cover.  The properties of this material are consistent with high requirements.  In their comments, buyers pay attention to the fact that even with insufficiently accurate interaction with the phone, scratches on the surface do not form.  An indisputable advantage is that the manufacturer used an oleophobic coating.  Thanks to him, the finger easily glides on the surface, fingerprints from it remain, but in a small amount, while they are easily erased. </p><p>  The frame itself, which runs along the perimeter, has not a rounded, but a rectangular shape.  In this matter, users could not come to a consensus, as some consider this solution to be quite acceptable, while others consider it to be outdated, preferring a rounded side end.  But it is not all that bad.  In order for the design to look pretty strong, the manufacturer complicated the shape of this frame a bit, giving it embossed beveled edges.  Thanks to this decision, it turned out to emphasize the peculiarity of the material used. </p><p>  Choosing the color scheme of the smartphone for each person will not be a problem.  The lineup presents several options.  For example, for men who prefer classics, the Meizu U10 16Gb Black smartphone is ideal.  Reviews about this instance prove that it looks quite impressive and stylish.  Of course, some flaws are still visible.  We are talking about the accumulation of greasy stains on the surface.  Unfortunately, the <span>oleophobic coating</span> does not completely protect against them.  The only solution to this problem is to constantly wipe the surface.  But such an unpleasant moment concerns only the black version.  On phones with a light body, these spots are almost invisible, so many people prefer to buy Meizu U10 16Gb Silver.  Reviews on this topic are often found on forums.  Users came to an unambiguous opinion: if the buyer doesn‚Äôt care about the color, then it‚Äôs better to choose a model with a light body, as greasy spots and fingerprints are almost invisible on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What can be said about the dimensions of this device?  In principle, they are quite expected, as for a smartphone with a 5-inch screen.  Its mass is small - only 139 g. The praise also sounds about the thickness.  This phone may well be called narrow.  According to most users, the developers have chosen the optimal thickness indicator, which is 7.9 mm.  Comments did not cause other dimensions.  A height of 141.9 mm is harmoniously combined with a width of 69.6 mm. </p><p>  As can be seen from the above, users do not have a pronounced negative.  Of course, there are several unpleasant moments (fingerprints remain in the black copy), but they are not quite critical for everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 32gb reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015842.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Controls and Connectors </h2><p>  The location of the controls will be examined using the Meizu U10 16GB Black as an example.  Reviews of connoisseurs of this brand confirm that they are all brought to their usual place.  The only difference was the connector for audio devices.  For some reason, the developers did not bring it to the upper end, as many have become accustomed to, but to the lower.  To judge the convenience of such an arrangement, of course, is difficult.  But you can get used to it easily. </p><p>  So, let's look at what is on the side faces.  On the left side of the case, the manufacturer installed a tray for SIM cards.  It can also be used to install external micro-SD drives.  The opposite side face is occupied by an elongated volume button and a power key.  The latter performs the function of locking the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The bottom end is multifunctional.  There was a place to bring the main speaker.  It consists of 4 small round holes.  In the center of the end is a USB port that supports the OTG format.  As mentioned above, on the right side there is an audio jack and a microphone hole. </p><p>  Many comments about this smartphone model are addressed to the control panel.  The manufacturer decided to completely abandon the touch navigation buttons, replacing them with one universal mTouch 2.1.  It is multifunctional, at the same time it is both mechanical and sensory.  Designed to control the gadget - navigation in the operating system interface.  In it, the developers also built a fingerprint scanner.  Up to 5 prints are stored in his memory.  The recognition angle is 360 degrees.  Although it does not work very fast, users have no comments on the speed and accuracy of operation. </p><h2>  <span>Meizu U10</span> hardware platform <span>: specifications</span> and reviews </h2><p>  Having discovered MediaTek's processor in the 2016 new product, users were not surprised.  These chipsets are often used in gadgets of this level.  That is why a certain opinion about their capabilities has long been established.  Of course, they are unlikely to compete with the original devices from Apple, but they are also able to show good results. </p><p>  This model is based on a processor, which is based on 8 computing modules.  The type of each of them is Cortex-A53.  They operate on a 4 √ó 4 system.  The first half is capable of delivering a maximum frequency of up to 1500 MHz, but the second half is limited to 1000 MHz. </p><p>  In order for the device to work with graphic images, a video card is installed in conjunction with the main processor.  In this model, the choice fell on the Mali-T860 accelerator.  It is worth noting that he copes pretty well with all the tasks. </p><p>  Now, let's consider what reviews this gadget received in terms of performance.  In the comments, users say that in practice the phone copes with all everyday tasks.  Of course, there are situations when the device hangs a little, but this is only if the owners set several actions at once.  This can not be considered a critical drawback, since in this price category all devices without exception show such results.  Players will be pleased with the U10.  She is able to open even "heavy" 3D-games.  The only thing you may have to sacrifice is the maximum level of graphics.  Also, users noticed that even with a long heavy load, the case does not heat up very much. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu u10 reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015843.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  What modifications did the manufacturer introduce to customers?  There are two versions in the lineup.  They differ among themselves in the amount of RAM and built-in memory.  First, consider the Meizu U10 16GB Gold.  Reviews about this modification vary somewhat.  There are several reasons for this.  The first thing to note is that the amount of RAM is only 2 gigabytes.  In the comments, people say that in fact no more than half will be available.  Also, the amount of internal memory is not large, it is only 16 GB.  For a modern user who prefers to use a smartphone to the maximum, such volumes will not be enough.  If you shoot a lot of videos, take photos, install various software, you will have to use an external drive, since the manufacturer has provided support for memory cards up to 128 GB. </p><p>  However, in this case, users should know that they will have to sacrifice one SIM card, as the developers combined their slots in one tray.  For this reason, many people recommend Meizu U10 32Gb in reviews.  According to most, this model is optimal for multitasking.  First of all, it has 3 GB of RAM.  Naturally, this figure is much better than in the previous modification.  This is especially noticeable during games.  Accordingly, the size of integrated memory in this version is 32 GB.  Advanced users are recommended to purchase just such a modification, because its advantages are obvious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu u10 32gb gold reviews" class="if" height="479" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015846.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  By the criterion of autonomy, Meizu U10 32Gb does not receive the best reviews.  The fact is that this model has a striking resemblance to the hardware of the M3s device.  However, for some reason, the manufacturer reduced the battery capacity by almost 300 milliamps per hour.  It was this decision that caused the most indignation of the owners.  Buyers are already accustomed to the fact that new products come out with higher rates, so the decrease in battery life to 2760 mAh was, clearly, a disappointment.  The only explanation that advanced users could give is that the developers tried to reduce the thickness of the phone. </p><p>  What results does this gadget show?  The owners assure that with an average load, you can safely count on 24 hours of operation.  The only thing that will have to be completely abandoned for such a period of work is to reduce the brightness level, not play, and also not activate network modules.  If you use one of the above, then the life of the gadget will be significantly reduced.  The advantages include the availability of energy-saving modes. </p><h2>  Meizu U10: camera reviews </h2><p>  It has become commonplace that manufacturers in modern smartphones use two cameras.  In most cases, for the main one, which is located on the back side, a high-resolution module is selected.  This model was no exception.  The optics are based on a 13 megapixel matrix.  It consists of 5 wide-angle lenses.  It is supplemented by phase autofocus, which works quickly and efficiently.  There is also a two-position flash. </p><p>  The camera application has a concise and simple interface.  In it, manufacturers have implemented a large number of features.  Among the settings, you can find modes for creating panoramas, portraits, macro shots and more.  Also here you can adjust the white balance, change the exposure value, use the built-in QR scanner and much more. </p><p>  Thanks to the main camera, <span>Meizu U10</span> receives only good <span>reviews</span> , as the pictures taken in the daytime are distinguished by high detail, sharpness and realistic color reproduction.  Also, users separately highlighted the ability to create GIFs.  As for the video mode, the maximum resolution in which you can record videos is Full HD.  The frame rate varies from 20 to 30. The minimum indicator corresponds to shooting in low light, the maximum is achieved in the daytime.  With this unit, you can make slow-motion recording. </p><p>  A few words need to be said about the front camera.  It is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  There are a large number of filters that help increase image quality.  Using the front module, you can record video with a resolution of 1080p. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 16gb gold reviews" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015845.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In reviews of the Meizu U10 smartphone, users separately highlight the screen.  For its price category, it has all the necessary characteristics.  First of all, pay attention to the size of the diagonal.  It equals five inches.  The picture is displayed on it in HD quality, which is pretty good for a "budget employee", the cost of which does not exceed $ 200.  Users separately in the comments highlighted the image quality.  It is quite high, "squares" are not visible on the screen.  The proof of this is the pixel density (296 ppi). </p><p>  Definitely, positive impressions arise due to the pleasant color scheme.  An indisputable plus is the ability to adjust tint temperatures.  This is evidenced by reviews.  <span>The Meizu</span> U10 <span>smartphone</span> does not have the highest brightness range, but it is quite enough for comfortable work on the street in sunny weather.  Owners praise sensor properties.  He quickly and clearly responds to all touches.  The phone has a multi-touch option for 10 touches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu u10 16gb black reviews" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015844.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software part </h2><p>  It's time to learn the features of the operating system implemented in Meizu U10.  Reviews about Android version six are found only positive.  Customers were pleased to find the Flyme shell of their own design. </p><p>  It is important to pay attention to the fact that devices intended for sale in China are equipped with a completely different operating system.  This information is important for those who directly purchase this phone from the Middle Kingdom.  Those who go to branded stores for him may not worry, the OS will be Russified. </p><p>  Did users like the Meizu U10 32Gb smartphone interface?  Reviews from happy owners indicate that the system works stably and smoothly.  The required software is easy to update by air.  It is important that the Flyme firmware is still being finalized by the developers, so the owners of this model can hope to make changes and additions.  Naturally, this greatly expands the capabilities of the gadget. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  After the model went on sale, comments began to appear about it.  Note that not all of them are laudatory.  Having studied the majority, it turned out to make a list of the strengths and weaknesses of Meizu U10.  Reviews of owners who were satisfied with their purchase, focused on the following advantages of the gadget: </p><ul><li>  Sleek and stylish design that looks pretty expensive. </li><li>  Low cost. </li><li>  Fingerprint reader. </li><li>  High resolution screen with excellent color reproduction. </li><li>  Great main camera. </li></ul><p>  In fairness, it is necessary to consider negative comments.  They say that the developer did not provide a separate slot for memory cards.  Users will have to abandon the second SIM card to install an external drive.  The owners also consider a non-separable design a drawback, which significantly increases the cost of repairs in case of some kind of breakdown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u10 specifications reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2015847.jpg" width="600"></div>
