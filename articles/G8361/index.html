    <h2>  What is the originality of the hotel? </h2><p>  Burj Al Arab Hotel is a truly amazing building.  So, first of all, it was erected directly into the sea on an artificially created island.  The coast is 280 meters away.  It can be reached by bridge.  Opposite is the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and Wild Wad Waterpark. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel building itself has an unusual shape.  So, it is built in the form of a mast with a sail.  Burj Al Arab itself is the tallest hotel in the world.  Its height is 321 meters.  In total, it has 56 floors.  By the way, the name of the hotel can be translated as "Arab Tower".  This hotel also boasts many more unique things.  So, for example, almost on its roof there is a helipad, which is easily converted into a tennis court.  It offers truly luxurious views of Dubai and the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="burj al arab hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1318573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History, architecture, design </h2><p>  This luxurious <span>Dubai hotel</span> was opened in 1999.  The best architects and designers worked on the project.  So, it was decided that the hotel should be in the form of a dhow sail, which is installed on traditional Arab sea vessels.  However, putting this idea into practice was a truly complex and time-consuming process.  So, it is made of a special fabric coated with a double layer of Teflon.  In the daytime, it is white, and with the onset of darkness it transforms into a giant screen onto which a bright light show is projected, making the structure even more original.  The atrium, mast and V-shaped are made of steel and glass.  Thanks to the original architectural design of architect Tom Wright, the Burj Al Arab Hotel has become for Dubai the same symbol as, for example, the Eiffel Tower for Paris or Big Ben for London. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The interior design of the Arabian Tower is based on the traditional theme of Arabian architecture, as well as the contrast of white and black shades and the abundance of gold decor elements.  For the decoration of apartments and halls, the most expensive materials were used here.  So, only 999 <span>gold foil</span> took more than one and a half thousand square meters!  Also, designers used precious and semiprecious stones, the best grades of marble, finest leather and precious woods in the interior decoration.  However, all the rooms in the hotel are very comfortable, multifunctional and equipped with the latest technology. </p><p>  Officially, this hotel belongs to the five-star category.  However, according to many guests, the rest even the luxury hotels of the UAE fade against its background.  So, the British journalist who attended the opening of the Arab Tower in 1999 was so impressed by the originality and luxury that he called it the only seven-star hotel in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helipad" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1318572.jpg" width="600"></div>
