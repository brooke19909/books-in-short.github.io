But they regulate only in general and in general.  In addition to the legislative framework, an additional cash settlement agreement is concluded between the legal entity and the bank.  There are no restrictions on the form of ownership for entering into such a relationship.

If this process is carried out for the first time, then special attention must be paid to the conditions for the provision of the following:

For this purpose, the use of BESP is now considered the rule of good form.  This abbreviation stands for electronic bank urgent payments.  With BESP, transferring money takes minutes.  Although, according to the law, payment must be made in three business days.  This is done in case of sudden and unexpected events that disable the system.  Although such a fast execution of the order may incur additional charges.  And transfers, even using BESP, will go just three business days.  If the bank practices such schemes, you need to think about whether to continue to be served in this financial institution.  Fortunately, there are enough worthy competitors.  Take at least such structures as Alfa Bank, Sberbank, VTB 24. Settlement and cash services for legal entities, if you do not satisfy the client, you can change the financial institution.  Remember that we can vote with our wallets.

    <h2>  Acquiring </h2><p>  All enterprises located on the cash register of a certain financial institution can, after signing a separate agreement, make it possible to pay for goods without leaving the outlet.  True, in such cases, it is necessary not only to take care of the availability of all necessary equipment, but also to carry out a fairly significant number of control measures in time (first of all, this relates to safety).  The same can be said about accepting payment by payment cards on the World Wide Web.  In such cases, the terminals replace the special forms that the buyer must fill out. </p><h2>  Cash operations </h2>

A unique analogue for a checkbook has recently become a corporate bank card.  When it is issued, a special account is opened, with the help of which the financial organization conducts a register of all completed transactions, issues statements with the amounts of turns and cash balances.  Consider the example of VTB.  Settlement and cash services for legal entities in terms of salaries for employees are carried out by transferring a certain amount of money to a bank card.  But this approach is not convenient for some people, since they are used to being clients of Sberbank rather than VTB.  In this case, an accountant may additionally be sent to the bank, who will already receive the necessary amounts there using the checkbook.  As you can see, there are positive changes, but so far certain obstacles often arise before the process of crediting money is completely automated.  If you have to travel with a significant amount of money, then many large financial institutions offer a collection service.  It is available after the settlement account and the corresponding additional contract have been signed.

    <h2>  Account opening </h2><p>  This service can be both paid and free.  It all depends on the policy of the bank.  But this amount is not unbearable even for new enterprises - for such pleasure you will have to pay ‚Äújust‚Äù a couple of thousand rubles.  A few hundred more need to be paid for servicing a current account.  Many financial institutions charge user fees only in those months when there is at least one transaction.  Certain deviations from the indicated values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be in those cases when a currency account is opened, not a ruble one.  Abroad, respectively, other prices for these services, which vary depending on local specifics. </p><h2>  Interaction with the tax service </h2>

    <p>  This information will be useful to those who are just thinking about opening an account.  The fact is that, according to the legislation of the Russian Federation, a legal entity, when opening a current account, must notify the tax service not later than 5 days after the completion of registration.  If you do not have time in time, then a fine is imposed.  In the absence of a desire to understand all the nuances yourself, you can entrust all questions specializing in this company.  The approximate cost of such a service will be about 2-3 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

In general, if an entrepreneur or manager has at least a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cash settlement system, this will allow him to better understand the affairs of a subordinate company, which is undoubtedly a significant plus.
