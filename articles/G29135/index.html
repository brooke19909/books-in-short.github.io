A foreman who is highly qualified in this matter is able to foresee these nuances.  Since the dishwasher combines both plumbing and electrical installation, water and electricity are in a successful, but very dangerous union.  Even small mistakes in such a serious matter as connecting a dishwasher can lead to undesirable and dangerous consequences.  In order to avoid this, it is better to entrust the connection process to an experienced specialist who regularly deals with equipment of this type. </p>

    <p>  You should know that this household appliance has special requirements for the quality of electrical wiring.  That is, you will need to lay a dedicated cable of increased cross section from the electrical panel, which will provide the possibility of a separate power supply for this device.  An additional <span>circuit breaker is</span> installed in the electrical panel itself <span>,</span> which performs a protective function in the event of an unexpected overload of the machine.  Also, when connecting a dishwasher, it is imperative to provide a grounding element, otherwise you will be shocked regularly.  In no case do you need to conduct a ground wire to the heating pipes, water supply, as well as gas pipes.  Such work, as mentioned above, is best entrusted to a qualified electrician, rather than interfering in the electrical network yourself, which is fraught with the possibility of fire, smoke, or electric shock. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Connecting a dishwasher requires special attention to the organization of water supply and its discharge.  It is also necessary that the surface under the machine is flat and hard.  The drain hose connected to the sewer must not exceed 1.5 meters in length, exceeding this parameter, you run the risk of losing the pump of the machine ahead of time due to excessive wear.  It is not recommended to use an extension cord, the machine should only be connected strictly to a power outlet. </p>

    <p>  Operation of the dishwasher is implied from the cold water supply system, it is believed that the machine connected in this way will work an order of magnitude longer.  There are options that allow you to connect from a faucet with hot water, but provided that the temperature of the incoming water is not more than 60 degrees C. This approach allows you to minimize temporary losses and energy spent on heating.  The only drawback of this type of connection is that during work on boiler rooms related to preventive maintenance, or during possible emergency outages, the machine will not be able to function, and the dishes will have to be washed by hand in cold water. </p><p>  There is still an option in which the connection of the dishwasher is carried out by means of a mixer, which allows you to choose between clean cold water and saving on hot water.  But mixers adapted to solve such a problem are quite expensive. </p>

    <p>  Before installing the <span>built-in dishwasher,</span> it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the classification of this appliance.  Distinguish between fully built-in machines and built-in with an open panel.  The first are completely hidden by a furniture set.  Management is via buttons located on the top end panel of the hinged door.  In turn, the machines of the second type are regulated using a control system located on the open part of the panel. </p><p>  Such machines are connected in a similar way and are very convenient in small kitchens.  It is recommended that all <span>types of dishwashers</span> be fully loaded with dishes, because when washing with an incomplete load, the <span>consumption of water,</span> energy, as well as detergents, does not decrease. </p><p>  To date, the market for such devices is represented by a wide variety of models and manufacturers.  The most famous companies in Russia are Bosch, Ariston, Electrolux, and so on. </p>
