    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  This is set by the bank.  Each institution offers its own conditions.  Somewhere they are beneficial to people, but somewhere they are not.  How does a credit card work in most banks?  She always has a bet, a limited period and amount.  Some have a grace period. </p><p>  The average rate on Russian banks is in the range of 24-35%.  Not always a low percentage means benefits, since an additional amount may be taken for insurance.  The lending period is usually 3-5 years. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  To receive a credit card, a client must meet certain requirements: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  age - from 18 to 70 years; </li><li>  good credit history. </li></ul>

It functions in the same way as the standard salary.  You can withdraw funds through an ATM if you need cash.  It is also possible to pay in stores for purchases and services. </p><p>  You just need to know before registration what interest is charged in each case, since the rates for receiving cash and for bank transfer usually differ.  It is necessary to pay the debt in a timely manner so that no fines are accrued, because of which a large amount will have to be returned. </p><h2>  Grace period </h2><p>  How does a <span>grace period work for a</span> credit card?  This feature is in almost every bank.  This is the period during which you can pay debt without interest.  Usually it is 50-60 days.  If during this period the loan is not paid, then the amount is recalculated at the current interest. </p>

    <p>  You can withdraw money through ATMs.  If the device belongs to the bank, then, as a rule, there will be no commissions for such services.  If the apparatus of another institution, then there will be a fee, the size of which may be different. </p><h2>  Repayment of a debt </h2><p>  It is necessary to pay the debt in a timely manner so that fines are not charged.  You can deposit funds in several ways: </p><ol><li>  Through the terminal of any bank - a commission of 2-5%. </li><li>  Depositing funds using transfers from other cards. </li></ol><p>  If you do not deposit funds in a timely manner, then the percentage valid under the contract will be established.  It is fixed.  Usually, a clear rate is set, specified in the contract, which is signed at the time of loan processing. </p><p>  Some banks provide a delay if the client does not have the opportunity to pay the debt.  Only this must be warned in advance.  In case of late payment, credit history worsens.  Then in the future it will be difficult to get a loan from this bank. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Using such programs from the bank has advantages and disadvantages.  From the pros, you can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  settlement in stores; </li><li>  bonuses and accumulations; </li><li>  Grace period; </li><li>  minimum requirements; </li><li>  clearance of large amounts; </li><li>  many payment options; </li><li>  Internet banking; </li><li>  registration of an online application. </li></ul><p>  Among the shortcomings are high interest rates, instability of the exchange rate (if the dollar card).  There is also a commission for cash withdrawals. </p><h2>  Offer from Sberbank </h2><p>  Do Sberbank credit cards work?  They are considered the most popular among Russian citizens, therefore they function without interruptions throughout the country.  The card has a grace period during which you can use the funds without interest.  Sberbank determines this period for 50-60 days. </p>
