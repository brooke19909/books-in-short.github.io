Among them is the sale or purchase of an apartment.  This procedure is characterized by many nuances that seem very complex. </p><p>  In an effort to protect themselves, people turn to agencies, but the work of realtors costs an impressive amount.  For example, residents of the capital and the Moscow region can give up to 150-200 thousand rubles for such services.  Naturally, there is a desire to save.  It turns out to buy or sell an apartment and save considerable money is quite real. </p><h2>  Should I turn to the services of real estate agencies? </h2><p>  Selling or buying an apartment on its own seems to many a very complicated procedure.  Of course, it’s much easier to turn to realtors for help, but do you really need their services?  In what cases can you do without an agency: </p><ul><li>  Are you sure that without realtors you will not be able to conduct a deal from start to finish on your own?  Read on carefully and understand that everything is not as complicated as it seems. </li><li>  Do you think that contacting realtors guarantees no risks?  Keep in mind that real estate agencies do not appear in sales transactions, since they are only intermediaries.  Realtors cannot give real guarantees; moreover, they themselves do not bear either financial or material risks. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Algorithm for the process of preparing an apartment purchase and sale transaction </h2><p>  Let's consider how to conduct a transaction using an example.  This will help us <noindex>  <span>step-by-step instructions for buying and selling an apartment</span> </noindex>  .  In this section you will find a guide that will lead you to the desired result, explaining each step and showing all the pitfalls that may occur when making a decision.  So how to get started: </p><ol><li>  Decide whether you are the seller or buyer.  Let's say your goal is to buy an apartment. </li><li>  If your own funds for the purchase of housing are not enough, read the terms of the mortgage.  Carefully read the information on obtaining ownership of the apartment. </li><li>  There are two real estate markets - primary and secondary.  For example, you plan to purchase housing in the secondary.  Please note that in this case, apartments with an already registered right of ownership are put up for sale.  Accordingly, even housing in a new building can belong to the secondary market. </li><li>  Following the steps of the instruction, we select the appropriate option.  Offers in the secondary market, as a rule, are much larger than in the primary.  If you buy an apartment for the purpose of your own residence, focus primarily on personal preferences.  The manual also gives access to the most complete and relevant databases of apartment offers. </li><li>  A suitable option has been found.  The apartment is inspected, the purchase decision is made.  What next?  Do not rush to make an advance payment.  There are many more points that should be clarified by the seller.  In particular, we are talking about whether the registration of ownership was carried out, who is registered in the apartment, whether there are persons under the age of majority among the owners, etc. Thanks to the information provided on the website "Apartment-without-agent.ru", you Do not miss a single important point. </li><li>  Prepayment.  A certain amount is transferred to the seller so that he no longer seeks another buyer while the process of collecting and checking documents is ongoing. </li><li>  The seller is preparing a package of documents that are necessary to purchase an apartment.  Then you as a buyer check them.  Independent determination of the “legal cleanliness of an apartment” includes an analysis of not only documents, but also the identity of the seller.  How to do this is described in detail in the instructions. </li><li>  All documents are carefully checked, it is time to transfer money.  In the secondary market, payments are usually made in cash.  Settlement through a bank cell is considered the most secure.  The instructions describe the various nuances of such calculations. </li><li>  The key stage of the transaction is the execution of an apartment purchase and sale agreement.  It is advisable to familiarize yourself with its text in advance.  The terms and conditions of the contract are also considered in detail at the corresponding step of the instruction. </li><li>  Registration of ownership of the acquired apartment.  It consists in entering data on new property rights into the Unified State Register. </li><li>  The final step is to sign the deed of transfer.  It may be compiled in any form.  The document is signed by both parties.  There is no need to register it. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, there is nothing particularly complicated in this procedure.  Buying or selling an apartment using the apartment-without-agent.ru resource algorithm is easy.  And one more important rule: in order to have a reasoned defense of your rights to the purchased apartment, keep all the documents that appeared in the process of preparing the transaction. </p></div></article>
