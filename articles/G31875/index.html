An original combination of textures, colors, applications, unusual decor and uniqueness are the main features of products in patchwork technology. </p><p>  The art of patchwork has been known since ancient times, and today it has received a second life.  In the past, housewives sewed items in patchwork technology due to the lack and high cost of fabrics, later this became a tradition, and the equipment was inherited.  Each craftswoman had her own original scheme for creating decor items. </p><p>  Bags in the style of patchwork have a unique design and, as a rule, exist in a single copy.  Masters do not like to repeat themselves, and each time they create with their own hands a bag in the patchwork style of the original color and in different techniques.  There are a great many technicians.  We will talk about some of them in this material.  Even a novice craftswoman will be able to create a stylish patchwork bag with her own hands.  And the detailed workshop presented below will help in this.  So, let's begin! </p><h2>  Features of the technique </h2><p>  Patchwork is a kind of needlework, the main feature of which is the creation of a fabric from rags of fabric.  The color scheme and texture of individual elements can be any.  Thanks to this patchwork canvas has an original design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.free-tutorial.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stylish patchwork accessory" class="if uuid-2809382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2809382.jpg"></div><p>  In the past, patchwork technique was used for the manufacture of interior and decor items: blankets, bedspreads, plaids;  covers for pillows, chairs, poufs;  tablecloths and curtains;  tacks.  Nowadays, craftsmen more often began to use the patchwork for decorating clothes and creating accessories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The technique of stitching textile flaps exists in large numbers.  Some masters develop their own authoring techniques.  The main techniques include the following: </p><ul><li>  Traditional.  This technique involves the use of geometrical flaps: squares, rectangles, stripes, triangles.  As a pad, a whole web is used.  The traditional technique is quite simple in execution and is suitable for beginner craftswomen. </li><li>  American  This technique combines traditional patchwork with stitch.  As a pad, a patchwork cloth is used.  The product turns out bilateral, it is supplemented with decorative lines. </li><li>  Japanese  A distinctive feature of oriental technique is a careful selection of color combinations of materials.  Often, masters lay out mosaic paintings from flaps or supplement applications with applications.  The stitch is also used in this technique, but more as a decorative element: a stitch can imitate a pattern, pattern, embroidery.  Making a patchwork bag in Japanese technique with your own hands is a difficult task requiring a high degree of skill. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese bag" class="if uuid-2809371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2809371.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Crazy.  The shape of the flaps of this technique can be different: regular and irregular geometric shapes, round in the form of silhouettes of people, birds, animals, fish, kitchen utensils, etc. Elements are sewn with decorative stitching, complemented with appliqu√©s, buttons, beads, beads, sequins, elements of felt wool.  This technique is considered aerobatics among patchwork masters. </li><li>  Knitted.  This technique involves the creation of a fabric of knitted elements.  You can use both knitting needles and a hook.  In the latter case, the product can be made more dense or, conversely, openwork.  As a rule, parts have a geometric shape, but this is not a prerequisite. </li></ul><p>  If you have not previously done needlework in patchwork technique, but want to sew a patchwork bag with your own hands, you should stop at the traditional method of manufacturing the canvas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bag in patchwork technique step by step </h2><p>  The main thing in the patchwork is accuracy and the right choice of colors.  The appearance of the future product directly depends on this.  Despite the fact that there are no strict rules, elements similar in color or pattern are more harmonious than chaotic combinations.  For work, you can use any pattern you like.  Photos of patchwork hand-sewn bags are presented below.  Products can be of any shape, their main highlight is color and texture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork bags" class="if uuid-2809369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2809369.jpg"></div><p>  In this master class, we will tell you how to sew a patchwork bag with your own hands.  The pattern is not needed, so in shape it will be a simple rectangle with long handles for easy wearing on the shoulder. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  To make a simple and stylish patchwork bag with your own hands, you need to prepare the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  The cloth.  It will take at least 2 types, the maximum number is not limited.  You can choose the right textile in the store or search in your own stocks.  Old tablecloths and curtains with original textures and colors, unnecessary clothes, etc. will do. Since we will make the bag in the traditional technique, the lining will be from a single piece of canvas.  You will need a 32-inch cut of 83 cm. </li><li>  Threads.  You can choose the thread in the tone of the fabric, but you can contrast.  In the latter case, the product will look very original. </li><li>  Glue non-woven.  The material is designed to seal the product.  Such a bag will be more durable and durable. </li><li>  Iron.  Useful for fixing non-woven fabric to the canvas and ironing seams. </li><li>  Tailoring scissors, ruler, roller cutting knife, sewing pins, pencil (crayon). </li><li>  Sewing machine. </li></ul><h2>  Patchwork </h2><p>  First of all, you need to collect a patchwork canvas.  The simplest versions of the traditional patchwork technique are paintings of square elements or stripes.  We suggest choosing the latter. </p><p>  Using a roller knife and a ruler, we cut the fabric into strips 83 cm long. The width can vary to your taste.  When calculating the width, consider the seam allowance (5-6 mm). </p><p>  Next, we fold the strips face to face in pairs and grind.  Stitched items are also paired with each other.  To create a DIY patchwork bag, you will need a canvas 32 cm wide, 83 cm long. </p><p>  The seams of the patchwork fabric must be ironed. </p><p>  Now glue the non-woven.  The material is laid out on a flat surface with the adhesive side up.  We lay on it a patchwork cloth.  We fix the non-woven sealant with a hot iron.  You need to move the iron in ‚Äústeps‚Äù and press it tightly for 8-10 seconds so that the material adheres firmly.  Excess non-woven cut off with scissors. </p><h2>  We sew a bag and lining </h2><p>  We put the glued patchwork cloth in half with the front side inward and grind the side seams of the future bag.  The distance from the edge is 5-6 mm. </p><p>  In the same way we sew a lining. </p><p>  Now you need to form the bottom of the bag.  To do this, use a ruler and a pencil to draw a square with a side of 5 cm at the bottom of the bag at the side edge. Marking should be done on both sides of the product.  Next, we straighten the markup and get the ‚Äúcorner‚Äù.  We fix it and sew along the line of the pencil.  We cut off the edge.  We do the same on the other hand and with a lining.  The bag took shape and became more voluminous. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bag bottom" class="if uuid-2807694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2807694.jpg"></div><h2>  Make pens </h2><p>  For the manufacture of pens you will need 2 strips of fabric 8 by 38 cm. We fold the strip in half and iron it.  Then we wrap the edges inward by about 1 cm and iron again.  The blank must be sewn on both sides.  In the same way we sew the second handle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make pens" class="if uuid-2807759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2807759.jpg"></div><h2>  Final assembly of the product </h2><p>  All the details of the future bag are ready, it remains to assemble the product and lay the final seams.  We take the front side and bend the edge inward, fasten with sewing pins or threads.  We do the same with the lining. </p><p>  We mark the places for fastening the handles on both sides of the product.  We measure 2 cm from the edge of the handles on both sides. </p><p>  We put the lining in the bag, align the seams and fix them with pins.  We attach the handles.  We lower them 2 cm inward between the bag and the lining, fasten with pins. </p><p>  Now the edge of the product must be sewn at a distance of 2 mm from the edge.  We lay the second line in one centimeter from the first.  She will fix the handles and make them more reliable.  We remove excess threads and pins. </p><p>  Stylish and original bag in patchwork technique is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="traditional bag" class="if uuid-2809373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2809373.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Following the master class described above, it is very simple to sew a patchwork bag with your own hands.
