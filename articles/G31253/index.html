Their images firmly took their place in the embroidery world.  Today, on shelves in handicraft stores and in collections of copyrighted designs, you can find hundreds of patterns of cross-stitch monkeys. </p><h2>  The secret meaning of handmade </h2><p>  Embroidered paintings are very symbolic.  They carry the energy of the needlewoman, multiplied by the secret meaning of the embroidered pattern.  In eastern practice of symbolism, a monkey is considered from two points of view.  On the one hand, this is an open, good-natured animal, on the other - an impulsive, unprincipled and wild creature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fabalabs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monkey on liana" class="if uuid-2935574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109904/2935574.jpg"></div><p>  Qualities of a monkey in oriental culture: </p><ol><li>  <em>Artistry.</em>  Imitation is the basis of human development.  On the evolutionary ladder, monkeys are several steps lower than humans, but artistry is no stranger to them either. </li><li>  <em>Cunning and selfishness.</em>  These negative qualities are by no means always bad: egoism, for example, serves a good service for personal development. </li><li>  <em>Optimism and extroversion.</em>  Communicability and curiosity of monkeys make them one of the symbols of various parties and travels. </li><li>  <em>Energy and power.</em>  Monkeys would never have acquired all these qualities, if not for their natural energy, instinctiveness and impulsivity. <blockquote>  A monkey embroidered with a cross and hung in a conspicuous place in your home or office will add you energy, spontaneity and liveliness. </blockquote></li></ol><h2>  The importance of monkeys in the culture of the peoples of the world </h2><p>  The symbol of the monkey has deep mythological significance in world culture.  Many peoples since ancient times have noted their connection with monkeys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  In Egypt, monkeys were revered and often considered more capable of learning than many people.  Also, monkeys were a symbol of the transience of time. </li><li>  In China, monkeys were the personification of acting, playing and thirsting for goals. </li><li>  In Japan, monkeys are considered the patrons and protectors of all children. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.marigold.gifts" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monkey - patron of children" class="if uuid-2935556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109904/2935556.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In India, monkeys are a symbol of loyalty, strength and readiness for self-sacrifice. </li><li>  In the Christian tradition, monkeys represent fall, greed and theft. </li></ul><blockquote><p>  The image of a monkey has a complex historical background and various interpretations in different parts of the world.  Cross-stitch with a monkey will give its owner a powerful boost of energy and strength. </p></blockquote><h2>  Monkeys in embroidery </h2><p>  There are countless cross stitch patterns with monkeys.  All of them are somehow connected with the above symbols and motives.  This means that monkeys almost always symbolize playfulness, narcissism, infantilism and countless different hooliganism.

Ripe banana in the picture will add richness to the image and bring good luck to the owner. <div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riolis Monkey Set" class="if uuid-2936000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109904/2936000.jpg"></div></li><li>  <em>Monkey girl.</em>  Charming monkey girl in a dress or with a mirror.  Such paraphernalia emphasizes femininity and inspires girls and women. </li><li>  <em>Little monkeys.</em>  This motif is great for a height meter or metric.  In addition, it is based on the Japanese tradition, where monkeys have always been the patrons of children. <div class="photo" data-original="www.hrisisart.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross stitch set &quot;Monkey&quot;" class="if uuid-2935541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109904/2935541.jpg"></div></li><li>  <em>Monkeys on palm branches or creepers.</em>  The pattern for embroidering the monkey with a cross, where the animal is in its natural habitat, will bring the living energy of childhood, joy and a few pranks to the owner‚Äôs house. </li><li><p>  <em>I see nothing, I hear nothing, I will not tell anyone.</em>  The incredibly popular image of three monkeys from Japan was also reflected in the embroidery, there are many variations of patterns with three monkeys, the most popular of which is the set of Dimensions "Three monkeys".  This picture is the best symbol of spiritual development, peace and purity. </p></li></ol>
