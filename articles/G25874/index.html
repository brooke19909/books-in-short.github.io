Over the past eleven years, the population of this city is only growing, and therefore there is a considerable need to provide everyone with housing.  Therefore, the <span>developers of Yekaterinburg</span> do not have to get bored, erecting more and more residential complexes.  One of these is the LCD "Change".  Yekaterinburg allocated a promising land plot for its construction in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKhrustalnogorskaya and Ekaterininskaya streets, which, in turn, have public transport stops within walking distance. </p>

    <h2>  Construction location </h2><p>  The complex took a very advantageous location - next to the Yekaterinburg ring road (in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Broad River), which allows its future residents to quickly get to work and other necessary places.  You can also quickly and easily get to the city center and back.  In the near future, it is planned to build a highway between the Shirokaya Rechka and Akademichesky microdistricts, which will provide even greater accessibility to the Peremena residential complex (Yekaterinburg). </p>

    <h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  What is a <span>residential complex?</span>  The developer designed two houses of variable height, reaching a height of 25 floors.  Both of them are being built using a monolithic-frame technology, which allows for the most convenient layout of apartments and high energy efficiency at home.  Apartments are rented to customers in fine finish.  LCD "Peremena" (Yekaterinburg) offers not very large apartments by area.  Families with a large number of children are unlikely to like the facilities that the complex offers to purchase.  Living in it is more likely to be suitable for small families with one child.  Since the apartments in the Peremena residential complex (Yekaterinburg) are mainly studios, one-room and two-room, this large complex is not suitable for a comfortable stay for a large family. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Of course, one cannot compare the ecological situation in the city itself and in the Peremena residential complex, Yekaterinburg and its outskirts.  Due to the abundance of industrial enterprises, the city is far from the first in terms of the purity of the atmosphere above it, and this can be explained: 60% of the region‚Äôs GDP is produced here, it is the largest transport hub in Russia.  And all this affects the air, its freshness, and in the end - the ability to inhale fully. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, those residents who have the opportunity to change their previous place of residence and move to more favorable environmental conditions, without hesitation, sell existing property and buy apartments in new buildings.  As a rule, developers try to erect modern houses in the countryside.  Rather, almost only there they allot land for construction. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure of the complex </h2><p>  Peremena residential complex (Yekaterinburg) provides for the possibility of developing the entire complex in terms of infrastructure in accordance with modern requirements for ensuring a comfortable stay for residents.  This means that there are specially designated concierge rooms at the entrance.  Modern passenger and freight elevators are also installed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As is currently accepted, it is planned to occupy all the first floors of residential buildings with non-residential premises, leased for various objects of social infrastructure: shops, pharmacies, children's clubs, dry cleaners.  A municipal kindergarten will be built near the complex so that its smallest residents can attend the institution, and their parents can work calmly.  Of course, the entire courtyard area will be ennobled, equipped with walking paths, alleys, a children's play and sports grounds. </p><h2>  Parking and territory entry </h2><p>  In addition, for owners of their own cars, the project provides ground and underground parking.  A double passage will also be laid along Ekaterininskaya Street in order to provide the residents and guests of the complex with the most favorable entry into its territory.  Also, due to this passage, it will be possible to equip parking for guests of apartment owners. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  LCD "Peremena" (Yekaterinburg), reviews of which are mostly positive, offers for purchase the following apartments: studios, one-room, two-room.  Studios have a total footage of up to thirty-three square meters.  One-room on average 40 square meters, and two-room - from fifty to sixty square meters. </p><p>  In addition to standard layouts, the complex also provides non-standard apartments, including kitchen-living rooms, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich can reach 24 square meters.  Thanks to this, two-room apartments can easily be turned into three-room apartments.  At the same time, their cost will be much cheaper, since the area remains within the limits provided for the two. </p>

This includes the installation of entrance safe doors, interior doors.  The windows are glazed with plastic double-glazed windows.  In addition, the developer makes glazing of loggias, glues white wallpaper for painting, lining the laminate.  The internal electrical wiring is completely carried out, plumbing and appliances for apartment water consumption, heat supply and electricity are installed.

    <h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  What is the LCD "Change" address?  Yekaterinburg, Sukhodolsky Street is within the boundaries of the city itself.  Therefore, its residents can rightfully use its entire infrastructure.  Until such social facilities as a kindergarten have been built, you can take your children to a preschool located opposite. </p><p>  Also within walking distance from the complex there is a Lenta hypermarket.  A few hundred meters will have to overcome older children to get to school.  And there are a lot of public transport stops nearby. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  LCD "Peremena" in Yekaterinburg, the feedback from real estate investors and tenants gathered not only positive.  There are negative statements.  Many are unhappy with the location of the complex.  Someone does not like some of his remoteness from the city itself. </p>

    <p>  But, of course, each of its residents can appreciate the opportunity to breathe fresh air, and not the exhaust gases of cars or industrial enterprises. </p><p>  The feedback was largely influenced by the reliable and stable reputation of the developer.  There were no dealers in their expectations.  All promised construction and finishing works were and are carried out within the time period specified by the documentation and agreements, which does not violate the rights of buyers of residential real estate.  The contract stipulates rather stringent conditions, especially with regard to pricing policy.  Everything is done in such a way that the developer unilaterally could not change the value of the apartments and thus violate the rights of equity holders. </p><p>  Residential buildings of the complex are being built in such a way as to protect the territory from winds and unauthorized persons.  The completion by the developer of the fine finish in the apartments will allow buyers of apartments in the complex to significantly save their efforts and money on the repair of the premises they acquired and immediately move into the apartments. </p><p>  All together the factors described allow us to believe that the feedback from the investors will continue to maintain only positive dynamics, because the developer honestly fulfills the obligations assumed in the project documentation for the object.  This means that the rights of buyers of residential real estate will not be violated and will not bring negative consequences.  Thus, there will be more and more positive reviews over time, as opposed to negative ones. </p>
