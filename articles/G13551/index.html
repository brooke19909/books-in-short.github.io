For many lovers of beach and sea holidays, a villa in the Maldives is a real dream.  Luxurious bungalows on the water and in the tropical thickets are created for solitude on the ocean coast and idle contemplation of natural beauty.  Currently, many hotels in an exotic country offer villas in the Maldives with their own beach and pool.  If you are going to the islands, you will probably be interested in information on how to choose the right bungalow and how much such a vacation will cost. </p><h2>  What is a pitchfork? </h2><p>  Villa in the Maldives is a luxurious house with all the necessary amenities, built on an island or on stilts above the waters of the lagoon.  In such a beautiful home you can spend an unforgettable vacation in the middle of the ocean, relax together or family on your own beach, swim in your own pool and have a nice evening in good company.  If you want peace, silence and exotic, then there is simply no better place than the Maldives. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.booking.com/hotel/mv/anantara-kihavah-villas-maldives.ru.html?aid=356993;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-mv-anantaraNkihavahNvillasNmaldives-unspec-ua-com-L%3Aru-O%3AwindowsS10-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=e3637965a61725d5e19bd32d5a3d34ce" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Villa Maldives" class="if uuid-2610040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2610040.jpg"></div><p>  The huge advantage of villas in the Maldives is that you can rent them yourself to spend time in seclusion, away from the noise of cities and the usual bustle.  It is on the islands that you can find an indescribable state of happiness and tranquility.  Maldivian bungalows are also good for relaxation, but the villas give greater privacy and a certain privacy.  It is worth saying that water villas in the Maldives are chosen by spoiled for comfort people who value a combination of privacy and a high level of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What do tourists need to know? </h2><p>  In order to choose a suitable <span>island in the Maldives,</span> you must first understand what villas it has and how good they are. </p><p>  The main feature of tourist buildings is the use of natural materials.  They are used not only for construction, but also for interior decoration.  Usually in the premises there is a luxurious wooden furniture, the ceilings are also decorated with precious wood.  The coolness reigning inside the rooms gives a feeling of freshness and lightness after the tropical heat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rbcollection.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water Villas in the Maldives" class="if uuid-2610048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2610048.jpg"></div><p>  For a romantic getaway, you can rent villas on the water in the Maldives in one of the five-star hotels.  These apartments are usually equipped with glass floors, through which you can admire the lagoon with a coral bottom.  Without leaving the terrace, you can admire the marine life. </p><h2>  What villas are there? </h2><p>  Villas in the Maldives (photo is given in the article) have their own characteristics.  They come in different types depending on their purpose: </p><ol><li>  Garden villas are fairly small and the cheapest apartments in the depths of the island.

Holidays in such apartments will be truly unforgettable for you. </p><h2>  What is the difference between a beach villa and a water villa? </h2><p>  The main difference of a water villa is its location.  The apartments are located directly above the lagoon.  The walls of the villas are made of glass with panoramic views.  Tourists say that admiring the ocean through the floor-to-ceiling windows is something amazing.  In addition, houses on the water are often equipped with glass floors, allowing you to contemplate the underwater world of a tropical reef.  The villas are equipped in such a way that their inhabitants relaxed comfortably and do not care about anything.  In fact, guests need to go to the island itself only in the restaurant and in the fitness center.  Even spa treatments and massages are available for you right in the apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.koamastravel.com/koamas_resort-villas/lux-villa-at-lux-maldives_2122_1292.html" data-original="www.koamastravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villas Maldives photo" class="if uuid-2610060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2610060.jpg"></div><p>  Beach villas in the Maldives, as their name implies, are equipped with their own beaches with clean sand.  These apartments are usually located a few steps from the water, right on the coast.  Private vacation on your own beach will give an unforgettable experience.  Nearby are tropical palm trees, in the shade of which you can contemplate the beauty of the ocean.  Even the most ordinary villa allows you to relax in solitude and silence, which is completely impossible within the walls of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the villas in the Maldives, you can find the most luxurious apartments, consisting of several floors, equipped with a <span>sliding roof,</span> private pool, slide, which takes you into the ocean, a terrace and a jacuzzi.  The high cost of such mansions does not bother wealthy people at all.  Villas are incredibly popular, they are booked a couple of months before the holidays. </p><h2>  "All inclusive" </h2><p>  Most of the five-star hotels in the Maldives offer their guests an all-inclusive vacation.  Tourists have the opportunity to relax in a beach villa, without worrying about alcohol and food.  The doors of the restaurant and bars are open for guests at any time of the day or night.  The cost of food in this case was originally laid down in the residence, so you can use the services without restrictions. </p><h2>  Cost of rest for two </h2><p>  What is the cost of holidays in the villas of the Maldives?  Hotels on the islands typically offer five- and four-star services.  Nevertheless, the cost of tours to different islands may vary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maldivesexclusive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Villa Maldives" class="if uuid-2610068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2610068.jpg"></div><p>  The price of a ticket largely depends not only on which island you have chosen, but also on the category of the villa itself.  As a rule, water apartments are more expensive than island ones.  Yes, and having your own beach and pool makes the tour more expensive.  Additional costs include butler service and room service. </p><p>  On average, the cost of renting a villa in the Maldives can be divided into three categories: </p><ol><li>  Cheap - $ 200-750 per day (prices vary in different seasons). </li><li>  Luxurious - 750-1200 dollars per day. </li><li>  Exclusive villas in boutique hotels - 1200-5000 dollars per night. </li></ol><p>  However, there are pleasant exceptions that are more acceptable for ordinary tourists.  For example, some hotels offer budget, but comfortable apartments that resemble small cottages.  Such villas will cost only $ 150 per day during the low season.  And living in a presidential apartment can cost up to 10 thousand dollars a day. </p><h2>  Recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Experienced tourists believe that relaxing in a villa in the Maldives is not a cheap pleasure.  But the vacation spent on the islands, you will definitely remember.  Travelers recommend going on vacation in the low season.  At this time, there are few vacationers, so accommodation will be cheaper, guests receive good discounts.  Of course, light rains and a bit of cloudy weather are possible, but this will not spoil your vacation. </p><p>  The high season on the islands lasts from December to April.  The cost of living at this time is the highest, especially during the New Year and Christmas.  Apartments should be booked in advance, because two or three months before the expected date there are no places. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.qantas.com/hotels/properties/34074-veligandu-island-resort-spa" data-original="www.qantas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water Villa Maldives" class="if uuid-2610070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2610070.jpg"></div><p>  The low season starts in May and lasts until November.  The only month when you should not fly to the islands is July.  In the middle of summer, tropical rains pour.  The rest of the low season, you can well rest.
