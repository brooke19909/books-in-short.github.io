A large number of tourists come here to get acquainted with local attractions. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rattlesnake key sergiev posad" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/156420.jpg" width="400"></div>  Sergiev Posad (whose photo is usually placed on <span>advertising booklets)</span> is located in close proximity to the Gremyachiy Klyuch waterfall, which is the main attraction of these places.  Currently, a large number of people make an annual pilgrimage to these places.  Also, a large number of ordinary tourists who are interested in various historical monuments come here.  A mass congestion of people at the waterfall can be seen on <span>religious holidays.</span>  The main of these holidays is Baptism.  On this day, a lot of people come to the Gremyachiy Klyuch waterfall (Sergiev Posad) to bathe in the <span>holy spring,</span> which is first consecrated by church representatives. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sergiev posad photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/156423.jpg" width="400"></div>  The sources located at the waterfall are completely cultivated.  People built stairs near them, installed benches, etc.  To the sources located at the Gremyachiy Klyuch waterfall (Sergiev Posad), there are gutters through which water flows.  It flows into specially designated containers that look like the heads of fabulous monsters.  Those who wish can collect water from these containers.  Not far from this place are buildings erected from natural wood.  Bathrooms are always open for visitors, with equipped locker rooms and lounges.  According to its external data, the main bathhouse resembles a church.  Between the baths laid paths lined with boards to exclude the possibility of injury to people in the event of an accidental fall.  For believers, a chapel has been built in which they can calmly pray. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="code sergiev posad" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/156426.jpg" width="600"></div>  The complex of these buildings is an ancient <span>architectural monument.</span>  In order for visitors to get to the baths open at the Gremyachiy Klyuch waterfall (Sergiev Posad), you should cross the Vondiga river.  More recently, the main buildings were located on the right side of the river, and on the left side you could see a wooden gatehouse, next to which was the structure of a wooden church.  In the change house, which was located near the descent to the baths, it was possible to purchase various containers for water from local sources <br><br>  Today, everything has changed here thanks to large-scale construction and refinement of the surrounding territory.  Not far from the baths appeared a garden, which is planted with seedlings of various fruit trees.  The only thing that the change has not touched is the road that leads from the roadway to the springs.  Under adverse weather conditions, this road becomes completely impassable.  A large number of vehicles usually accumulate at the side of the road, as visitors get to the springs themselves on foot.  In the middle of the path for tourists there is a place to relax, where they can relax and eat.  This parking can also be reached by car, but only one that can move in extreme conditions and overcome various obstacles. <br><br>  The road from the parking lot to the source is quite flat.  Its main part passes through the field, and the other through the local semi-abandoned village.  Near the waterfall Gremyachiy Klyuch (Sergiev Posad) there are two villages called Vzglyadnevo and Botovo.  You can find out more accurate information by calling the administration of this tourist complex directly by dialing the city code (Sergiev Posad) in front of the phone number.
