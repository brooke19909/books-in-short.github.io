And this is a big omission, because the vast experience accumulated by generations is forgotten every day. </p><p>  In a world where everything is ruled by a computer, handicrafts, which can be useful, go by the wayside.  Few people today are fond of drawing, burning, carving or embroidery.  Of course, everyone chooses his own hobbies, but good skills should not be forgotten.  This article will focus on embroidery, in particular, what is embroidery with ribbons.  Poppies, roses, grapes, daisies and many other patterns can be created using a needle and a pair of short ribbons of different colors.  And embroidery ribbons for beginners will help to master the basics of this fascinating needlework. </p><p>  <span>Embroidery with ribbons</span> for beginners involves first a simple learning elementary stitches, which in the future will allow you to create beautiful creations made by yourself.  What is needed for this?  First you need to stock up on a canvas, a needle with a thick eye so that you can thread a ribbon or braid, as well as multi-colored ribbons and ribbons of different widths from which a pattern will be created. </p><p>  There are many different stitches for <span>embroidering ribbons,</span> for starters it is enough to master a few of them. </p><p>  1. In order to create the stalk and outline of any pattern, the following type of embroidery is perfect.  It is necessary to thread the ribbon on the front side and make a stitch about a centimeter and a half, then pull the ribbon for the new stitch from the middle of the previous one from the back so that the next stitch overlaps the previous one by about half a centimeter.  Such stitches make the strip even, it will be possible to avoid interruption, which will look very nice, like a contour or a stalk of a flower. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Flower petals or leaves can be made with regular stitches of different lengths.  To do this, you do not need to turn the needle in any way.  Such stitches are suitable for embroidering petals of chamomile or other flowers.  As mentioned earlier, <span>embroidery with ribbons for beginners</span> does not contain any difficulties. </p><p>  3. To create a roughness on the edge of the leaf or petal, it is necessary to embroider the tip with a needle when embroidering simple stitches and fold it at the end.  An illustration of such stitches can be viewed on the Internet.  They are very easy to perform, but make the picture more interesting. </p><p>  4. Using ribbons, you can create beautiful roses.  This can be done as follows.  First you need to make loops through which the tape will pass.  Further, in a circular motion, the ribbon passes either from below or from above the loops, forming a spiral bud and making the rose very simple to perform, but beautiful and voluminous. </p><p>  5. <span>The vine</span> can be created using knotted stitches.  To do this, when sticking the needle into the canvas, you need to double-wrap the tape around the needle and pull it in such a way as to make a knot.  Making several such knots next to each other will result in a beautiful and voluminous vine or tansy, depending on how far the imagination goes and what pattern you want to depict. </p><p>  <span>Ribbon embroidery</span> for beginners quickly develops into a professional mastery of this technique, because it is very beautiful and elegant, and therefore it can be used for any purpose and for different occasions.  For example, New Year's embroidery with ribbons will be a great addition to decorating a house before the holidays.  You can add more flowers and get a beautiful pattern on the eighth of March. </p><p>  You should not limit your imagination, because this technique can be used on different occasions, and its use is very simple, and most importantly, beautiful, feminine and delicate. </p>
