    <h2>  Why "anti-crisis"? </h2><p>  To begin with, we‚Äôll try to understand why <span>Megafon‚Äôs</span> ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù <span>tariff plan</span> is called anti-crisis.  After all, it was not without reason that they gave him such an original name, right? </p><p>  Indeed, all this is not just.  The thing is that this tariff is a very advantageous offer for those whose family and relatives use the Megafon mobile operator.  After all, calls for such subscribers will be absolutely free.  Of course, inside your home region. </p><p>  In addition, another pleasant surprise that may surprise many customers is that the Megafon ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù tariff plan is the absence of a monthly fee.  That is, you will spend money only on SMS messages and conversations with other subscribers, as well as on calls to landline numbers and the Internet.  Great offer, right?  Let's do a little review of the ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù tariff to understand better what is being said. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conversation in the home region </h2><p>  The first thing you should start with is to learn more about conversations within your home region.  After all, this moment is attracting customers to the tariff plan. </p>

    <p>  As already mentioned, all calls to Megafon within the network will be absolutely free.  But only 20 minutes a day.  Next, you will pay 60 cents per minute.  With all this, it does not matter what tariff your subscriber is connected to.  The main thing is that it be a <span>Megaphone.</span>  <span>The tariff plan "Go to zero"</span> is the most advantageous offer for those whose environment mainly uses this mobile operator.  But in cases where your comrades use the communication of other operators, do not worry. </p><p>  The thing is that the prices for all calls within the region are really anti-crisis.  In cases when you have the additional option "All numbers" enabled, you will pay only 60 kopecks per minute of conversation.  And without it - 1 ruble 20 kopecks.  As you can see, not very high prices.  So, for example, at Beeline with a similar tariff, you will pay about 2 rubles for a conversation with another operator.  Prices for <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãnumbers</span> are saved - 1.2 rubles per minute.  But that's not all surprises from Megafon.  The tariff plan "Go to zero" has prepared a lot of interesting points.  And now we learn about them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In Russia and other countries </h2><p>  Now it is worth paying attention to such a moment as making calls to Russia or to any other countries.  Indeed, for a modern client it is very important to know how much it will cost him to call to the most remote places in the country.  For example, to your close relatives who now live very far from you. </p><p>  In Russia, calls to Megafon will cost 3 wheels per minute.  Other operators and city numbers are much more expensive - 12.5 rubles.  In fact, if you think that these are high prices, then you can compare this item with other mobile operators and tariffs.  There you will pay as much as 2 times more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about the tariff plan megaphone go to zero" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867766.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tariff plans from the Megafon company have recently been more and more often aimed at expanding the circle of contacts outside of Russia and your home region.  That is, the emphasis is on foreign calls.  What did <span>Megafon</span> prepare for us <span>(the tariff plan</span> "Go to zero")? </p><p>  Customers can call South Ossetia, Georgia, the Baltic States, the CIS, Abkhazia and Ukraine for only 32.5 rubles per minute.  To Europe - for 63 rubles.  This is not so much.  Especially when you consider that not many are ready to talk with residents of other countries for days.  Calls to other countries will cost 97 rubles.  For example, for the money you can safely talk to Japan.  Very profitable.  If you think about it, then other operators for such calls will charge you from 100 to 200 rubles.  Anyway, this is higher than the "Megaphone". </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Well, now we‚Äôll talk a little bit about what today's tariff offers regarding messages and MMS.  After all, this is exactly what customers will spend their main traffic on.  In addition, SMS messages are now also almost an essential part of modern communication. </p>

    <p>  If you connect yourself an additional SMS XXS service package, then all messages to numbers in your home region will cost ... 0 rubles.  That is, they will be free.  You already pay a small fee for the additional service.  Otherwise, without options, you will be charged 1.6 rubles per SMS.  But if you decide to write to Megafon outside the region, you will have to pay only 3 rubles per message.  The same amount is charged for writing SMS to numbers of other mobile operators throughout Russia.  Regarding MMS, we can only say that regardless of your location, you will pay 7 rubles for one such message.  Reviews about the <span>tariff plan "Megaphone"</span> - "Go to zero", as a rule, start with this particular feature.  Moreover, customers note that this mobile operator and tariff plan has a very correct and advantageous position regarding messages.  Well, and we continue to study our today's "object". </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  What else went unnoticed?  What function does almost every modern user use on a mobile phone?  Of course, this is the mobile Internet.  And it‚Äôs about him that we‚Äôll talk now.  Indeed, without it, as a rule, not a single modern client can do.  And overpay for this service is not very willing. </p><p>  The thing is that if you have a special package called ‚ÄúInternet XS‚Äù connected, then for 1 MB of traffic you will not pay anything.  But in cases where these capabilities are not available, it will be necessary to pay 9.9 rubles per megabyte of Internet.  In fact, this is a significant amount if you are actively downloading data using your gadget.  Nevertheless, you can give away 150 rubles a month and enjoy the connected Internet XS service package. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, it's time to take stock of our talk today.  In order to start using the "Go to zero" tariff, you can buy a specific SIM card, connect this tariff (the cost of the transfer is 200 rubles), or send SMS to 000146 with the text 2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff plans from the company megaphone" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867764.jpg" width="600"></div>
