How to find out the cadastral value?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cadastral value of real estate is the most important indicator from the point of view of the most diverse types of legal relations with the participation of citizens of the Russian Federation, authorities, organizations.  Due to the high significance of the relevant characteristics, its definition is quite strictly regulated by law.  What is the cadastral value of real estate?  How to find out about an object of interest? </p><h2>  Determination of cadastral value </h2><p>  You can find out the official cadastral value of real estate for free on the Rosreestr.net service at this link - <noindex>  <span>https://rosreestr.net/uznat-kadastrovuyu-stoimost-nedvijimosti</span> </noindex>  . </p><p><noindex>  To check, enter the cadastral number or the full address of the object in the search bar.  Here you can see the current cadastral value. </noindex></p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Object screenshot" class="if uuid-3285230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/3285230.jpg?1571158171"></div><p><noindex>  If you need to lower the cadastral value in order to reduce the tax, then you will need a certificate of cadastral value.  It can also be ordered online with digital printing in electronic form.  After completing the application, the certificate will be sent by e-mail, usually within 24 hours. </noindex></p><p>  Cadastral value is the value of real estate calculated and fixed by the state structure - Rosreestr.  This agency also has a full name, namely the Federal Service of Cadastre and Cartography.  The criteria by which Rosreestr determines the value of real estate can be very different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861245.jpg?1571158051"></div><p>  Now, market indicators are considered to be such - those that reflect the specifics of pricing for real estate in a city or region, based on supply and demand mechanisms.  The cadastral value of real estate today, therefore, can be as close to market as possible. </p><h2>  The specifics of the cadastral valuation of land </h2><p>  There are certain features that characterize the entry of information on land plots into the records of the Rosreestr.  Consider the relevant specifics. </p><p>  The cadastral value of land is not its only possible characteristic.  Along with that, there is also the market and regulatory price of the plots.  In this case, the cadastral value is the value that is determined on the basis of land valuation taking into account its class, current level of <span>market prices,</span> and also the value of rental rates.  The main source of law governing the procedure for entering information about the plots in the Rosreestr record is the Law on Valuation Activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861242.jpg?1571158051"></div><p>  The cadastral value of land is the most important category in terms of calculating the tax on the corresponding type of property.  Its size is directly determined by the results of the actions of Rosreestr.  The cadastral appraisal procedure for the territory is also important for establishing statutory restrictions on the use of the appropriate type of property, such as leasing or redeeming it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Regarding the land plot, the cadastral value is the value, which is also formed on the basis of its area, the category of the zone in which it is located.  The specificity of the corresponding assessment is that it should be reviewed every 5 years.  Rosreestr, thus, forms lists of sites that need cadastral valuation. </p><h2>  What is the cadastral value used for? </h2><p>  For what purpose does the Rosreestr calculate and record buildings and structures in the relevant records?  The cadastral value of real estate can, as we noted above, affect the amount of land tax, as well as property tax, which is charged by the state from owners of apartments, houses and other objects.  The legislation governing the appropriate type of collection in Russia suggests that the numbers entered in the Rosreestr record will be exactly the same as the market ones.  But a similar norm was introduced only in 2015.  Prior to this, real estate tax was calculated on the basis of its <span>inventory value,</span> as a rule, several times lower than the cadastral <span>value</span> . </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861243.jpg?1571158051"></div><p>  The cadastral value of the property is an important criterion for the sale of the respective objects.  What is this expressed in?  In order to carry out a transaction for the sale of an apartment or house, it is necessary to issue a <span>cadastral passport</span> of the property.  At the same time, it is highly desirable that this document be fresh.  The fact is that the cadastral value is the value that can periodically change based on adjustments in the Rosreestr records. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cadastral value tax specificity </h2><p>  We will study the basic information about the marked tax that property owners must pay to the budget.  We said above that since 2015, the cadastral value is actually a market valuation of real estate.  Before the relevant norms were enshrined in the legislation, real estate tax was calculated on the basis of its inventory value.  She could be several times lower than the cadastral.  Therefore, deductions of the order of 0.1-0.3% from it, which citizens had to pay to the budget, were not too strong a financial burden. </p><p>  However, the legislator decided that the tax calculation should not be based on inventory, but on cadastral value.  What is this innovation?  In all likelihood, the corresponding initiative was implemented by the authorities in order to increase budget revenues.  At the same time, the formula for calculating the tax on the basis of the cadastral value is still different from that used in the inventory indicators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861240.jpg?1571158051"></div><p>  Thus, a proportional increase in the financial burden on homeowners is not expected - despite the fact that the basis for calculating tax in most cases increases several times.  This is possible due, firstly, to the tax deductions stipulated by law, based on the type of real estate and its area, and secondly, due to the fact that until 2019 the Russian Federation has established a transitional period from the old <span>system of calculating</span> fees to the new, when determining the amount actual payments to the budget, reduction factors may be involved. </p><p>  The tax formula in question thus consists of three components: </p><p>  - cadastral value of the object, close to market; </p><p>  - a deduction determined on the basis of the type of real estate and its area; </p><p>  - reducing coefficients. </p><p>  However, in absolute terms, the tax determined on the basis of the cadastral value of real estate is usually higher than when the base for calculating the fee is based on inventory indicators. </p><h2>  How to find out the cadastral value of real estate? </h2><p>  The cadastral value of an apartment is official information that is provided to citizens by Rosreestr.  There are several ways by which you can get it at this department.  The first option is to use the online resources available to citizens on the agency‚Äôs website.  The second is to see the current cadastral passport of the object.  There is a third option.  It involves contacting directly the Rosreestr structures operating in a specific region.  We study the mechanisms noted in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861244.jpg?1571158051"></div><h2>  Working with the Rosreestra website: extract from the State Committee for State Revenue </h2><p>  Firstly, this can be done by ordering an extract from the State Property Committee.  How to use this option?  You need to go to the main page of the website of Rosreestr, and then go to the section associated with services for individuals.  Next, you need to select the service ‚ÄúObtaining information from the State Committee for State Revenue‚Äù.  After that, you must fill out the online form and send the appropriate application to the agency.  If the document is filled out correctly, then upon sending it, the system will issue a control number.  It will need to be recorded - it can be used to track at what stage the application is at.  The relevant information from the State Property Committee, including the cadastral value of the object, the agency must provide the applicant within 5 days after receipt of the documents. </p><h2>  Public Cadastral Map </h2><p>  Secondly, a citizen can obtain the necessary information by using the interface of the ‚ÄúPublic Cadastral Map‚Äù, which is presented on the website of the Federal Register of Regions.  How should I use the appropriate service?  The cadastral value of real estate is a collection of information that is identified by a special number. </p><p>  A citizen planning to use the service in question should know him.  Having opened the online map, you must enter the cadastral number in the appropriate fields, after which the system should give the person information about the property of interest.  However, the information displayed on the card cannot be considered legally significant.  It is for reference only. </p><h2>  Online reference </h2><p>  Thirdly, you can use the online service "Reference Information" on the website of Rosreestr.  If we are interested in the cadastral value of an object - this is also an entirely acceptable option for its receipt.  This online service can be found in the Electronic Services section.  As with the card, it is advisable to know the cadastral number of the property.  However, it may well turn out that the address of the building is enough. </p><h2>  Data Fund Information </h2><p>  There is another interesting option for using the resources of the Rosreestr website.  So, on the corresponding portal there is a service with which you can get information of interest from the Cadastral Valuation Data Fund.  Information gets there as a result of actions of regional or municipal authorities.  In order to use this service, you need to enter the ‚ÄúIndividuals‚Äù section, and then select the option that reflects the desire to receive data from the Fund.  In this case, you will also need the <span>cadastral number of the property.</span>  The service is convenient in that it can be used to generate and download a report that reflects how the cadastral value of the building was determined.  This is very important information for many citizens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861239.jpg?1571158051"></div><h2>  Offline interaction with Rosreestr </h2><p>  If the necessary information on the Rosreestr website was not found or it was not possible to use the marked services, then you can contact the agency in the manner of, so to speak, an offline request.  To do this, you will need to go to the territorial office of Rosreestr or to the city MFC - the one that has the competence in providing information from the cadastral registry.  You can also send a request to the agency by mail.  Many citizens believe that it is most convenient to find out through an offline parameter such as the cadastral value, that this is the most optimal option for interaction with Rosreestr.  It can also be noted that the documents received in the order of offline interaction between the property owner and the agency are, as a rule, quite official and have legal significance. </p><h2>  When the numbers are too big </h2><p>  Situations may arise when the corresponding figures determined by Rosreestr in relation to the property are objectively higher than the market, as a result of which the amount of tax that citizens must pay to the budget also increases.  The legislation of the Russian Federation governing the appraisal actions of Rosreestr provides for the protection of the interests of owners in such cases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-861241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/861241.jpg?1571158051"></div><p>  So, a citizen who believes that the cadastral value of a plot calculated by Rosreestr is an indicator that does not objectively reflect the state of affairs in the market, can defend his position in court or through interaction with the agency within the framework of mechanisms established by law.  In order to challenge the figures determined by Rosreestr, a citizen should provide documentary evidence.  These may be: </p><p>  - acts that confirm the inaccuracy of the information recorded in the registry; </p><p>  - documents reflecting the market value of the property; </p><p>  - expert opinions on compliance with the law of mechanisms for determining the cost of housing, which are involved by a citizen. </p><p>  It is advisable to begin interaction with the Rostreestr on the adjustment of data relating to cadastral valuation within six months after the relevant information in the records of the department has been updated.  If the costs associated with the preparation of the necessary documents that are aimed at refutation <noindex>  figures from Rosreestra, tangible for a citizen - he has the right to apply to the court with a claim for compensation of expenses at the expense of the department. </noindex></p>
