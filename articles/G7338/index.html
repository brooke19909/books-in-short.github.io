    <h2>  Peace treaties </h2><p>  The foreign policy of the USSR in 1953-1964 was focused primarily on establishing peaceful mutually beneficial cooperation with foreign countries.  At the initiative of the Soviet leadership, many agreements were signed.  So, in 1953, on July 27, an armistice agreement was signed in Korea.  The leadership of the country saw the expansion of the scope of cooperation with other states as the main means of easing tension on the world stage.  In 1955, on January 25, the Presidium of the Armed Forces adopted a decree ending the state of war with Germany.  In September of that year, the head of the German government arrived in Moscow.  During the visit, diplomatic relations were established with West Germany.  In 1955, in mid-May, an agreement was signed with Austria.  In accordance with it, the state of war was also terminated.  The document established <span>state sovereignty</span> and guaranteed neutrality. </p><p>  In 1956, the USSR returned the leased territory of Finland - Porkkala-Udd, where the Union's naval base was located.  In mid-June, the Karelian-Finnish Union Republic was transformed into an autonomous one.  In the same 1956, on October 19, Japan and the USSR adopted a declaration on the restoration of diplomatic relations and the cessation of martial law.  By the end of the 50s, the Soviet Union was bound by trade contracts with more than 70 states. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foreign policy of the USSR 1953-1964 (briefly) </h2><p>  Key areas were identified at the <span>XX Party Congress.</span>  Khrushchev announced at the meeting that there was no inevitability of the next world war, pointing out the possibilities of different paths to the transition to a socialist system and the peaceful neighborhood of countries with different political systems.  The documents of the congress emphasized the loyalty of the Soviet Union to the principles of independence and sovereignty in cooperation with foreign countries.  Moreover, Khrushchev argued that the coexistence of states in the world acts as a specific type of class struggle.  It excludes only military methods and does not extend to ideology.  In 1957, the Foreign Ministry was headed by a major diplomat Gromyko.  The foreign ministry was under his leadership until 1985.  Gromyko made a great contribution to the development of the negotiation process on the issue of establishing control over the arms race. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR foreign policy in 1953 1964" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1249683.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Changes in Military Doctrine </h2><p>  In 1956, a certain inconsistency of the foreign policy of the USSR of 1953-1964 appeared.  A number of foreign countries formed blocks whose activities were aimed, inter alia, at deterring the influence of the states of the socialist camp and the formation of the national liberation movement of the colonial peoples. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1956, the <span>military doctrine of the</span> Soviet Union was amended.  They were due to the transition from mass use of soldiers on the battlefield to nuclear missile confrontation.  The world's first intercontinental ballistic missile was successfully tested in 1957. It had a considerable range and could reach the territory of the United States.  Since 1959, the serial production of these missiles was launched, followed by the equipping of the air defense forces, air and ground forces, and the construction of an underwater nuclear missile fleet also began.  America, observing all this, understands that the Soviet Union could well strike back in the event of a new war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foreign policy of the ussr 1953 1964" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1249684.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Conflict with the USA </h2><p>  Despite the active buildup of nuclear missile potential, the foreign policy of the USSR 1953-1964.  nevertheless focused on cooperation with states in various fields.  The key to this was the relationship with the United States.  From September 15 to September 27, 1959, <span>Khrushchev paid a visit to America.</span>  During it, Nikita Sergeevich was adopted by Eisenhower, spoke at the National Press Club and at the UN General Assembly, met with farmers, businessmen.  In the summer of 1961, the return visit of the American president was supposed.  But on May 1, while on the rostrum of the Mausoleum, Khrushchev learned that a U.S. spy plane had invaded the country's airspace and was shot down near Sverdlovsk.  The Soviet leadership sent a note of protest.  In response, the American government announced a ‚Äúnavigational error‚Äù because it did not know that, contrary to the instructions, the pilot remained alive, rather than blowing himself up.  Accordingly, he was captured.  Soviet authorities published the testimony of the pilot and convicted the United States of lies.  Eisenhower refused to apologize.  His visit to the USSR was canceled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of foreign policy of the ussr in 1953 1964" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1249685.jpg" width="558"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  New negotiations </h2><p>  Foreign policy of the USSR in 1953-1964  assumed a tough positioning of the country on the world stage in the context of increasing military-industrial potential.  This, no doubt, exacerbated international tension.  In early June 1961, negotiations between the Soviet leadership and Kennedy in Vienna took place.  At the meeting, the parties tried to discuss the German question and ban nuclear tests.  Khrushchev proposed signing a peace agreement with the two Germanys in accordance with the actual existing borders, declaring West Berlin a free city.  But this offer was rejected.  In turn, Kennedy was unable to achieve a ban on nuclear testing.  On August 13, the Berlin Wall was erected.  She became the real embodiment of the "Iron Curtain" that divided Europe.  In September, the Soviet Union, abandoning an agreement with America to ban nuclear explosions, conducted a series of tests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR foreign policy 1953 1964 briefly" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1249686.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <h2>  Caribbean crisis </h2><p>  Foreign policy in the USSR in 1953-1964  It was focused primarily on establishing military parity with the United States.  In 1962, a danger arose for bilateral relations.  The situation escalated in connection with the decision of the Soviet Union to deploy medium-range missiles in Cuba.  America, in turn, began preparations for the invasion.  However, almost at the last moment, Khrushchev and Kennedy had a telephone conversation, during which the leaders managed to come to a compromise.  As a result, the United States withdrew missiles from Turkey, and the Soviet Union from Cuba. </p><p>  <span>The Caribbean crisis</span> is considered the climax of the confrontation between the USSR and the West.  After it began a period of relative discharge.  In 1963, an agreement was concluded in Moscow between the Soviet Union, England and America on the ban on nuclear tests under water, in space and the atmosphere.  In a short time, more than 100 states joined the agreement.  After the death of Kennedy and the displacement of Khrushchev, the process of discharge was interrupted. </p><h2>  ATS </h2><p>  Foreign policy in the USSR in 1953-1964  It was aimed at establishing cooperation not only with Western countries, but also with its immediate neighbors.  The socialist camp at that time included Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, and Albania.  Together with the Soviet Union, they created the ATS (Warsaw Pact Organization).  Its participants committed themselves to provide mutual assistance in the event of a military threat, and to cooperate in work to ensure security and peace.  In addition, consultations were expected on issues related to common interests.  From this moment began the formation of a united army, a common command. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of foreign policy of the ussr in 1953 1964" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1249687.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  CMEA </h2><p>  Foreign policy in the USSR in 1953-1964  assumed large-scale assistance to the countries of the social camp in the construction of industrial facilities in their territories.  The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) has become a key center of relations.  The key areas of cooperation were: </p><ol><li>  Coordination of national economic plans. </li><li>  Trade. </li><li>  Cultural connections. </li><li>  Interaction in the field of science and technology. </li></ol><p>  Cuba subsequently joined this collaboration.  In 1958-1964, by the decision of the CMEA, the Druzhba oil pipeline, the largest in the world, was built.  Its length was more than 4.5 thousand km.  In 1959-1962  the general power system Mir was created.  She connected the networks of the Soviet Union and the <span>socialist countries of</span> Europe.  At the same time, the USSR took over most of the costs.  The Soviet leadership also tried to establish relations with Yugoslavia.  In 1955, a declaration was signed between representatives of countries, in accordance with which areas of cooperation in the cultural, economic and scientific fields were identified. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inconsistency of foreign policy of the ussr 1953 1964" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1249688.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Conflicts </h2><p>  Features of the foreign policy of the USSR in 1953-1964  consisted in the decisive desire of the Soviet leadership to establish socialism.  However, the influence of the "thaw" led to the processes of democratization and de-Stalinization in some union states.  Disagreements between countries began to appear.  They were mainly associated with the retreat of the Soviet Union from established principles and with its open intervention in the internal affairs of other states.  In mid-June 1953, speeches for the <span>unification of Germany</span> began in East Berlin <span>.</span>  In the summer of 1956, demonstrations took place in Poland.  Here the workers went on strike, demanding the overthrow of communism.  As a result, leadership has changed in the country.  In October 1956, an uprising broke out in Hungary.  Under the pressure of anti-socialist forces, the leadership of the state announced its withdrawal from the police department.  However, in early November, Soviet troops were introduced into the country, which crushed the <span>Hungarian uprising.</span> </p><p>  Foreign policy in the USSR in 1953-1964  thus showed the determination of the leadership to preserve the model of socialism in the states of Southeast and Central Europe. </p>
