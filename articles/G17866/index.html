When <span>selling goods,</span> products, providing various services and performing work, any organization incurs additional costs not included in the cost of production.  This type of cost is called the commercial costs that arise as a result of the preparation and sale of products.

The closure of all necessary accounts occurs automatically when the period is closed.  The duties of an accounting employee include a thorough check of the results of the conduct and reflection of business transactions.  Studying <span>the balance sheet</span> and the analysis of the account will make it possible to track the correctness of sequential closing of accounts to obtain an accurate result of work.  The account 90 is debited before the balance sheet is created, it is of great importance for obtaining objective information.  Therefore, for the chief accountant, the process of reformation of the balance is especially important.  It implies not only the correct closing of the account, but also the verification of its maintenance during the entire period.
