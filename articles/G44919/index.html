Despite its advantages, Bang Tao does not belong to the successful choice of a vacation spot for the average tourist.  Mostly expensive resort with appropriate rates for accommodation, services.  Therefore, the budget tourist is not particularly clear. </p><h2>  Bang Tao Beach </h2><p>  One of the best beaches for family, secluded, single and youth vacations, located in the kingdom of Thailand. </p><p>  Bang Tao Beach is a huge bay, and the 8-kilometer coastline makes it the second largest in Phuket.  It is located in the northwestern part between Pansea Beach and Nai Thon. </p>

    <p>  Bang Tao is also known as Laguna Beach, as the area surrounding the place was previously used for tin mining.  Later, the territory turned into a luxurious "Lagoon Phuket Complex" and is considered the center of the most prestigious villas and hotels. </p><p>  Just a couple of minutes drive from the beach is the city of Cherng Talay, where the local population still lives on the profits from fishing, agriculture and latex processing. </p><p>  There is no rental of sun loungers on the beach, as hotels provide them for their guests.  But there are a lot of dealers in trinkets and local souvenirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conditional division </h2><p>  The northern part is located closer to the airport and, of course, undeveloped, that is, there is no infrastructure and hotels.  Along the coast you can find several lonely cafes, and beyond it is only a road.  There are practically no tourists here, so the northern part of Bang Tao is an ideal place for privacy.  True, the quality of the beach is worse in comparison with the southern part: a narrow strip of sand, and during tides its width is only a few meters.  A place free not only from vacationers, but also from entertainment and sunbeds. </p>

    <p>  The southern part is located closer to Patong beach and is very different in infrastructure from the northern one.  This is where all the cafes, shops, restaurants, hotels and entertainment are located.  True, the situation in the southern part is not the same as in the usual resorts.  There are no merchants, rental offices or travel agencies.  Everything is cultural, rich, civil, and most importantly, clean.  Noisy tourist areas familiar to many vacationers are located at the very end of the south and smoothly pass to the territory of Surin beach. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Arriving at Bang Tao Beach by local public transport does not work, it remains to call a taxi or rent a car.  It is worth considering the high prices of taxi drivers, since the area is expensive.  For example, the road from Patong Beach or the airport will cost about 600 baht, and then if you bargain.  For 50 baht you can take the local shuttle bus to Surin Beach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Shopping at Bang Tao Beach </h2><p>  Taking a walk along the beach, you can find several shacks that sell all the accessories necessary for the beach, from clothes to sunglasses. </p><p>  You will get household items and household utensils near the entrance to the Laguna Complex. </p><p>  A shop with Asian art, wooden statues of elephants and a handmade Buddha is located on the main road on the way to the beach.  Here is the world-famous chain store 7 eleven. </p><p>  At the entrance to the Laguna Phuket in the Canal Village shopping center there is an opportunity to buy antique goods and designer clothes. </p><h2>  Restaurants on the beach </h2><p>  Laguna Resort occupies the central territory of Bang Tao.  There <span>are several excellent restaurants</span> north of <span>Angsana Laguna Resort.</span>  <span>Restaurants are among the best, the prices are reasonable, as they are not related to hotels, and the food causes gastronomic delight.</span> </p><p>  <span>Therefore, if your path passes through Bang Tao Beach, then reviews of tourists recommend visiting restaurants located to the north of the Laguna resort.</span> </p>

    <p>  As for the nightlife, it mainly boils in luxury 5 * hotels, where there are own bars and restaurants offering guests daily entertainment programs. </p><p>  But to spend an unforgettable evening, smoothly flowing into the night, it is not necessary to live in a five-star hotel.  Bars and restaurants along the coastline are ideal for this idea.  By the way, food and drinks here are inexpensive, and as a bonus you get a breathtaking view of the night sea. </p><p>  A popular place for both locals and tourists is the institution <span>Siam Supper Club.</span>  <span>Here you can enjoy a delicious cocktail and listen to jazz music.</span> </p>
