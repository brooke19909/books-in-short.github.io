    <h2>  The crew of Soyuz-11 </h2><p>  The crew of the Soyuz-11 was developing gradually.  In the late 1960s, only two people flew into space at a time.  But the Americans were the first to launch three at once.  The Soviet Union decided to keep up and began to select a crew of 3 people.  The main team included <span>A. Leonov,</span> V. Kubasov and P. Kolodin.  In the backup - Dobrovolsky, Patsaev and Volkov. </p><h2>  The first and last flight of Dobrovolsky </h2><p>  Dobrovolsky Georgy Timofeevich, whose wife bore him two daughters, continued to serve his homeland.  On June 4, 1971, a meeting of the State Commission was held.  The main crew of the Soyuz-11 was replaced by a backup crew.  The reason is a blackout in the lungs of V. Kubasov.  The crew was commanded by George Dobrovolsky.  On June 6, 1971, Soyuz-11 with three astronauts started at 7:55 AM GMT. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="volunteer georgy timofeevich family" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1290973.jpg" width="428"></div>

    <p>  The next day, the ship safely docked with the <span>orbital station.</span>  So for the first time in the world there appeared a scientific manned station.  The crew of Dobrovolsky performed a huge amount of test work on all systems of the station and conducted many studies and experiments.  They opened up great prospects for geography, meteorology and geology, as well as for the study of the ocean, Earth's resources and its vegetation. </p><p>  The flight lasted 23 days.  18 hours  21 minutes  and 43 seconds  Then there was an unforeseen tragic incident that killed all the expedition members.  During the return of the ship from the orbital station to Earth, the astronauts first lost contact.  When the Soyuz-11 landed, lifeless bodies had to be taken out of the aircraft. </p><p>  Doctors immediately determined the cause of death - a cardiac arrest.  And all three at once.  Understood the reasons later.  And then immediately resuscitation teams tried to bring the astronauts back to life.  Moreover, the temperature of the bodies was normal.  But the hearts did not work. </p><p>  The cause of death was found later thanks to the decryption of the "black box".  It turned out that depressurization occurred at an altitude of 150 km.  The pressure began to drop sharply, and after 40 seconds it became almost zero.  At the 43rd second after depressurization, all three cosmonauts simultaneously stopped their hearts. </p><p>  According to official figures, the reason is the untimely opening of ventilation valves.  The mistake was found in the design of the spaceship.  The installers screwed ball valves on it instead of the required force of 90 kg - a total of 60 to 65 kg.  As a result, a large reboot occurred, which caused the valves to work.  But they could not bear the load and crumbled.  A hole with a diameter of 20 mm formed in the ship.  The astronauts first lost consciousness at the 23rd second.  And then their hearts stopped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Volunteer George Timofeevich wife" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/1291007.jpg"></div>
