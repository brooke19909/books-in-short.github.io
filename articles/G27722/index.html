But in our country, a new car is not cheap, and there are enough chances to lose it.  For example, as a result of theft.  In any case, today you can find numerous reviews about this.  ‚ÄúStarLine A93‚Äù is an alarm system popular among domestic motorists that can prevent such a sad and undesirable outcome. </p><h2>  Basic information </h2>

What are the reviews talking about?  StarLine A93 was specifically designed to protect those vehicles that can take full advantage of the CAN and LIN digital data transmission circuitry.  Simply put, these are all the latest cars from AvtoVAZ.  When buying and installing, be sure (!) To check the availability of the following components in the delivery:

    <h2>  What is characterized by this alarm? </h2><p>  The manufacturer himself ‚Äúrests‚Äù on the following distinctive features of his brainchild: </p><ul><li>  Three security lines at once: a code, an immobilizer validator, a standard self-defense system. </li><li>  Shock and tilt sensors with remote adjustment.  Simply put, this system is able to automatically register an attempt to jack the car up with its subsequent "evacuation". </li><li>  The system automatically <span>starts the engine</span> at the appointed time or by a signal from the control panel. </li><li>  In the presence of CAN + LIN in the car, the <span>installation of an alarm system</span> takes very little time.  In addition, the presence of such a system minimizes the need for interference in the electronic circuits of the machine, which contributes to a sharp increase in the reliability of the entire complex.  The number of "glitches" is significantly reduced. </li><li>  The keychain of the protective system is made of especially durable plastic; it easily withstands impacts and falls on a hard surface. </li><li>  Through additional channels, you can configure the alarm management of the car itself, folding mirrors, seatback angle, etc. </li><li>  The range of the multichannel protected receiver reaches 2000 m. </li></ul><h2>  The main advantages of this security system </h2><p>  Do all the above reviews confirm?  ‚ÄúStarLine A93‚Äù is a really good alarm system, the list of real advantages of which is much wider: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Users especially note the presence of a standard START / STOP button.  Due to this, this security system is ideally compatible with vehicles structurally having such a system.  Motorists note that this option makes it much easier and faster to integrate an alarm system with on-board equipment of a car. </li><li>  CAN + LIN interface currently supports more than 300 machine models, and their list is regularly updated.  Users say that support for new cars is added almost every time the firmware is changed. </li><li>  Implementation of additional functions is available without buying new, expensive ‚Äúlotions‚Äù.  The huge potential of modernization allows you to simply update the firmware, and not to buy a new protective kit. </li></ul>

The reviews confirm that this alarm also has other positive aspects, which even the manufacturer itself does not always mention.  Among the positive aspects include, for example, a wide range of the most diverse teams in standard security and alarm modes.  Here is a short list of them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The ability to control all the standard car locks responsible for locking the doors. </li><li>  There is a constructive protection against theft, which imitates a technical engine malfunction and prevents the further movement of an attacker who has illegally taken possession of your vehicle. </li><li>  When you open the trunk, the StarLine A93 alarm is immediately turned off.  Reviews say that the owner of a car with this protective system will never be in a stupid situation when the car starts to ‚Äúyell‚Äù when opening the luggage compartment with an alarm running. </li><li>  Management of opening and closing the hood lock. </li><li>  Since this security system is deeply integrated into the car‚Äôs electronic circuits, it can even be used to turn on the standard alarm, which is quite convenient in emergency situations. </li></ul><h2>  Owner Comfort </h2>

Reviews of even experienced motorists indicate the fact that the manufacturer is seriously concerned about the comfort of using its products.  In order not to be unfounded, the main "comfortable" functions should be listed:

    <ul><li>  If a pre-start heater is mounted in your vehicle, then it can be controlled using the standard features of the alarm described by us.  You do not have to buy any additional modules. </li><li>  It is possible to automatically adjust the angle of the seatbacks depending on the preferences of the owner of the car.  Again, you do not need to buy any additional blocks and other equipment to implement this function. </li><li>  Again, the functionally incorporated possibility of automatically returning the steering column to its original state. </li></ul><h2>  Will autostart hinder? </h2><p>  Not everyone immediately liked the StarLine A93 alarm.  The reviews often contain the opinions of those incredulous motorists who, having taken a leap with cheap Chinese alarms, don‚Äôt trust such a ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù technique too much.  The motives for their suspicions are largely understandable, since other security systems often begin to "fool" when using the same startup.  But StarLine A93 car alarm doesn‚Äôt belong to this category in any way: owner reviews indicate that all its components work perfectly and without failures.  This is what the standard autostart option is good for when it is integrated with the auto protection system: </p><ul><li>  When the car starts in automatic mode, the start of the wipers and radio is automatically blocked. </li><li>  But in the same period, the heated seats and windows automatically start.  When you leave the house, you only need to brush off the significantly softened ice from the windshield and get into a fully warmed, comfortable car. </li><li>  There is an imitation of ‚Äúordinary‚Äù ignition keys, which is useful in the case of obsolete cars, on board of which there is not enough ‚Äúsmart‚Äù electronics. </li><li>  If it is frosty outside, and the first signal did not lead to the start of the motor, a second impulse is sent.  It should be noted that this option is relevant only for machines with a standard STOP / START button. </li><li>  There is also a simulated second starter signal.  Again, this mode is intended for those cars in which the regular <span>engine start</span> from the button is absent constructively. </li></ul><p>  How else do they characterize StarLine A93 (reviews)?  The GSM module, according to the impressions of the owners, is surprisingly reliable and does not fail even in really difficult operating conditions.  For civilian electronics, this is truly a rarity.  In addition, the extended security mode really pleases, since when it is turned on, the following automatically occurs: </p><ul><li>  Mirrors fold (if they have an electric drive, of course). </li><li>  The ceiling hatch closes (also if available). </li><li>  The display mode on the control panel changes, which will not allow the owner to forget about the activation of the mode. </li></ul><h2>  Tips from experienced car owners: proper installation </h2><p>  What other features is characterized by "StarLine A93"?  Reviews (you can open it on any automotive-related resource) indicate that this alarm system, despite its technological complexity and the abundance of options provided to protect your car, can be installed independently.  So you will save a lot of money, and even be able to protect yourself from the machinations of dishonest "official representatives". </p><p>  Again, from the reviews there are many situations where car owners had to visit the service center three and four times to eliminate installation flaws.  Naturally, for each visit and "diagnosis" had to pay separately.  So independent work is the key to maximum quality.  This conclusion inevitably comes any experienced motorist with experience.  So, what is the best advice to fix StarLine A93 reviews?  Installation instructions are pretty simple. </p>

The unit must be mounted with bolts or plastic ties in such a way as to completely eliminate its displacement from its place, even under conditions of strong vibration.  Important!  Since there are several temperature sensors in the central unit, you need to place it at the maximum distance from any heat sources in the cabin.

    <p>  If you have to mount the unit in a place that cannot completely guarantee the absence of moisture, be sure to place it with the connectors down so that the water, even if it gets on the electronics, does not cause the last critical harm.  What else is characterized by the installation of StarLine A93?  Owner reviews indicate that special attention should be paid to the placement of various sensors. </p><h2>  Placement of the main sensors </h2><p>  It is imperative not to place the receiver receiver sensor under the tinted sunscreen on the windshield, since in this case the range of the complex and its remote control capabilities are noticeably reduced.  In addition, the transceiver sensors have very sensitive elements that respond to shock and strong tilt. </p><p>  Therefore, we strongly advise against installing this module on soft plastic, since in this case the probability of false positives is too high.  What are the requirements for the installation of a siren, which is obligatory equipped with a StarLine A93 KAN / LIN alarm?  Reviews from experienced car owners say that the "fastening" of such an important element should be given as much attention as possible. </p><h2>  Where to mount the siren? </h2><p>  It is mounted under the hood, and trying to place it at the maximum distance from sources of moisture and heat.  The ‚Äúspeaker‚Äù is directed downward so that moisture does not get into it under any conditions.  Immediately make sure that the siren and its wires are completely inaccessible and invisible even if an attacker crawls under the bottom of the car to inspect it.  In the event that you have purchased an autonomous version of the siren, be sure to provide the most convenient access to the module for disconnecting it. </p><p>  In the same manner, it is recommended to incorporate a fuse in the circuit of its power supply, which protects the warning device from overloads in the vehicle electrical system.  By the way!  Failure to fulfill this requirement is the basis for every second negative review: ‚ÄúStarLine A93‚Äù simply will not be able to work normally during overloads or short circuits in the electrical circuit of the machine.  It can be very difficult to identify their causes, and false alarms are provided to you. </p><h2>  Temperature sensor </h2>

Installation is allowed near the engine block, provided that suitable bolted joints are used in diameter.  It is important to understand that the correct operation of the system for automatically starting the engine of your car, and the optimal fuel consumption, largely depend on the correct choice of a place for a temperature sensor.

    <h2>  Basic alarm installation requirements </h2><p>  Many negative reviews about StarLine A93 alarms with auto start are caused not by any shortcomings in the hardware and software of this equipment, but by a banal unwillingness to understand the basic installation rules.  If you make gross mistakes during this operation, you should not be surprised at the inadequate operation of the protective system and its strange ‚Äúglitches‚Äù.  So, here are the main points that must be followed during installation: </p><ul><li>  It is installed only (!) On cars whose on-board network voltage is not lower than 12V. </li><li>  Without fail (!) Before installation, you should ‚Äúdrive off‚Äù the electronic circuits of the machine for any errors.  By such are meant not only non-working interior lights, but also the ‚ÄúJackie Chan‚Äù icon, which is cheerfully burning on the dashboard.  It is due to the fact that many motorists completely ignore this condition, and terrible stories about the "StarLine A93" CAN / LIN appear.  Reviews fully confirm this. </li><li>  Before starting installation, remove the electrical and electronics circuits of your car from dusty bins.  Only on the basis of these documents can installation be carried out.  ‚ÄúBy eye‚Äù, never do anything. </li><li>  All wires should be laid as far as possible from all possible sources of interference, especially from ignition coils and power cables.  Never and in no case should they come into contact with moving mechanical parts, as this will sooner or later lead to breaks and short circuits. </li><li>  All components can only be connected to the supply sockets (!) After the final installation and integrity check. </li><li>  If your machine has additionally installed relays, then before installing the security system, check their operability.  In the event that at least some doubts arise about this, it is better to completely replace the "controversial" part. </li><li>  Mount the engine temperature sensor near the exhaust manifold - utter stupidity.  Constant overheating will be guaranteed. </li><li>  The gap between the contacts of the <span>limit switches of the</span> trunk and the hood when they are closed must be at least three millimeters.  Violation of this simplest requirement of 90% leads to false alarms and incorrect operation of the alarm. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So how did the StarLine A93 KAN / LIN alarm system work?  The feedback from experienced car owners confirms that we are faced with a high-quality and reliable protective system, the installation of which can quite prevent many troubles associated with car theft. </p>

But here it is worth mentioning once again those aspects that distinguish StarLine A93 car alarms: the responses of inexperienced "installers" do not corny take into account that this is a really complex complex, and installation errors are unacceptable.  If you poorly integrate the alarm system into the electronic circuits of your car, it is foolish to count on uninterrupted and trouble-free operation.
