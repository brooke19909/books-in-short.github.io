The designation is formed during registration in the system, most often it repeats the e-mail address, but not always. </p><p>  It is worth remembering: if you know the password and identifier, then you can access Apple resources and nothing else. </p><p>  Different things happen in life, people can forget the identifier, because you should know how to find out the Apple ID. </p><h2>  Problem or not - forget the identifier? </h2><p>  Losing information is rather unpleasant, however, if you forget the identifier, then it will be easy to see, there are many ways to do this.

Therefore, it will be useful to understand how to find your Apple ID on the iPhone. </p><h2>  How to find out the identifier? </h2><p>  To find the ID on your device, you may need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  If you logged into the AppStore, then the information you need is located in the column "Selection", at the very bottom of the page. </li><li>  In iTunes, the login is at the bottom, where there are sounds, movies, music. </li><li>  Open "Podcasts", go to the column "Selection" and you will also see your own identifier. </li></ol><h2>  Where can I see the identifier in the device settings? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="remont-apples.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We look at the identifier on the device" class="if uuid-3040501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/3040501.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not know <span>how to find out the ID of your</span> Apple <span>phone</span> , then synchronization with one of the company's services will help you.

The letter will be similar to the original, but always check the sender address.  For example, letters from Apple come from only one address: appleid@id.apple.com </p><p>  If you see the slightest difference in the address, then without hesitation close the letter and never follow the links from the ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù e-mail - these are scammers who are trying to access your device.  In addition, never tell anyone your ID, do not store passwords in accessible places, and always block devices.  If you block the device, the attacker will not be able to do anything with it - maximum, will sell for details. </p>
