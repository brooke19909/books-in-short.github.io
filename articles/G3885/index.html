  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silver ore mined in the Wowhead game.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a new exciting <span>online multiplayer online game</span> World Of WarCraft, created by Blizzard developers, <span>silver ore</span> is mined using a game pick.  The new version of the game gives the opportunity to participate in it at the same time tens of thousands of users.  A convenient and simple interface and a colorful three-dimensional image, simulating space with great reality, takes players to the wonderful fantastic world of Warcraft, full of fast-moving events, exciting adventures and unusual transformations. </p><p>  <strong>Game Description Wow</strong> </p><p>  The creation of the game World Of WarCraft is inspired by the motives of the Warcraft gaming series.  Here you can meet the same characters and similar plots.  But now players have the opportunity to independently explore the world of the Warcraft universe, and can also directly participate in battles with evil monsters and enchanted monsters. </p><p>  The game is designed so that, despite the large number of players, they all have the opportunity to look for each other and talk.  You can assist others in completing the quest.  It is possible to combine for joint repulsions of monster attacks or attacks on the enemy, as well as joint mining operations.  After all, <span>mineral deposits,</span> such as cobalt, indarilium, adamant, mithril or silver ore, are located in hard-to-reach places, and completing this quest has its own nuances and difficulties when the help of a playmate is especially needed. </p><p>  Passing quests of different levels is of great importance for achieving success in promoting and receiving awards.  They help to increase the level of a participant in a role-playing game after gaining a certain experience.  In addition, after completing the quest, you can earn a variety of bonuses and rewards, such as money, food, potions, magic items, weapons and armor.  For example, WOW-silver ore is mined in such impassable places of the game world as Thousand Needles, <span>Hillsbrad Foothills,</span> Desolace, Arathi Highlands, <span>Ashenvale,</span> Badlands, <span>Stranglethorn,</span> Dusk Forest, Wetlands, Stonetalon Mountains.  Agree, only one name is worth something! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Mining is a skill</strong> </p><p>  Sources of useful minerals become available for development in the degree of increasing their rarity.  The most affordable is the extraction of copper.  Silver ore is not so common.  Therefore, completing this quest is fraught with difficulties.  The regions of the world where you have to sneak or break through are the most dangerous.  But efforts and perseverance pay off with interest! </p><p>  To do mining, you do not need to make anything.  Ore is mined by digging it with a pickaxe.  Then, the extracted minerals can be profitably sold at auction.  Having mastered Mining, which is the most popular profession in the gaming world, you will have the opportunity to move to Blacksmithing, Engineering, and even Jewelry.  Moreover, completing this quest will help you acquire 60 stamina - indicators of the health of the game character. </p><p>  <strong>Game Skill Levels</strong> </p><p>  Any silver core of Mithril becomes accessible for development only if the player has reached seventy-fifth level, and true silver can be mined by climbing two hundred and thirty.  Ore extraction from the deposit should be carried out until the mineral deposits are exhausted.  To search <span>for minerals</span> in the game provides a mini-map.  Mineral veins must be located at the quest site or inside underground mines.  But there are still unusual places where iron, gold or silver ore can be found.  These are trophy monster chests. </p><p>  By right-clicking on the found source of minerals, you can start mining them.  In the mineral vein, you will find not only metal, but also precious stones.  The color that appears when you hover over a found fossil will reflect the ability to obtain skills or "money" from its extraction. </p>
