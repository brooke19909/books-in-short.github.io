    <h2>  Why does the question arise </h2><p>  But first, let's see why people ask themselves: ‚ÄúI found an iPhone 5. How to keep it?‚Äù  After all, it is always important to understand how honest people flip into the head, to put it mildly, not the best thoughts. </p><p>  The thing is that iPhone 5 is a new and branded gadget.  It is a very high-quality and stylish smartphone with lots of features.  Everyone dreams of getting them.  True, the price for the brand and "promotion" is quite high.  Not everyone can afford such a pleasure.  Think for yourself, are you really ready to pay about 25,000-30,000 rubles for a mobile phone (albeit branded)?  Better to buy something simpler or get a brand new laptop. </p><p>  That is why some are asking: "I found iPhone 5, how to keep it?"  Moreover, this will not necessarily be a dishonest person.  For the most part, if someone thinks about our topic today, they are honest and law-abiding people.  Let‚Äôs now see what can be done. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  To begin with, let's try to parse the ‚Äúleave for myself‚Äù option.  In this case, you have to try pretty hard so as not to get into trouble.  After all, an iPhone is a very expensive gadget.  It is unlikely that the previous owner will forget about him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="found iphone 5 how to make it not found" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/809938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, if you have a problem: ‚ÄúFound iPhone 5 - how to make it not found?‚Äù, Then the first thing you will have to see is which SIM card is inserted into the smartphone.  Now you can easily determine the location of equipment by phone number.  So to speak, direction it.  To do this, the owner only needs to contact the mobile operator and explain the situation with the loss. </p><p>  If you are thinking about the topic: "Found iPhone 5 - I want to keep it for myself. What should I do?"  - it would be better to immediately disassemble the gadget and remove the SIM card from it.  You can break it and throw it away, or you can leave and put on the wanted list of the owner.  True, it would be better to just throw out the SIM card.  So you will not fall suspicious about the theft of the gadget itself.  Now you can proceed to the next step. </p><h2>  Flashing </h2><p>  The second point that should be taken into account is that the iPhone can simply be blocked after loss.  Honestly, now it is far from rare.  Good protection against theft and loss.  True, there is a way out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is nothing more than unlocking the iPhone 5 found. Now a lot of companies are engaged in the so-called flashing.  As a rule, they are located in the same place as the repair of mobile phones. </p><p>  For the money you will unlock the gadget.  But here you will have to prepare well - you may be asked what happened, especially if you go to some company store.  Then it will be necessary to figure out why a flashing was required.  In general, when this lesson is finished, we can continue to think about the topic: ‚ÄúI found iPhone 5 - how to keep it?‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  Silence is gold </h2><p>  Well, now we will come with you to simpler (though not always) moments.  In cases when you really want to leave yourself an expensive find, you will have to be patient and strong.  After all, we need to be silent.  That is, if you wondered: "I found an iPhone - what should I do?"  - You can simply say nothing to anyone about your treasure. </p><p>  No need to tell friends, on the Internet or on the forums that you picked up iPhone 5. Yes, and working with this gadget after reflashing and removing the SIM card is also not necessary.  <span>The ‚Äústandby time‚Äù,</span> as a rule, should be about 1 month.  If during this period of time the owner is not found, then, of course, you can safely say that now you have an iPhone 5. </p><p>  True, sometimes this is not enough.  Let's see what other precautions you can take to prevent you from being caught, and the sophisticated gadget remains at your disposal. </p><h2>  Change of components </h2><p>  You are thinking about the question: ‚ÄúI found iPhone 5, how to keep it?‚Äù  Then, after all the actions done, let's try to slightly modify our gadget with you.  Sometimes this also helps. </p><p>  The first step is to replace the panel.  Give the gadget a new look by buying several interchangeable panels for it.  Sometimes this can help with identification.  Especially if the old owner prefers to reconcile only on the "appearance" and "fullness". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock found iphone 5" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/809935.jpg" width="560"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The second point - change the battery.  Yes, you have to fork out if you decide to leave yourself such an expensive gadget.  However, this is what can sometimes help, though not always.  So give it a try.  It is worth it to play it safe, especially if it concerns very expensive gadgets. </p><p>  It would also be nice to remove the memory card (if any) and format it.  A card reader that can easily connect to a computer will help you with this.  In extreme cases, you can simply throw out additional memory, and then buy a brand new one.  So to speak, for yourself. </p><p>  Move on.  Another move is to completely format the contents of the iPhone after flashing.  Preferably through a computer.  So, if the former owner tries to look at the contents of his gadget, then, of course, this will not give any result.  That's all.  Now wait a while - the former owner was not found after a long time?  Then you can safely use the equipment. </p><h2>  Torment of conscience </h2><p>  However, if you have a conscience, then most likely you will immediately ask the question: "Found iPhone 5 - sell or return to the owner?"  Now we will see with you what has more advantages here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="found an iPhone what to do" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/809943.jpg" width="500"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If you decide to sell such a popular and expensive gadget, then prepare for the fact that this process will have to be carried out "underground."  The thing is that in fact you will give away a stolen smartphone, so there is a possibility of a collision with the law enforcement.  Especially if the real owner has already wanted his loss.  In this case, as a rule, it can be checked by special numbers that are assigned to each technique.  Risky, albeit profitable, occupation. </p><p>  Another option is to return the owner of his gadget for a fee.  And for a rather big one.  Naturally, it will be less than the cost of iPhone 5, but, nevertheless, you can get a good reward.  So you will remain with a clear conscience, and with money.  Just do not throw out the "SIM card" inserted into the gadget.  And then post the find ads.  You can even contact the police. </p><h2>  The consequences of cheating </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, if you decide to leave yourself such an expensive find, you should be prepared for some consequences.  Now you can find a lot of similar stories that end very badly.  Namely - a prison. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Found iPhone 5 to sell or return to the owner" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/809933.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If you do not put the find on the wanted list, then most likely you will simply be found and detained.  Naturally, this is only if the former owner begins to search for his gadget.  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  It may happen that you contact the police, ask to find the former owner, and he will not get in touch for a long time.  You can say, forget about the iPhone.  In this case, as a rule, in 2-3 months the find will pass into your full and legal disposal. </p>
