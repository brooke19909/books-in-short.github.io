There are so many interesting and unusual things that it will take several months to see at least a small part.  We propose to get acquainted with India from one of its most popular resorts - the city of Calangute.  You can stay here in the small and homely little hotel Sea Breeze Inn Calangute 3 *.  Its main advantage is its convenient location, which allows you to easily reach anywhere in the city on foot. </p><p>  In addition, very friendly and hospitable people work at this hotel, striving to make the rest of their guests carefree and enjoyable.  An atmosphere of freedom and celebration reigns in Calangute, popular DJs often come here, colorful festivals take place here, and even in this area fantastically beautiful sunsets, which you need to see at least once in your life.  Those who do not want to participate in a stormy enchanting fun, but are looking for peace and measuredness, will also like the small friendly Calangute, because there are many beautiful secluded places where you can completely relax and forget about the problems of large cities.  The Sea Breeze Inn is suitable for any type of vacation.  Here they always try to provide their guests with the maximum of amenities and comfort. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a wonderful area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIndia is the Sea Breeze Inn 3 *.  Goa is the smallest and perhaps the most popular coastal state among tourists.  North Goa is a county in this state, vibrant, youthful, unpredictable and always festively noisy.  Among all resort cities, Calangute stands out in the highest contrast.  Poverty and luxury, temples with mountains of garbage, street fakirs and stray cows, fascinating with sophistication, quietly coexist nearby.  There is also gorgeous tropical vegetation, a fabulously beautiful sea and friendly, sometimes obsessive, locals.  You will live in such a place if you choose Calangute for relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Sea Breeze Inn 3 * is located on a wide busy street called Dr. Afonso, but not on the coast, but on the second line.  I must say that in Calangute, unlike Egypt and Tunisia, on the first line you can find very few hotels.  Here they are evenly distributed throughout the city, so the location of the Sea Breeze Inn here is considered quite normal and even favorable.  The advantages are: </p><ul><li>  To the sea very close. </li><li>  Less noise and clutter, increasing as you get closer to the coast. </li><li>  In the evenings and nights it is not dangerous to return to the hotel, since there are almost no beggars and beggars on the main street. </li><li>  All major infrastructure facilities (cafes, shops, pharmacy, market) are nearby. </li><li>  Walking to the bus station takes a little less than a quarter of an hour, to the main street of the city about 5 minutes. </li></ul><h2>  How to get to the hotel comfortably </h2><p>  It is far from always easy and quick to get from Russia to Calangute and its wonderful Hotel Sea Breeze Inn 3 *.  India, Goa in particular (as it is located on the coast) are subject to cyclical changes in climate.  If we have it limited to summer-winter seasons, then they have a rainy season (low) and a dry season (high). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Goa, 2 km from the village of Dabolim there is an international airport, also called ‚ÄúDabolim‚Äù.  There direct charters from some cities of our country (Moscow, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and St. Petersburg) fly only in the high season, that is, from November to the first of June.  It is 39 km from Dabolim to the hotel in question, which can take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour.  The best option is to go on the transfer of the travel agency where the tour was purchased.  Independently more comfortable and more profitable in time to go by taxi.  If it is ordered in advance (back in Russia), the price will be fixed at 21 rupees per 1 km.  If you take a taxi locally, the price can change both up and down. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the hotel cheaply by public transport </h2><p>  Theoretically, you can travel from Dabolim to Calangute by train.  5 km from the village is the city of Vasco da Gama, where there is a large train.  D. Station.  From there you need to follow to the city of Tivim, and then take a taxi to the hotel.  In general, the road will cost up to 300 rupees.  But <span>trains in India</span> for a European are quite extreme and not the most suitable mode of transport, as they are always crowded and late.  Tickets for them must be ordered in advance, and often they are sold to several passengers in one seat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can get from Dabolim to Sea Breeze Inn 3 * and by bus.  At 80 meters from the airport, buses stop right across the road for 10 rupees taking to the bus station in Vasco da Gamma, where you need to get a ticket to Panaji, and then transfer to the bus to Calangute.  In general, travel will take up to 100 rupees. </p><p>  If you decide to visit North Goa during the low season, you will have to fly to Delhi, and preferably to Mumbai.  From there it is most advantageous to take a plane ticket to Dabolim (price from $ 148), and then follow the scheme described above. </p><p>  Buses and trains from Delhi and Mumbai to Goa also run, but travel time with all transfers takes almost the whole day, and the cost savings are very small. </p><h2>  Description of the Territory </h2><p>  Very pleasant impression, literally from the first minutes makes Sea Breeze Inn 3 *.  North Goa is rich in lush tropical vegetation, as all tourists who have been there mention in their reviews.  The hotel also has many palm trees, ficus, vines, flowering shrubs all year round.  Among this tropical greenery is a swimming pool.  Around him on the grass are umbrellas and sunbeds.  Nearby there is a cafe with a bar, the roof of which is a tent made of green branches.  Hotel staff exhibit tables, wicker chairs and at the entrance to the buildings.  There are also two restaurants on site, but tourists say they do not work.  In front of the main entrance to the hotel there is a spacious area, paved with tiles and surrounded by flowers.  It leads to a covered terrace where there are several summer armchairs.  It is always pleasant to relax here on a hot afternoon. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  In the infrastructure of Indian three-star hotels, it is very rare to find anything for a variety of leisure guests.  Basically, they only relax here after a bright and interesting day.  Sea Breeze Inn 3 * is somewhat distinguished from the general background by the fact that on its territory there is a chic garden and a swimming pool with a relaxation area around.  For children, the hotel has only a compartment in this pool and small cots designed for an age of 3 years.  They are installed in rooms ordered by parents. </p><h2>  Things to do in the city </h2><p>  Tourists seek to India to see with their own eyes her unique inimitable beauties and plunge into her amazing, extraordinary and such an unusual world.  For all this, the Sea Breeze Inn 3 * (North Goa) is great.  Calangute and other cities of this small state became popular in the 60s of the last century thanks to the hippie colonies settled here.  These people promoted freedom in everything and from everything.  Their followers are still gathering on the local beach, where they organize trance parties and electronic music festivals.  Rock and pop groups perform in the coastal shek every night, and noisy parties last almost until the morning. </p><p>  Those guests of the Sea Breeze Inn who do not like such a pastime can entertain themselves with interesting excursions.  Representatives of travel agencies usually offer an overview of Calangute and its environs for free.  A very interesting and relatively inexpensive tour of Goa with visits to monasteries, a waterfall, plantations with spices, elephant farms.  Many tourists travel by bus or rented bike to Anjuna, Mapusa, Panaji on their own. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  From the coast of the Indian Ocean and its Arabian Sea, Sea Breeze Inn 3 * is located five hundred meters.  You can go to the beach in two ways - either longer along the road past shops and shops with goods, or short through the yards.  According to tourists, the beach of Calangute is very crowded, so many people go or walk to Baga Beach, which is about 1,200 meters away. There is a small water park here.  In the Arabian Sea, even in the dry season, there is rarely complete calm.  The waves rising from 11 a.m. swell sand, so the water is almost always cloudy, but its temperature does not drop below + 27 ¬∞ C.  On the beach in Calangute you can always admire the cows, feed the dogs.  They do not interfere with rest.  Sunbeds here are the property of Shek.  You must either pay for them, or buy drinks or food, then you can use them all day. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  For many tourists it is important that near the shops and the market is the Sea Breeze Inn 3 *.  India is a country from which it is impossible to return without shopping.  The most popular among our compatriots are spices, teas, coffee, <span>Indian jewelry,</span> idols and souvenirs.  In the Tibetan market they take silver dishes, jugs, vases.  In the stores of Calangute and Panaji you can buy excellent clothes and shoes several times cheaper than in Russia.  Besides things, many tourists try to bring home Indian exotic fruits.  The main condition for all purchases, regardless of product category is bargaining.  Sellers are even offended if they take something without bargaining. </p>
