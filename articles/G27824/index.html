  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it possible to read someone else's correspondence in Viber</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes human curiosity crosses all sides.  And the biggest temptation for many is the dialogue of others.  Some people are often guided by excruciating suspicions or the desire to find incriminating evidence - everyone has different motives. </p><p>  If you look in more detail, then interference with someone else‚Äôs privacy and information space carries a criminal responsibility.  However, this is not an obstacle for people who by all means want to learn how to read someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber. </p><h2>  Access via mail, VK or other instant messengers </h2><p>  Each messenger provides a backup scheme, which insures the account holder from losing important information when you delete the application or when changing the device.  If the data is stored on the messenger servers, then an ordinary person without hacker talent will not be able to extract it.  In the case of Viber, you don‚Äôt have to go that far.  To gain access to someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber, just send a text file with dialogs to email, Telegram, VK or other convenient platforms.  You can do this through the settings menu in the "Calls and Messages" section, by clicking on the option to send message history and selecting an addressee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="o-viber.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to see someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber" class="if uuid-2993474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2993474.jpg"></div><p>  Direct access to the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù device is required, because the data is transferred through it.  In addition, there is a high probability of getting caught red-handed, because sooner or later in the history of correspondence there will be evidence of such an invasion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cloud storage </h2><p>  Instead of specially created servers, Viber uses third-party cloud storage for backup, such as Google Drive.  Again, without access to someone else‚Äôs device, such an operation will not succeed.  In the settings you need to enter the backup categories and click on the "Create a copy" section.  Next, you need to select the necessary "Google Drive" account, where correspondence will be saved, and authenticate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="o-viber.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to read other people's posts in Viber" class="if uuid-2993414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2993414.jpg"></div><p>  But before you see someone else‚Äôs correspondence in ‚ÄúViber‚Äù, you will need to find a file with a duplicate chat history, since it does not appear in normal access in ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù, but you can enable the display of hidden files in the settings.  Having installed the desktop version of Viber, the downloaded data can be read here. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that to do so with secret dialogs fail.  They are based on the Peer-to-peer principle, that is, they are decentralized and cannot synchronize like regular chats. </p><h2>  Foreign correspondence in ‚ÄúViber‚Äù: how to track?  Sync on other devices </h2><p>  The easiest way to figure out how to read someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber is to synchronize it with your device.  Notifications of new messages will come directly to the smartphone.  And if you make backup in advance, then you can read the old correspondence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="-." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Access to someone else's correspondence in Viber" class="if uuid-2993452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2993452.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to install the PC version of Viber.  In the installation window, the question ‚ÄúDo you have a Viber for the phone?‚Äù Appears.  After clicking ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, you must select the country of residence and enter your phone number.  The last step is scanning the QR code.  And to complete the procedure, you must delete the SMS message with the activation code, because this can become evidence. </p><h2>  Backup Text for Viber Method </h2><div class="photo" data-original="-." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to read someone else's correspondence in vibe" class="if uuid-2994175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2994175.jpg"></div><p>  This method is very similar to the previous ones.  The only difference is that this one is brought to automation thanks to special software.  The program is available for download via Google Play and contains advanced functionality for synchronization.  For example, you can choose the place of export - e-mail or to a memory card and select the data file format with correspondence and contact lists (Excel, html, txt, CSV and others).  Before reading someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber, you must persuade the account owner to download this program and make backups. </p><h2>  Special Hacking Software - ViberCrack </h2><p>  You need to be careful with spyware - they are most often placed on questionable portals and, downloading data from them, you can compromise your own data.  Installation does not require root privileges on the smartphone.  The installation of such a program is a rather difficult process.  You need to install it yourself on the device, from where you need to steal data, go through the registration and authorization procedure.  In most cases, this is problematic, because not everyone has such an opportunity.  The program runs silently.  It does not take up much memory and works when notifications arrive. </p><p>  Among the main functionalities of such software are: </p><ul><li>  viewing and control of dialogs and call history; </li><li>  access to media files and documents; </li><li>  hacking and synchronization of secret dialogs; </li><li>  listening, forwarding, rejecting and tracking calls; </li></ul><p>  The hacking procedure can last from a few minutes to 3 hours. </p><h2>  Safety rules, or How to avoid becoming a victim yourself? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ugetapps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foreign correspondence in &quot;Viber&quot; how to track" class="if uuid-2993470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2993470.jpg"></div><p>  Most users ask themselves: ‚ÄúIs it possible to read someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber?‚Äù.  In fact, Viber is not so easy to hack, and all procedures associated with interfering in personal correspondence are somehow related to the attacker's personal access to the device.  This access is available to people who have grounded in trust.  If a person really trusts, he will not need to read correspondence in such an unethical way.  But it is precisely between close people that such situations occur most often. </p><p>  To prevent data leakage, you must take the following precautions: </p><ol><li>  Always keep your phone with you without leaving it unattended.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter who sits in front of you - spouse, stranger or colleague </li><li>  Do not visit suspicious sites and do not download dubious content.  This also applies to third-party Viber clients.  For security, you must download applications from official sources. </li><li>  Set the protection for the smartphone when unlocking (by fingerprint, password, pattern, FaceID), as well as the password and PIN code for the application itself. </li><li>  Timely respond to suspicious activity.  In the item ‚ÄúComputers and tablets‚Äù you can see a list of devices connected to the system.  Detected alien gadget can be easily deactivated. </li></ol><p>  Attackers, trying to decide how to read someone else‚Äôs correspondence in Viber, it is important not to miss the prerequisite for the procedure - excellent Internet.  This is necessary to install a special application that will provide access to other people's messages.  The only negative is that the fact of installing the application is easy to detect.  Therefore, in order to keep the correspondence secret, one should be extremely cautious, always leave the profile and not leave the smartphone unattended. </p>
