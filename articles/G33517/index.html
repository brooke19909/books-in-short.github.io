This is especially true when it comes to small amounts.  As a rule, when obtaining credit cards, it is not necessary to provide a large list of documents, and the procedure itself takes a minimum of time.  However, some banks still have higher requirements or issue approved QCs for too long.  Consider the fastest ways to get a credit card loan at different banks. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  Since this organization is the largest bank in Russia, the number of people who can count on receiving instant cards is limited.  According to the current program, only people who already own accounts to which salaries or pensions are transferred can receive Credit Momentum.  Therefore, obtaining a Sberbank credit card is very beneficial for its regular customers. </p>

    <p>  To do this, you just need to present your passport and wait 15 minutes until the plastic is ready.  In this case, there is no need to confirm your solvency, because in the bank the movement of funds in the accounts is already perfectly visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After receiving a Sberbank credit card, the conditions for using plastic are very favorable.  The client has 50 days to pay off the debt without any interest.  The maximum amount for which you can get a loan is 150 thousand rubles.  At the end of the grace period, the interest rate will be 18.9%.  However, there is one condition: the monthly payment must be at least 10% of the amount taken. </p><h2>  "Europe Bank" </h2><p>  At this financial institution, customers can also count on getting a quick credit card.  It takes no more than half an hour to issue it.  To do this, the client only needs to present a passport and meet some requirements of the bank.  Those who are over 21 years old can count on a credit card.  In addition, the potential borrower must be registered in the same place where the bank branch is located.  You will also need to provide a certificate confirming the fact that the borrower has a permanent place of work in which he has been working for at least 4 months. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about interest rates, they are calculated privately and can range from 19 to 29.9%.  Moreover, loans in the amount of up to 150 thousand rubles are available for customers.  As with other banks, the grace period is 50 days, but card service is free. </p><p>  You can also apply for a gold card.  In this case, the total loan amount increases to 750 thousand rubles.  For the maintenance of the spacecraft will have to pay 1.5 thousand rubles annually.  Gold card holders receive a 20% discount in most stores.  The grace period for loan repayment is also 50 days. </p><h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  This credit organization offers its customers to receive a Halva card.  It is free, so you don‚Äôt have to pay annual maintenance fees.  As a rule, such QCs are used for payment in stores.  To get such an instant credit card, it is enough to fill out the corresponding application on the bank‚Äôs official website and wait for the call from the manager of the credit organization who will inform the decision.  After that, it is enough to come to the branch of Sovcombank and receive the treasured card.  The only requirement a borrower must meet is his age.  It should be from 20 to 75 years.  You will also need to submit a passport. </p>

    <p>  If the application is left on the Network, then after a while a bank employee contacts the client (by phone or e-mail) and informs him that the loan has been approved.  After that, he suggests approaching that branch of the bank, where it is more convenient for the client to pick up the card.  Then it is enough to come to the specified address and get the original document.  Thanks to online design, you can significantly save your time, so today most citizens prefer this option. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Credit cards are very profitable products from financial institutions.  However, you need to understand that it is not profitable for a bank to provide loans for free.  This is not necessary, since most citizens do not know how to calculate their financial capabilities correctly.  Therefore, before issuing a QC, it is worth considering several times.  If the borrower does not fit into the grace period, then in the end he will have to overpay the bank a lot more.  Therefore, it makes sense to think about getting a cash loan. </p>

    <p>  If you arrange a target loan, then the rates will be much lower.  You also need to take into account the fact that the less the bank requires documents for obtaining a loan, the less favorable conditions are offered to borrowers.  Nevertheless, credit cards will be useful for those who are a client of a particular financial institution, since there are many preferential programs for this.  The main thing is to properly assess your capabilities, select the most favorable loan conditions and carefully study the contract before signing it. </p>
