Bering, leaving Galernaya Gavan on the right side, and Skipersky Canal on the left, then turning right, ends at the marina, the old Skipersky Protok street in St. Petersburg winds. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The harbor itself was created by decree of Peter I. In 1721, a swimming pool for galley ships was dug through a small river called the Black Channel.  Then a canal was created, which is now called Skipersky. </p><p>  Once upon a time here in Galernaya Gavan was formed Skipper settlement, named after the craft of its inhabitants.  From its name the name of the street was formed. </p><p>  At first (from 1812) it was Skiperskaya Street, then (from 1891) - Skiperskaya Embankment, and from 1893 - the embankment of Skipersky Canal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Skipper duct" class="if uuid-2227471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2227471.jpg"></div><p>  In the 18th century, the so-called nautical signs were installed at the entrance to Galernaya Gavan - kronshpits or watch towers.  These are buildings, previously wooden, then rebuilt from stone, which were crowned with high flagpoles. </p><p>  They still stand there along the Skipper Channel - West Kronshpitz on 14 Skippersky Canal Street and East Kronshpitz - at 12 AB along the same street.  The building of the second, once sentinel, building now houses a museum of the history of rescue on the waters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern street </h2><p>  The length of Skipersky Canal is 2.2 km.  Now on this street there are only a couple of hostels and several residential buildings, mainly industrial facilities, research institutes, historical and museum buildings are located here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmap.net" data-author=": " data-source="http://rusmap.net/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3/%D0%A8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA/21"><img itemprop="image" alt="Skipersky duct street on a city map" class="if uuid-2236287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2236287.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, most of the territory is industrial.  In general, Vasilievsky Island in this area recently began to be built up with residential buildings. </p><h2>  Large industrial area </h2><p>  At 14 Skipersky duct, Priboy factory is located, which produces electronic devices and components.  In the past, the entire territory with all buildings at this address was subordinate to this production, but after the collapse of a single country, the enterprise management leased some of the premises. </p><p>  Now on its territory a business center “Surf” has been built, where class “B” offices, warehouse and production facilities are located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Skipper duct 14" class="if uuid-2227492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2227492.jpg"></div><p>  Everywhere <span>modern repairs are made,</span> you can choose one of three Internet providers.  There is a guarded parking lot, an electronic access system, 12 elevators, rooms with a free layout of various meters.  That is, tenants can plan the space in accordance with their work needs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The complex is located near the metro stations Vasileostrovskaya and Primorskaya, major highways of the city.  This makes it affordable and convenient for visitors. </p><p>  On the territory there are several car repair shops, auto parts stores, companies for the production and sale of instrumentation, window and door structures, furniture stores.  “Seaside Park” is a company uniting initiative, business, and creative people.  It is located in the Mast housing.  In total, there are 45 buildings on the territory of the Priboy business center at Skipper Channel, 14. </p><p>  Adequate rental price, the possibility of placing production near the warehouse and office, transport accessibility and the availability of comfortable working and dining conditions are the reasons why premises in the Priboy business house rarely remain free from tenants. </p><h2>  Modern residential complex </h2><p>  The majestic modern 25-storey building at 20 Skipersky Protok is not only an apartment building consisting of four buildings, but also the location of several enterprises.  Here there is a multidisciplinary clinic "West-East", a private pension for the elderly "Skipersky", shops, an excellent bakery, beauty salons, cafes and restaurants.  There is everything to make life convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg, Skippersky duct" class="if uuid-2227501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2227501.jpg"></div><p>  This is a beautiful building in the form of a horseshoe with stained glass glazing of balconies, penthouses.  From here you can clearly see the historical center of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Residents have already moved into their modern apartments with decoration, so you can find reviews about the house on Skipersky duct, 20. They say that this is a wonderful house with a well-functioning infrastructure, worthy neighbors.  Manages the house of HOA "Skipersky, 20". </p><p>  Residents can use the underground parking, in the courtyard there is a modern, colorful and comfortable playground. </p><p>  Like any new building, in this house for the first couple of years there were reasons to worry: either the elevators are turned off, or the bulbs quickly burn out in the common corridors.  But gradually everything calmed down, and now few of the residents want to change their place of residence. </p><h2>  Sights of the Skipper Channel </h2><p>  Vasilievsky island is a great place to live.  This is the central part of the city.  All the historical sights of the city, large shops, the subway, roads are located nearby. </p><p>  Nearby are two nice and clean squares where you can take a walk in sunny weather.  There is another Small Havantsi square with the Nakhimov Banquet Hall (in the center there is a monument to Admiral P.S. Nakhimov).  And quite small - behind the monument to Peter I. </p><p>  For lovers of yachting, after 0.5 km there is the Nevsky Yacht Club and several marinas for boats and yachts.  In the yacht club you can rent a watercraft or take training in the management of a small sea vessel. </p><p>  On this street is the naval museum "Submarine D-2" Narodovolets "."  There is a real submarine since the Second World War, the center of modern art.  Kurekhina and, mentioned just above, the Museum of the History of Rescue on the Waters in the building of East Kronspitz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Skipper duct 14" class="if uuid-2227465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2227465.jpg"></div><p>  St. Petersburg carefully preserves its history, gives room for the creation and development of everything new and progressive. </p>
