  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet napkins: diagrams and description for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each craftswoman who crochets napkins is looking for patterns on different resources.  And it is not always possible to decipher them (especially for beginners), because in foreign sources the designations may differ.  In the article, we have selected several interesting options for you, which we will analyze in detail so that you get the perfect product. </p><h2>  Simple napkin </h2><p>  Crochet is not difficult.  The main thing is to ensure that the report in each row is repeated with the same number of loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern napkins" class="if uuid-2484538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2484538.jpg"></div><p>  Let's start with round napkins.  They are the simplest in execution if you already know the basics of knitting: air loops, connecting loops and posts. </p><p>  The product begins with 6 air loops (v. P.) Connected in a ring.  Based on them, you need to knit a 3-in.  n. and 19 double crochet posts that connect to the beginning of the second row.  The next stage is the same 19 columns after a chain of 3 air loops.  But between the elements you need to knit 1 in.  P. </p><p>  Next, a simple crochet napkin is knitted using chains of air loops to make the product more openwork.  In the diagram they are indicated by dots.  Now you know the principle of reading this scheme and quickly understand the further stages of work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But it is worth paying attention to the fact that in this figure there are elements where the double columns have a common vertex.  This is done as follows: 1 crochet column is knitted, but at the last stage it does not completely close and the second element begins, which also does not tie to the end.  When all 3 columns are made in this way, there will be 4 loops on the hook.  They are all together and you need to knit at a time. </p><h2>  Spiral pattern </h2><p>  Continuing our crochet napkin lessons.  The next option, although it will turn out a little denser than the previous product, looks no less attractive.  We will consider the main points in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large napkin" class="if uuid-2485180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2485180.jpg"></div><p>  The following knitting elements are used here (we go in order, as in the legend of the scheme): </p><ul><li>  The handle is a connecting column.  Used at the end of each row. </li><li>  The point is the air loop.  On the diagram they can be seen perfectly. </li><li>  A small cross is a single crochet.  They are used in the dense upper part of the product, forming triangles. </li><li>  A long cross is a single crochet.  This is the main element of the product.  It reads well in the diagram. </li><li>  The triangles in the last row of the napkin are pico.  They consist of three air loops, the base of which is tied to the same place from where it started. </li></ul><p>  Further, there should be no problems with reading the diagram.  The main thing is to correctly count the number of certain elements in each part of the pattern and repeat it exactly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Large openwork napkin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet beautiful napkins" class="if uuid-2484575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2484575.jpg"></div><p>  The crochet knitted pattern presented above in the photo is also a great option for beginners. </p><p>  In this graphic image, all the same notations are used, which means that it will not be difficult to read it.  We will analyze only the most difficult moments. </p><p>  A number of single crochet columns are knitted on the base of the ring from air loops.  Here they are presented in the form of simple sticks without dashes.  The second row is a group of columns with two double crochets with one vertex, which are separated by air loops (dots). </p><p>  In the 13th row, a lush column is used.  It is made of half-columns with a crochet with a common base and top.  First, double-crochet and pull the thread from the previous row.  Repeat this step again.  Remember that the base of all half-columns should be common.  Make 3-4 loops and then immediately connect them with one common c.  P. </p><p>  In the 18th and 19th rows there are loops that indicate pico.  How it is done, we described in the previous diagram.  So easily, we made out another simple napkin scheme for beginners.  Even schoolgirls in labor lessons can crochet it. </p><h2>  Napkin with cones </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted oval napkins" class="if uuid-2484541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2484541.jpg"></div><p>  Details to paint this option also does not make much sense.  All its elements are understandable and well readable.  Therefore, we pay attention to the fact that almost all patterns of napkins crocheted do not fully depict the entire product.  This is due to the fact that such figures depict one or more reports. </p><p>  What does it mean?  When the depicted element is knitted completely, then you need to start working on exactly the same piece of work.  Reports are repeating parts of a pattern that will ultimately lead to the completion of a series.  And then you need to use the connecting loop and the lifting column to start a new row. </p><h2>  Lush napkin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkin lessons" class="if uuid-2484587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2484587.jpg"></div><p>  This is an example of another beautiful napkin.  Crocheting according to this pattern already requires a certain level of skill.  But we already know the basic techniques of this needlework and have thoroughly mastered them on previous products. </p><p>  Since the scheme is slightly blurred, it is worth noting that in those places where tight knitting with 1 crochet columns is used, you need to knit them in an amount of 6 pieces.  So the product is obtained as complete and complete.  In places where these columns converge on a wedge, moving from two vertical stripes into one, 8 columns with one crochet and a common top are made.  And chopsticks without dashes indicate SC. </p><p>  The oval elements in the pattern are lush columns.  They are used quite often in this scheme. </p><h2>  Square napkin with cones </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet rectangular doily" class="if uuid-2484542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2484542.jpg"></div><p>  If you decide that in this type of needlework there are only round napkins, you are mistaken.  They can be knitted of any shape, not even the right one.  But this already depends on the skill level of the needlewoman.  Now we will consider <span>crocheting a square napkin.</span>  Its <span>scheme</span> is presented in the photo above. </p><p>  As you may have noticed, it fits in a circle and the final shape is obtained all from the same round product.  A chain shape is defined by chains of air loops, which are slightly larger in the corners and much smaller in the center. </p><p>  The layout of this product is quite simple.  It uses air loops, columns without and with several crochets.  If there is at least a minimum level of skill, then you can cope with this work in an hour or two. </p><h2>  Learning New Forms </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple crochet napkins for beginners" class="if uuid-2484543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2484543.jpg"></div><p>  We talked about square products.  But what if you want to create oval crochet napkins.  Yes, just take and knit them according to the schemes.  There are plenty of such graphic patterns.  But if you could not find such a scheme, you can safely remake the round napkin into an oval one.  An example of such a transformation is presented in the photo above. </p><p>  As you can see, initially it was a round napkin with a fairly simple algorithm for working on it, but the master decided to make it oval.  What does that require?  Make a long base.  The longer it is, the more elongated the product will be. </p><p>  Further it fits almost like in the original scheme, but with some nuances.  In the end parts of the oval napkin, a little more basic elements are crocheted so that their concentration is thicker and the final product is flat and without extra folds. </p><p>  If you still don‚Äôt know how to transform round patterns, you can experiment on unnecessary yarn, which is not a pity to dissolve several times.  Transfer each successful row in graphic form to your workbook so that you don‚Äôt remember later how you did it. </p><p>  If you combine the techniques for oval and square, you will be able to crochet a rectangular napkin.  But these are already experiments for the most experienced craftswomen who see where it is better to add loops and where to refrain from it. </p><h2>  Fillet knitting </h2><p>  Up to this point, we looked at how to create a product, starting from its middle in a circle.  But there is another interesting technique, which also turns out to make a rectangular napkin crocheted.  It is called fillet knitting.  You can see an example of such work in the main photo in the article. </p><p>  The main principle of this technique is the alternation of empty and filled square elements.  The patterns are similar to a drawing in a checkered notebook or monochrome cross-stitch.  The beginning of work is not the middle, but one of the edges.  For him, the necessary length of the chain of air loops is dialed. </p><p>  The cells themselves are created as follows: empty - double crochet, 2 air loops, double crochet;  shaded - 4 double crochet.  So you can create products of any size and with any drawings that you like. </p><p>  The article presents simple napkins for beginners.  Crocheting them is not only easy, but also exciting. </p>
