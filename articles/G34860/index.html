Negative comments </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even the most modern hotels are not immune from some negative aspects.  This is true for many institutions in Sochi.  Catherine‚Äôs Quarter, Velvet Seasons Hotel, reviews of which allow an objective picture to be drawn, allow us to conclude the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  After completing the registration process, guests are not just not helped to bring their bags, but they are not even brought to the room. </li><li>  The situation in the room is not very comfortable. </li><li>  In the room, guests can use only one outlet to charge their phones and connect other devices. </li><li>  Bed linens are much smaller than a bed and a blanket. </li><li>  The rooms have a musty smell.  They should be carefully ventilated before checking in. </li><li>  The hotel staff is not particularly polite to the guests (all too arrogant and not very smiling). </li><li>  In the bathrooms of the rooms located on the lower floors there is a strong smell of sewage. </li><li>  Weak wireless signal in the room. </li><li>  In the booklet on the rules of hotel accommodation, which is in each room, phone numbers are not indicated for communication with the administration. </li><li>  The building number is indicated only on one side of the building, which greatly complicates the search on the day of arrival. </li><li>  There are no ramps (it is impossible to roll a stroller or a suitcase). </li><li>  On the territory of the car ride. </li><li>  Overpriced late eviction rates.  No matter how many hours you stay in the room in the afternoon, you still need to pay half the day. </li><li>  Prolonged registration procedure. </li><li>  Lack of soundproofing in the rooms. </li><li>  Too many prohibitions and rules. </li><li>  Very small tv. </li><li>  There are no electric kettles in the rooms, although they are stated in the brochures. </li><li>  Instead of double beds in the rooms are two shifted. </li><li>  Given the small size of the sink, during washing, water pours onto the floor. </li><li>  Too little greenery on the territory (almost everything is asphalted). </li><li>  There is no curtain in the bathroom. </li><li>  Paid sunbeds on the beach. </li><li>  Due to the insufficient number of reception staff, queues are formed during registration. </li><li>  There is no drinking water in the room or on the floors. </li><li>  Access to the territory is open to outsiders. </li><li>  The food in the restaurant is pretty monotonous. </li><li>  There are no signs on the way to the hotel. </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Fans of the sea and the sun should pay attention to such a tourist destination as Sochi, Adler.  The hotel "Velvet Seasons", "Catherine's Quarter" - this is not just a hotel, but a full-fledged resort town, consisting of several "districts".  In addition, the developed infrastructure allows you to find everything you need for a comfortable stay and good rest, without leaving the complex.  The only thing lacking in all this splendor is a friendly and warm attitude from the staff.  Unfortunately, arrogance than participation is more likely to be encountered here. </p><p>  At first glance, this city-hotel may seem a little uncomfortable.  The reason for this is a huge amount of asphalt and concrete, an insufficient amount of greenery.  Nevertheless, the situation will change dramatically in a few years, when the seedlings turn into luxurious trees with thick crowns that create a cool shadow.  But such a problem as the movement of cars across the territory is likely to remain.  Given that not all drivers comply with speed limits, it would not hurt to install more speed bumps or involve traffic controllers. </p><p> It is worth noting that the "Catherine quarter" is located in relation to the sea most favorably.  You will have to walk no more than 30 meters from the nearest building to the beach.  Nevertheless, from the windows of the rooms it is not always possible to enjoy the azure waves, and the reason for this is the dense development.  Be sure to specify when booking where the windows of the apartments go, so that instead of beautiful landscapes you do not contemplate the concrete walls of the neighboring building. </p>
