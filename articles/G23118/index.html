    <p>  So, as already noted, mobile devices are released by the Canadian developer RIM.  In general, every Blackberry smartphone deserves attention for the reason that the company has its own corporate identity. </p><p>  Take a look, for example, at the popular modern smartphones.  They have a rectangular shape, a large screen, the same location of the navigation keys and, in almost all cases, the Android or iOS operating system.  Uniqueness can boast except that Nokia with its Lumia on Windows Phone.  Everything, nothing else to meet on the phone market! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, Blackberry should be highlighted separately.  The phone is equipped with a QWERTY-keyboard, which is not used on most smartphones.  The company has developed its own style - black color, strict tone lines.  Finally, phones are not copies of other devices, only for this, developers already need to pay tribute! </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  You can still list some of the <span>strengths of</span> these devices.  For example, your own operating system.  Due to the fact that the Blackberry smartphone does not work on Android, it responds well to the touch of the owner, does not slow down and does not allow delays in performing tasks. </p>

    <p>  In addition, if you still do not know what Blackberry is, it is worth mentioning a special encrypted method of <span>transmitting data.</span>  Due to this, all the information that is on your BlackBerry device is strictly classified.  Add the functions of setting passwords to folders and files here - and get the perfect phone for members of government and <span>government officials at</span> various levels. </p><p>  Another important point is a full keyboard.  Agree, this is a rather bold decision that most mobile device developers did not dare to make.  Due to it, the Blackberry device (we will publish reviews of the company below) is a convenient tool for sending mail, correspondence and viewing Internet sites anywhere! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The advantages of the devices can also include attractive design, build quality, materials that are used in the device‚Äôs case, as well as reliable and durable service. </p><h2>  Failures </h2>

    <p>  This is not to say that the BlackBerry brand is very successful in the smartphone market.  Troubles began in 2013, when after the release of the Z10 model, the development company suffered serious losses in the amount of almost 800 million dollars.  Then it was a question of reducing almost 40% of the company‚Äôs staff and closing the production of 2 out of 6 models. Media reported that the company could be sold to the Samsung smartphone market giant. </p><p>  As you can see, the company survived the crisis, but so far it has not been able to regain leadership positions in the telephone industry. </p><h2>  Popular models </h2><p>  Today, the most popular are touch models Z3, Z10, Z20, as well as keyboards 9900, 9320, Classic, Passport, Q5, Q10.  All of them are on sale.  Models operate on the basis of BlackBerry OS.  Thus, the applications that will work on these devices can be found on the BlackBerry App World (the same catalog of programs as Google Play or Appstore). </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of the models is quite diverse: at Blackberry, the phone can be found both in the middle class and in the premium segment.  For example, LEAP costs 20 thousand rubles, it is a business smartphone with a 5-inch <span>touch screen</span> .  A simpler-looking phone with a physical keyboard, model 9720, will cost 14 thousand rubles.  And his screen also recognizes touch (although smaller in size). </p><p>  Another inexpensive device is the BlackBerry Q5.  The device costs only 13 thousand rubles, while it has pretty good technical specifications that can satisfy most users. </p>

    <p>  There is also a Blackberry 9900, which is externally made in the style typical of the brand - a physical keyboard in combination with a touch screen.  There is a model of 20 thousand rubles.  In this case, the buyer can choose the color of the device. </p><p>  If we talk about premium phones, we should mention the BlackBerry P'9983 Porsche Design, the cost of which is 95 thousand rubles.  In the decoration of the phone used expensive materials, which can explain such a cost.  Another can be attributed to not the most affordable BlackBerry Passport phone - the device is made in an unusual square shape and costs 35 thousand. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It should be understood that reviews of Blackberry phones depend on which model the person worked with.  Generally speaking, some patterns can be revealed. </p><p>  Most of the devices are noted positively: working style, ‚Äúnothing more‚Äù, while all the applications that the buyer needs to get started are preinstalled here.  However, some negative reviews that can be grouped are interesting. </p>

    <p>  The first is an insufficiently powerful battery.  Many buyers complain that it lasts for a very short time.  What is Blackberry, we know, is a practical device for work.  How then can it be used if some of its models (especially for touch devices) can hold a charge of less than 12 hours? </p><p>  The second is overpriced.  Due to the fact that the phones are positioned as representatives of the business segment, their cost clearly exceeds the expectations of the buyer.  According to the assurances of people leaving reviews, even the most budget devices are not worth the money.  Obviously, the buyer is simply overpaying for a well-known brand. </p><p>  Third is the quality of the materials.  Reviews indicate that on the cheapest models in the finish of the case you can find low-quality materials that wear out too quickly and lose their appearance. </p><p>  So what is Blackberry?  These are reliable devices, designed primarily to perform work tasks and ensure the owner's comfortable activities.  She is well known in the world and continues to buy.  Therefore, it is possible that in the future the company will restore its leadership position in the market. </p>
