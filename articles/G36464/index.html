    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  As evidenced by the comments left by our compatriots, the rooms offered by the Plumeria Resort <span>Pattaya (Pattaya,</span> Thailand) almost all vacationers were very pleased with.  So, according to the guests, the apartments here are spacious, bright, furnished in a traditional style.  Furniture and appliances in the rooms are not new, but everything is in good, working condition.  Tourists also especially note the large built-in wardrobe, in which you can fold not only things, but also suitcases with bags, and a safe that you can use for free.  There is also a minibar in the room, in which the maid reports two or three bottles of drinking water every day during cleaning.  As for the furniture, then in the apartments, according to our compatriots, more than enough.  So, in addition to comfortable large beds, there are bedside tables, a chest of drawers, a pair of armchairs, a desk, a mirror.

So, according to them, they have not only a shower cabin, as in most other four-star hotels, but also a separate bath.  The room itself is quite spacious. </p><p>  The only minus of the apartments of this hotel, some guests considered too noisy air conditioning.  However, according to them, one can quickly get used to this or use earplugs before bedtime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plumeria resort pattaya reviews" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1047090.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning, maintenance </h2><p>  As for this paragraph, on the whole, there were no particular complaints from the guests on this side.  So, guests say that wet cleaning of the rooms was carried out every day.  Bed sheets and towels were changed twice a week.  The maids regularly replenished supplies of personal hygiene products (soap, toilet paper, shower gel, shampoo). </p><p>  Due to the fact that both furniture and appliances in the apartments of Plumeria Resort are not new, sometimes something can fail.  However, worrying about this, according to travelers who have been here, is not worth it.  So, the problem should be immediately reported to the administrator at the reception.  He will send you a wizard who will fix the malfunction as soon as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, in most cases they just try to place 4 * guests who have just arrived at the Plumeria Resort Pattaya hotel in their rooms as soon as possible.  In addition, administrators always take into account the wishes of tourists.  For example, if you come with a big family or company, then you can ask to move you into neighboring rooms or apartments, interconnected by an internal door.  If even at the moment this is not possible, you will be offered to relocate in a few days, when suitable rooms become available. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, as a rule, the hotel administration does not require guests to leave the room before noon, as is the case in many other hotels.
