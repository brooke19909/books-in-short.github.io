Sanatoriums set prices very different, but, I must say, this boarding house surprises not only with the quality of services, but also with a moderate cost.  For example, a double room in January will cost 3000 rubles per day.  For two people, and even in such a prestigious place, taking into account the cost of treatment, this is quite a bit.  The cost of luxury rooms also varies depending on the season; in general, such a room per day costs from 7,000 to 11,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Sanatorium "Matsesta", located in Sochi, annually receives hundreds of guests.  Its history is very interesting and begins at the beginning of the last century.  In 1902, on September 28, two bathtubs made of wood were installed on Old Matsesta.  A small shed, located near the caves, where there was a source of mineral water, this was the beginning of the history of the sanatorium, which is now known all over the world.  The beginning of the existence of this hospital was laid by Viktor Frantsevich Podgursky.  Perhaps he did not even know that this institution, which at that time was not even one, would become a place for which hundreds of tourists would come to Sochi.  Sanatorium ‚ÄúMatsesta‚Äù is named after the name of one girl.  That was her name.  Legend has it that Matsesta, in order to somehow alleviate the suffering of seriously ill people, penetrated the underworld for healing water.  At the risk of life, she took out healing moisture to all people.  And the saved saved the water in the name of the girl - Matsesta. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  ‚ÄúMatsesta‚Äù is a sanatorium in Sochi, which is located in an evergreen and very picturesque park, in which subtropical plants are pleasing to the eye all year round.  The hospital is located on the banks of the Matsesta River.  Two kilometers separates it from the seashore - it can be said, this is an ideal location, which is especially pleasant for visitors who want to not only heal, but also enjoy the healing sea air.  The sanatorium is located on Profsoyuznaya street, 1/1.  It‚Äôs easy to get there: there is a bus number 3 from the railway station, as well as a fixed-route taxi number 17.

    <h2>  ‚ÄúNukutskaya Matsesta‚Äù - a sanatorium where everyone in the district goes </h2><p>  In a small village called ‚ÄúNovonukutsk‚Äù there is a boarding house identical to Sochi.  It is located at a distance of 230 kilometers from Irkutsk, near the cities of Zima and Cheremkhovo.  This place was created in 1967.  The initiator of the boarding house was Gennady Karelin, who is the director of the Zalarinsky gypsum mine.  Initially, the sanatorium was a dispensary for the employees of this enterprise.  But today it is one of the most famous places for treatment and relaxation in the whole district.  The complex offers the services necessary for a good rest and a full passage of procedures.  Five meals a day, comfortable rooms with amenities and, of course, treatment.  At this point, procedures are under way to get rid of diseases of the female genital organs, musculoskeletal, nervous, and genitourinary systems.  It is also possible to cure diseases of the circulatory system and the gastrointestinal tract.  All thanks to the unique properties of mineral water, which is taken orally, in the form of compresses and baths - depending on the nature of the disease. </p><h2>  The miraculous properties of mineral water </h2><p>  So, as it has already been found out, the sanatorium ‚ÄúMatsesta‚Äù is known for the procedures that use healing water.  Why is she considered special?  Firstly, its chemical composition includes strong sodium chloride sulfide brines (mineralization index is 50-70 g / l).  And the hydrogen sulfide content is as follows: 240-270 mg / l.  And, of course, many other useful substances and trace elements, which include, for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria.  For example, in the above-mentioned ‚ÄúNukut Matsesta‚Äù water is used, which is taken from a depth of about four hundred meters.  If we analyze the classification of groundwater, it should be noted that they are among the strongest. </p>

    <h2>  Rest and treatment </h2><p>  For many people, a trip to a boarding house or sanatorium is in no way associated with relaxation - only with treatment.  But in the case of ‚ÄúMatsesta‚Äù this is not so.  A person who has spent at least a week in this place returns home refreshed, renewed, rested, full of strength and energy.  And those people who had the opportunity to visit various places are returning to the ‚ÄúMatsesta‚Äù, since this complex is truly unique.  Anyway, in Sochi you always want to come back to re-feel the fresh sea air, admire the subtropical plants and enjoy a comfortable climate. </p>
