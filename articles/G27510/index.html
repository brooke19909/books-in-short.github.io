Give preference to models with a raglan sleeve.  Such <span>outerwear</span> looks stylish, but at the same time not as trivial as a classic coat.  And raglan sleeves distract attention from the shoulder line, and due to this, all eyes are riveted to the waist.  Are you ready for creativity?  Then look for patterns of a coat with a raglan sleeve below. </p><h2>  Cropped coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve" class="if uuid-2240108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240108.jpg"></div><p>  If you lead an active lifestyle, then you just need that outerwear that will not hamper your movements.  In this case, a <span>classic coat</span> will not work for you.  It looks elegantly that lady who is in no hurry.  But active women should give preference to shortened models.  The pattern of a coat with a <span>raglan sleeve is</span> attached above.  Before you begin, you need to print it and select the material.  For such a style, any dense fabric is suitable.  You can choose something woolen with a simple pattern.  Remember that the cage and the goose foot are at their peak today. </p><p>  After you have selected the material and printed the pattern of the coat with a raglan sleeve without a collar, you can begin the sewing process.  We cut out the details from the fabric and begin to sew them together.  The first step is to grind off the sleeves.  Then we lay the side seams and insert the sleeves into the product.  Lastly, we sew the decor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fitted coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve and a hood" class="if uuid-2240110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240110.jpg"></div><p>  Such outerwear can be considered almost a classic, even despite the raglan sleeve.  The model is fitted, which allows its owner to feel more feminine.  The classics should be sewn from the classics.  Therefore, you should choose a dark dense woolen or cashmere material.  Of course, today you can see many models in non-standard yellow or green colors, but if you want your outerwear not to go out of fashion for 3-5 seasons, give preference to black, gray or sand colors. </p><p>  How to sew such a model of outerwear?  You should print the pattern of the coat with a raglan sleeve and transfer it to the material.  Then you need to cut out the details of the top and lining.  First we grind the sleeve, and then the tucks on the front and rear shelves.  Now we make side seams and then insert the sleeve into the product. </p><h2>  Jacket coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan burda sleeve" class="if uuid-2240111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240111.jpg"></div><p>  This is a lightweight coat model for beginners.  There are no unnecessary details, only the front and rear shelves, as well as the sleeves.  Of course, it is still not possible to sew a coat in 2 hours, but in a day it is quite possible.  Such outerwear can be worn on a daily basis.  And not only in the autumn-spring period, but even in warm winter weather.  Despite the classic style, the coat will completely allow its owner to play snowballs in it or ride a sled.  In general, such outerwear should be in the wardrobe of any girl. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern of a coat with a raglan sleeve is presented above.  It must be printed and transferred to the fabric.  Such models look good in both dark and light colors.  We cut out the details and proceed to work according to the standard scheme.  First we grind the sleeves, then the side seams, and after that we completely assemble the product. </p><h2>  Wide-sleeved coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve photo" class="if uuid-2240117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240117.jpg"></div><p>  This is a complicated version of the previous product.  What are the differences?  In the width of the sleeves.  If in the previous model they were narrow and, as a result, fit the arm tightly, then according to the pattern given above, we get a model with tube sleeves.  The coat is quite loose, so it is perfect for girls who prefer a business style.  But if you complement this model with a scarf and long gloves, you get an image with a touch of French chic. </p><p>  Let's start sewing.  You need to choose fabric based on your needs.  If you like bright colors, then sew from bright material, if you like monochrome - no one will mind.  We print out the pattern, scale it and transfer it to the fabric.  We will start stitching the product from the front shelves.  We sharpen the side insert to them, then the back detail, and complete the manufacture of the coat by attaching the sleeves. </p><h2>  Straight coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with a raglan sleeve without a collar" class="if uuid-2240116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240116.jpg"></div><p>  This is almost a classic model.  According to the pattern above, you can sew a sleeve in two ways: standard and modernized.  Choose the one you like best.  But do not forget about all those advantages that a raglan has and does not have a classic sleeve.  Such a coat will be relevant for both full women and thin girls.  The fact is that oversize is still at the peak of popularity, so many women are intentionally sewing clothes a couple of sizes larger. </p><p>  Let's start manufacturing.  We print out the pattern and scale it.  Now you need to cut out the details from the fabric.  And after that, you can begin the creative process.  Stitch side seams, sew in a sleeve.  Now you should sew in the collar.  If desired, you can supplement the coat with patch pockets. </p><h2>  Coat without collar </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve for a girl" class="if uuid-2240152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240152.jpg"></div><p>  Variations in this outerwear can be a lot.  For example, you can make a coat with large patch pockets, supplement the model with a belt or hood.  Fantasy should be shown, because no girl wants to go in the same style in which all the fashionable persons of the city dress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve for a girl" class="if uuid-2240469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240469.jpg"></div><p>  Patterns of a coat with a raglan sleeve and a hood are given above.  If you wear a hat, then outerwear should be sewn without additional parts.  But if you prefer to leave your head uncovered, a hood is best done.  He will be able to help out more than once in bad weather.  Choose the right fabric and start creating.  First you need to make sleeves, and then you can proceed to the base.  We sew all the parts together and, if necessary, supplement the product with a hood. </p><h2>  Wrap Coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve for a girl" class="if uuid-2240146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240146.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the simplicity of the pattern, such outerwear looks very elegant and feminine.  A large collar and floor-to-ceiling floors add elegance.  You can verify this by looking at the photo.  The pattern of a coat with a raglan sleeve is presented above.  If you want to make the slope of the sleeve more pronounced, you should slightly modernize the drawing.  We print out the pattern and transfer it to the fabric.  Now you need to stitch the product.  We start with the manufacture of sleeves.  Then you should connect the front shelves with the rear.  Now we sew sleeves in the places designated for them.  Finish the manufacture of the product by attaching the collar. </p><h2>  Baby coat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern coat with raglan sleeve for a girl" class="if uuid-2240467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2240467.jpg"></div><p>  Outerwear for little fashionistas is the most diverse.  Girls need to choose those things in which children will not only look beautiful, but also feel comfortable.  You should pay attention to bright fabrics.  Girls love colored things with interesting stripes.  It is worth starting from this, making a coat.  You can successfully combine the classic style with bright inserts and applications.  The pattern of a coat with a raglan sleeve for a girl is given above.  If desired, it can be somewhat modernized.  But you should do this carefully so as not to violate the proportions of the product.  We print out the Burda pattern.  We will sew a coat with a raglan sleeve in the following order: first we need to make sleeves, then side seams, and only then connect the parts.  Some may doubt this sequence.  Indeed, experienced seamstresses know that it is easier to insert a sleeve into an open armhole than into a closed one.  But this method is simply not applicable with raglan.  There are no shoulder seams in the coat; it is the sleeve that forms them.  Therefore, so that the product does not skew during the creation process, you should clearly follow the instructions. </p>
