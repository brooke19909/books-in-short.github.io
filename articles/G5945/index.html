    <h2>  Sea and entertainment </h2><p>  Just a couple of tens of meters from the sea is Tsalos Beach Hotel 3. O. <span>Crete, Heraklion</span> and other areas of the island are famous for their excellent beaches.  Most of them are rocky, but there is a sandy beach near the hotel.  Reviews indicate that the entry into the sea is convenient, the depth is small.  Sunbed and umbrella cost 3 euros.  You can agree for this amount and for 2 sunbeds with an umbrella.  Sometimes staff treats their customers with fruit.  The only negative is the frequent winds.  It depends on the location of the village.  If it happens that during the holiday there will be high waves from this side of the island, you can choose a beach at the other end, located in one of the quiet picturesque bays. </p><p>  But to come to Crete and spend all the rest on a sunbed is not particularly interesting.  Active tourists can rent a car (average price of 30-50 euros per day) and travel around the whole island, having got acquainted with the mass of attractions.  Sightseeing tours can be bought at the hotel itself, or you can use the services of numerous tour bureaus of the village.  Prices and quality of service there will pleasantly surprise you.  Saves around 50 euros per unit.  Throughout the season, trips are arranged all over the island with a visit to the Knossos Palace, and in the high season you can visit the amazing uninhabited islet of Kufunisi. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  A comfortable, carefree holiday is provided by Tsalos Beach Hotel 3. Reviews of those who have been there are the best confirmation of this.  This hotel is ideal for parents with children, youth, anyone who leads an active lifestyle.  It is not particularly comfortable here only for those who are not going to leave the hotel often, expecting daily entertaining animations from its employees.  All <span>that such people</span> can count on is music in the bar and infrequent evenings of national dance. </p><p>  Also, for some guests, too small showers are criticized, but in general, according to the vast majority of tourists, the Tsalos Beach Hotel, declared as a three-star, fully corresponds to its category, being one of its best representatives. </p>
