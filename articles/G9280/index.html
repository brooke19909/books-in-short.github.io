A large number of legends and traditions are associated with this amazing natural wonder, and local shamans consider the lake to be a real place of power and it is here that they hold their secret rites.  For many Russians, visiting Baikal is the most cherished dream.  But for some reason, its implementation is always put off the shelf.  Our article will be useful to those who decided to drop all their affairs and finally go to the shores of the ancient lake.  We will tell you as much as possible about how to get from Lake Moscow to Lake Baikal. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Baikal from Moscow" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1765293.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The distance between Moscow and Lake Baikal </h2><p>  The most significant reason why the trip to the sacred lake is usually postponed indefinitely is the distance separating the central part of Russia from Lake Baikal.  It seems significant even to experienced travelers with hundreds of roads and countries passed behind. </p><p>  According to average estimates, Muscovites may end up on Lake Baikal, having overcome five thousand three hundred kilometers.  Depending on the chosen method of transportation, the path can be increased by another five hundred kilometers.  Of course, not everyone will decide on such a trip, fraught with many surprises.  But all the tourists who visited the sacred lake claim that the impressions and emotions of the trip can not be compared with anything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are still interested in information on how to get to Lake Baikal from Moscow, then we are ready to tell you the best routes.  And also orient at the approximate cost of travel. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baikal how to get from Moscow by car" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1765300.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Lake Baikal: how to get from Moscow </h2><p>  In summer, the route from the capital to the most beautiful lake in the world becomes very popular.  After all, the best time to visit Lake Baikal is the summer months.  July and August are the most comfortable, although frequent changes in temperature are also observed in this period. </p><p>  Those who are considering how to get from Lake Moscow to Lake Baikal usually consider the following travel options: </p><ul><li>  air flight; </li><li>  Railway; </li><li>  own car. </li></ul><p>  Each of these methods has its own characteristics, and both beginner travelers and experienced tourists who have conquered overseas distances more than once need to know about them. </p><h2>  Baikal: how to get from Moscow by plane </h2><p>  This is the fastest and most convenient way to be on the shores of the sacred lake.  If you are in Moscow, the following Siberian cities will be the closest settlements to Baikal for you: </p><ul><li>  Irkutsk </li><li>  Ulan-Ude. </li><li>  Severobaykalsk. </li></ul><p>  Moscow has established air links with each of the above cities.  But the fact that it is rather irregular will turn out to be an unpleasant surprise for tourists.  It is best to choose the destination airport of Irkutsk, flights from Moscow fly several times a week, and getting to Lake Baikal will be very convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Keep in mind that air travel is far from the cheapest way to be in Irkutsk.  A round-trip ticket for an adult will cost no less than fifteen thousand rubles.  You will spend about five and a half hours en route.  Do not save money and choose flights with transfers: they are usually not so cheap as to extend the trip for another five to six hours. </p><p>  If you book tickets in advance, they will cost about twenty percent less than the regular price.  In addition, the chances of getting to stocks and sales are increasing. </p><p>  It is most convenient to go from Irkutsk to the following places: </p><ul><li>  Olkhon. </li><li>  Arshan. </li><li>  Listvyanka. </li><li>  Circum-Baikal Railway. </li></ul><p>  You can get here by taxi or minibus.  You will overcome seventy kilometers in a couple of hours. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baikal how to get from Moscow by plane" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1765299.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Train travel </h2><p>  So, you have decided that it is too expensive to travel by plane to Lake Baikal.  How to get from Moscow by train?  There is nothing complicated here. </p><p>  When planning a trip by train, you need to take into account the fact that without transfers from the capital you can get to the same cities that we have already listed - Irkutsk, Listvyanka, Ulan-Ude.  But in this case, the trip will take about three days. </p><p>  This fact is a significant minus of the trip.  After all, not everyone feels great in a train for such a long time.  But the cost of a ticket for many can compensate for some inconvenience along the way.  The average price of a reserved seat in one direction is five thousand rubles.  In addition, it must be borne in mind that in the season tickets in this direction are sold out like hot cakes.  Therefore, you need to be at least efficient in order to take return tickets. </p><p>  If you choose the destination of Ulan-Ude, then from here you can go to the eastern coast of Lake Baikal.  The most popular among tourists here are <span>Chivyrkuy Bay</span> and the Barguzin Valley. </p><p>  If you are a lover of wild places where there are not too many tourists, then take train tickets to Severobaykalsk.  From this city they usually go to the northern part of Lake Baikal.  Here, there are very beautiful taiga places where it is best to come with tents and all the necessary accessories for relaxation. </p><p>  From any of these cities, buses, minibuses and, of course, taxis go to Lake Baikal. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Baikal how to get from Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1766244.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Drive to Lake Baikal </h2><p>  Many Muscovites dream of a real adventure, planning to go to Baikal in their own car.  How to get from Moscow by car?  Everything is not so simple here.  Of course, the direction itself is known and quite lively, but such a long road is fraught with great difficulties. </p><p>  First of all, tourists should keep in mind that the quality of roads in some sections of the road leaves much to be desired.  And this already leads to vehicle breakdowns.  In addition, it is necessary to carefully plan stops and possible arrivals in other large cities located along the <span>federal highway.</span> </p><p>  By the way, there are two ways to <span>make a route</span> to Lake Baikal.  Muscovites have a choice between the Volga (M-7) and Siberia (M-53) routes.  On the way, travelers will meet different cities, there will be an opportunity to meet new people and interesting places.  Interestingly, for these five thousand kilometers, travelers will have to change five time zones, which will affect the length of the day's journey.  Experienced car tourists in Russia advise newcomers to always spend the night in specially designated places, of which there are a sufficient number along the routes.  After all, fatigue and lack of sleep will negatively affect the driver‚Äôs health, which will increase the risk of an accident. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baikal how to get from Moscow by train" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1765303.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The cheapest way to get to Baikal </h2><p>  Of course, many residents of the capital are thinking about how to get to Lake Baikal from Moscow cheaply.  Unfortunately, we will not reveal to you the secret of the most budgetary way to overcome such a significant distance.  Do not neglect the fact that each person has his own concepts of high cost and low cost.  For example, it is easier for some people to spend fifteen thousand rubles on air travel than to lose several days on the road.  For this category, loss of time is an unforgivable luxury.  But others are ready to spend a couple of weeks on the road by car, but save. </p><p>  Therefore, each potential tourist must decide for himself how to get from Lake Moscow to Baikal is the cheapest and most comfortable.  And we, in turn, have collected all the features and nuances that you will need to take into account when setting off on a journey. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to Baikal from Moscow cheap" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1765308.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Travel features: general recommendations </h2><p>  Each trip should be carefully planned, and our relevant information based on the recommendations of experienced travelers can help with this: </p><ul><li>  the best time to visit Lake Baikal is July and August; </li><li>  in the second half of summer from Irkutsk to the lake can be reached by water - on motor ships; </li><li>  when building a car route, it is necessary to take into account the congestion of the federal highway; </li><li>  after arriving in Irkutsk, it is better to spend one day exploring the city and only then with new strength go to Baikal; </li><li>  during the trip, most of the money must be kept in cash, because not all small towns can quickly find an ATM. </li></ul><p>  We hope you find our tips helpful.
