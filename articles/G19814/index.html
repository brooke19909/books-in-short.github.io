Reign of the Ming Dynasty</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As a result of the peasant uprising, the power of the Mongols was overthrown.  The <span>Yuan dynasty</span> (foreign) was replaced by the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644).  Since the end of the XIV century.  China is thriving economically and culturally.  Old cities begin to develop, and new ones appear, in which trade and craft prevail.  The process of the country's evolution is supported by the emergence of manufactories, where the division of labor is being introduced.  The best scientists, architects, artists are attracted to the imperial court.  The main emphasis is on urban construction. </p><h2>  Chinese Ming Dynasty: Economic Transformation </h2><p>  Almost immediately after the advent of this dynasty, measures began to be introduced to improve the existing situation of the peasants, since it was they who helped make the change of power.  The Ming Dynasty revived the allotment system in the North, which eliminated the economic power of the landowning elite (North China), which had previously allied with the Yuanyamm.  And in the South, everything was exactly the opposite - landlord tenure was saved.  Modernization of the existing tax accounting system, as well as special attention on the part of the authorities to irrigation - all this contributed to rapid economic growth. </p><p>  The growth of the urban economy was traced, the reason for which was regional specialization (in Jiangxi, porcelain production was located, and in Guangdong, mainly railway), the emergence of new directions, a special place among which was the construction of 4-deck ships. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="min dynasty" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/755539.jpg"></div>

Private manufactories appear on the basis of merchant capital.  Central and southern China became the site of the emergence of artisan settlements.  Subsequently, prerequisites were formed for the creation of a nationwide market (the number of official fairs was already close to 38). </p><h2>  but on the other hand </h2><p>  Along with the above-mentioned progressive phenomena, a number of obstacles were present that hindered the development of entrepreneurship (this was characteristic of the whole East).  These include state monopolies, state-owned manufactories, in which more than 300 thousand artisans worked, state borealis from trade and <span>craft activities.</span>  It was they who did not give the economy the opportunity to switch to a qualitatively different production. </p><h2>  Ming Dynasty <span>Foreign Policy</span> </h2><p>  During the period of economic growth and strengthening of state power, an offensive policy was carried out mainly (until 1450 it was called ‚Äúfacing the sea‚Äù, and after that it became ‚Äúfacing the barbarians‚Äù). </p><p>  The most significant event of this time is the expansion of China, which affected the states of the South Seas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="min dynasty 1368 1644" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/755575.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  The Ming Dynasty, in view of the growing need to solve the problem of Japanese, Chinese, Korean piracy, was forced to create a fleet of 3500 ships.  Further economic growth contributed to the completion of seven expeditions of a separate fleet, led by the chief eunuch Zhen Hae, to East Africa.  This naval commander had at his disposal 60 large 4-decker ships, the length of which reached 47 meters, they had such pretentious names as "Pure harmony", "Welfare and prosperity".  Each had 600 crew members, including a group of diplomats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Excerpt from logbooks </h2><p>  According to them, in the course of his journey to the coast of <span>East Africa,</span> Zhen, speaking in modern language, acted calmly and humbly at sea.  However, occasionally small foreigners did not submit to the good intentions of the emperor. </p><h2>  Ming Dynasty reign: history </h2><p>  The main emphasis of Zhu Yuanzhang (the first <span>Chinese emperor)</span> in the period 70-80.  made for the final expulsion of the Mongols from his country, the suppression of attempts at social protest among the Chinese peasants through the process of improving the economy and strengthening personal power.  Such tasks were accomplished by increasing the army, strengthening centralization, and applying the most stringent methods that caused discontent among all sections of the population. </p><p>  Along with limiting the powers of local authorities, the emperor relied on numerous relatives who later became rulers - van (title) of specific principalities due to the fact that, in his opinion, children and grandchildren are the most reliable. </p><p>  Vanities were all over the country: near the periphery they performed a defensive function against threats from the outside, and in the center they acted as a counterweight to separatism and rebellion. </p><p>  In 1398, Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang died, after which the court camarilla, bypassing his direct heirs, elevated Zhu Yongwen, one of his grandchildren, to the throne. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the fall of the Ming Dynasty" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/755589.jpg" width="298"></div>

    <h2>  Third Emperor of the Ming Dynasty </h2><p>  Zhu-Di continued his father's policy of centralizing the state, while abandoning the existing system of vanities (in 1426, the rebellion of dissatisfied vanes was suppressed).  He besieged the titular nobility and strengthened the importance of the palace secret services in the process of government. </p><p>  Under him, the question of the <span>Chinese capital was</span> finally resolved <span>,</span> which significantly influenced the political weight of the South and the North.  So, the latter, acting as the cradle of Chinese civilization, loses its weight in the III - V centuries.  in favor of the former due to the constant threat of nomads.  These parts of the country are carriers of fundamentally different traditions and mentalities: southerners are complacent, nonchalant, and northerners are decisive, tough, with a higher social status - ‚Äúhan-zhen‚Äù.  All this was supported by existing linguistic (dialectical) differences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ming dynasty emperors" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23495/755586.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  Yuan and Suni chose the North as the political base, while the Ming dynasty, on the contrary, the South.  That is what gave them the opportunity to win. </p><p>  In 1403, the new emperor, the existing Beiping (translated as "Peaceful North") was renamed Beijin ("Northern Capital").  So until 1421 in China there were two capitals - the imperial in the north and the government-bureaucratic in the south.  Zhu Di thereby got rid of the influence and guardianship of the southerners, while simultaneously depriving the southern bureaucracy (Nanking) of excessive independence. </p><p>  In 1421, the capital was finally consolidated in the North.  In this <span>regard, the</span> Ming Dynasty provided itself with the support of the North Chinese population and strengthened the country's defense. </p><h2>  Emperors Min </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, this dynasty ruled in China from 1368 to 1644.  Ming replaced the Mongol Yuan during the popular uprising.  Only sixteen emperors of this dynasty ruled for 276 years.

It is known that the <span>peasant war,</span> in contrast to the uprising, is not only numerous, but also affects different sections of the population.  It is more ambitious, long-term, well-organized, disciplined due to the presence of a leadership center and the presence of ideology. </p><p>  It is worthwhile to analyze this event in more detail in order to understand how the fall of the Ming dynasty happened. </p><p>  The first stage of the peasant movement began in 1628 and continued for 11 years.  Over 100 foci failed to unite, which is why they were suppressed.  The second stage occurred in 1641 and lasted only 3 years.  The joint forces of the rebels were led by the capable commander-in-chief Li Zichen.  He was able to form a peasant army from the numerous numerous chaotically arising units, which was distinguished by discipline, had a clear tactic and strategy. </p><p>  Lee was rapidly advancing under popular slogans regarding the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty.  He promoted universal equality, made a promise regarding the non-collection of taxes at the end of the war. </p><p>  As it became known, in the early morning of April 26, 1664, absolutely no one came to the ringing of the bell, which called on the ministers to come to the emperor Chun Chen.  Then he said that this was the end, his associates began to sob.  The empress turned to her husband for the last time and told him that for 18 years she had been loyal to him, but he had never bothered to listen to her, which led to this.  After that, the empress hanged herself on her belt. </p>

    <p>  The emperor had no choice but how ineptly to kill his daughter and concubine with a sword and hang himself on a belt on an ash tree.  Following the emperor, according to the customs of that time, all 80 thousand officials passed away.  According to one version, the Great Sovereign left a note on a piece of silk that was addressed to Li Zichen.  In it, he said that all officials are traitors, and therefore deserve to die, they must be executed.  The emperor justified his passing away from life by his unwillingness to be obligated to the very last, despised of his subjects.  After several hours, the invaders' messengers removed the emperor‚Äôs body from the tree, and then placed it in a coffin, which was intended as a beggar. </p><h2>  Tomb of the Great Ming Dynasty </h2><p>  More precisely, tombs, since the graves of the thirteen emperors of this dynasty are located on the territory of the famous memorial.  The tomb of the Ming Dynasty extends over 40 square meters.  km  It is located about 50 km from Beijing (to the north) at the foot of the great Mountain of Heavenly Longevity.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Manchu yoke of the newly minted Qing dynasty, it can be said, was imposed on the country during the European <span>bourgeois revolutions,</span> which doomed China for as much as 268 years of political and socio-economic stagnation before the growing colonial expansion on the part of Europe. </p><p>  The two most powerful dynasties are Ming and Qing.  But the differences between them are enormous: the first showed the people the opportunity to embark on a new, progressive path, made it possible for them to feel free, meaningful.  The second one destroyed everything that was created by many years of work, made the state reclusive. </p>
