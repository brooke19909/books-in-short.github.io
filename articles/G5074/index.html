  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights and amusement parks of Tomsk</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, having once visited Tomsk, called this city boring, dull.  The Russian classic was wrong.  There are also architectural monuments and amusement parks.  Tomsk also has a caricature monument to Chekhov.  It is installed on the waterfront.  So local residents avenged the writer for his offensive words. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomsk city" class="if uuid-2616702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616702.jpg"></div><p>  Below are the parks and entertainment centers in Tomsk.  There are many wonderful places for families. </p><h2>  "Gambling addiction" </h2><p>  This is the name of one of the most popular amusement parks in Tomsk.  This is a huge complex, which includes a large selection of attractions, a festive agency, creative studios.  Gambling regularly hosts celebrations.  The address of the amusement park: Tomsk, Lenin Avenue, 174. </p><p>  X-Project and City Park belong to Gambling.  Located at the same address.  This is the most modern entertainment center for children in Tomsk. </p><h2>  "Sunny town" </h2><p>  This is another park with a huge selection of children's entertainment.  Tomsk, Krasnoarmeyskaya street, house 120 - this is the address of the "Solar Town".  There is a playground between the entertainment center "Fakel" and the store "Tomsk goods." </p><p>  In the "Sunny Town" various city events are held.  However, the small residents of Tomsk love the amusement park primarily for attractions, of which there are about fifteen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ice town </h2><p>  As you know, in <span>Tomsk the climate is</span> harsh.  Winters are cold, long.  Summer is short.  But parks mainly work in the warm season.  In 2004, an <span>ice town</span> appeared here <span>.</span>  There was nothing like this in Tomsk before. </p><p>  A crystal attraction, and this is the name of this attraction, is located near the Tomsk Commodities shopping center.  The figures that can be seen in the ice town resemble the main architectural <span>monuments of Tomsk.</span> </p><p>  "Crystal attraction" caused delight among local residents.  A year later, the first festival of ice sculptures took place here. </p><h2>  "Emerald City" </h2><p>  Other amusement parks in Tomsk are less popular.  Many locals spend their free time with children in the Emerald City shopping center.  In addition to shops and cafes, there is a Kinderville playground and several attractions located on the third floor.  Shopping and entertainment center is located at: Komsomolsky prospekt, 13-b. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kleinburd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emerald City" class="if uuid-2617361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2617361.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to amusement parks, there are many attractions in Tomsk that are visited both by local residents and city guests.  Below is a summary of each of them. </p><h2>  Camp park </h2><p>  This square is located in the Kirovsky district.  It arose in the 19th century and has nothing to do with the Stalinist camps.  Previously, the summer camp of the infantry regiment was located on the site of the park.  Today <span>this square</span> is one of the main attractions of Tomsk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wetravelers.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp garden" class="if uuid-2616707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616707.jpg"></div><h2>  New Cathedral Square </h2><p>  This architectural ensemble is over 150 years old.  The first building appeared in 1842.  At the beginning of the 20th century, rallies of radical students were held here.  In Soviet times, holiday demonstrations. </p><h2>  Monument to Anton Chekhov </h2><p>  The sculpture is located along the promenade, in the most suitable place for the promenade.  The authors of the monument are Leonty Usov and Maxim Petrov.  The writer is depicted in a rather comical way, and on the pedestal there is an inscription according to which the drunk local resident saw him that way, lying in a ditch and reading "Chestnut".  It is worth saying that the author of "The Cherry Orchard" called Tomsk a city not only boring, but also drunk, which was probably remembered by the sculptors when they were visited by the muse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foretime.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Chekhov" class="if uuid-2616706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616706.jpg"></div><h2>  Ruble Monument </h2><p>  Guests of the city love to be photographed at this monument.  The monument dedicated to the national currency was originally located on the New Cathedral Square.  However, among the inhabitants of the city there were vandals who mercilessly damaged the attraction.  The monument had to be moved to the territory of the Museum of <span>History of Tomsk.</span>  The huge ruble is made of Siberian pine. </p><h2>  Monument to Happiness </h2><p>  In 2005, a sculpture was installed on Shevchenko Street, depicting the famous character from the Soviet cartoon "Once Upon a Dog".  The wolf appears before passers-by in a state of complete bliss, which he achieved after a very hearty dinner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmystery.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Happiness" class="if uuid-2616703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616703.jpg"></div><h2>  NKVD Investigation Prison </h2><p>  A visit to this museum, of course, should not be included in the entertainment program for family vacations.  However, it will be useful for adults and teenagers to get acquainted with the exhibits presented in the memorial complex.  The museum, dedicated to the dark page of Russian history, is located in the former investigative prison of the NKVD. </p><h2>  Square of wooden architecture </h2><p>  And this attraction can be visited with young children.  The square of wooden architecture appeared in Tomsk quite recently - in 2013.  Here are the works of local artists. </p><h2>  House with a tent </h2><p>  Experts call this building a real architectural masterpiece.  A house with a tent appeared here at the beginning of the 20th century.  The attraction is a luxurious wooden mansion.  The decor is very skillful.  From a distance it seems that the building is covered with a lace tablecloth. </p><h2>  Buff garden </h2><p>  The square was built in 1907.  At the beginning of the 20th century, successful merchants and manufacturers were spending leisure time here.  The garden housed a cozy restaurant serving Caucasian dishes.  In Soviet times, the institution was closed.  The square was converted into an amusement park.  In 2004, a large-scale reconstruction was carried out. </p><p>  There are several more parks in Tomsk.  Among them are the University Grove, the city park of culture and leisure, Teacher's and Troitsky squares.  A botanical garden is also worth a visit.  In addition, there are many event agencies in Tomsk.  "Arena of entertainment" - one of the companies providing services for organizing holidays. </p>
