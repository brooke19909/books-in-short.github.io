  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sewerage in a private house - what's the secret?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, living should be with amenities.  Today you rarely meet a family that manages with old methods of arrangement - a toilet on the street, a stove heating system, using only cold water and a bathhouse, instead of a bathroom or shower.  Now, when designing a house, people strive to create a cozy and comfortable corner so that each room is equipped with the necessary amenities.  This also applies to such an element as a sewer in a private house.  Many residents install a toilet in the house and sewer, which indicates the comfort and improvement of housing. </p><p>  If there is no central sewage system, then the sewage system in a private house can be performed independently.  The sewage system must be organized at the beginning of the construction phase, but if the house is already built, then you can rebuild its individual premises.  In a private house, wastewater is not always disposed of centrally, but mainly on an individual basis.  There are several methods to complete a process such as a sewer in a private house.  It can be like a filtering well, a cesspool or a septic tank.  Each method is determined based on the geological features of the area, and has its own peculiarity. </p><p>  A cesspool is the easiest way to organize a sewer system.  In this case, if necessary, the pit will have to be cleaned occasionally, you can do it yourself or use the services of special services.  A cesspool can be installed in any house with any soil.  It can be made of iron, concrete, wood or brick.  Typically, a sewage device in a private house has its own depth and width, the cesspool should be at least two meters deep, and 2 or 2.5 meters long and wide.  On the side where the hatch is located, the pit should be tilted.  To protect against unpleasant odors from the pit, the hatch must be two-door - the first door is above the ceiling, the second above the ground.  If the pit will be made of cement or brick, then in this case it is necessary to cover the internal walls with plaster. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next way is a <span>filter well.</span>  Such sewage in a private house is most suitable for small houses.  A filter well is made of brick, concrete and a reinforced concrete ring.  The depth of the well should be greater than in the cesspool, about 3 meters, and a width of -1.5 - 2.5 meters.  Such a sewage device in a private house is widely used only with moderate discharge of water.  The bottom and outer <span>walls of the well</span> must be covered with gravel or gravel for one meter.  The internal walls must be plastered with <span>cement mortar.</span> </p><p>  And the last option for sewage is a septic tank.  There are several sedimentation tanks (usually 2 or 3) with overflows.  This is a standard <span>type of sewage system, the</span> depth of which is 2.5 meters and a width of 1.5 meters.  You need to know that in the septic tank, sewage lasts only 3 days.  Unlike other types of sewerage, air can be supplied to the septic tank from separate ventilation, which filters the wastewater. </p><p>  For the proper sewage system, it is necessary to follow the rules and regulations in construction.  Therefore, there is such a thing as snip outdoor sewage, with which you can safely carry out your activities.  Also, special permits for sewage equipment will help to avoid misunderstanding with local authorities and administration. </p><p>  The market for sewer systems is vast.  Today you can pick up any type of sewage system and for any money.  In order to choose your system correctly, it is necessary to take into account the following factors - how many people live in the house, the duration of the use of sewers and how much will be drained.  In order for the sewerage in a private house to be effective and without problems, all the above points should be taken into account. </p>
