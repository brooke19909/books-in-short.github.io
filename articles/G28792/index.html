Since the main objects of entertainment infrastructure are, as a rule, in the central part of Anapa, it is worth staying in rooms that are not far from it.  The main age category of people who prefer to relax in such places are tourists who are from 18 to 35 years old. </p><p>  Which room near the center is best to rent in Anapa's private sector?  Experienced tourists recommend such farms as "On Astrakhan 69", "Komilfo", "On Lenin 109".  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, there is everything for a comfortable pastime, including Wi-Fi.  Due to the fact that the apartments are located in the central part of Anapa, their cost does not increase much - renting a room for a day will cost about 300-400 rubles per person - such prices can also be found on the outskirts of the city, and, as tourists themselves note, living conditions will not differ much. </p><p>  Travelers know that, housed in the center of Anapa, they will be within walking distance from the central market, pharmacies, shops, as well as various places for entertainment - karaoke, bars, restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  At these addresses are the best central apartments in the private sector of Anapa: </p><ul><li>  Pioneer Avenue, 26. </li><li>  St.  Sovetskaya, 22a. </li><li>  St.  Red Green 26. </li><li>  St.  Gorky, 66. </li><li>  St.  Tverskaya, 22/1. </li><li>  St.  Constitution, 57. </li></ul><p>  If guests of the city understand that noise will interfere with them or their children at night, then there is always the opportunity to rent housing in more remote areas.  In the event that it is still planned to visit the entertainment places located in the city center, while staying on the outskirts, you can use the public transport services, which runs regularly in Anapa.  In this case, the proximity of the house to the stopping point will be an important factor to pay attention to during placement. </p>
