  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Northern region of Voronezh: hell on the roads and a million new buildings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The northern district of Voronezh (Moskovsky Prospekt, <span>General Lizyukova,</span> Antonov-Ovseenko, Khodzunov, Victory Boulevard and many other small streets) is a sleeping quarter, which is not an independent intracity formation.  It is located close to the center and at the same time is famous for some of the problems that we will now discuss. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.702887" data-lng="39.18413099999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/2/2/3/2223.png"></div><h2>  Traffic jams </h2><p>  The northern region of Voronezh is famous among the townspeople for its amazing traffic load.  To get to work in the center in the morning, local residents have to get stuck in kilometers of traffic jams.  On Moskovsky Prospekt, you can travel 1-1.5 hours, breaking about 3-4 kilometers. </p><p>  When choosing housing, this factor should be taken into account.  The road to work and back is a real test, and the "burgundy streets" in the navigator are very depressing, especially if you overslept. </p><p>  Also in the North is a large private sector with very large houses.  It is because of the chic of local housing that this place was called the "valley of the poor."  Representatives of the elite of the past two decades and some high-ranking officials live here.  It is here that the "northerners" try to go round the traffic jam on Shishkova Street, which irritates the locals very much.  On the Korablinov street you can even find a barrier that tacitly reminds us that someday it can be closed once and for all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pleasant but dense building </h2><p>  Until recently, the northern <span>district of the city of Voronezh</span> was the outskirts.  It is this fact that allowed urban planners to plan residential areas in an integrated manner.  If Voronezh is an example of a point development, then the Northern region is continuous housing estates. </p><p>  Fortunately, it is almost impossible to find single houses here.  But there are real fortresses with kindergartens and playgrounds.  The presence of sports simulators and recreational areas in the yards is also a normal occurrence. </p><p>  There are, of course, critics of the development of the Northern region of Voronezh.  The most popular <span>residential complexes</span> are concrete-brick jungle without a single tree or shrub, but against the background of Khrushchev, which has expanded in other quarters, you can come to terms with this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microdistrict north" class="if uuid-2392383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/2392383.jpg"></div><h2>  Lack of parking spaces and arson of cars </h2><p>  This is a real feature of the Northern region of Voronezh.  Despite the abundance of modern neighborhoods, their tenants in the evenings test their patience, trying to put their car at night. </p><p>  Another problem is regular hooliganism in the form of arson cars in the yards of the Northern region of Voronezh.  The property of residents has been suffering for several years, and a gang of hooligans has not been eliminated so far.  It is worth noting that the fashion for pyromania is now a bit quiet, and since 2017, motorists can sleep peacefully. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="v-kurse-voronezh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="north new buildings" class="if uuid-2392384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/2392384.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive side </h2><p>  Northern is an area that can live independently.  In terms of infrastructure, it is an independent unit. </p><ul><li>  There are many huge grocery stores.  And if the residents of the center are forced to purchase small grocery stores, then the ‚Äúnortherners‚Äù have access to huge food malls, where you can find anything you want. </li><li>  The northern district of Voronezh is a lot of opportunities for entertainment.  To do this, you do not even need to travel beyond it.  Although in the evening, after rush hour, you can reach the central part of the city in 10-15 minutes, nevertheless there are several large cinemas, shopping centers and even a night club. </li><li>  It is relatively calm here.  The whole area is new buildings, respectively, and local residents are people who have accumulated on an apartment or are pulling a mortgage.  All of them are interested in observing the norms of life in society, and most protect the place where they have to live.  This is a very strong feature - such an atmosphere of bliss and silence, as in the Northern region of Voronezh, is almost never found in the evenings. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monument of fame" class="if uuid-2392388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/2392388.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In the North, most types of services are widely represented: from car services to private dental clinics. </li><li>  There are beautiful parks where you can feed squirrels, and even the real forest, in which the Olympic sports center is located.  North is an ideal place for sports.  Several skating rinks, a ski run of different lengths, outdoor fitness equipment are just part of the leisure activity for outdoor enthusiasts. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="videohive.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="runner in the forest" class="if uuid-2391933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2391933.jpg"></div><p>  By and large, this neighborhood is one of the best parts of Voronezh.  He, of course, is not without the problems inherent in the whole city.  But against the backdrop of the uncomfortable neighborhoods along January 9 or the anecdotal Mashmet Severny, it's just a fairy tale.  Here you can safely live with children, sleep peacefully at night and have a good quality leisure time. </p>
