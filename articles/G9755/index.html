What do you need to know for those people who prefer gold as an investment tool?  What are the rules for buying gold assets? </p><p>  Of course, such a serious operation as <noindex>  <span>buying gold</span> </noindex>  only possible with an identity document. </p><p>  A bank can sell gold to a person - this is the best option, since by purchasing gold bars in a bank, the risk of fraud is reduced to almost zero.  The list of banks providing such services is not very large (Sberbank, Absolut Bank, Uniastrum Bank, Nomos Bank), so you need to independently study the specifics of purchasing gold (investment coins) in any bank.  The most important thing is to pay attention to two points - is there a possibility for the bank to buy back an ingot or coin bought by a person, and what is the value of the spread, namely the difference between the sale and purchase of gold. </p><p>  Some aspects are to <noindex>  <span>sell gold in banks</span> </noindex>  CIS countries may vary.  The legal aspect is also required when buying gold.  It must be respected by both the buyer and the seller.  All legal aspects can be found in the corresponding legal document, which was approved in accordance with the decree of the government of the Russian Federation.  This resolution clearly states that the sale (purchase) of gold bullion can only be carried out in the presence of a person investing in gold.  Weighing procedures are required before purchase to eliminate any assumptions or inaccuracies.  Weighing is carried out with an accuracy of 0.01 g. The Bank is obliged to issue documents to the person from the manufacturer, which confirm the origin of the ingots, as well as the gold contained in them.  The process of buying gold bars in addition, involves the preparation of cash documents, which should indicate the price of the gold bar, weight, number and cleanliness. </p><p>  If a person decided to engage in the acquisition of gold for investment purposes, then he should pay attention to what appearance have gold bullion, coins or jewelry.  After all, it is desirable to purchase high-quality goods, since in the future it will be more profitable and easier to sell.  If the ingot has no burrs, foreign inclusions, scratches, scuffs, and clean and whole documents of the manufacturer are drawn up on it, then there is every reason to believe that this product is in excellent condition. </p><p>  A satisfactory condition is considered for the ingot, the surface of which contains dents and stains, abrasions and scratches (which do not affect the weight), the documents of the manufacturer are torn or covered with stains that affect reading of the text.  In this case, a person has the right to refuse to purchase gold.  If a person decides to open a bank account, a bank deposit in gold, palladium or silver, this can be done with great ease. </p></div></article>
