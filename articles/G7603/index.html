  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holographic screen: description, device, principle of operation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Plasma panels and LCD screens have not surprised anyone for a long time, taking their place in everyday life.  The technology for creating stereoscopic images using 3D glasses, which has emerged in recent years, has occupied its niche and is actively developing.  Most experts are of the opinion that the next stage in the development of display technologies will be the appearance of a holographic projection screen, which is quite logical, since modern 3D television is an intermediate step in creating a three-dimensional image, since a three-dimensional image on such screens is visible only with a certain head position.  Holographic displays can be seen as the next step in the development of 3D technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thetechnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red hydrogen one with holographic screen" class="if uuid-2581131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2581131.jpg"></div><h2>  3D Technology Principle </h2><p>  In modern cinemas and TVs, 3D technology is used, based on the deception of human vision by presenting slightly different images from the eyes, which ultimately creates a three-dimensional effect.  Optical focus is widely used in 3D technology: for example, the illusion of the depth and volume of an image is created using polarizing glasses, which filter part of the image for the left and right eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  3D technology flaw </h2><p>  The disadvantage of this technology is that the three-dimensional image is visible only at a certain angle.  Despite the fact that home TVs with the 3D effect and without glasses are on sale, the viewer can watch them only if they are exactly opposite the display.  The volumetric image begins to disappear with a slight shift to the right or left relative to the center of the screen, which is the main drawback of all 3D displays.  This problem should be solved in the near future by holographic screens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="digest.dx3canada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red holographic smartphone" class="if uuid-2581127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2581127.jpg"></div><h2>  Pseudo-Holographic Displays </h2><p>  To date, pseudo-holographic screens created on the basis of a translucent mesh or film are very popular.  Panels are mounted to the ceiling or display case.  With proper lighting, the panels are invisible to humans, and if an image is projected on them, it creates the impression of a hologram through which the viewer can look.  In comparison with <span>liquid crystal screens</span> and plasma, pseudo-holographic screens have a number of advantages: a vivid image, originality, and the ability to install in any room. </p><p>  The projector that projects the image may be hidden from the viewer.  The advantages of such equipment are wide viewing angles, high image contrast and the ability to create holographic screens of a certain size and shape.  Displays on translucent film are used to give an unusual effect and charm to the room, the design of television studios and shopping spaces.  Transparent panels are produced by many companies and are used for advertising and marketing purposes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sax3D Screens </h2><p>  One of the most popular are Sax3D holographic screens from a German company, created using selective light refraction technology, so the system ignores any light in the room except for the projector beam.  The display itself is made of durable transparent glass, on top of which a thin film is applied, turning the screen into a hologram and displaying the contrast image projected by the projector.  Such a holographic screen allows you to view both digital photographs and videos.  Transscreen displays, created from a polyester film with special layers that block the light coming from the side of the projector, work by a similar principle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hologram3ddisplay.m.buy.ecer.com.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone with holographic screen" class="if uuid-2581124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2581124.jpg"></div><h2>  Holographic TVs </h2><p>  The inhabitants are more interested in not specialized screens, but in solutions that can be used in tablet computers, televisions and smartphones with a holographic screen.  It is worth noting that in this area a large number of original solutions have appeared in recent years, despite the fact that most of them work on the improved 3D effect. </p><p>  InnoVision at CES 2011 unveiled a prototype holographic television called HoloAd Diamond.  When creating a TV, a prism is used that refracts the light coming from several projectors and creates a full-fledged hologram that the viewer can view from different angles.  During the demonstration, visitors to the exhibition and journalists were able to make sure that such a hologram significantly exceeds the images created by classic 3D devices in terms of color saturation and depth. </p><p>  A HoloAd TV can play back hologram images, photos and videos in FLV format.  At the exhibition, the company introduced two TV models based on a similar principle: the first resolution is 1280x1024 pixels, the weight is 95 kilograms, and the second resolution is 640x480 pixels.  Despite the fact that the TVs are quite large, using them is convenient and comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2techworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holographic telephone" class="if uuid-2581120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2581120.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology development </h2><p>  Specialists at the HP lab in Palo Alto have attempted to fix the perennial problem of 3D effect screens.  To reproduce the three-dimensional image visible from any point of view, the researchers proposed to show the image from different sides, sending a separate picture for each eye of the viewer.  Such technology implies the use of a system with laser systems and rotating mirrors, however, California scientists have resorted to components of a conventional liquid crystal panel, having applied a large number of round grooves to the inner surface of the glass of the screen.  As a result, this allowed the light to be refracted in such a way as to create a three-dimensional hologram in front of the viewer.  The screen, created by HP specialists, shows viewers a static three-dimensional image projected from two hundred points, and a dynamic picture from sixty-four. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reduser.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holographic projection screen" class="if uuid-2581138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2581138.jpg"></div><h2>  Holographic telephone </h2><p>  More recently, the event, expected by many, finally took place - a smartphone with a holographic display was officially presented.  The display technology used in the Red Hydrogen One phone is expensive, but will be used on many mobile devices in the near future. </p><p>  Red mainly specializes in the production of professional digital movie cameras, but now it has turned its attention to the new industry by developing and introducing a smartphone with a holographic screen Red Hydrogen One. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fony.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red hydrogen one" class="if uuid-2581145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2581145.jpg"></div><h2>  Phone display </h2><p>  Red experts said that the screen installed on the smartphone is a hydrogen holographic display that allows you to instantly switch between 2D content, 3D content and holographic content of the Red Hydrogen 4-View application.  Despite the fact that exact information about the principle of this technology has not been published, the smartphone allows you to view all holograms without the use of special glasses or additional accessories. </p><p>  The demonstration of the Red smartphone with a holographic screen took place in June 2017, however, no details have been disclosed by the manufacturer so far.  However, there are several lucky bloggers who managed to hold two prototypes of the smartphone in their hands: one is a non-functional layout that demonstrates the finish and appearance of the phone, the second is a working device that the company still keeps secret. </p>
