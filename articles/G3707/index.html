Most of the creative kits are dedicated to this particular art.  Such popularity is easy to explain: even a child can cope with simple drawings.  It is enough to master a few tricks, and you can get to work.  This lesson develops creative thinking, attentiveness, perseverance.  The location of each stitch needs to be calculated, and the process of creating an image resembles how an artist paints his picture.  Therefore, this art gives a similar feeling, and the image on the canvas sometimes looks better than some of the works of modern masters of drawing. </p><h2>  Types of canvases for transferring a pattern to a fabric </h2><p>  The technique of cross-stitching is able to give a second life to worn out or outdated wardrobe elements.  With its help, any thing from the ordinary will turn into exclusive.  But it often happens that on a fabric with a tight weave of threads, even an experienced embroideress is difficult to make straight crosses without distorting the pattern.  And without neat stitches, even the original idea will look ugly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water soluble canvas" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1890196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An overlay or water-soluble canvas helps to transfer the pattern to the material.  The first is attached to the fabric.  When the embroidery is finished, the threads of which it consists are simply pulled out one after another.  The disadvantage of this method is the distortion of the crosses: their slope is lost.  In addition, removing threads with dense firmware is not very convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The advantages of soluble canvas </h2><p>  It‚Äôs much easier to work with non-woven water-soluble canvas.  Markings are usually already marked on it, so you do not need to suffer with a marker and a ruler, dividing the material into squares.  When the drawing is finished, it is enough to lower the product into water, and the excess threads will dissolve, leaving only straight embroidered crosses.  This canvas is easy to attach to any fabric thanks to its non-woven lining. </p><p>  Other benefits of water soluble canvas: </p><ol><li>  There is a different layout, into squares of different sizes.  You can choose the appropriate option. </li><li>  When combined with non-woven material keeps its shape better. </li><li>  Canvas is completely dissolved in both cold and hot water.  No need to remove remaining pieces. </li><li>  Cross-stitch looks neat and even, in comparison with the usual method of work or using a patch canvas. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of embroidery with thread" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1890198.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><h2>  Drawbacks of embroidery on soluble canvas </h2><p>  There are also disadvantages of this method of transferring a pattern to a fabric.  Water soluble <span>canvas for embroidery</span> is only suitable for inelastic fabrics.  You also need to choose the correct temperature of the iron, attaching it to the material.  Iron the material without steam, otherwise it will begin to dissolve.  Water-soluble canvas has a fairly high cost - 3-4 times more than usual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are several more disadvantages of this material: </p><ol><li>  If elastane is present in the fabric, it is not possible to use a non-woven backing. </li><li>  If the fabric is not tightly attached, you need to constantly check whether the direction of the thread is the same and if the pattern began to move. </li><li>  On some types of canvas, cells are labeled in 7 pieces, and not in 10, as usual.  This can complicate the process of creating a picture, especially if its layout is standard. </li><li>  Sometimes it is difficult to pierce a marking with a needle, it slides off, you have to make an effort. </li><li>  Some manufacturers print the name of their brand on the canvas, taking up useful space that could be used for work. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water soluble canvas for embroidery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1890204.jpg" width="524"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to use water soluble canvas </h2><p>  Before starting work, you need to determine the pattern, measure its size and cut off part of the canvas.  The marking is located according to the direction of the threads on the fabric.  Then the iron is heated.  If the instructions do not indicate the optimum temperature, it is advisable to conduct an experiment on a small piece of water-soluble canvas.  If it is excessively low, the top layer will begin to recede during embroidery, so you will have to iron the material again.  By setting the temperature too high, you can melt the non-woven base and deform the workpiece. </p><p>  It is not necessary to press the sole of the iron too much to the fabric, otherwise the material may melt.  It will be impossible to return to its original form.  The drawing, if it has already been applied, will have to be removed, and the thing on which it was executed will be damaged.  Smooth the canvas only to a dry cloth.  Do not touch it with wet hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch technique" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1890197.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Features of work with the canvas, soluble in water </h2><p>  Sometimes, if the non-woven fabric has moved around the edges, it is better to hold it with your fingers, continuing embroidery.  It is better to create a picture starting from the edge or frame, if it is present in the project, in order to better fix the canvas.  Work is performed in small areas using a sharp-pointed needle.  When the drawing is ready, just dip the product into water.  The material will completely dissolve, and the embroidered motif will remain on the fabric.  It is possible to work with non-woven canvas with other types of thread embroidery, for example, using the handanger technique. </p>
