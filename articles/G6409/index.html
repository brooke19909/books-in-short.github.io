    <p>  As you might guess, Evgeny Bogarne came from a noble noble family.  It was not possible to make a photo of him in those days, but history left us with a number of portraits, one of which is presented above.  Alexander de Beauharnais, his father, was Viscount, a native of the <span>island of Martinique</span> (a colony of France located in the Caribbean).  Even when he was a young officer, Alexander married Josephine's Creole.  After a while, he became a general and a prominent figure in the revolution, but was arrested on a denunciation and died on the guillotine.  By this time, Eugene was only 13 years old.  Josephine was also arrested, and her son was sent to the artisan's family for re-education. </p><h2>  Studying at a military school </h2>

    <p>  Eugene Bogarne was one of the participants in the coup of the Eighteenth Brumaire held on November 9, 1799.  The directory as a result of it lost its power.  A new interim government appeared, headed by Napoleon Bonaparte, now consul.  Eugene also served in his guard, where he was the captain of horse rangers.  In the photo above - Eugene Bogarne on horseback. </p><h2>  Career advancement </h2><p>  In 1800, Eugene took part in the military campaign that France organized in northern Italy against the Austrians.  At the end of the battle of Marengo (the so-called village located in northern Italy), Eugene was awarded the rank of colonel.  And a few years later, in 1804, he became a brigadier general. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1804, the <span>coronation of Napoleon</span> took <span>place,</span> during which Beauharnais received the title of State Chancellor.

    <p>  Napoleon in 1805 created the <span>Italian kingdom.</span>  He became the king, and Beauharnais the vice-king.  It is known that at one time (in 1806) Bonaparte even wanted to declare Eugene his heir.  To this end, he adopted him.  Thus, the status of Eugene has increased.  He has now become a monarchist person.  Thanks to this, our hero married in the same year (at the request of Napoleon).  His wife was the daughter of the King of Bavaria, Agnes Amalie (1788-1851). </p><p>  In 1807, Bonaparte made Eugene the heir to the Italian throne.  He was given the title of Prince of Venice. </p><h2>  Eugene on the Italian throne </h2><p>  Eugene Bogarne was not an experienced administrator.  Therefore, as the ruler of Italy, he surrounded himself with many advisers, Italians.  During his reign, the administration and court were transformed (in the image of France), and the army was also improved.  However, the sending of troops and financial payments made by Eugene at the request of Bonaparte, caused discontent of the local population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When Beauharnais became the ruler of Italy, he was only 24 years old.  However, he managed to lead the state quite firmly.  The army was reorganized, the Civil Code was introduced.  The country was equipped with fortifications, canals and schools.  Despite some dissatisfaction, inevitable in the difficult task of government, in general, we can say that he managed to earn the respect and love of his people. </p><h2>  Participation in the Napoleonic Wars </h2><p>  Beauharnais participated in almost all the wars that Napoleon waged.  In the Austrian campaign (1809), he was commander of Italian troops.  The outcome of the battle of the city of Salice (in Italy) was unsuccessful.  Archduke John of Habsburg won.  However, despite this, Eugene managed to turn the tide of events.  He inflicted several defeats on John, first in Italy and then in Austria.  Beauharnais also won in Hungary, important for the French.  We are talking about the battle of Raab (today it is the city of Gyor in Hungary).  After that, he distinguished himself in a decisive battle at Wagram (now this is a village located in Austria). </p><p>  Napoleon called Beauharnais from Italy in 1812.  He was to become the commander of the fourth corps of the now French army.  Eugene participated in the war of 1812, where he distinguished himself in the battles of Ostrovno (today it is an agro-town located in Belarus), near Borodino, Smolensk, Vyazma, Maroyaroslavets, Vilna (now it is the city of Vilnius, Lithuania), Red. </p><h2>  Eugene Bogarne and Savva Storozhevsky </h2><p>  Many miracles are associated with the <span>Monk Savva Storozhevsky.</span>  One of them is considered to be his appearance to Eugene Beauharnais in 1812, during the capture of Moscow by the French.  Savva convinced Eugene not to destroy the monastery located in Zvenigorod.  In exchange, he promised that Eugene Beauharnais would return home without hindrance.  Savva kept his word - the prophet's prophecies really came true. </p><h2>  The reflection of the attack of the Austrian troops </h2><p>  After Napoleon left Russia with Marshal Joachim Murat, Beauharnais commanded the remnants of the French army.  He took troops to Magdeburg (today it is a German city).  After the battle of Luzen (a city in Germany), which took place in 1813, Eugene was sent to Italy by order of Bonaparte.  He had to provide her protection from the attack of the Austrian troops.  It is believed that the military operations of Beauharnais in Italy, in the campaign of 1813-14, are the pinnacle of military skill.  Only thanks to the betrayal of Murat did the Austrians manage to avoid a complete defeat. </p><h2>  The fate of Beauharnais after the abdication of Napoleon from the throne </h2>

    <p>  In 1814 (April 16) Napoleon abdicated.  After that, Beauharnais, the <span>Viceroy of Italy,</span> entered into a truce and went to Bavaria.  Beauharnais became a peer of France in June 1815. The Vienna Congress, held in 1814-1815, decided to allocate 5 million francs to him in compensation for Italian possessions.  For this money, Maximilian-Joseph, the Bavarian king and father-in-law Beauharnais, ceded to him the Principality of EichstÃ¤t and the Landgrauch Leuchtenberg, which formed the Duchy of Leuchtenberg.  The title and duchy were to be inherited by the descendants of Eugene (by birthright, and other descendants were granted the titles of His Serene Princes). </p><p>  Eugene Bogarne in recent years has retired from politics.  He decided to move to Munich, where he settled at his father-in-law.  The first attack of the disease struck Beauharnais in early 1823.  This happened in Munich.  Eugeneâ€™s shaky health caused a great public outcry.  Prayers were held in almost all the churches of Munich for six weeks to grant him healing.  This clearly shows how people loved him. </p>

    <p>  The disease receded for a while.  Doctors prescribed Eugene treatment in the waters.  However, by the end of the year, the state of Beauharnais again worsened.  He began to suffer from frequent headaches.  February 21, 1824 he died from an apoplexy stroke.  In modern terms, Eugene had a second stroke. </p><p>  However, there are other versions of the causes of his death.  For example, the historian D. Seward believes that Beauharnais was ill with cancer.  Eugeneâ€™s funeral was grand.  After his death, the whole of Bavaria was covered with mourning ribbons.  Eugene Bogarne, whose brief biography was examined by us, died at the age of 42.  His name is carved on the Arc de Triomphe, located on Sq.  Stars in Paris, the grand opening of which took place in 1836. </p><h2>  Major rewards </h2><p>  Eugene was awarded many awards.  In 1805, he received the Orders of the Legion of Honor, the Iron Crown, and St. Hubert of Bavaria.  In 1811, Eugene Bogarne was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Stephen.  And these are only his main rewards. </p><h2>  Children Eugene </h2><p>  The wife of Agnes Amalia gave birth to Beauharna with six children: the sons of Karl-August and Maximilian and the daughters of Josephine, Eugene, Amalia and Theodolind.  Josephine, the eldest daughter, became the wife of King Oscar I of Sweden, who was the son of Bernadotte, the former Marshal of Napoleon.  Eugenia married Prince F.V. Hohenzollern-Ehringen.  Emperor of Brazil Pedro I married his daughter Beauharnais Amalia.  Theodolina became the wife of Duke Urach Wilhelm WÃ¼rtenberg. </p><h2>  The fate of the sons of Eugene Beauharnais </h2><p>  Karl-Augustus, the eldest son of Eugene Beauharnais, became the Duke of Leuchtenberg after the death of his father.  In 1835, he married Maria II da Gloria, the 16-year-old Portuguese queen of the BraganÃ§a dynasty.  However, in the same year, Karl-August passed away. </p>

    <p>  Maximilian, the youngest son, inherited the title of Duke of Leuchtenberg from his dead brother.  In 1839, he took as his wife Maria Nikolaevna, daughter of Nicholas I (her portrait is presented above).  Since that time, Maximilian lived in Russia.  He was the head of the Mining Institute, president of the Academy of Arts, conducted research in the field of electroforming.  It was he who established the galvanoplastic plant in St. Petersburg, as well as the hospital.  After the death of Maximilian, Nicholas I decided to sell his possessions in Bavaria, and his children became members of the Russian imperial family.  They were granted the title of the Romanov princes.  Thus, in the history of Russia, representatives of the family, whose father was Eugene Bogarne, left their mark.  Orthodoxy has become their new religion. </p>
