    <h2>  City name </h2><p>  <span>Many local historians do not agree with this version, although it is the most believable.</span>  <span>There are many assumptions; here are the most confirmed ones.</span>  <span>The word Saratov can be perceived as a derivative of two Tatar words - "sar" and "atav" - which translates as "low-lying island."</span>  <span>Another phrase of Tatar words reminds the name of the city - it is "Saryk" and "Atav", which translates as "island of hawks."</span>  <span>Either there are no islands <span>in Saratov</span> , or hawks, but there is Sokolinaya Gora, therefore it is generally accepted that the name of the city in Tatar means ‚Äúyellow mountain‚Äù.</span>  <span>There are other versions of the origin of the name of the city of Saratov.</span> </p>

    <h2>  History of education </h2><p>  <span>Saratov was laid along with other Volga cities: Samara, Tsaritsyn (Volgograd) as a watchtower.</span>  <span>The goal was to restrain the hordes of nomadic tribes, thieves' gangs, Kuban and Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks who raided, burned the houses of immigrants, drove people into slavery.</span>  <span>That is, they ravaged the settlements and prevented the development of settled agriculture and the settlement of these places.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The foundation of the city of Saratov on the Yellow Mountain was carried out under the leadership of Prince Zasekin and Boyar Turov at half the distance from Samara to Tsaritsyn.  The city was laid three times.  The first burned down, the second place was on the low left bank, as a result of which the tsar‚Äôs decree was received by Alexei Mikhailovich, who commanded Saratov to be built on the mountain, which was done.  He was transferred to the foot of the Falcon (Yellow) Mountain, located on the right bank. </p>

    <h2>  Modern Saratov </h2><p>  <span>During the years of Soviet power, Saratov has become one of the developed industrial, scientific and cultural centers of the country.</span>  <span>During World War II, the largest enterprises were evacuated here, which raised Saratov to a higher level of development.</span>  <span>One such enterprise is the Saratov Aviation Plant, which produced aircraft for civil and military aviation, as well as fulfilled orders for the space industry.</span> </p><p>  <span>Many other factories worked on space.</span>  <span>The city has more than ten universities, including the oldest university in the country.</span>  <span>The social sphere developed, hundreds of gardens, schools, hospitals were built, entire residential areas grew, where apartments were received by workers and employees of enterprises, doctors, teachers, builders.</span> </p><p>  <span>In the post-Soviet period, the city acquired the negative reputation of being dirty, groomed, enterprises were closing down, parks and squares were cut down for commercial development.</span>  <span>It was during these years that there was a sharp reduction in the population of the city, mainly due to natural decline, that is, an excess of mortality over birth rates.</span>  <span>In recent years, the situation has stabilized a little, indicators have gone up.</span>  <span>The city has become cleaner, housing is under construction.</span>  <span>Citizens live in the hope of restoring their former glory.</span> </p>
