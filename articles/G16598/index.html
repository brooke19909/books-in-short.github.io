Several decades of his actual rule put island England among the most influential European countries.  Unlike his mentor and friend, Cardinal Walsi, he was neither a royalist nor a priest.  Thomas Cromwell was a lawyer and in all his endeavors was sober and rational. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thomas Cromwell" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1129153.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  It is known that in 1485, Thomas Cromwell was born in one of the most dubious places in London.  The biography of this figure begins in Putney, where at the end of the fifteenth century all the garbage of the English capital was collected.  His father was a brewer and innkeeper, distinguished by his violent disposition and bad character, he did not disdain and petty fraud.  It is not surprising that Thomas Cromwell left the family early and began to lead an adventurous life in England and on the continent.  It is known that for some time he served as a French confectioner in Italy, distinguished himself in several military campaigns.  But the soldier's life was not for him.  Having deserted from the army, Cromwell became a simple employee in the banking house of Frescobaldi.  Thanks to his natural savvy and knowledge of languages, he becomes a banker's confidant.  Gradually, Cromwell was entrusted with the most sensitive transactions - for example, all relations between the bank and the Vatican administration passed through his hands.  After some time, Cromwell held a similar position in Antwerp, and then in Calais, which at that time belonged to the British crown.  Having put together the initial capital, Cromwell decides to return to England.  The 16th century begins, and with it the next stage of his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Life in England </h2><p>  After crossing the English Channel, Cromwell donkey in London.  At first, he traded a little wool and various fabrics.  Having come to the conclusion that the life of the merchant was not good for him, Thomas Cromwell was educated and became a lawyer.  The natural mind and the gift of eloquence quickly made him one of the most successful lawyers in London. </p><p>  In the mid-20s of the 16th century, she met Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, one of those people who made politics in the kingdom.  T. Cromwell takes the place of Secretary of the Cardinal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thomas Cromwell biography" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1129156.jpg" width="600"></div>  They were very similar in appearance and ambition.  As time has shown, such a similarity of aspirations and characters played a special role - both were ambitious and intelligent, both sought to tumble down the creaky medieval bureaucracy and for a long time were close advisers to the volatile Henry VIII.

    <h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  According to contemporaries, Cromwell was frivolous and broke many women's hearts.  But officially, he married only once.  When he was a banker, he married Elizabeth Waikis, from whom he had three children.  The daughters Anna and Grace died young, and the son became one of the royal courtiers.  Supported by Thomas Cromwell and his nephew Richard.  Subsequently, he will become the great-grandfather of the famous <span>Oliver Cromwell.</span>  Thus, Thomas Cromwell and Oliver Cromwell are really relatives and statesmen who at different times changed the history of their native country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beginning of the Reformation </h2><p>  It is important to understand the environment in which Cromwell began his public service.  England since the time of Henry VIII was a country of young people, many of whom were not even twenty years old.  English culture and society of that time were saturated with the spirit of youth.  Hunting, tournaments, dueling and glorious war - these are the main activities of Tudor youth.  And Henry himself was young at the time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="English reformation" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30555/1131324.jpg" width="512"></div>  He gladly joins the golden youth, constantly leaving his pious wife Catherine, who was a true Catholic.  At the same time, the king met (or was introduced to) the young Anna Boleyn, who shared the tastes and preferences of the monarch.  Such a fun life required huge financial injections.

    <h2>  Sprouts of Protestantism </h2><p>  At this time, in faraway Germany, the young priest Luther King began his crusade against the papacy.  This is not to say that the religious worldviews of the distant preacher had a decisive influence on the king, the letters of the monarch are known in which he strongly condemned the new trend.  But Henry VIII soon realized the attractive aspects of the new heresy and saw in them a chance to solve his urgent problems: </p><ul><li>  break the marriage with <span>Katerina of Aragon</span> ; </li><li>  redirect cash flow from the pockets of Catholic priests in favor of the royal treasury; </li><li>  nullify the influence of the papacy in their own kingdom. </li></ul><p>  The refusal of Pope Clement to annul the marriage with the Queen forced Henry VIII to take decisive steps, the consequence of which was the English Reformation.  The king broke the marriage with the queen and married his impregnable lover Anna Boleyn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="16th century" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1129159.jpg" width="448"></div>  Thus, the holiness and infallibility of papal authority in the English kingdom seriously shook.  In response to the anathema made by the Vatican, Henry declared himself the head of the Church of England.  An order was issued to secularize the monastic estates that occupied the vast territory of the island.  Of course, there were many supporters of the Catholic Church who did not recognize the king‚Äôs divorce and lost their heads because of their beliefs.  This fate has not passed Thomas Wolsey.  He was stripped of the rank of Lord Chancellor and subsequently executed.

    <p>  But the Reformation movement gradually gained strength.  Catholic supporters have repeatedly tried to regain their influence in English society.  But the Reformation took place, and English Protestantism gradually spread throughout the kingdom. </p><h2>  Rapid take-off </h2><p>  Cromwell's desire for power was exceptional, and in time it coincided with the moment when Henry needed a loyal and influential minister.  Cromwell‚Äôs entry into public service dates back to 1530, from that moment on, his career has been skyrocketing. </p><p>  The thirties of the sixteenth century were a period of great reforms and transformations relating to the destruction of the old English way of life.  Cromwell came to power as a supporter of Anna Boleyn.  Walsy could not change his mind and refused to recognize <span>Henry VIII as</span> Queen of England in <span>his</span> new <span>wife</span> .  Therefore, he was removed from his post and replaced by his own protege.  Cromwell's nomination was one of the most successful in the personnel policy of the English crown. </p><h2>  Cromwell's Achievements </h2><p>  Among the most significant projects of this politician were: </p><ul><li>  The dissolution of monasteries and the establishment of royal dominance in all secular and church matters.  Cromwell persecuted Catholic priests and supporters of Catholicism, liquidated monasteries, expelling the monks from the land for subsequent transfer to the Crown.  For his irreconcilable policies, Cromwell earned the nickname Hammer of the Monks. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thomas Cromwell and Oliver Cromwell" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1129165.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Development and promotion of the adoption of new land laws, recounting and secularization of lands that simplified their taxation and leasing </li><li>  The expansion of royal power in Northern England, Wales and Ireland.  These actions outraged large feudal lords and led to unrest that was brutally crushed. </li><li>  Use of a <span>printing press</span> for the publication of decrees, secular and religious literature.  It was Thomas Cromwell who holds the honor of publishing the Bible in English.  This event occurred in 1539. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chancellor of the Exchequer of England" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1129200.jpg" width="318"></div></li></ul><h2>  Court realities </h2><p>  As an insightful and prudent courtier, Cromwell in time noticed the slightest nuances in the behavior of the king and often turned his convictions in the opposite direction.  For example, in relation to Anna Boleyn, at first he was her most loyal supporter.  But as the monarch‚Äôs feelings cooled, Cromwell changed his attitude towards Anna.  In the end, he joined the majority, which confirmed the fact of the betrayal of Anna, and was an ardent supporter of the execution of Boleyn and the new marriage of the monarch. </p><h2>  Awards and Positions </h2><p>  The king praised Cromwell's allegiance.  It is rare for a politician to always be able to stay afloat and follow the course of a changeable and agile monarch.  For his loyalty, Henry showers Cromwell with a hail of state awards and appointments.  Here are the milestones of his royal service: </p><ul><li>  1531 - Member of the Privy Council. </li><li>  1533 - Chancellor of the Exchequer of England. </li><li>  1534 - Royal Secretary and President of the Court of Appeal. </li><li>  1536 - Guardian Lord of the Seal of Minority. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  1537 - Knight of the Garter and Dean of the University of Wales. </li><li>  1539 - Chamberlain. </li></ul><p>  At the end of his life, Cromwell was granted the title of count.  True, Count Essex was able to use the new title in just a few weeks.  Not having time to once again change his beliefs, Thomas Cromwell was suspected of royal treason.  During a meeting of the Privy Council, he was arrested, and after a short trial executed in the Tower at the age of 65. </p>
