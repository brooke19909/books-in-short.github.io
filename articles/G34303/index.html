It is no less exciting to study its nature, especially the lakes of Kazan, most of which are located directly in the city. </p><p>  This is exactly what the capital of Tatarstan looks like - a hospitable hostess of a beautiful and majestic region. </p><h2>  City ponds </h2><p>  Even his legends are associated with water, as it has been since ancient times.  For example, the name of the city itself is based on the legend that in search of a place for its construction people turned to the sage and wizard for help.  What was their surprise and disappointment when they heard that the city would be where a boiler with water would boil without fire. </p><p>  For a miracle to happen, they made it of gold and began to check, maybe where the earth warmed up enough to boil water.  And so it happened - in the place where the Bulak-river flowed into the Kazanka, the boiler began to boil without flame.  Here the city of Kazan arose, named after that very event. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan lakes" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1367945.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And it so happened that it is here that numerous lakes are located, which for modern residents of the capital have become their favorite places to relax: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Lower Boar. </li><li>  Black </li><li>  Blue Lakes. </li><li>  Forest. </li><li>  Emerald. </li><li>  Deep. </li><li>  Swan. </li></ul><p>  Each lake of Kazan has its own legend or history, as well as its admirers.  Unfortunately, not all of them comply with environmental and sanitary standards, but the same citizens are guilty of this, many of whom live according to the principle of ‚Äúat least a flood after us‚Äù. </p><h2>  Blue Lakes </h2><p>  A whole chain of ponds stretches, framed by emerald greenery, just 20 km from the city.  Lakes with water of unusual blue color seem to flow into one another and resemble the low of precious sapphires dropped by someone here a long time ago. </p><p>  <span>The blue lakes of</span> Kazan are of karst origin and formed on the site of craters resulting from subsidence of soil hundreds of years ago.  The earth has failed along with trees, the remains of which can be seen today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emerald lake kazan" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1367946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most of the lakes are shallow, but everyone has very clear and transparent water, which diving enthusiasts often use.  Fishermen do not exist here, since there is no fish at all - cold and salty water does not allow it to live or breed here. </p><p>  Underground sources that feed the Blue Lakes with their waters give them a sulfate composition, which makes them medicinal, so you can often meet people bathing here, although the water temperature of +8 degrees requires some hardening. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Divers of the Blue Lakes have a custom to install a decorated Christmas tree at the bottom of the deepest of them, which is clearly visible from the shore due to clean and clear water. </p><h2>  Deep Lake </h2><p>  How big is the <span>capital of Tatarstan</span> can be judged by the size of the reservoirs located on its territory.  <span>Deep Lake</span> (Kazan), a recreation center on its shore belong to the Kirovsky district of the city.  This is a surprisingly beautiful wild corner of nature inside city life. </p><p>  Surrounded by coniferous forest, the reservoir is located behind the village of Zalesny.  Its depth is 26 m, and only on one side is the coast adapted for swimming and diving, for which special bridges are equipped here.  Very clean sand and a water temperature of +23 degrees make it a favorite place for a family summer vacation, when work "does not let" people out of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deep lake kazan recreation center" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1367947.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Very close to the coast, in the forest, there are cozy cottages of the recreation center "Deep Lake".  Their fund is designed for 1-, 2- and 3-bed rooms with all amenities.  The houses are equipped with heating, so here you can celebrate the New Year or spend the winter holidays.  Luxury cottages have a fireplace, air conditioning and a toilet in each room. </p><h2>  Emerald lake </h2><p>  This place can hardly be called a lake, since its origin is completely artificial.  In place of the sand pit, which was excavated by excavators from year to year, a pond was formed that filled groundwater.  Be that as it may, Lake Emerald (Kazan) fully lives up to its name, and its waters are really unusually beautiful in color. </p><p>  It is good that the reservoir passed into private ownership, and here they strictly monitor cleanliness, are fined for rubbish thrown in the wrong place (there are bins everywhere), and they monitor the state of the sand.  Water also meets all sanitary standards, and on the shore for the convenience of vacationers there are changing rooms and "mushrooms" from the sun.  For the kids, the "paddling pool" is fenced for swimming, as the bottom here abruptly breaks, which can be dangerous for those who can not swim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forest lake kazan" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1367948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The pond is surrounded by a pine forest, but getting to it is not very convenient (it‚Äôs still about 20 minutes to go from the stop), so there are never many people on the Emerald, but for some local residents this is a plus. </p><h2>  Forest Lake </h2><p>  This body of water is located in the Aircraft Building Region and, unfortunately, is an example of human stupidity, immorality and impunity. </p><p>  <span>Forest Lake</span> (Kazan) was once a pretty picturesque place, surrounded by a forest with a shore covered with emerald grass.  But today, instead of vegetation, there are entirely plastic bottles, bags, the remains of bonfires on the ground, and it‚Äôs not recommended to go into the water at all, since here everyone is just washing cars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seven lakes kazan" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1367949.jpg" width="560"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Apparently, until the pond is given to private business, which would monitor compliance with cleanliness standards, or state penalties of such a magnitude as to substantially hit the budget are not introduced, there will be no result and restoration of the ecological balance. </p><p>  The indifference of officials and the unscrupulousness of local residents are simply amazing.  As if these people do not live here, do not rest and do not bring their children and grandchildren here.  As always, the lakes of Kazan can only rely on enthusiasts and people who are not indifferent to what they are doing with their homeland. </p><h2>  Boar Lake </h2><p>  The capital of Tatarstan is full of surprises and places that you should definitely visit.  Seven Lakes (Kazan) is a water pearl of the city, and among them the greatest interest of tourists is the Kaban pond.  Still would!  All the legends where treasures are mentioned are the most popular, and places are visited. </p><p>  As people say, it was in this lake that a huge treasury of the Kazan khan was thrown during the siege of the city by the troops of Ivan the Terrible, and since then they have been looking for it on its muddy bottom.  Attempts have not been abandoned today, since in any legend there is always a grain of truth. </p>
