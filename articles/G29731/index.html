Moreover, a person who wants to resort to free Scype services must adhere to the software implementation scenario strictly stipulated by the regulations for the use of Internet communications in the form of installing a service application and setting up working software options.  Here is an informational review, which will tell you in a simple and accessible language how to register with Skype. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to register on Skype" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/376297.jpg" width="558"></div>

    <p>  Skype has a number of additional options, the use of which involves some payment.  The cost of services that expand the functionality of the application is not expressed by a prohibitive amount and is close to a relatively low value. </p><p>  <em>Advantage No. 5</em> </p><p>  The terms of use of the program do not oblige the user to anything and are mostly free.  The versatility of the application and the incredibly wide functionality of Scype make it a worthy helper for literally everyone who needs stable and accessible video communications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By following the step-by-step instructions below, you will learn how to register with Skype to take advantage of a truly unique opportunity to communicate with anyone who has Scype installed on their device with an Internet connection. </p><h2>  Step number 1.  Create Microsoft Account </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Register on skype on computer" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/376306.jpg?1397761199863" width="600"></div></h2><ul><li>  Go to the official website of the service and proceed to the implementation of the "Registration". </li><li>  Indicate your current email inbox.  You can subscribe to a newsletter, just check the box next to the corresponding description. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúI agree - Next.‚Äù </li><li>  If you do not have an email address, use the option ‚ÄúRegister a new email box‚Äù below.  Often, such an action allows you to register with Skype a second time. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúCreate an account‚Äù form will open before you, filling out it; remember that the accuracy of the information will allow other users to easily find you. </li><li>  Complete the proposed action by clicking the corresponding button, which is located at the very bottom of the filled data list. </li><li>  The next page is your account.  Here you can subscribe to plugins, edit personal information, view usage history, etc., in general, manage functionality and expand the capabilities of Scype. </li></ul><h2>  Step number 2.  Software download </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sign up for skype now" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/376303.jpg?1397681962327" width="508"></div></h2><p>  If you do not have the installed Scype application, click on the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button and install the program on the device that you will use for video communication. </p><p>  The installation process is unremarkable, and even if the user constantly presses "Next" or "Continue", a favorable completion is guaranteed unambiguously.  In exceptional cases, you can always re-run the installation file of the downloaded program. </p><h2>  Step number 3.  Primary entry </h2><p>  So, most of the task ‚Äúhow to register with Skype‚Äù has been solved.  Now you have to make some settings of the utility program: </p><ul><li>  After the notification ‚ÄúAlmost done‚Äù, click on the ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù button. </li><li>  Now you need to configure your audio and video devices. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúCheck sound‚Äù button allows you to verify the performance of the speakers, that is, the correctness of the installed drivers. </li><li>  Under the ‚ÄúMicrophone‚Äù tab, the reaction to your voice will be visually displayed (green indicator).  If the indicator does not respond with a green signal line, check if the device is connected correctly. </li><li>  If you see your own image on the right side of the window, then everything is in order.  Otherwise, check the camera settings. </li><li>  When finished, click Continue. </li></ul><h2>  Step number 4.  Visual id </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to register on Skype?" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/376299.jpg?1397682025041" width="600"></div></h2><ul><li>  At this point you need to set an avatar.  Your photo will help users of the service recognize you by the posted image.  You can take your own picture with a webcam or download it from your photo gallery. </li><li>  Often, various graphic drawings are used as an avatar.  In this case, nothing and no one limits you. </li></ul><h2>  Step number 5.  Effective Search Tool - Skype </h2><p>  Register without e-mail will not work in any of the currently known Internet products.  And, as you know, Scype is no exception.  The seriousness of the purpose and the functionality of the communication service are also intended to significantly facilitate the search for certain people: old school friends, colleagues, distant relatives, friends or like-minded people of your youth who have gone abroad. </p><ul><li>  There is a search box on the left side of the interface on the main Skype work page. </li><li>  Entering a person‚Äôs personal data (F.I.) from the keyboard, you will see a list of users found.  Of course, the desired people, by definition, must be registered on the service. </li><li>  The Contacts tab, of course, is initially empty.  Echo Technical Service is your first assistant.  Call the service and make sure the settings are working. </li></ul><p>  Now you certainly have the skill of registering with Skype.  Although, looking ahead, we note: the described option is not the only possible one. </p><h2>  Session Management </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sign up for skype a second time" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/376300.jpg?1397682060397" width="600"></div></h2><p>  During a video call, you can use some functional tools of the program located at the bottom of the window. </p><ul><li>  The ‚ÄúRight arrow‚Äù icon shows the list of contacts, reducing the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚ÄúCommunication screen‚Äù. </li><li>  The next icon, ‚ÄúCallout,‚Äù is an auxiliary tool for instant messaging. </li><li>  ‚ÄúCamcorder‚Äù - on / off video broadcasting. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMicrophone‚Äù - activate or deactivate the audibility of the sounds you reproduce (the environment). </li><li>  The cross-shaped icon is a multifunctional menu with which you can add participants to the communication, as well as show the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour screen to the other person and much more. </li><li>  ‚ÄúHandset‚Äù - end, end the call. </li><li>  ‚ÄúRising level‚Äù - data on the quality of communication. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúFull Screen‚Äù icon speaks for itself. </li></ul><h2>  Alternative registration methods </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sign up for a free skype" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/376301.jpg?1397682165414" width="600"></div></h2><p>  How to register on Skype?  This is a conditional question.  The wrong option is by definition impossible.  Without a valid account, the service simply will not allow the user to carry out further registration actions.  And it is a fact!  Another thing is when the issue of variation of the method for entry is taken into account.  That is, it is not necessary to have a Microsoft account.  Google account is no less capable.  Moreover, it is worthwhile to discern the issue of universal accounting attachment: Facebook, Twitter, etc. All these social networks can also be carriers of credentials.  Therefore, when registering, you can specify a Facebook account, agree, this greatly simplifies the process of filling out an extra form. </p><h2>  One but important tip </h2><p>  So, you managed to register in the free Skype, and now you can enjoy all the delights of video calling.  However, it is worth noting that the data in the form of a login and password always needs to be saved, and, as practice shows, the head is not a very reliable storage, because people tend to forget a lot.  Whether it‚Äôs a notebook or a diary, they surely capture information in the impeccable originality of the recorded characters.  Have a good mood and fruitful dialogs.  Be on Skype! </p>
