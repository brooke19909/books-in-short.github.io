    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In place of Ficos </h2><p>  Once upon a time, about three millennia ago, the small city of Ficos stood here.  Throughout its history, it survived the change of a large number of rulers and at different times, according to historical data, was ruled by the Carians, Romans, Seljuks, Egyptians, Dorians, Byzantines, Ottomans and Assyrians.  There is an opinion that the inhabitants of Fikos destroyed their city on their own, so as not to give it to the reign of Alexander the Great. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that in Ashartep today the excavations of temples and fortresses are carried out, archaeologists systematically discover new prints of the history of the ancient settlement.  By right, this place is a paradise for those who are passionate about archeology and ancient civilizations.  Currently, there is a museum here, introducing visitors and the local population to the ancient culture and traditional dwellings of the Turks.  The museum also has exhibitions of antique paintings and amphorae, and in the adjoining luxurious garden you can see magnificent peacocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Marmaris Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478629.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hafsa Sultan Caravanserai in Marmaris </h2><p>  The sights, the photographs of which are presented in the article, deserve close attention, and this ancient building, erected in 1545 during the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent, occupies a special place.  The name of the building is associated with the name of his mother - Valide-Sulatn Aisha Hafsa.  This is the inn for Suleiman‚Äôs army, which served as a refuge for him during the campaign to Rhodes with the aim of conquering.  The rectangular building includes seven small rooms and one spacious hall.  To this day, it remains a symbol of the hospitality of the city, tours are regularly held here.  Marmaris has many narrow streets, just on one of these, at the foot of the fortress, and there is a caravanserai.  Nearby there are restaurants where you can relax and eat, souvenir shops and shops where you can buy all kinds of souvenirs as a keepsake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmaris attractions map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bedesten Bazaar </h2><p>  Viewing the sights of Marmaris, you can not pass by this "covered market".  Not a single tourist will forgive himself if, having glanced at all the shops and boutiques of the city, he will forget about such a point as the Bedesten market.  Unique Turkish goods are concentrated here, and the place itself is an architectural masterpiece, telling about the majestic centuries-old history of Marmaris.  About forty shops offer tourists jewelry, porcelain, leather products, handmade items by masters of Turkish folk art.  High-quality factory, but at the same time inexpensive clothes will be an excellent gift for relatives upon arrival home.  But, perhaps, the main souvenir of this resort pearl is coniferous or pine honey.  The cost of goods on the Bedesten market is slightly higher than in the country as a whole, but Istanbul is very far from prices. </p><p>  After shopping, you can take a walk in the garden and go to the famous Ottoman coffee shop.  Here you can enjoy the exquisite taste of Turkish coffee and aromatic tea or relax with a hookah.  Bedesten Market will allow you to get a lot of unforgettable pleasant experiences and feel the whole atmosphere of Turkish trade. </p><h2>  The ancient city of Kaunos </h2><p>  A few kilometers from Marmaris there are the ruins of this city, founded three thousand years ago by Kaunos, the son of Miletos, who was expelled from his home for inappropriate communication with his sister.  Initially, according to Herodotus, the city was inhabited by Cyrians.  As part of the Ottoman and Roman empires, Kaunos was the largest port and played a significant historical role for powerful powers.  But over time, it began to decline due to the shallowing of the bay on which it was located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmaris sights photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478623.jpg" width="600"></div>

When the day excursion programs end, everything is just beginning.  The residents of Marmaris are very proud of their waterfront, because it is the longest in all of Turkey.  Nowhere else are there so many diverse establishments and ways to have fun in the evening.  At night, the seaside boulevard is a long chain of illumination, numerous lights of yachts, sailboats and boats.  It is worth mentioning about restaurants located on the city promenade.

    <h2>  To the question of the name </h2><p>  In the article we talk about the sights of Marmaris, but do you know where the name of the city came from?  This is also worth mentioning.  There are two versions.  According to one, Marmaris is translated as ‚Äúthe pearl of the sea‚Äù, and according to the other, ‚Äúmimar ass‚Äù is a distorted order of Suleiman to hang the architect.  Why the city was named that way, it‚Äôs definitely hard to say now. </p><h2>  Sedir Island </h2><p>  There are a lot of interesting corners in Marmaris and its environs.  So, in addition to the above, you should definitely visit the amazing island of Sedir, the sand on which (according to legend) was brought specially from the beaches of Tunisia on the orders of <span>Marcus Aurelius.</span>  This was done for his beloved Cleopatra, because she did not like the local sedimentary rock.  Until now, the sand is carefully monitored, protected from the winds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris tours" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478632.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  Those who love sandy beaches can also be recommended to visit the Kiz-Kumu spit.  Her origin is associated with the sad story of a girl who, fleeing the sea from her pursuers, poured sand in front of her so that she would not be caught.  When you walk along the spit, the water is just ankle-deep, but if you take a step to the side, you already run the risk of being at a great depth. </p><p>  Fans of mountain formations should watch the cave called Nimara, associated with the name of the nymph Summer.  The road to it goes among the thickets of <span>strawberry trees</span> uphill.  And those who are interested in the animal world, it will be interesting to go to the town of Dalyan.  There you will find Turtle Beach, as well as the opportunity to recover from diseases in nearby sulfur springs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris resort" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/478633.jpg" width="500"></div>
