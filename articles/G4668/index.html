  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carbon dioxide. Properties, obtaining, application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carbon dioxide - a substance that has many names: <span>carbon monoxide</span> (IV), carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide.  It is also called carbonic anhydride.  It is a completely colorless gas that is odorless, with a sour taste.  Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and poorly soluble in water.  At temperatures below - 78 degrees Celsius crystallizes and becomes like snow. </p><p>  From a gaseous state, this substance becomes solid, since it cannot exist in a liquid state under atmospheric pressure.  The density of carbon dioxide under normal conditions is 1.97 kg / m3 - 1.5 times higher than <span>air density.</span>  Solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice.  In a liquid state, in which it can be stored for a long time, it passes with increasing pressure.  Let us consider in more detail this substance and its chemical structure. </p><p>  Carbon dioxide, whose formula is CO2, consists of carbon and oxygen, and it is obtained as a result of burning or decay of organic substances.  Carbon monoxide is found in air and underground mineral springs.  Humans and animals also emit carbon dioxide when they exhale air.  Plants excrete it without illumination, and intensively absorb it during photosynthesis.  Thanks to the process of cell metabolism of all living things, carbon monoxide is one of the main components of the surrounding nature. </p><p>  This gas is not toxic, but if it accumulates in high concentration, asphyxiation (hypercapnia) can begin, and with its lack, the opposite state develops - hypocapnia.  Carbon dioxide transmits <span>ultraviolet rays</span> and reflects infrared.  It is a <span>greenhouse gas</span> that directly affects global warming.  This is due to the fact that the level of its content in the atmosphere is constantly growing, which leads to the greenhouse effect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Carbon dioxide is obtained industrially from flue or furnace gases, or by the decomposition of carbonates of dolomite and limestone.  A mixture of these gases is thoroughly washed with a special solution consisting of potassium carbonate.  Then it goes into bicarbonate and decomposes when heated, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide (H2CO3) is formed from carbon dioxide dissolved in water, but in modern conditions it is obtained using other, more advanced methods.  After carbon dioxide is purified, it is compressed, cooled and pumped into cylinders. </p><p>  In industry, this substance is widely and universally used.  Food workers use it as a baking powder (for example, for making dough) or as a preservative (E290).  Using carbon dioxide, various tonic drinks and soda are produced, which are so loved not only by children but also by adults.  Carbon dioxide is used in the manufacture of baking soda, beer, sugar, sparkling wines. </p><p>  Carbon dioxide is also used in the manufacture of effective fire extinguishers.  Using carbon dioxide, an active medium is created, which is necessary for <span>welding with wire.</span>  At a high temperature in the welding arc, carbon dioxide decomposes into oxygen and carbon monoxide.  Oxygen interacts with liquid metal and oxidizes it.  Carbon dioxide in cans is used in air rifles and pistols. </p><p>  Modellers use this substance as fuel for their models.  Using carbon dioxide, you can significantly increase the yield of crops grown in the greenhouse.  <span>Dry ice is</span> also widely used in industry <span>,</span> in which food products are stored much better.  It is used as a refrigerant in refrigerators, freezers, electric generators and other thermal power plants. </p>
