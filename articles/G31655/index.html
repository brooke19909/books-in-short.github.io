Only this will take much more time than if you immediately read about the methods of using modes and their purpose. </p><h2>  What is called depth of field in photography, and for what purpose does it serve? </h2><p>  First of all, you should understand that the camera focuses on a certain distance.  At the same time, what is beyond its capabilities remains blurred.  Thus, all objects that are at the same distance as the subject will be as sharp as he is. </p><p>  If you look at any photo, it immediately becomes clear that there are no clear boundaries when a clear picture loses sharpness.  The transition is usually smooth and inconspicuous. </p><p>  The photo shows the aperture priority shooting mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photoreview.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aperture Priority Shooting Mode" class="if uuid-2421055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421055.jpg"></div><p>  The usually sharp objects on which the camera is focused, as well as the nearest objects (while all those located further) are blurred.  Depth of field depends on several factors: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  range to the point where the camera is focused; </li><li>  focal length of the camera itself; </li><li>  aperture </li></ul><p>  Below we consider in more detail each case. </p><h2>  The concept of aperture priority mode, and for what purpose is it used? </h2><p>  To understand what the aperture priority mode in the camera is, you should first know what it is indicated by the abbreviation A and Ay, which are in the menu of the device.  This allows you to change the width of the aperture.  The width of the aperture determines how much sunlight enters the frame.  The wider it is open, the more lighting gets (and vice versa).  Automation will choose which shutter speed to use.  This is what aperture priority is in the camera. </p><p>  This mode is usually used where shooting speed is required.  For example, when shooting a report, sports, air shows, etc.  When the object that you want to photograph is in motion, there is no time to tinker with the settings for a long time, because you can miss a really interesting and important shot.  Therefore, it is worth understanding how to use the aperture priority, because working with this mode, you need to manipulate with just one button, which takes only milliseconds. </p><p>  Also, this mode can be used while traveling without worrying about lighting, the camera itself will do this for you, you just need to make some manipulations with the diaphragm. </p><p>  The photo below shows the f / 11 aperture setting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vuanhiepanh.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="F / 11 aperture adjustment" class="if uuid-2421065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421065.jpg"></div><p>  From this mode will depend on how the background will be.  When the aperture is open, the background is blurred, focusing on a specific figure of the photo.  When you close the aperture, all objects and the surroundings in the photo become sharp and clear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vuanhiepanh.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="f / 11 / 1/400 sec / ISO 400 - 1" class="if uuid-2421077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421077.jpg"></div><p>  Two photographs (above and below) show examples of f / 11/1/400 sec / ISO 400 aperture settings. The first shows a mountain landscape, where the focus is on stones (they are planned to be photographed).  On the second - the result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vuanhiepanh.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="f / 11 / 1/400 sec / ISO 400 -2" class="if uuid-2421080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421080.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, an open aperture is usually used to create portrait photographs, while a closed aperture is used to capture landscapes.  It should also be remembered that with a closed aperture, the shutter speed is longer.  At this moment, the camera should be held more evenly, without twitching, but it is better to use a tripod. </p><h2>  Shooting objects in motion </h2><p>  Aperture priority allows you to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù the subject or make it more blurry.  The thing is that when the diaphragm is in the open position, more light enters it.  This allows you to take high-quality pictures in cloudy weather.  The shutter speed at the same time becomes much less, which means that you can manage to capture a moving object without lubricating it at the same time. </p><p>  An example of shooting moving objects is shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="snapshot.canon-asia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moving objects" class="if uuid-2421087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421087.jpg"></div><p>  But there is also the need to blur the background of the photo.  For example, if you need to focus on a specific person in the crowd, and at the same time there is very little light at the scene.  In this situation, close the aperture by increasing the shutter speed.  Thus, following the selected moving object, we can take a photo where the background surrounding the object will be blurred, and he will remain clear. </p><p>  Thus, without manipulating the aperture mode, the photo will not be bright enough and expressive. </p><h2>  Lighting and aperture </h2><p>  The aperture priority mode should be chosen depending on the light.  For example, if you have to take pictures in a dimly lit room, it is better to make it more open so that the picture is clearer.  Also, with an aperture equal to f / 2.8 or f / 3.5, it is possible to photograph in a darker environment, creating amazing and high-quality images. </p><p>  This is what shooting in the dark looks like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="insomnia.cocolog-nifty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aperture under lighting" class="if uuid-2421093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421093.jpg"></div><h2>  Example </h2><p>  An example is shooting in a theater or concert hall.  If you have a good lens that can shoot distant objects, you can open the aperture, letting in more light, take a great shot without distracting the actors or musicians from their work, flickering before your eyes, like photographers with less high-quality equipment do. </p><p>  For example, shooting in the auditorium is shown in the photo below.  An f / 2.8 aperture was used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dyxum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The shooting in the audience" class="if uuid-2421112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2421112.jpg"></div><p>  In this scenario, the picture will be sharp and clear, allowing you to see everything you need without extra effort. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, having studied the aperture priority, realizing what it affects in the picture, and using it when shooting in a timely manner, you can create amazing pictures that attract attention. </p>
