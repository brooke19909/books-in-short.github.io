    <p>  Although the prices in this health resort are slightly higher than in other sanatorium-resort institutions of the same region, this justifies itself.  The best and cleanest beach, beautiful and well-groomed territory, which is closed to outsiders, doctors with a high level of professionalism and high-quality work of staff - all this is the receiving side of such a city as Anapa - the sanatorium "Dream".  The reviews of 2014 confirm this.  That is why every guest has the opportunity not only to have a good rest, but also to restore all his strength. </p>
