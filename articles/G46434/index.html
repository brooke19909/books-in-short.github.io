Why is this so?  How to fix the situation?  How dangerous is this phenomenon?  All this will be described later.  In fact, understanding <span>why the phone does not turn on is</span> simple.  Especially if the power button is to blame. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The first scenario is quite common.  Moreover, he has nothing to do with damage.  Why does the power button on the phone not work?  The reason may be the most ordinary battery of the device.  The thing is that an insufficient amount of battery power makes the smartphone inoperative. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the power button on the phone does not work" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1492084.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Because of this, it turns out that the power button does not work.  This is actually not the case.  It is enough to turn on the phone in the network for a few minutes, and then try again to work with the equipment.  If the problem lies in the low battery, then everything will work. </p><h2>  Real damage </h2><p>  But this is only the beginning.  In fact, many users confuse situations in which their power button on the phone does not work, and when the device just does not turn on.  In principle, the result is the same - the gadget becomes a useless piece of plastic and iron. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In some cases, the power button may actually break.  This is a common problem.  It occurs mainly in those who either sloppily work with the device, or use it for a long time.  The blame for the usual wear and tear. </p><p>  If the problem really is a breakdown, you can fix the mobile phone.  Repair is carried out in specialized centers.  As a rule, for a fee you can pick up a working smartphone with normally functioning buttons. </p><p>  Sometimes the equipment is not subject to repair.  What then?  If the power button on the phone is broken, so much so that you can‚Äôt return it to work, you will have to buy a new gadget.  Fortunately, this situation is not too common.  Usually, you can easily contact the service center to fix the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone repair" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1492087.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Software issues </h2><p>  Does the power button on the phone not work?  As already mentioned, often users confuse the disruption of the smartphone and the breakdown of the gadget control buttons.  The second alignment is exclusively mechanical damage.  Usually they are either fixed in service centers, or lead to the need to purchase a new phone. </p><p>  If we consider the problem not as a failure of the power button from working, but as the fact that the smartphone itself does not work, the reasons may lie, for example, in software failures.  For example, the phone‚Äôs settings are lost under some circumstances.  Or viruses damage the gadget's OS.  Then he will not turn on.  Or it will constantly turn off.  The power button will not work either, nor will it respond to the commands sent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The situation is resolved if there are suspicions of a software failure in several ways.  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Flashing the phone.  It is carried out either independently, or in service centers.  It is better for novice users to entrust their mobile phone to professionals.  Repair expressed by firmware is carried out in a few minutes.  The gadget will work in full force. </li><li>  Setting up already included equipment.  Typically, users themselves carry out the so-called "Hard Reset", and then begin to establish the operation of the device.  The power button should work after resetting the phone to the initial level. </li><li>  Scanning your smartphone for viruses and further getting rid of malware.  If the gadget has already turned off, and it turned out that the power button on the phone does not work, it is best to return the equipment to a service center.  They will quickly help to rectify the situation. </li></ol><p>  All this helps in crashes caused by the phone‚Äôs operating system or its software.  But that‚Äôs not all.  You need to get acquainted with other options for the development of events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the power button on the phone has broken" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1492086.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  External influence </h2><p>  Why else might it seem that the power button on the phone does not work?  It is likely that the device had a negative external impact.  And this led either to system failures or to hardware damage.  Because of this, the power button may indeed not work. </p><p>  For example, the phone was dropped into the water.  Or the gadget fell from a height to the floor.  These causes damage to the smartphone.  And it stops working.  In the first case, you need to disassemble the phone as soon as possible and dry its components.  After that, collect and try to turn it on.  In the second, it is better to immediately contact the service center if a malfunction of the phone‚Äôs navigation buttons is detected. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn?  The power button on the phone does not work often because the gadget itself refuses to function.  The most common causes of this behavior are: </p><ul><li>  mechanical damage; </li><li>  defective production type; </li><li>  external negative impact on the phone; </li><li>  low battery; </li><li>  viruses on the phone; </li><li>  system failure </li><li>  the need for flashing. </li></ul>
