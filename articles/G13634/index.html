And hotels in Tbilisi will always welcome new guests from all over the world with pleasure and hospitality. </p><h2>  What to do for tourists in Tbilisi </h2><p>  The city got its name thanks to the warm sulfuric springs that are on its territory (from the Georgian ‚ÄúTbili‚Äù - ‚Äúwarm‚Äù).

    <p>  However, Tbilisi hotels are very diverse, so finding an option suitable for yourself will not be difficult.  Everything will depend only on where the hotel of your choice will be located.  Housing prices in Tbilisi largely depend on the area in which the hotel is located.  Expensive hotels prevail in the city center.  A significant factor affecting the value of the room may also be the view that the guest will observe from his window.  If you dream of a panorama of the city, then be prepared to pay extra money for such a luxury. </p><h2>  What hotels does Tbilisi offer its guests? </h2><p>  The capital, modern and popular with many tourists, boasts that on its territory several hotels with world names can host guests.  Choosing such hotels in Tbilisi, any guest can have no doubt that he is waiting for the highest quality service and incomparable comfort.  These hotels include: Marriott on Rustaveli Street, Courtyard by Marriott on Freedom Square, Sheraton on Telavskaya Street, Radisson Blue on Republic Square and Holiday Inn in Saburtalo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, in the capital of Georgia there are a large number of hotel options that do not have world names, but which have worked well here.  Those who are looking for very good hotels in Tbilisi, in the city center, can choose the beautiful Narikala Citadel or Orion, located near the State University.  The prices in them, of course, are not very affordable, but both of these hotels have 4 stars.  Of the inexpensive options that are located quite well, it is worth highlighting the Victoria Hotel and Diamond. </p><h2>  Great views from the Narikala Citadel Hotel </h2><p>  Choosing the Old City for your stay in Tbilisi is the right decision, especially for those who are visiting the capital of Georgia for the first time.  After all, the central temples and the best views of the whole city are concentrated here.  And it is thanks to the amazing panoramic view that opens from the windows of his rooms that the Hotel ‚ÄúNarikala Citadel‚Äù collects many rave reviews. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is located at 20. J. Azhiashvili Street. This place is located in close proximity to <span>the Narikala fortress,</span> which appeared here in the 7th century.  The Narikala Citadel itself is a unique small boutique hotel with a roof terrace.  From it you can admire magnificent views of the city and its attractions, as well as taste delicious Georgian dishes in the restaurant located right here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Both ordinary tourists and experts agree that this hotel is simply amazing.  Everything here has a good rest and immersion in the real Georgian flavor.  Of course, it is more suitable for physically prepared holidaymakers, since it is located high enough on a hill and it‚Äôs hard to climb up to it.  So if you are ready for such a small difficulty and are looking for good hotels in Tbilisi, then the Narikala Citadel will be an excellent choice for living in the Old City. </p><h2>  Services and rooms at the Citadel Narikala hotel </h2><p>  This boutique hotel has very few rooms - only 16. Each of them is designed for two guests and is made in white or gray colors.  It offers soft bathrobes and slippers, a minibar, a flat-screen TV with cable channels, air conditioning, a hairdryer, a large mirror and a balcony with amazing views. </p><p>  For guests at the hotel there is also a small fitness room with the necessary equipment, as well as its own museum.  It is located right in the lobby and introduces guests to archaeological finds discovered during the construction of the hotel. </p>

    <p>  The prices for rooms in the hotel are rather high, but this is directly explained by its location, the views and the quality of the rooms and service.  Therefore, few vacationers here complain about the price tag. </p><h2>  Orion in the center of Tbilisi </h2><p>  Just 100 meters from Chavchavadze Avenue, on Napareuli Street, 5, is the 4-star Orion Hotel.  Due to its favorable location in the very center of the city, this hotel will be a great place for all those who come to get acquainted with the capital of Georgia.

    <p>  Among the apartments offered to tourists, there are both double and triple standard rooms, family rooms, which can comfortably accommodate up to four guests, deluxe rooms with one or two beds and even suites with magnificent terraces.  Each of them has free Wi-Fi, <span>air conditioning, a minibar</span> and a safe, a flat-screen TV and comfortable new furniture. </p><h2>  What guests think about the Orion Hotel </h2><p>  Everyone who has ever stayed at this hotel speaks great of local breakfasts and comfortably furnished rooms.  Friendly guests and a very good location of the hotel delight guests. </p><p>  Some, however, say that Orion is clearly not up to 4 stars, but solid 3 stars can be given to it.  Local Wi-Fi guests also scold at times, because it sometimes disappears.  But this happens with almost any Internet, isn't it? </p>
