They can be found in residential buildings, shops, subway cars.  They are reliable "suppliers" of coolness on hot days, cooling the air around them.  However, such devices can be configured as heating appliances and perform the functions of an ordinary heater, stove.  In this article we will analyze the technical characteristics of the air conditioner BK-1500. </p><h2>  Air conditioning </h2><p>  This device is capable of supporting specific climatic conditions in a room or in any vehicle.  The simplest models only lower the temperature by cooling the air - these are the ones used in every second office on hot days. </p>

    <p>  There are more complicated models that can combine the functions of both cooling and temperature increase.  In such units, a heat pump is installed that can play the role of a heater.  More complex plants are equipped with filters and systems that purify the air entering the room, moisturize it (for example, during the hot period), saturate it with oxygen, and can spray fragrances. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  According to their functions, as well as the place of use, all devices can be divided as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  <em>Central</em> - used in large-scale premises.  It can be an indoor stadium, swimming pool or industrial enterprise, factory.  For uninterrupted operation, such an air conditioner needs an external source of cold: either cold water, or freon from an external unit.  If the device performs the functions of a heater, then, accordingly, for operation it needs continuously incoming and heating hot water, for example, from a central heating system. </li><li>  <em>Precision</em> - stand in rooms where it is necessary to maintain a strictly specified temperature.  These are hospitals, kindergartens, laboratories, industries associated with high-precision technologies and chemical, biological reactions, as well as factories related to military production, communications, electronic support and others.  Externally, the device looks like a candy bar, stuffed with a fan, filter, water heater and electric air heater.  It is capable of both cooling and heating air. </li><li>  <em>Wine</em> - work in the premises where wine is stored.  Storage parameters must be observed very clearly: air temperature - 12 degrees, humidity - 60-70%.  Only under these conditions, wine can be stored for a very long period of time and not lose its taste and strength.  On the contrary, a product stored in rooms with accurate air control systems is considered more mature, better and more expensive every year. </li><li>  <em>Autonomous air conditioning systems</em> are systems that work with an external source of electricity.  They can lower and raise the temperature; they function, as a rule, on freon. </li></ul>

Air conditioners with recovery are models that can work both ways.  Above, we disassembled the models at the place of their use.  Next, we will talk about the installation methods, the features of various machines, as well as the technical characteristics of the BK-1500 air conditioner and other units. </p><h2>  What are air conditioners? </h2><p>  According to the installation method and characteristics can be divided: </p><ul><li>  <em>Mobile</em> - they do not require special installation.  There are monoblock and mobile split systems.  To use monoblock conditioners, you need to remove the hose from the room and remove warm air through it.  If a split system is used, a separate unit is carried out.  The advantages of such air conditioners are that installation and maintenance are simplified here, and there are no detachable connections of the freon highway.  Main disadvantages: high price, large dimensions, installation restrictions </li><li>  <em>Window</em> - consist of one block.  They are installed in the window or on the wall where the opening is made.  Cons: they make a lot of noise, and also due to the reduction in the area, for example, of the window, the room becomes darker.  Pros: low price, easy to install and maintain, very high efficiency, there is the possibility of very long use. </li></ul>

The blocks are interconnected by copper pipes, through which the freon circulates.  Today it is the most popular and most used type of air conditioner. </li><li>  <em>A multi-split system</em> is almost the same as described above, but the number of indoor units can be two or more.  The blocks are also interconnected by copper pipes, through which the freon circulates.  Usually they are installed in multi-room rooms or where it is necessary to ventilate strongly and continuously. </li></ul><p>  The BK-1500 air conditioner belongs to the type of window.  Its description will be below.  Other models of the Baku Machine-Building Plant will also be presented, in fact, where this unit was manufactured. </p><h2>  BK-1500: specifications </h2><p>  Next, we consider the technical characteristics of the air conditioner BK-1500.  In the window version, all parts are assembled in one all-metal casing, and air flows through a hole with a valve, which is located at the rear of the machine.  An air conditioner is usually mounted in a window (in fact, that's why it is called that) or in a hole that makes its way into the wall.  In most air conditioners of this type, the condensate formed does not drain onto the street, but is collected at the bottom of the unit, from where it is collected by special devices and scattered across the surface of the condenser to improve heat transfer. </p>

    <p>  There is also a cyclical operation of the compressor - it is periodically turned off, and then turned on again.  This is to ensure that the mechanism does not overheat from continuous operation.  The temperature sensor monitors on and off.  The latter is either mechanical or electronic. </p><h2>  Strengths </h2><p>  We will call the positive qualities of these devices: </p><ul><li>  low cost of installation or dismantling;  the main thing is that there is an opening where the device will be located; </li><li>  there are no <span>detachable connections of the</span> freon line, which means that there will be no refrigerant leak; </li><li>  the function of the so-called forced ventilation, that is, the use of air outdoors, which allows it to be constantly updated, circulating through the device; </li><li>  long service life, ease of use. </li></ul><h2>  But there are weaknesses </h2><p>  We list them: </p><ul><li>  very noisy; </li><li>  along with noise, it should be noted and poor thermal insulation between parts of the same air conditioner, located indoors and outdoors;  due to the passage of cold air through the apparatus, experts recommend dismantling the model for the winter season; </li><li>  and you can‚Äôt install it in modern window frames, only if you have to foresee the necessary opening in advance in the manufacture. </li></ul><h2>  BK-1500 </h2><p>  So, before us is the air conditioner BK-1500.  We will describe it further.  This unit is able to operate in two modes that are set manually: ventilation and cooling.  It is installed in a window opening or in a hole in the wall on a special wooden or metal frame.  The device is divided into two equal compartments with a stainless steel partition (usually): internal and external.  On this partition there is a small hole that is closed by a shutter-valve.  This allows you to adjust the flow of fresh air in the room: opened the damper - launched the air.  At the heart of the device: a refrigeration unit, two fans (one axial, the other centrifugal), which have a common electric motor, as well as a control panel, which also includes a start-up device. </p>

    <p>  A centrifugal fan, which is installed in the internal compartment of the air conditioner, draws in air from the room.  In parallel, he is engaged in the fact that he pumps the cooled and dust-free air.  That is, it works on the basis of the "take-give" principle.  The fan motor turns on when the compressor starts, although it is able to turn on during ventilation and when the refrigeration system is off. </p><h2>  Remote controller </h2><p>  A control panel having a start-up protection device is, of course, the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of the entire model.  It monitors start and stop, controls the operation of the air conditioner, sets the desired temperature in the room and maintains it.  The stable temperature around the device saves it from excessive pressure and overloads.  On the outside of the console there is a panel with various knobs and switches to control the entire operation of this unit.  To date, many of the technical specifications of the BK-1500 air conditioner are outdated.  Remote controls, motors, fans, additional devices, released back in the Soviet Union, all this wears out, despite the very good quality. </p><h2>  Conditioner BK 1500: instructions for use </h2><ul><li>  You can connect the device to the network only with the help of a plug, which is inserted into a special two-pole socket with a grounding contact. </li><li>  You can start the air conditioner only using the switch knob, which is located on the remote control. </li><li>  Before restarting, a short break is necessary so that the device does not overheat. </li><li>  The air conditioner is able to work even when the voltage in the network deviates from normal values ‚Äã‚Äã(220 V) by several percent.  In this case, a temperature of about 20-30 degrees above zero is desirable. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  It is necessary to monitor the cleanliness not only on the air conditioner, but also inside it.  The unit should be cleaned of accumulated dust, sand and other debris, do not block the air flow both from the outside and indoors, do not put things near the unit, especially those that can be damaged due to the air stream.  It is advisable not to stand close to a running machine in order to prevent a possible cold, illness, as the air flow is very strong and cold.  Do not open doors and windows when the air conditioner is running, to prevent drafts. </li></ul><p>  Despite the fact that today the air conditioner BK-1500 is considered a rather outdated device, it‚Äôs easy to find instructions for it.  She describes in detail and step by step all the nuances of the operation of this unit.  This is not due to the fact that the unit is difficult to use, but with a very strict tracking system at enterprises during the period of the USSR, everything should have been clear, clear, detailed, correct. </p><h2>  Air conditioning BK-1500: specifications, photos, reviews </h2><p>  In general, reviews about such devices have always been positive.  The air conditioner is easy to use, with an easy system that, even with a little knowledge, you can fix it yourself.  Many craftsmen based on the BK 1500 created their own split systems or more powerful air conditioners.  A very long service life and Soviet reliability are also noted by consumers. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 614px; height: 403px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  A type </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  KB-0.4-01 UZ </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  The area that the machine can serve </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  25 m <sup>2</sup> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Cold production., W (kcal / h) </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  1740 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Air production, m3 / h </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  400 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  The power that the model consumes </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  900 watts </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Refrigeration unit </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Freon - 22 (R22) </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Amount of refrigerant used </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  0.8 kg </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Voltage </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  220 V </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Current frequency </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  ~ 50 Hz </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Noise level </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  no more than 58 dB </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Working current </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  not less than 5 A </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Dimensions in millimeters: height-width-depth </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  400-600-585 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Mass air conditioner </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  51 kg </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The technical characteristics of the BK-1500 air conditioner are certainly inferior to the new ones, but for that time such units were ‚Äúon top‚Äù.
