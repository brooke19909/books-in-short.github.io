For them, the flight is short-lived, and therefore inexpensive.  Why is Hainan so attractive?  Summer is all year round, a warm sea, a maximum of entertainment - one cannot directly believe that once this island served as a place of exile for disgraced Chinese courtiers.  They mastered the northern coast of Hainan, closer to the mainland of the Celestial Empire, and everyone waited for the emperor‚Äôs anger to be replaced by mercy.  And now the most developed is the southern tip of the island, where the resort capital is located - Sanya.  The city gradually turned into an urban conglomeration.  Tourists have heard the names of resort areas such as Dadonghai and Yalongwan.  But in this article we will describe the Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 * hotel, which is located in the heart of the city, on the shores of Sanya Bay.  We took information to describe the hotel and its services both from tour operators and from guest reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2118843.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  The Asgard Seaview 4 * Hotel is very easy to reach.  The islet where the Phoenix (Sanya) Airport is located is only twelve kilometers from the hotel.  The transfer will take only some twenty minutes.  When leaving for a group excursion, you are the last to be picked up from the hotel, and brought first.  Ten minutes on foot - and you are already on the pedestrian street of Sanya - the main focus of the resort.  And right next to the hotel are numerous shops and two restaurants.  The hotel we are describing is located at the very beginning of Sanya Bay.  Literally fifty meters from the gates of the hotel - just cross the road - a wide sandy beach stretches.  Its length is 18 km.  So everyone will find a place on it.  Nearby, a five-minute walk, is the center of the resort.  And if you go for a walk, then you won‚Äôt get lost.  Finding ‚ÄúSanya Bay Asgard Seaview 4 *‚Äù will not be difficult if you focus on the nearby high-rise hotel Tianze Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix Sanya Airport" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2118847.jpg"></div>

Since then, renovations and improvements have been carried out repeatedly.  The last repair took place in 2012.  Despite the fact that the hotel is urban, its territory is quite extensive.  Its area is over 37 thousand square meters.  On the territory there are two buildings (A and B), both thirteen-story.  For the convenience of guests in the buildings are equipped with seven elevators.  According to tourists, the buildings are very beautiful, white, with a bold architectural solution.  Representative halls with high ceilings and richly decorated chandeliers immediately indicate the high status of the hotel.  Tourists liked the hotel grounds.  The space between the buildings is occupied by a lush tropical garden.  And if your room is located on the upper floors, the view from the balcony you will be simply amazing.  Tourists recommend that you pay three thousand rubles for the entire stay when booking in order to receive a Sea View room.  A view of Sanya Bay (Hainan) costs that much money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2118827.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  All categories of tourists can find suitable accommodation for themselves in the Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 * hotel.  Let's start the description of the rooms with the cheapest category - a business room.  They are located in building B on the second and third floors.  These rooms serve as an overnight stay for those tourists who stop in transit to Sanya.  The rooms have balconies, but they overlook the street.  But the standard category numbers can be ‚Äúsea view‚Äù.  They are also located in Building B, but above, from the fourth to the sixth floor.  The same area, 48 square meters, have superior sea view rooms.  These improved standards are housed in Building B from floors 5 to 9.  On the upper levels of the second building are junior suites.  In building A, from the fourth to tenth floors, there is a category of rooms called full sea view room.  They are characterized by the fact that their balconies do not have a side view, but a frontal view of the sea.  The hotel has a total of six Executive Sea Business Suite rooms.  These luxurious chambers have a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã90 square meters.  m. They are located on the upper floors of building A. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 China" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2118837.jpg"></div>

And the filling, in essence, is the same.  Everywhere, even in business rooms, there is a TV, central air conditioning, telephone, minibar, safe, electric kettle with dishes, iron with ironing board, hairdryer.  Tourists are happy to note that most of the services in the room are free.  So, you can use the safe and connect the device to the Internet.  Wi-Fi, as tourists assure, is very smart.  In addition, every day, during cleaning, the maids bring two bottles of drinking water and bags of coffee and tea.  Bathrobes and slippers are provided.  The bathrooms have a shower.  The rooms have flaws.  So, reviews note the lack of Russian channels on television.  For large companies there are no family rooms.  They have to order the highest category - suites designed for four people.  But there is the possibility for an extra charge to order another bed for a third guest in a regular double room.  The suites differ from other guest rooms not only in their larger area and the presence of a living room, but also in such pleasant trifles as a bathroom scale, a radio, a set of films and a fruit basket upon check-in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2118830.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 * has already included breakfast in the price.  Their hotelier calls continental.  But do not rush to worry - tourists reassure.  <span>Continental</span> European <span>breakfast is</span> significantly different from the same in mainland China.  The inhabitants of the Middle Kingdom love to start the day with a very dense meal, which includes scrambled eggs, noodles, vegetable and meat stews and the like.  Breakfast, as can be judged from the reviews of tourists, lasts a long time, so that larks and owls can eat.  Meals are served as a buffet in the Asgard Cafe restaurant from seven to ten in the morning.  But even then this institution does not close its doors to visitors.  Here you can have lunch and dinner.  Asgard Cafe specializes in European cuisine.  And if you want to get involved in Chinese exoticism, you can visit the hotel‚Äôs second restaurant, Longkanren. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Sanya Bay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2118855.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Sanya Bay (Hainan) is located only fifty meters from the Asgard Seaview 4 * Hotel.  But, as the reviews warn, you have to cross the road.  On the sandy beach, the hotel does not have its own plot.  Sun beds with umbrellas also do not belong to the hotel.  Tourists go to the city beach.  But the hotel itself has a swimming pool.  Tourists described the beach as good, but too crowded.  After all, this is actually the center of the city.  But on the palm of your hand you can see the Phoenix Island - the man-made miracle of Sanya. </p><h2>  Hotel Sanya Bay Asgard Seaview Hotel 4 *: description of services </h2><p>  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel.  It is fast and free.  Among the ‚Äúgratuitous‚Äù services is a guarded parking lot, where you can also attach a rented moped and even a bicycle.  The hotel has a currency exchange, tour desk, laundry service, three conference rooms and a business center.  For babies there are cribs and high chairs.  For a fee, a shuttle service to Phoenix Airport (Sanya) is available.  The hotel has a lounge where you can watch TV with a large screen or read the press.  People with limited mobility will be comfortable in the hotel, because here the elevators and other rooms are equipped with wide doors and ramps for strollers. </p><h2>  Asgard Seaview Hotel Sanya Bay 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists liked the spacious and bright rooms.  The views from Building A and from the upper floors of Building B are breathtaking.  <span>Phoenix Island</span> with its skyscrapers rises just opposite the hotel, across the bay.  Tourists also enjoyed the breakfasts.  They are very satisfying and you can not feel hunger until the evening.  Around the hotel, city life is noisy.  Restaurants, public transport, shops, cafes, entertainment - everything is within walking distance. </p>
