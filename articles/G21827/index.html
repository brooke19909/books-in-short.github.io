Both manufacturers produce really good modern cameras that provide not only fantastically high quality images, but also very similar capabilities.  There are a considerable number of similarities between brands, which makes it seem to many that there is no difference which one to buy.  However, whether you choose "Canon" or "Nikon" may be affected by some significant differences (of which not everyone is aware).  Although in the right hands each of these cameras can show amazing results. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon or Nikon" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2710/214527.jpg" width="485"></div>  Advantages and disadvantages </h3><p>  If we talk about which is better - "Canon" or "Nikon", then you should first consider certain points regarding each manufacturer.  For starters, you can talk about the merits of technology produced under the brand name "Nikon".  Here you can highlight the excellent quality of images obtained in low light conditions.  In this regard, the camera "Canon" significantly loses.  Most Nikon cameras have significantly more autofocus points than competing manufacturers.  Very often, an insufficient number of autofocus points does not allow the photographer to choose a subject for shooting, forcing to change the whole composition.  In terms of controlling the flash, ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù is in the lead; its cameras in this vein are superior to the Nikon technique.  It is generally accepted that Nikon devices are more ‚Äúuser friendly‚Äù in the sense that they have a lot of amenities, as well as a number of pleasant things. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon Camera" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2710/214528.jpg" width="600"></div>  Canon cameras: advantages </h3><p>  The equipment of this manufacturer is capable of making high-quality video.  The latest Nikon models can also shoot video, but it does not reach the required level of quality.  Traditionally, Canon cameras and lenses are much cheaper than Nikon.  If you look at the price range of the most popular SLR cameras from both manufacturers, then usually the first is 8-10% more expensive than the second.  Many photographers pay great attention to such a factor as the number of megapixels, since the larger it is, the more convenient it will be to work with the image in the future.  ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù is usually slightly ahead of ‚ÄúNikon‚Äù in this indicator.  It is worth mentioning the availability of cameras and lenses produced under this brand.  All modern Canon cameras have a built-in motor, while Nikon usually does not have one (or you need to overpay for it).  One more small remark from experienced users: it is much easier for Canon devices to purchase special adapters that allow you to connect a <span>Soviet lens.</span>  Very often this is necessary for experienced photographers who have stocks of lenses for a long time. </p>
