Most users can hardly copy contacts from the address book, and they are ready to give up as they try to copy the rest of the information (like SMS messages), resigned to the fact that it will always remain in the old gadget. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will try to answer the question of how to transfer SMS from Android to Android and make it the most painless for both the new phone and the user himself. </p><p>  One of the easiest options is when the new gadget is running the same operating system as the old device.  For example, you need to export from ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù to ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù or from ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù to ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù, in this case, the migration occurs through official software that comes with the device. </p><p>  For iPhones, it‚Äôs IT Tunes, Nokia has a Nokia Syut, and the Microsoft Background service has been developed for the Windows platforms.  Before transferring SMS from Android to a computer, in such cases, the user just needs to connect his old gadget to the computer and through the official utility create a backup copy of the data, which can then be restored on the new phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The whole migration process is noticeably complicated if you need to transfer information from one operating system to another platform.  For example, before transferring SMS from Android to iPhone, you need to install several applications at once, and then also write the execution of small scripts in the command line. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the panacea for complete synchronization and subsequent migration have not yet been invented, but in general the whole process has been significantly improved. </p><h2>  Address Book and SMS </h2><p>  Without the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù utilities, it will not be possible to completely transfer all the data.  The pre-installed software in the phone is not able to intelligently export contacts and SMS messages.  Built-in applications allow you to copy contacts, and only in some cases SMS, to a SIM or SD card.  Before transferring SMS to the Android memory card, it is important to know that all information in this case will be truncated: you cannot save messages with any attachments and contact names should not exceed a limit of 8 characters. </p><p>  To begin, let's start with the ‚Äúlight‚Äù services, which are mainly intended for transferring contacts marked as SMS migration.  They are considered as such by virtue of their simplicity, clarity and accessibility for the average user. </p><h2>  Google sync </h2><p>  One of the easiest ways to export and import data is Google‚Äôs service from Google Sink.  Software ceases to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù such platforms as BlackBerry, iOS, Symbian and other operating systems that support SyncML. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Before transferring SMS from Android to Android or any other device, you need to configure Google Sink on the old and new gadget, and then start synchronization with the subsequent migration of contacts and SMS messages.  There are more than enough reviews about the service on the network, but all of them are mostly in a positive way. </p><h2>  Idrive </h2><p>  The service, developed for storing and transferring data of "iDrive", has released a lightweight version of "Light" (IDrive Lite) for smartphones operating on the BlackBerry, Android and iOS operating systems.  The application allows you to save your contacts along with SMS messages and, if necessary, restore them, which also implies migration to new devices. </p><h2>  Synkontact </h2><p>  The application allows you to export and import data between the Android and iPhone platforms, and in any combination and in any order.  All migration occurs through the server of the software developer, so there is no need to connect phones to each other or connect them to a personal computer. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the service worked well, but before transferring SMS from Android to iPhone, it‚Äôs important to clarify that the software is distributed under a paid license, so don‚Äôt be surprised if the basic or trial version is extremely poor in functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Funambol </h2><p>  A fairly popular online service among Europeans, which perfectly synchronizes smartphones among themselves, and also copes well with tablets and personal computers.  The application supports the work of platforms such as Android, BlackBerry, iOS, and Symbian.  In addition to transferring contacts and SMS messages, the service allows you to migrate a calendar, mail, images and other data. </p><h2>  Synchronet </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSynchroNet‚Äù is specially ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for certain types of devices and feels great when working with the gadgets ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù, ‚ÄúEricsson‚Äù, ‚ÄúMotorola‚Äù, ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù and NTS.  Before transferring SMS from Nokia to Android, it should be clarified that the service allows not only exporting contacts with messages, but also editing data on the phone through its web interface. </p>

    <p>  The trial version has limited functionality, therefore it saves only one copy of the backup data, but after subscribing and acquiring a license, the program‚Äôs capabilities expand significantly, and the number of copies is no longer limited.  Users respond very warmly about this software, mark it with a successful solution for resetting memory in an existing device. </p><h2>  Mybackup pro </h2><p>  The multifunctional utility ‚ÄúMayBackup Pro‚Äù allows not only to transfer SMS and applications to another device, but also perfectly exports photos, bookmarks, MMS, calendars, shortcuts, dictionaries, alarms, playlists and other system settings.  The program features are simply gorgeous and, judging by the feedback from users, it can be recommended to literally anyone who needs data migration. </p><p>  The shareware version has its limitations, and before transferring SMS from Android to Android, you must definitely get an SD card.  If a license was purchased, then the entire migration process takes place through a specially online storage, which, incidentally, is protected with the latest technology and has an extremely high level of security. </p><p>  If you rarely export and import information from one device to another, then for a one-time use, you can use the trial period of 30 days.  Supported platforms: Android, Windows Mobile, Symbian and BlackBerry. </p><h2>  MOBILedit </h2><p>  The utility for desktop devices ‚ÄúMOBILEdit‚Äù allows you to transfer SMS messages from ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù to Mac, ‚ÄúWindows Mobile‚Äù, ‚ÄúSymbian‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlackBerry‚Äù.  The software supports thousands of different devices, synchronizing devices for transferring music, photos, contacts, MMS, call history, search, bookmarks and other settings. </p>

    <p>  Looking at all this rich functionality and compatibility with so many devices and operating systems, it is clear <span>that such software</span> cannot be free.  Buying a license for the full version costs quite a lot of money, but the owners of Android devices are very lucky - the lite version of Phone Copier, although it has more modest functionality, can handle the transfer of SMS messages and contacts. </p><p>  A shareware license allows you to save only the address book on the developer's servers, so for a full migration it is better to use a local memory card, where you can export SMS, calls and phone settings. </p>
