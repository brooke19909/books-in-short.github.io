Thanks to the Schengen visa, they can visit several EU countries and get the maximum number of impressions from their trip.  The most popular countries for traveling with Russians are the Czech Republic and Germany, and the most popular route is the road from Prague to Munich.  Therefore, we decided to consider all possible travel options suitable for tourists traveling in Europe on their own. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from Prague to Munich" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763903.jpg" width="508"></div></h2><h2>  Distance from Prague to Munich </h2><p>  Each route begins by determining the distance between two points.  How many kilometers from Prague to Munich?  In our case, this question is extremely clear and does not require careful study.  These two beautiful cities are separated by only three hundred and eighty kilometers. </p><p>  Even for Europe, this distance is extremely small, and what can we say about the Russians, who are accustomed to overcome much longer stretches of the path.  After all, our country is famous for its vast expanses. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Munich how to get" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763899.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Prague - Munich: how to get there </h2><p>  If you have definitely and irrevocably decided to visit both cities in one trip, then you can understand - it‚Äôs hard to refrain from traveling to such wonderful European corners filled with history and amazing sights.  Many tourists think so, so the route Prague - Munich is well thought out and very lively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Travelers have several ways to get to their desired cities: </p><ul><li>  sightseeing tour; </li><li>  car; </li><li>  a train; </li><li>  air flight; </li><li>  bus. </li></ul><p>  Each of the proposed options has its pros and cons, so we will talk about them in more detail. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Munich by car" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763900.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Sightseeing tour </h2><p>  The easiest way to get from Prague to Munich is to get an excursion for one to two days.  The fact is that in Prague such tours are in great demand among numerous tourists. </p><p>  Judge for yourself, you will be taken to a place, settled in a hotel, fed, shown all the sights, and at the end of the trip they will be returned back to Prague.  From the trip you get some pleasant emotions, and do not take any risks.  In addition, a large number of Russian-speaking guides are currently working in the Czech capital, so you will fully enjoy sightseeing in Munich. </p><p>  It is best if such a tour lasts two days.  This will allow you to visit all the attractions and even buy souvenirs for friends and relatives.  Such a pleasure will cost about one hundred and thirty euros per person.  The price of the tour includes moving, visiting museums and memorial places, hotel accommodation and meals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague munich distance by car" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763905.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Flight </h2><p>  The fastest way to travel from Prague to Munich is, of course, air travel.  But it is worth noting that this method is not the most popular because of its high cost.  Not every tourist can afford to buy a plane ticket to Munich. </p><p>  Time in the air does not exceed fifty minutes, but the cost of a flight is equivalent to 250 euros.  Typically direct flights are made by Lufthansa.  If this price seems unnecessarily high, then look for a route with transfers.  Such a flight will cost you an average of one hundred and fifty euros.  True, in this case, the journey will take from four to ten hours.  The following carriers operate according to this scheme: </p><ul><li>  Lufthansa; </li><li>  Swiss </li><li>  Austrian. </li></ul><p>  Tickets for transit flights can be purchased online or at the box office in the <span>Prague airport</span> building itself <span>.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much from Prague to Munich" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763901.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Train travel </h2><p>  If you are not new to traveling around Europe, then you know that rail is the most popular here.  Almost all points of the European Union are well connected, which greatly facilitates the life of tourists. </p><p>  The train from Prague to Munich leaves four times a day.  It has a rather convenient schedule, tourists can plan a trip so as to be in Munich in the early morning or, conversely, leave in the morning if you plan to stay in Bavaria for several days. </p><p>  You will spend six hours on the road, and the cost of a second-class ticket will be about seventy euros. </p><h2>  Bus route </h2><p>  Budget tourists usually choose a bus service between cities.  It is worth noting that this method of transportation is also quite popular.  European buses are comfortable, and spend a few hours in them will not be difficult. </p><p>  The route to Munich is served by three well-known companies: </p><ul><li>  StudentAgency; </li><li>  Deutsche Bahn; </li><li>  Eurolines. </li></ul><p>  Each has its own schedule, convenient for one or another category of passengers. </p><p>  For example, Deutsche Bahn is a daytime bus.  They overcome the route in four hours, and this pleasure costs only twenty-five euros.  In Prague, you can catch a bus from the Main Station, and in Munich you will leave at the Central Station. </p><p>  StudentAgency makes night flights, the ticket price does not exceed twenty-seven euros.  In Munich, you will be at about five in the morning. </p><p>  Eurolines buses leave for Munich twice a day - morning and evening.  Ticket price varies within twenty-five euros.  The bus leaves from the Florenc station and arrives at Munich Central Station. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Route Prague Munich" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1763902.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Prague - Munich by car </h2><p>  If you are ready to rent a car and enjoy the surrounding beauties, as well as independently plan possible deviations from the route, then you need to choose a trip by car </p><p>  If you manage to leave Prague no later than eight in the morning, then in five hours you will overcome the road Prague - Munich.  The distance by car may take longer if you get into traffic jams, and they are quite common in this direction. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  Of course, the choice always remains with the traveler.  After all, only he can know how much time and money he is ready to spend on moving.  Nevertheless, we can briefly summarize all of the above.  If you are not too confident in a foreign country, then an excursion tour is ideal for you.  In the case when the important factor is time, not money, it is worth choosing air travel.  A direct route will literally be a godsend for such busy people. </p><p>  The most common way to get around is bus and train.  It all depends on the preferences of the tourist, although rail transport is a bit more expensive than bus travel.  However, it is more comfortable, so we would advise him to large companies or families with children. </p><p>  And finally, the car.  It can become a source of pleasure or problems.  It all depends on the mood of the traveler and his driving skills.  On the one hand, the track is equipped with picturesque places to stop, where you can have a cup of coffee and stretch your legs.  In addition, there are a lot of neat little settlements along the way, which is nice to look into.  But, on the other hand, you will have to navigate the map yourself and make a route.  And also refuel the car and pay for paid sections of the route.  If you are ready for all this, then choose a car trip. </p><p>  And, however, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all how you overcome these three hundred eighty kilometers, the main thing is that you will see with your own eyes the most beautiful cities of Europe. </p>
