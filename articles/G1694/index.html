    <p>  The hero of this article is Kolovrat Evpatiy.  The feat of this hero, tremulously preserved by popular history, is a vivid illustration of the above thesis. </p><p>  The beginning of the XIII century was a difficult test for the Russian lands.  Hordes of Mongolian tribes, led by Genghis Khan‚Äôs grandson <span>Khan Batu,</span> invaded the Russian principalities, sweeping away everything in its path.  The more backward in historical development, but militant and united groups of the Mongols acted cunningly, swiftly and ruthlessly.  The situation was complicated by the fragmentation of the Russian principalities, which did not allow the whole nation to come together against the enemy.  Nevertheless, these gloomy pages of history are sanctified by the <span>strength of the spirit of the</span> Russian people, including Kolovrat Yevpatiy.  But these are only isolated reflections of heroism that have come down to us through the ages.  The chronicler describes the events as follows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The Vladimir-Suzdal prince refused help, so the Ryazan prince turned his eyes to Chernigov, from which support could be expected.  Kolovrat Yevpatiy, a rich boyar, a strong and courageous hero, was sent for help.  But events developed much faster than our compatriots expected.  It was not possible to buy off the Mongols, and the Ryazans were not going to surrender to the enemy.  Having seized the city, Batu ordered to destroy the entire population, so that it would be disgraceful for others.  They cut everyone from small to large, neither the elderly nor the children were left alive, the city was burned down.  The news of what happened quickly spread throughout the Russian principalities.  Having learned about the incident, hurriedly returning to their homeland with a small squad Yevpatiy Kolovrat.  Ryazan lay in the ashes, a raven soared above the unburied corpses.  The heart of a Russian warrior was breaking with grief and longing.  In this situation, he makes the only possible decision for himself - to catch up with the Mongol army and engage in an unequal battle. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Tale of Evpatia Kolovrat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/220750.jpg" width="436"></div><br>  The rearguard of the Mongols was overtaken near Suzdal.  Like a whirlwind, unexpectedly and swiftly, without fear, Kolovrat Yevpatiy and his fellows attacked the enemy.  The effect of surprise upset the ranks of the Mongols.  1,500 Russian knights swept away thousands and thousands of opponents in their path.  The help of the main forces, of course, determined the outcome of the battle.  Batu ordered Eupatius to be taken alive, but the Mongols could not fulfill this order.  Only after killing the hero with the help of throwing guns, they managed to stop him.  This heroic act amazed and delighted the Khan; he ordered Kolovrat's body to be given to the surviving associates, who were released and were able to bury their leader.

    <p>  The people preserved this feat in their memory, and the chronicler wrote down the tale of Eupatia Kolovrat as an example to descendants.  The modern pragmatic generation can say: and why did you have to die in vain?  But there are circumstances with which it is impossible to live, it is impossible to realize that you did nothing where you could, showed cowardice.  As long as people like our hero Kolovrat live on our land, our people will live. </p>
