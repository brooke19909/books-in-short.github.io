    <p>  The young man saw himself as a financier.  In 1954, he began his studies at the Moscow Financial Institute.  In 1958 he received the specialty "Finance, Credit and Money Circulation".  Valentin Sergeevich Pavlov got a job as an inspector of state revenues in one of the district financial departments of the capital. </p><p>  A year later, the twenty-two-year-old Pavlov became an economist in the Ministry of Finance of the RSFSR.  He worked in the system for seven years, until he reached the rank of deputy chief.  Since 1968, he became deputy head of the budgetary sphere of administration of the USSR Ministry of Finance. </p><p>  In 1979, Valentin Sergeevich was able to defend his thesis and get a PhD in economics.  He became an assistant professor at one of the financial institutions.  At the same time, he begins work in the State Planning Commission.  Three years later, he defended his doctoral dissertation. </p><p>  In 1986, Pavlov was appointed deputy minister of finance of the Soviet Union.  Three years later, statesman Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov himself becomes Minister of Finance. </p><h2>  Government of Pavlov </h2><p>  In 1991, he became Prime Minister of the USSR.  In the same year he joined the USSR Security Council.  Everything happened after Ryzhkov and his government resigned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The government operated from January to August 1991.  Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov, whose biography is connected with the termination of the existence of the USSR, was able to carry out a number of transformations. </p><h2>  Reform Activities </h2><p>  Soviet statesman Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov had to work in a short period of time, which was full of dramatic events.  He failed to complete the transformation of the economy. </p><p>  The most famous reform of the Pavlov government was Money.  It was initiated by the Prime Minister himself.  He decided to use the ‚Äúsurprise effect‚Äù to try to stabilize the money circulation in the country.  The purpose of the transformation was to get rid of excess money supply and partially solve the deficit problem. </p><p>  The official reason for the reform was the fight against fake rubles, which were allegedly imported from abroad. </p><p>  Banknotes of 1961 with face value of fifty and one hundred rubles were subject to exchange.  Three days were given to all people, while there was a limit for each person of one thousand rubles.  A restriction was also introduced on withdrawals.  One depositor of Sberbank of the USSR could withdraw no more than five hundred rubles. </p>

    <p>  Government actions allowed the withdrawal of fourteen billion rubles in cash from circulation.  They expected to strike at persons who engaged in illegal money transactions.  As a result of such actions, the population has lost confidence in the government.  The April price increase worsened things.  General consumer goods tripled in price. </p><p>  In 1991, new bills and coins were put into circulation.  For some time, the money of 1961 also acted, except for denominations of fifty and one hundred rubles.  Denominations of denominations that were not there before were also created. </p><h2>  GKChP </h2>

    <p>  Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov (photo from the press conference) was one of the founders of the self-proclaimed authority in August 1991.  It is known as GKChP.  The main opponent of the body was Boris Yeltsin, who declared the actions of the GKChP members unconstitutional. </p><p>  The political organization opposed the course of Mikhail Gorbachev.  Representatives promised to establish a tough order and not allow the country to develop due to the decline in living standards.  However, they did not mention specific measures to solve the main economic problems.  The GKChP officially announced that perestroika was at an impasse.  Members of the organization did not want to allow the liquidation of the USSR. </p>

    <p>  Troops with military equipment were brought into Moscow.  Boris Yeltsin refused to cooperate with the State Emergency Committee.  Gradually, the army switched to the side of Yeltsin.  They liquidated the organization from August 20 to 22, 1991. </p><p>  The events were called the ‚ÄúAugust putsch‚Äù and were condemned by the USSR authorities.  Representatives of the Committee were arrested, including Pavlov.  He spent a year and a half in the Sailor Silence prison.  In 1993, a trial took place.  At that moment, the accused were released, provided that they did not leave their place of residence.  Former members of the Emergency Committee were accused of treason. </p><p>  The process was completed in 1994.  Then the GKChP members were amnestied.  Only Army General Varennikov did not agree with the amnesty.  After a couple of months, he was acquitted, since the corpus delicti was not proved. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov until the last was engaged in economic affairs of the state.  He was vice president of the <span>Free Economic Society,</span> headed one of the Institutes at the International Union of Economists. </p><p>  There was no known financier on March 30, 2003.  He was buried at Pyatnitsky cemetery in his hometown. </p>
