Materials and step-by-step instructions for making a model</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Classical ballet skirt became a real trend of youth fashion in 2012.  Looking at the slender ballerinas fluttering around the stage in air dresses, the designers were inspired by the idea and presented the girls and girls with a tutu skirt that allows them to look truly glamorous in everyday life.  Not every girl‚Äôs dreams bring to the stage, and a <span>tutu skirt, sewn with her own hands,</span> will allow her to touch the inaccessible. </p><p>  In fact, this very elegant skirt will become a favorite not only for your charming baby, but also for your matured daughter.  The manufacturing process will take quite a bit of time, you just have to prepare the necessary materials in advance.  There are many different ways, among which there are quite easy, not time-consuming, and more complex, requiring certain skills and mastery.  In any case, if there is a desire and a little patience, everything will work out.  We proceed to the description <span>of manufacturing processes</span> on the principle from simple to complex. </p><p>  <strong>Do-it-yourself skirt tutu.</strong>  <strong>Very easy way to make</strong> </p><p>  Such an amazingly beautiful and magnificent skirt will turn your baby into a real princess, will be a wonderful outfit for the New Year's party, for a photo shoot, dance classes.  If you just had a desire to please the child and, of course, yourself, and besides all this there is free time, approximately one hour, try to sew it yourself.  For a little girl, a do-it-yourself tutu skirt will be of medium length, you can make a calculation taking into account your size. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  tulle (tulle), cut into rectangles measuring 20 cm x 50 cm - 50 pcs.; </li><li>  elastic band 2 cm wide in quantity - subtract 4 cm from the waist circumference; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Manufacturing process: </p><ol><li>  Sew the elastic and adjust it to the legs of the inverted chair or to your own legs, as it is more convenient. </li><li>  Fold the first rectangle in half and tie it on an elastic band without tightening it too much, but also so that the imposed pieces do not hang out, in general, tighten it medium.  If desired, you can make a skirt with a pattern, take the material of two or more colors and alternate when they are imposed on an elastic band. </li><li>  Gradually impose tulle (tulle) rectangles around the gum until there is no free space. </li><li>  The finished skirt can be trimmed by holding it with scissors. </li></ol><p>  <strong>How to make a skirt-tutu in another way?</strong> </p><p>  For this <span>model of a tutu skirt,</span> it is necessary to prepare a mesh or tulle for its lower layers and fabric of a denser structure on the upper layer (depending on the season: for summer it is thinner, for winter it is denser).  In this model, the splendor of the skirt will directly depend on the number of lower layers. </p><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  tulle (tulle, mesh); </li><li>  thin knitwear (jersey); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  satin ribbon; </li><li>  sewing machine. </li></ul><p>  Manufacturing process: </p><ol><li>  Before <span>sewing a pack skirt,</span> measure the waist circumference and cut the same length strip for the future belt from knitted fabric, making a small allowance for the seam.  The rectangle is cut two times the width of the future size of the belt. </li><li>  The length of the skirt is determined, its splendor will depend on this parameter.  Proceed directly to cutting. </li><li>  Six pieces of tulle are cut off, equal in width to the length of the bundle, and in length - twice the size of the belt.  In the same way, two more rectangles are cut from a denser tulle.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if the edges of the cut pieces are not too even, this will not be visible after the assembly of the tutu skirt. </li><li>  Start cutting out frills from light tulle.  The size should be 2.5 cm wide and the length should be five times the size of the belt.  Manually draw two pieces of light tulle and a frill, collecting them to the size of the belt. </li><li>  Then sew the parts of the skirt and ruffles.  This is done using a sewing machine, attaching a frill with an even stitch, retreating 2.5 cm from the lower edge of the light tulle. </li><li>  The next step is to pick up the remaining pieces and sew them neatly.  In the event that the sewing experience is small, it is recommended to pre-assemble the assembly, and then attach it to the typewriter.  All pieces should be equal to the length of the knit belt.  Layers are sewn to the belt gradually, retreating 5-7 mm from its lower edge.  If there is a shiny tulle, it can be sewn onto the topmost layer. </li><li>  Final action: the upper part of the belt is wrapped in such a way that the knitted fabric covers all layers of the sewn tulle, and a satin ribbon can be pulled in.  They sew a belt, put in a ribbon, and a do-it-yourself skirt-tutu is ready. </li></ol>
