    <h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  Typically, travelers staying on vacation in Lloret de Mar (Costa Brava) do this through the <span>airports of Barcelona,</span> Girona or Reus.  If you want to spend as little time as possible on the way to the hotel, then try to find a flight to Girona.  The airport of this city is only 30 kilometers from Lloret de Mar.  Thus, after landing, your journey to the hotel will take only 30-40 minutes.  Some tourists choose Barcelona as their arrival airport.  The distance from this air harbor to the center of Costa Brava spa life is 75 kilometers.  In this case, the journey will take you more than two hours.  If you are planning a trip to Spain on your own, without the help of a travel agency, the important factor will also be how you will get from the airport to the Selvamar 3 * hotel.  The most expensive, but simple and comfortable option is to order a transfer directly to the hotel, or hire a taxi.  You can also rent a car in the air harbor of both Barcelona and Girona.  If you want to save money, you can get to the hotel by bus (there is a well-established regular service between all the cities of Spain) or by train. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Selvamar 3 * (Costa Brava, Spain): photos and description </h2><p>  The three-star Selvamar Hotel was opened in 1988.

    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  As in other hotels around the world, the Spanish three-star Selvamar has a check-in and check-out time.  So, settling the staying tourists here is supposed to be after an hour of the day.  However, this is not a strict rule, and in case of your earlier arrival, the hotel will do everything possible so that you can stay in your booked room as soon as possible.  True, this is not always possible at the height of the tourist season, when the hotel is completely full.  In this case, you will have to wait until the previous guests have vacated the room, and then the maids will prepare it for new guests.  By the way, it is not necessary to sit in the hall next to your suitcases.  So, you can leave your things in the luggage compartment and go for a snack in the restaurant, refresh yourself with drinks in the bar, have a nice time by the pool or take a walk around the hotel and its surroundings.  As for the day of departure from Selvamar 3 * (Lloret de Mar, Spain), the occupied room should be vacated by 10 a.m.  At the same time, it is necessary to hand over the keys to the reception and pay for the entire stay in the hotel and use additional services.  If you have previously paid for the tour with your travel agency, then you only have to pay for additional services (if you resorted to them).  By the way, both cash and credit cards of payment systems such as Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Diners Club are accepted for payment at the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  Since the three-star hotel ‚ÄúSelvamar‚Äù is oriented to family tourists in many respects, guests who are on holidays with children of all ages are always welcome here.

But we offer to find out everything in detail. </p><p>  The main thing that tourists arriving at a particular hotel pay attention to is, of course, the room and the surrounding area.  In the case of the three-star Selvamar, almost all of our compatriots were quite satisfied with their rooms.  So, despite the fact that the furniture and appliances are already new, everything is in good and working condition.  The rooms themselves are compact, but clean, well decorated and comfortable.  The territory of the hotel, though small, but well-planned and well-groomed.  There is even a shady garden. </p><p>  The location of the hotel deserves attention.  So, being almost in the very center of Lloret de Mar, it is, nevertheless, removed from most noisy nightlife venues.  Thanks to this, here you can always relax in a relaxed atmosphere.  Especially this fact was appreciated by tourists who arrived on vacation with children, as well as elderly people. </p><p>  There were no complaints about the hotel‚Äôs food.
