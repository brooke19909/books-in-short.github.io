Fashionists of all ages give particular preference to t-shirts.  This garment can be bought at any store, market or mall.  But if you want a truly exclusive item, you need to know how to sew a T-shirt with your own hands.  This activity is very exciting and will require a little imagination and small needlework skills from you. </p><p>  <span>How to sew a</span> jersey <span>t-shirt</span> with a lowered shoulder line. </p><p>  To make a <span>simple model,</span> you need a piece of knitted fabric, threads of suitable tone, an overlock and a sewing machine.  Before stitching a T-shirt, you need to make a pattern on paper.  It will take a few measurements.  We need data on the volume of the chest, waist, hips and the length of the finished product. </p><p>  On a piece of paper whatman draw a rectangle, the sides of which correspond to the length of the product and chest circumference.  We add 4 centimeters on all sides for a free fit.  If the <span>chest</span> circumference <span>is smaller</span> than the hips, then we expand the bottom of the rectangle by the desired number of centimeters.  We lighten the pattern slightly, drawing smooth lines at the waist level.  Cut out the resulting <span>pattern t-shirts</span> and fold in half.  Draw the desired neckline and cut it out. </p><p>  Fold a piece of knitted fabric in half, directing the columns of thread from top to bottom.  We impose the finished pattern and fix with sewing needles.  We cut out the details, after which we remove the needles and remove the pattern.  Do not forget to add 1.5 centimeters to the seams and 4 centimeters to process the bottom.  We measure 20 centimeters along the side cut from the shoulder and put a mark.  This will be the armhole. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Using the overlock, we sew the shoulder and side seams.  If necessary, leave side cuts below.  In this case, we process 10 centimeters of the bottom of the side seams separately.  Next, we bend inwards along the centimeter of the fabric in the neck, side sections and armholes and bast.  We bend the bottom of the product by 2.5-3 centimeters and also fix it. </p><p>  Now we need a double needle sewing machine.  Having laid the t-shirt face up, we lay the finishing double stitch along all the folded parts of the product.  Our new thing is ready.  We iron the finished T-shirt and wear it with pleasure. </p><p>  How to sew a T-shirt with inserts of guipure or other elastic material. </p><p>  The manufacturing process of this model is a bit more complicated than the previous one.  In this case, use the finished pattern of a simple T-shirt from the magazine "Burda".  On the pattern we put the lines of the proposed inserts and cut the shelf and the back according to the drawn marks.  Remember that for a good fit of the finished product, the junction of the individual elements of the pattern must have straight sections.  On each side of all parts of the pattern we add 1.5 centimeters to the seams. </p><p>  Before stitching a T-shirt, you will need to assemble a shelf and back from separate parts.  We make all connecting seams on an overlock.  After that, iron the assembled parts and only after that we fold them with the front sides inward and sew the shoulder seams.  If your model requires sleeves, then we sew them in, and only after that we grind the side seam, simultaneously connecting the sleeve. </p><p>  We bend the bottom of the product, sleeves and neck.  We fix the fabric using needles.  We hem and well iron the finished product. </p><p>  To sew a T-shirt that will be unlike all the options offered at retail outlets, plug in a fantasy.  A special combination of several elastic fabrics, decorative trim with patches, appliqu√©s, print, rhinestone, beads or sequins, will give your product a special style and personality.  Using guipure will help emphasize the smooth curves of the figure and a special femininity. </p>
