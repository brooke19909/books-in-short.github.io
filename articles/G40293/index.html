How to make assassin weapons?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few people know that assassins are a whole ideological system among the Ismailis, and not just a computer game.  It still remains the main one for the company "Ubisoft", which at one time invented such a revolutionary gameplay.  What attracts attention in it?  Why do thousands of players acquire new parts over and over again?  This is due to the exciting and interesting plot, with a great atmosphere.  No less interesting is the weapon of the assassins.  It is worth getting acquainted with this current closer. </p><h2>  Real assassins </h2><p>  In fact, the assassins presented in the game are extremely far from the original. </p><p>  A stable legend lives in the world, supposedly assassins - this is such a medieval special forces of the Arab world, an analogue of the ninja from Japanese culture.  In fact, this is not so at all.  At its core, these killers are closer to kamikazes, and if we draw analogies with the world today, then ordinary suicide bombers.  Only the tasks they set themselves were different: not to scare the Gentiles, but to destroy a specific goal.  As a rule, immediately after this, the assassin died himself. </p><p>  The movement was organized in 1094.  Adherents of the son of Caliph al-Mustansir, led by the Persian Ismaili Zasan ibn Sabbah, announced that Abu Mansur Nizar is the ancestor of the invisible imam.  In the ranks of the assassins recruited young men who quickly turned into fanatics, able to give their lives for their chapter. </p><p>  Now similar communities are still preserved in some parts of the Earth.  They are mainly located in 20 countries. </p><p>  The basic knowledge about these warriors is given by the very first part of the Assassin Creed game.  In it, they still looked like their real colleagues, but later completely changed for the sake of the plot and entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="assassin weapons" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/663890.jpg" width="463"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In our world, assassins were like <span>knights' orders,</span> only from the Muslim world.  It included the Nizari Islamists.  Getting here was extremely difficult.  So there was a mystical idea of ​​this movement. </p><p>  The adherents of this movement gained wide fame thanks to their endless terror, which they arranged for the crusaders who came to their land.  However, unlike the open and honest battle that most Muslims preferred, the weapons of the assassins against the enemies were different.  A hidden blade that could hit the enemy anywhere and anytime was what these ancient killers used. </p><h2>  Raising Assassins </h2><p>  In order to create the perfect fighter, boys were recruited at a young age.  The Elder was engaged in the selection.  The boys grew in severity and starving.  A little matured youths were given the opportunity to find out <span>what luxury is.</span>  They were transferred to the Garden, where there was an abundance of appearances, fruits, and female bodies for comfort.  Future killers were drugged with hashish and preached their ideology, which was accepted as truth. </p><p>  The warriors ready for the fight lived together, had nothing of their own.  They waited their turn to become elected for the murder.  It is a great honor for them. </p><h2>  Game success </h2><p>  This whole topic was well presented in the first part of the game.  In addition, an excellent motivation appeared for the struggle of the Assassins and the Templars - the struggle for the sacred artifact, known as the "Apple of Eden."  The trademark Assassin Creed is a weapon in the form of a stylish hidden blade.  It was them who Altair hit his goals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the game really blossomed with the release of the second part.  For its time, it was a natural breakthrough.  As if wanting to show the importance of the numbers two, the assassins' weapons were doubled - Ezio Auditore, the main character, had two hidden blades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="assassin creed weapon" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/663891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Millions of players were captured by the adventures of the brave Italian and his struggle against the evil Templars.  "Assassin Creed 2" came out truly cult. </p><p>  Many believe that this is the best game in the series, which could not be surpassed in atmospheric, music and characters.  In the world created by Ubisoft, I want to return again and again, as if to an old, but good house every day. </p><p>  At the moment, the last game in the series is Assassin Creed: Unity.  The weapons in this part have not changed much, except that the hero began to use firearms more and more. </p><h2>  What did the assassins defeat </h2><p>  Assassin weapons deserve special attention.  It is worthwhile to figure out what the real Nizari Islamists fought for and how they killed their enemies.  If you plunge into a video game, you can see a huge selection of special unique devices. </p>

    <p>  For the goals set in reality, the assassins had a significant arsenal.  They had blades, daggers, knives, catars, swords and many other devices.  The hidden blade used in the game is not fiction either.  But still, with such diversity, the killers preferred the main weapon of the Assassins - this is a simple dagger.  You can’t imagine a more effective and faster tool.  Often, the assassins went on to complete the task irrevocably, because it was simply impractical to use complex weapons. </p><h2><strong></strong>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  One of the most famous assassin weapons in the game is a hidden blade.  He is a deadly retribution in the capable hands of the order.  And how to make an assassin’s weapon at home, let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  It works quite interestingly.  A ring is attached to one of the fingers, to which a thread is drawn.  She, in turn, clings to the spring.  As soon as the assassin correctly jerks a finger, the blade immediately jumps out of the bracers (part of the armor).  From there it appears with the help of a spring, and it is also pushed back. </p><p>  Such a thing allows you to perform many hidden actions, which is what the assassins use.  For example, you can approach the victim in the crowd and cut the throat with one touch, and in the meantime, the blade will instantly disappear in your hand. </p>

    <p>  For this we need a knife blade, gloves and <span>guides (ball).</span>  They should be similar to those in computer desks.  On such guides the little table for the keyboard leaves.  The blade must be long and the same <span>size as the</span> carriage.  They can be very easily combined using special glue, fasteners or adhesive tape.  There are holes on the guides.  A glove can be tied to them, which should be made of strong leather.  For an aesthetic and more warlike look, you can come up with various decorations.  Here it all depends solely on imagination. </p><p>  Except for the visual part, the blade is already completely ready.  It is thrown out due to a sharp wave of the hand.  Of course, this is not the original - it was activated using a complex system of springs.  In general, there are many ways to make a hidden blade.  But this one is the easiest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what weapon does the assassin have" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/666291.jpg"></div>

    <p>  However, it is worth remembering that it is illegal to walk along the street with such non-toy devices.  Officially, such blades and swords fall under the "cold weapon" class, because the "Templar hunt" can quickly end at the nearest police station. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What weapons does the assassin still have?  Yes, in fact, everything that can cause a mortal wound and lead to the <span>death of the</span> victim will be useful. </p><p>  There is a lot of fiction in the stories about these killers, so you should not believe video games.  Indeed, in fact, these warriors were far from noble fighters for justice - no, these are ordinary people, zombified by the idea. </p>
