Such a thing here may well become a reality.  After all, this hotel really differs in modest prices, as for the UAE.  However, he has many other advantages, which I would like to talk about in a little more detail. </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel, built in a modern style, was opened a little less than ten years ago, in 2007.  The hotel belongs to the fairly well-known Rotana chain.  What is worth knowing about her?  Perhaps a few facts.  The network was founded in 1991, and over 25 years it has become the most popular of all those that exist in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa.  It owns 44 different hotels.  And Fujairah Rotana Resort SPA al Aqah Beach is one of those. </p><p>  It is located on the shores of the Indian Ocean, in the emirate of Fujairah, very close to the beach.  In 3 minutes you can drive to the village of Dibba, which is one of the most important historical centers in the UAE.  It is also popular among divers.  So here there is really a very rich and diverse underwater world. </p><p>  The only negative is the airport is far away.  It is located about 55 kilometers from the hotel, in the capital of the emirate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  In terms of conditions, Fujairah Rotana Resort SPA al Aqah Beach is fully consistent with its declared level.  Inside, there is everything from 24-hour customer service and Wi-Fi to parking and transfer to the Dubai and Fujairah shopping centers (everything is free, of course). </p><p>  All conditions are created here for both leisure and work.  There are several conference and banqueting rooms, three meeting rooms and a small business center.  There is also a currency exchange office and an ATM in the lobby. </p>

The hotel service is excellent and that is a fact.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  The staff tries as much as possible to please the guests so that they are satisfied.  So, for example, if guests arrive late in the evening, then several plates of delicious food - eggs, rolls, vegetables, cheese and cold cuts - will be waiting for them in the room.  And at an early check-out, you will be presented with packed lunches with fruits, pastries, yoghurts and water. </p><p>  The cleaning is daily and of high quality.  Towels are also changing.  Cosmetic kits are also regularly replenished.  These include shampoos, shower gels and body lotions, sponges, hair conditioners, shower caps, ear sticks.  Everything is of excellent quality.  Like bathrobes, linen and towels - snow-white, fresh. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is ideal for people who want to relax as low as possible in the Emirates, where prices are high everywhere, but in this place are quite acceptable. </p>
