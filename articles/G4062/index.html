Then you will like this accessory.  How to decorate a hair band with your own hands?  To do this, you need a thick plastic base and a plain, lightweight material.  It is best to use silk or chiffon.  Round blanks need to be cut from the fabric.  The edges of the circles should be scorched with a lighter.  We take a thread and a needle and collect the center of the flower with a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam.  We tighten the workpiece.  The result should be a kind of flower.  Using this technology, you need to flash all the blanks.  When the preparatory work is done, you can begin to manufacture a hair band.  Glue the flowers to a plastic base.  Glue the blanks so that they fit snugly against each other.

Then you need to look at this version of the hair band.  To make it, you will need wire and nail polish.  We begin the creative process by creating blanks.  Flowers are made as follows.  Take wire and any pen or other cylindrical shape.  Wind the wire around it and twist it.  As a result, you should get a petal.  By analogy on one flower you need to make 4-5 petals.  Make flowers of different sizes.  When the workpieces are done, you can start painting them.  Take nail polish in two colors.  Apply a thin layer alternately on each petal.  You can make flowers monophonic, and you can create unique color combinations.  Similarly, you need to colorize all the blanks.  Take a thin metal bezel that will protrude the base.  Alternately, you need to attach to the base of the workpiece.  Alternate flowers of different sizes and colors.  A hair band with flowers will look presentable if you add beads and rhinestones as a decor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Band rim </h2><p>  Do you like not only beautiful, but also comfortable things?  Then this hair band is for you.  How to make it?  You need to pick up two contrasting ribbons and a long metal chain or a thread with beads.  Getting to the manufacture of the rim.  Elastic band for hair will be the starting point for the product.  We tie all three components to the knot.  Weave a thin braid from ropes and chains.  The product must be periodically applied to the head in order to approximately orient in its size.  When it seems to you that the bezel is finished, tie all the ends of the ribbons to the other side of the elastic band.  The bezel is ready.  With this product, you can clean your hair daily, or you can use the bezel as a thing to fix your hair during sports.  If you want to make something more feminine, you can replace one of the ribbons with a lace cut. </p><h2>  Wire rim </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire bezel" class="if uuid-2451047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2451047.jpg"></div><p>  Such an accessory looks very solemn.  For every day it does not fit.  But such a decoration will look good on the head of the bride or graduate.  How to make a hair band with your own hands?  To make this craft, you will need a coil of silver wire and large beads.  You can use natural pebbles or replace them with plastic ones.  The rim will be created on the principle of trees that are woven from beads.  So, if you have already done such crafts, you can use the familiar scheme.  Take the bead and put it on the wire.  Now do 5-6 inoculations.  Put one more bead on one of the ends and again reinforce it with interlacing, but this time they should be done no more than 3-4.  Twist the two ends of the wire together.  You got a part with two branches.  Similarly, you can make blanks with 5-6 branches.  When you have a lot of workpieces, you can start creating the foundation.  Wind the harnesses on top of each other, periodically removing the already strengthened parts, so as not to create excess thickness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  D&amp;G style bezel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.stylemotivation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rhinestone bezel" class="if uuid-2451051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2451051.jpg"></div><p>  A similar accessory is suitable for both girls and women.  In this rim, you can go to the cinema, on a date or to meet friends.  How to make a stylish accessory?  For its manufacture you will have to find a wide plastic base.  Degrease it and proceed to the decor.  You need to fill the space with flowers, rhinestones and large beads.  Arrange the flowers in the center of the rim.  Surround them with one row of beads, and decorate the sidewalls of the rim with rhinestones.  Does this decoration option seem too simple to you?  You can draw a sketch more complicated.  For example, create an ornament from beads or semicircular rhinestones.  For this purpose, baroque analogues are ideally suited.  In a similar technique, it is easy to repeat the pattern of sea waves or frosty patterns.  If you have large decorative details, place them in the center.  Otherwise, they will strongly cling to the hair. </p><h2>  Lace bezel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.stylemotivation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lace headband" class="if uuid-2451057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2451057.jpg"></div><p>  Do you like headbands?  You can make such an accessory for yourself.  A photo of the hair band is presented above.  Delicate decoration will help to make any image feminine and romantic.  Where to start the manufacturing process?  With the choice of material.  It is advisable to use a tight lace, which over time does not rub and does not tear.  Buy a piece woven manually by craftsmen, or tie a small ribbon with a crochet or knitting needles.  Do not use leftover curtains or nightgowns.  Such lace will look cheap.  When you have decided on the material, bend it several times so that you get a thin tourniquet.  In this position, you can fix the lace with the help of threads.  Take another small piece of the same material and grab the bandage in the middle.  Thus it will turn out to create a semblance of a bow.  You can decorate the accessory with rhinestones or large beads. </p><h2>  Headband with a branch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bezel" class="if uuid-2451072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2451072.jpg"></div><p>  Many accessories look stylish thanks to catchy decorative details.  Therefore, if you want to do an elaborate thing, then make a semblance of a branch, and then glue it to a plastic or metal billet.  How to make an interesting branch?  To create it, you will need a wire of two different diameters.  From a thick metal wire you need to assemble the frame.  Make sheets first.  Make an oval, and then sharpen both edges with pliers.  Attach the sheets to the base branch.  To make the central axis stronger, roll two pieces of wire into a bundle.  You can decorate the branch with large beads.  Fix them on a less thick wire, and then attach them to the center of the branch.  It remains to duplicate the sheets.  Cut them out of capron, tulle or any other translucent fabric.  If the material of your choice does not keep its shape, fill it with hair spray.  Attach the workpieces to the branch using a hot gun.  It remains to fix the decorative part on the rim. </p><h2>  Feather headband </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zszywka.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="feather headband" class="if uuid-2451074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2451074.jpg"></div><p>  In summer, do you go to your grandmother in the village?  Do not waste time in vain.  Pick up feathers from birds.  From them you can make stylish accessories.  How to make a headband for hair?  From feathers of the same size you will need to make a composition.  Take acrylic paint and brush the feathers in gold color.  You can paint over the blanks from the spray can, but look carefully so that the paint layer is thin.  Otherwise, the pen will stick together and become a shapeless mass.  It is advisable to choose long feathers for the manufacture of the product.  But if there are none, you can use small ones, for example, chicken.  While the workpieces are dry, paint over the base.  We tint the bezel in golden color.  Feathers should be attached to a hot gun.  Place parts in one direction with a good overlap on each other.  The accessory does not need additional accessories, but if you wish, you can decorate the rim with beads and rhinestones. </p>
