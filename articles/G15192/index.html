    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there were some negative moments at the Lykia World Antalya &amp; Links Golf 5 * hotel.  Reviews about this place contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  not very good quality of cleaning the rooms, and the adjoining terrace is not even swept; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel was renovated relatively recently, the tiles are already falling off in the rooms and the wallpaper is peeling off; </li><li>  the beach is very dirty, all strewn with cigarette butts, pieces of paper and bottles; </li><li>  children's menu leaves much to be desired (dishes are tough and highly seasoned); </li><li>  you will have to drive at least 30 kilometers to the nearest city, and in those few shops that are located on and around, the prices are just cosmic; </li><li>  instead of one double bed, two shifted ones await you; </li><li>  there is no pan in the shower, but a hole in the floor acts as a drain, which passes water very slowly; </li><li>  the tiled floor in the bathroom is very slippery, especially when bathing; </li><li>  the air conditioner turns on according to the schedule, and therefore most of the time in the room is unbearable heat; </li><li>  the essence of the design decision to make transparent doors in the bathroom and the window between the bathroom and the bedroom is not entirely clear (it‚Äôs good that at least latches are provided for those who do not like such frankness); </li><li>  on the territory of the hotel there are very few tall trees and canopies, in the shade of which one could hide from the sun; </li><li>  few sunbeds by the pool; </li><li>  the number of tables in the restaurant does not match the number of guests, and therefore you have to come to the dining room very early if you want to take a seat. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the resort </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the territory of the Lykia World &amp; Links Golf Antalya 5 * hotel.     ,        .        .          ,    ,        .     ,     .   ,      . ,   ,  ,      .       ,       , ,       . </p><p>       Lykia World Antalya &amp; Links Golf 5*.      ,        .        ,          ,    . ,       ,      16 ,   ,     ,    . - ,     ,   . </p><p>       (   ).  ,       ,       .    ,   .       .    ,     .  ,        ,    .       ,         ,        . </p>
