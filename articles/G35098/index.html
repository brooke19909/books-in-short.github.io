  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to play bowling in Khimki</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bowling is a game whose main goal is for the smallest number of attempts to knock down 5, 9 or 10 (depending on the variety) balls with special balls, lined with a triangle at the end of the track. </p><p>  Today it is one of the most popular sports games in the world.  On a professional level, bowling is played in the USA, Japan, Russia and other countries. </p><p>  Going to a bowling club with friends can be a great option for spending the evening after work or a weekend.  For example, in the city of Khimki near Moscow, several large institutions are open where you can play this game. </p><h2>  rules </h2><p>  The rules of bowling are relatively simple, and even a child can understand them - that is why the game is popular not only among athletes, but also loved by ordinary people.  In addition, bowling does not require any special physical preparation and special equipment.  All you need is special shoes. </p><p>  Almost everyone knows what a strike is.  However, it is not necessary to knock down all the pins with one ball.  If you do this with two throws (sper), for one frame you can get as many points as for a strike. </p><p>  Most often, in amateur bowling after two throws (exactly so many attempts to knock out all the pins of each player in one frame), figures still remain on the track.  In this case, the frame is called open.  The amount of points depends on how many pins were hit. </p><p>  The number of points depends on subsequent throws.  Playing bowling with 10 pins, for one batch you can get a maximum of 300 points if you beat exclusively strikes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bowling in Khimki: "Space" </h2><p>  Entertainment complex "Cosmos" is located in the Lev Tolstoy Park of Culture and Leisure at 2B Leninsky Prospekt.
