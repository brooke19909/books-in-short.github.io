Traveling through it, you can discover not only wonderful cities, but also no less beautiful and interesting medieval villages.  In this state, so many medieval villages have been preserved in perfect condition in perfect condition that it is difficult to somehow compare and arrange them in descending order of their beauty.  It should be noted that many of them are included in the list of the association, which gathered the most beautiful villages (more than 150 small settlements). </p><p>  Traveling in France is a great pleasure.  The French take care of their nature, decorate their streets and houses with picturesqueness.  They have a lot to learn. </p><h2>  Association briefly </h2><p>  This association was created in 1982 with the aim of developing tourism in small picturesque French communes with a rich cultural heritage. </p><p>  Criteria for joining the association of the most beautiful villages in France: </p><ul><li>  the population should not exceed 2,000 inhabitants; </li><li>  the village must have at least two objects or two protected areas (legendary or picturesque places of historical, scientific or artistic interest); </li><li>  approval of the request for admission to the association by the municipal council is necessary. </li></ul><p>  In addition to all this, it is taken into account that there is a landscape conservation policy that restricts the construction of various structures.  It is designed to preserve the pristine and aesthetic appearance of the village.  Of course, such a policy can restrain the development of the economy of this area, but it guarantees a settlement that is on this list a continuous flow of tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Below are some of the most beautiful French villages. </p><h2>  La Rock-Gageac </h2><p>  A village is located in the region of New Aquitaine on the banks of the Dordogne River.  Tard Castle (15th century), the ruins of the castle of Bishops of Sarlat and the castle of Malatry have survived to this day. </p><p>  There is also a wonderful botanical garden with exotic plants growing in it, including bamboo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lapelonie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Roc Gageac Village" class="if uuid-3069000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3069000.jpg"></div><h2>  Rikvir </h2><p>  This village is located in the heart of the vineyards of Alsace (a historical region of the north-east of France).  A village appeared in the XII-XVI centuries. </p><p>  This amazing fabulous place with fun-colored fancy houses and cobbled streets looks almost the same as it did 4 centuries ago.  This is one of the most beautiful villages in France.  Wine trade still thrives here.  A huge number of tourists come to this area not only to admire its beauty, but also to taste a wide variety of wines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riquewihr Village" class="if uuid-3067976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3067976.jpg"></div><h2>  Gerberua </h2><p>  Another charming village with magnificent houses and narrow cobbled streets appeared in the XVII-XVIII centuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once, Henri le Sidaner (post-impressionist artist), this village seemed very nice, and he bought a house in it.  Then he created a beautiful rose garden on his site, and subsequently this hobby became one of the most important areas of Gerberua.  Here, almost all gardens and houses are decorated with wisteria and curly wonderful roses.  An annual rose festival is held in this village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.robertharding.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village Gerberua" class="if uuid-3067987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3067987.jpg"></div><h2>  Vel le Rose </h2><p>  This amazingly beautiful seaside village is one of the oldest.  It has been populated since the 4th century.  Vel-le-Roses is highly regarded as one of the most beautiful corners of Normandy (a historical region of the north-west of France). </p><p>  One of the most beautiful villages in France is located on the banks of the Vel river, winding between water mills and old houses with unusual thatched roofs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of Vel-les-Roses" class="if uuid-3067993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3067993.jpg"></div><h2>  Peorug </h2><p>  This small town is located a few kilometers from the city of Lyon (northeast), in the most central part of the Rhone-Alpes region.  Previously, it had the status of a city that became famous for its prosperity at the end of the medieval period of the wine industry. </p><p>  The ancient buildings of the commune of Peruges are so well preserved that today they are used as scenery for many historical films. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themostbeautifulplacesineurope.files.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village of P√©ruge" class="if uuid-3068016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3068016.jpg"></div><h2>  Cologne La Rouge </h2><p>  This picturesque corner stands out among many of the most beautiful villages in France with its unusual architecture.  Almost all the houses were built of red local sandstone.  In the summer, the combination of such red houses against the background of bright and lush vegetation of the fields is an amazing picture for the eyes. </p><p>  In the very central part of the village is the church of St. Peter, built in the Romanesque style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sv.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cologne La Rouge Village" class="if uuid-3068022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3068022.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Away from the long-trodden tourist routes, there are medieval picturesque villages with ancient houses and fortified walls, with narrow quaint cobbled streets.  In the charming corners of the country hides a more traditional France, rarely found in large cities (Lyon, Paris).  Many small villages in France are surrounded by beautiful nature, seas, rivers and mountain peaks. </p><p>  Popular bus tours to France and other European cities (including Moscow) include in their routes a visit to a small picturesque French village, completely built of red sandstone.  This is Cologne-La-Rouge.  It was in this village that the same association was created, uniting the most amazingly beautiful corners throughout France, meeting the requirements of preserving the architecture of antiquity and general harmony. </p>
