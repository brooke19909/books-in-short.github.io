    <h2>  How many people died in the Afghan war? </h2><p>  According to official figures, about 15 thousand Soviet soldiers did not return home from Afghanistan to the USSR.  So far, 273 people are listed as missing.  Over 53 thousand soldiers were wounded and shell-shocked.  The losses in the Afghan war are enormous for our country.  Many veterans believe that the Soviet leadership made a big mistake by getting involved in this conflict.  How many lives could be saved if their decision was different. </p><p>  There is still a debate about how many people died in the Afghan war.  After all, the official figure does not take into account the pilots who died in the sky, who transported goods, soldiers returning home, and came under fire, nurses and nurses caring for the wounded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Afghan war 1979-1989 </h2><p>  On December 12, 1979, a meeting of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee decided to send Russian troops to Afghanistan.  They have been located in the country since December 25, 1979 and were supporters of the government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.  Troops were deployed to prevent the threat of military intervention from other states.  The decision to help Afghanistan from the USSR was made after numerous requests from the leadership of the republic. </p><p>  Conflict erupted between the opposition (Dushmans, or Mujahideen) and the armed forces of the Government of Afghanistan.  The parties could not share political control over the territory of the republic.  A number of European countries, Pakistani secret services and the US military during the hostilities supported the Mujahideen.  They also provided them with the supply of ammunition. </p><p>  The Soviet troops were deployed in three directions: Khorog - Fayzabad, Kushka - Shindad - Kandahar and Termez - Kunduz - Kabul.  The airfields of Kandahar, Bagram and Kabul took the Russian landing. </p>

    <h2>  Heroism of a Soviet soldier </h2><p>  The heroes of the Afghan war are probably known to many citizens of Russia.  I heard everything about their brave exploits.  The history of the war in Afghanistan has many courageous and heroic deeds.  How many soldiers and officers bore the hardships and deprivations of hostilities, and how many of them returned to their homeland in zinc coffins!  All of them proudly call themselves Afghan warriors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Every day the bloody events in Afghanistan are becoming more and more distant from us.  Unforgettable heroism and courage of Soviet soldiers.  They earned the gratitude of the Afghan people and the respect of the Russians, fulfilling their <span>military duty</span> to the Fatherland.  And they did it selflessly, as required by a military oath.  For the heroic deeds and courage, the Soviet wars were awarded high state awards, many of them posthumously. </p>

    <h2>  In the lists of awarded </h2><p>  Over two hundred thousand military personnel received <span>awards</span> and medals of the USSR, of which 11 thousand were posthumous.  86 people received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, 28 of them did not know about him, since the award came too late. </p><p>  In the ranks of the heroes of the Afghans there are representatives of different branches of the army: tankers, paratroopers, motorized riflemen, aviators, sappers, signalmen, etc. The fearlessness of our soldiers in extreme conditions speaks of their professionalism, endurance and patriotism.  The feat of the hero, who covered his commander with his chest in battle, cannot leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  We remember, we are proud ... </h2><p>  The heroes of the Afghan war are not very willing to recall the events of the war years.  They probably do not want to stir up the old wounds that are still bleeding, it is only worth touching.  I would like to single out at least some of them, because the feat should be immortalized in years.  The dead soldiers in the Afghan war deserve to be talked about. </p><p>  Private N. Ya. Afinogenov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union posthumously.  He covered the retreat of his colleagues in carrying out an important combat mission.  When he ran out of ammunition, with the last grenade he destroyed himself and the souls who were nearby.  Sergeants N. Chepnik and A. Mironenko did the same when they were surrounded. </p><p>  Dozens more such examples of self-sacrifice can be cited.  The solidarity of Soviet soldiers, military mutual assistance, and the solidarity of commanders and subordinates cause particular pride. </p><p>  Private Yuri Fokin died trying to save the wounded commander.  The soldier simply covered it with his body, not allowing it to die.  Guard Private Yuri Fokin posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Star.  The soldier G. Komkov performed an identical feat. </p><p>  The desire, at the cost of his life, to comply with the commander‚Äôs order, to secure his comrade, to preserve military honor - this is the basis of all the heroic actions of our soldiers in Afghanistan.  The current defenders of the Motherland have someone to take an example from.  How many of our guys died in the Afghan war!  And each of them deserves the title of hero. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  The history of the Afghan war is tragic.  The April Revolution took place in Afghanistan in 1978, as a result of which the People‚Äôs Democratic Party came to power.  The government proclaimed the country a democratic republic.  M.N. Taraki took the post of head of state and prime minister.  X. Amin was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. </p><p>  On July 19, Afghan authorities proposed that the USSR introduce two Soviet divisions in case of emergency.  Our government made small concessions to resolve this issue.  It suggested in the coming days to send one special battalion and helicopters with Soviet crews to Kabul. </p><p>  On October 10, the Afghan authorities officially announced the sudden death of Taraki from a severe incurable disease.  Later it turned out that the head of state was strangled by officers of the presidential guard.  The persecution of supporters of Taraki.  The civil war in Afghanistan actually began in November 1979. </p>

    <h2>  The decision to send troops to Afghanistan </h2><p>  The deceased head of state Taraki wanted to replace a more progressive figure.  Therefore, after his death, <span>Babrak Karmal</span> became the post <span>.</span> </p><p>  On December 12, after coordinating his actions with the commission of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, Brezhnev decided to provide military assistance to Afghanistan.  December 25, 1979 at 15.00 Moscow time began the introduction of our troops in the republic.  It should be noted that the role of the USSR in the Afghan war is enormous, as the Soviet units provided feasible support to the Afghan army. </p><h2>  The main reasons for the failure of the Russian army </h2><p>  At the beginning of the war, luck was on the side of the Soviet troops, proof of this is the Panjshir operation.  The main trouble for our units was the moment when the Stinger missiles were delivered to the mujahideen, which easily hit the target from a considerable distance.  The Soviet military did not have the equipment capable of hitting these missiles in flight.  As a result of using the Stinger, Mujahideen shot down several of our military and transport aircraft.  The situation changed only when the Russian army managed to get a few rockets in their hands. </p><h2>  Change of power </h2><p>  In March 1985, power in the USSR changed, the presidency passed to M. S. Gorbachev.  His appointment has significantly changed the situation in Afghanistan.  The question immediately arose that the Soviet troops would leave the country in the near future, and even some steps were taken to implement this. </p><p>  A change of power also took place in Afghanistan: B. Najibullah took the place of B. Karmal.  The gradual withdrawal of Soviet units began.  But even after this, the struggle of the Republicans and Islamists has not stopped and continues to this day.  However, for the USSR, the history of the Afghan war ended there. </p>

    <h2>  The main reasons for the outbreak of hostilities in Afghanistan </h2><p>  The situation in Afghanistan was never considered calm due to the republic being in a geopolitical region.  The main rivals wishing to have influence in this country were at one time the Russian Empire and Great Britain.  In 1919, the Afghan authorities declared independence from England.  Russia, in turn, was one of the first to recognize the new country. </p><p>  In 1978, Afghanistan received the status of a democratic republic, followed by new reforms, but not everyone wanted to accept them.  So the conflict between the Islamists and the Republicans developed, which as a result led to a civil war.  When the leadership of the republic realized that they themselves could not cope, it began to ask for help from its ally, the USSR.  After some hesitation, the Soviet Union decided to send its troops to Afghanistan. </p><h2>  Book of Memory </h2><p>  Farther and farther away from us is the day when the last units of the USSR left the lands of Afghanistan.  This war has left a deep indelible mark in the history of our country, drenched in blood.  Thousands of young people who had not yet had time to see the lives of the children did not return home.  How scary and painful it is to remember.  What were all these sacrifices for? </p><p>  Hundreds of thousands of Afghan warriors underwent serious trials in this war, and not only did not break, but also showed such qualities as courage, heroism, devotion and love for the motherland.  Their fighting spirit was unshakable, and they passed this fierce war with dignity.  Many were injured and treated in military hospitals, but not even the most experienced doctor can cure the main wounds that have remained in the soul and still bleed.  In the eyes of these people, their comrades bled and died, dying a painful death from wounds.  The Afghan warriors have only the eternal memory of their dead friends. </p><p>  The book of memory of the Afghan war was created in Russia.  It commemorates the names of heroes who fell in the territory of the republic.  In each region there are separate Books in Memory of the soldiers who served in Afghanistan, in which heroes who died in the Afghan war are listed by name.  Pictures from which young beautiful guys are looking at us make our heart contract with pain.  After all, none of these boys are already alive.  "In vain the old woman is waiting for her son to go home ...", - these words from the time of World War II have been engraved in the memory of every Russian and make his heart contract.  So may the eternal memory of the heroes of the Afghan war remain, which these truly sacred Books of Memory will refresh. </p>
