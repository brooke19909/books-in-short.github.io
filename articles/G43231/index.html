Leisure here is very diverse.  Apparently, it was for this that travelers chose this small town on the Aegean coast.  The tourist season in Marmaris is much shorter than, for example, in Antalya.  It rains here in October, and in the winter months the thermometer does not rise above +15 degrees.  But even at this time in Marmaris can be quite warm and sunny days.  Therefore, some resort hotels receive guests year-round. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris Begonville Hotel 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2065900.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  This resort on the Turkish coast of the Aegean Sea became popular among Russian tourists just a few years ago.  But Europeans have chosen Marmaris for a long time.  High quality service is offered by all hotels in this resort.  They can be located both near the sea or in the city center, and on elevations in the mountains. </p><p>  Among the hotels there are different options: modest small and relatively cheap, luxurious complexes with a huge territory - here, every tourist can choose an option based on their wealth and preferences.  The most popular are four-star hotel complexes, built near the coastline.  One of them is Begonville Beach Hotel 4 * (Marmaris).  This hotel will be discussed in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  <span>Begonville Beach Hotel 4 *</span> (Turkey, Marmaris) is located on the seashore.  The resort center is only one kilometer, which can be easily overcome with a walking step.  This is where many entertainment venues are located. </p><p>  The nearest international air gate is ninety-five kilometers away.  Transfer from the airport lasts about an hour and a half.  Bar Street Marmaris and the city beach are within walking distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris Begonville Hotel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2065901.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This hotel was formerly called the Marmaris <span>Begonville Hotel.</span>  3 years ago a major renovation was carried out here.  Repair of the building and all infrastructure facilities was made.  The name of the hotel has also changed.  Since 2014, he has been featured in travel agencies as the Begonville Beach Hotel 4 * (Marmaris). </p><p>  It is built on a relatively small area - a little more than a thousand square meters.  Nevertheless, many basic infrastructures fit on it. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are a city bazaar and many shops.  The hotel does not have its own parking.  Guests can use the public parking, free of charge. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Marmaris Begonville Hotel 4 *, according to Russian reviews, is a hotel with an excellent ratio of the cost of living and the quality of the service provided.  Our compatriots consider its main advantage proximity to the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After a thorough renovation, the hotel looks quite modern.  Despite the small area, its very well-groomed territory is everywhere planted with flowers, covered with a soft lawn cover. </p><p>  Marmaris Begonville Hotel consists of one six-story building with an elevator.  There is mail in the lobby.  The reception and lobby are practically combined.  Sitting on comfortable sofas and armchairs, guests can comfortably wait for check-in. </p><p>  The reviews of our countrymen suggest that this hotel is primarily intended for lovers of "hanging out", so too large a hotel area in this case is not relevant.  Tourists can walk to the center of Marmaris in about twenty minutes along the beautiful promenade.  There is a bus stop near the hotel.  From here, buses depart literally to any place in the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Begonville Beach Hotel 4 Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2065899.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As for the services provided, the hotel guests can take their clothes to the laundry room, consult a doctor if necessary.  Of course, all this is not included in the price.  These are paid services, as well as the use of a built-in safe in the rooms and their maintenance.  On the ground floor of the building near the registration desk there is fast Internet.  A free shuttle leaves the hotel daily, which takes tourists to the equipped Nirvana Beach in Icmeler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Policies Marmaris Begonville Hotel </h2><p>  Check-in is scheduled for three in the afternoon.

Since 2014, after the renovation, the hotel has been a four-star hotel, however, some tour operators still position it as a three-star Marmaris Begonville Hotel (3 *).  Marmaris is a resort where the category of a hotel determines little.  Here in the ‚Äúkopeck piece‚Äù you can get a fairly high-quality service, and in luxury hotel complexes.  Therefore, many tourists pay attention primarily to reviews, and not to the "stardom" of the hotel. </p><h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  Marmaris Begonville Hotel is considered average in terms of housing.  It has only sixty rooms in the following categories: standard with garden view, as well as standard and premium with sea view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Begonville Beach Hotel 4 Turkey Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2065905.jpg"></div>

For children, the hotel's infrastructure includes a playground and a mini club.  A babysitting service is available upon request.  Of course, it is not included in the price.  In addition, parents can get a cot in the room for children under six years of age for free.  There is no special menu at the hotel for the smallest. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Living in the Marmaris Begonville Hotel in the evenings, you can stroll along the promenade and the narrow streets of the old city, if you wish, you can climb to the Suleiman the Magnificent Fortress to look at ancient sculptures.  In addition, the hotel‚Äôs tour desk offers many guided tours to other local attractions. </p><p>  In the center of Marmaris, a market runs every Thursday.  Here you can inexpensively buy products directly from manufacturers.  Judging by the reviews of tourists from Russia, many of them just went to the bazaar to feel the real oriental flavor. </p><h2>  Description of the beach area </h2><p>  The hotel has its own swimming area.  Before her, about two minutes walk at a slow pace.  The beach is fully equipped: it has sun loungers and umbrellas, which are provided to residents free of charge.  Judging by the reviews, the sea is very clean.  The beach is cleaned twice a day.  In the mornings and evenings, the water in the sea is especially clear.  The beach is sandy in some places, at the very edge there is a pebble strip two meters wide.  Therefore, the presence of rubber bathing slippers for tourists of this hotel is relevant.  If you wish, you can go to another beach - in Icmeler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Begonville Hotel 3 Turkey Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2065897.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel has a small outdoor pool, as well as a small branch - "paddling pool" for bathing children.  If it seems to tourists that the beach is too hot, they are conveniently placed on sun loungers in the shade of palm trees.  Judging by the reviews of some Russians, they liked the pool even more.  The sun terrace is large enough, so there are always a lot of free sunbeds.  The pool itself is clean, with very comfortable steps to enter the water.  The hotel also has a cinema and relaxation room, a wellness center and a spa.  A visit to the Turkish bath and a reflex massage course can be obtained for a fee. </p><h2>  Marmaris Begonville Beach Hotel 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  In general, tourists from Russia liked this hotel.  The rooms were always clean, the maids cleaned them every day.  The food is also good, although there are some problems with the variety of dishes.  Most often, Turkish kyuft cutlets and chicken are present on the trays.  There are many salads and greens that tourists can season to taste with mayonnaise, vegetable oil or yogurt.  The side dishes serve potatoes, pasta and stewed vegetables.  Once a week, fish and liver appear on the trays.  A lot of fruits and sweets of different kinds.  And although the food is not very diverse, nevertheless, as our compatriots write, it is quite tasty and satisfying.  Especially a lot of enthusiastic reviews about the cakes, which the Turks call "gozleme".  This, according to almost everything, is a real alliance.  And all that they lacked in food, the Russians bought at the market or in supermarkets.  The staff at Marmaris Begonville Hotel speaks good English, and some even speak Russian.  All employees are friendly and good-natured.  Many of our countrymen especially note the convenient location of the hotel.  One minus is a small territory, however, few vacationers spend all day on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris Begonville Hotel 3 Turkey Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2065898.jpg"></div>
