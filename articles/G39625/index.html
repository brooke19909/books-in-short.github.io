It is on its territory that absolutely dissimilar unique <span>climatic complexes are located.</span>  This explains the difference in weather conditions in the region.  It depends not only on the time of year, but also on the territorial zone. </p><h2>  Climate features </h2><p>  Near the very center of the Asian mainland is the Altai Republic.  The climate here is sharply continental.  And this is due not only to the location of the area, but also to its significant remoteness from the oceans (to a huge water layer - not one thousand kilometers), as well as some other factors. </p>

This causes a significant fluctuation in temperature during the year.

And this is due to the very difficult terrain.  Fluctuations in heights in the republic range from 350 to 4500 meters.  Thus, the formation of vertical climatic zonality occurs.  At the same time, they distinguish: </p><p>  - areas of low mountain climate (up to the mark of 500-600 meters); <br>  - zones of mid-mountain climate, located from 500 to 1500 m and above; <br>  - areas of domination of the high mountain climate (from 2000 m). </p><p>  The north-eastern and north-western, south-eastern and central <span>Altai climates</span> are different.  And this feature exists due to differences in relief.  It is a diverse landscape that contributes to a varying degree of nighttime air cooling in valleys, hollows, and mountain slope lines. </p>

    <p>  The highest ranges are located in the southeast and south of the region.  In the north, the terrain is somewhat lower and opens the way for the passage of the Arctic masses. </p><p>  In addition, <span>mountains (Altai)</span> influence the nature of moisture <span>.</span>  The climate from the western slopes of the ranges is characterized by a significant amount of precipitation.  The fact is that the mountain slopes block the path of moist air coming from the western seas.  On the eastern slopes of the ranges, the picture is completely different.  Humid air does not enter here.  That is why arid climate prevails in the area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Air flow </h2><p>  Important factors influencing climate formation in Altai are: </p><p>  - masses of continental Arctic air, capable of reaching the internal territory of the republic throughout the year; </p><p>  - moist and warm air currents coming from the Atlantic; </p><p>  - south and southwest winds; </p><p>  - local cyclones arising due to the mountainous terrain; </p><p>  - fan-shaped air flows. </p><p>  As a rule, it is the western air currents that influence the formation of weather in the Altai Republic.

    <p>  Winter in Altai lasts from three to five months.  This applies to river valleys, as well as low and middle mountains.  Winter is especially severe in the intermountain plains.  This is due to stagnation of cold air masses.  For example, the average January temperature in the Chui steppe reaches almost thirty-two degrees below zero, but the southern tip of Lake Teletskoye boasts a milder winter.  Here the thermometer shows only eight degrees of frost. </p><p>  In the Altai intermontane basins under the influence of high atmospheric pressure, temperature inversions are observed.  They are caused by ‚Äúrolling‚Äù heavy cold air into the plains.  In this case, with increasing height, the air temperature rises.  Such "cold lakes" have significant differences depending on their location.  So, in the case of a moist closed valley at the top it can be 10-15 degrees warmer.  But a similar phenomenon is observed only at night.  In the morning, the sun's rays warm the air masses.  They rise and the inversion is destroyed. </p>

    <h2>  Climatic oases </h2><p>  During the winter period in Altai, one can observe very interesting weather phenomena.  In most mountain valleys, peculiar climatic oases arise.  In these zones, winds constantly blow, there are no severe frosts, and there is no stable snow cover.  These phenomena are especially pronounced in the valleys of such rivers as Katun and Chulyshman. </p><p>  The most climate-friendly region of Altai is the shores of Lake Teletskoye.  This fact confirms the air temperature in neighboring valleys.  It can be ten to fifteen degrees lower.  Here, during this period, complete calmness reigns supreme.  The reason for such an unusual phenomenon, as climatic oases, is the "hair dryer".  So called warm and dry wind.  It arises due to the pressure difference in the territory of Gorny Altai in the winter.  On our planet, it is impossible to find another such area where the "hairdryers" would have such a significant impact on climate formation. </p><h2>  Warm season </h2><p>  What is the climate in Altai in the summer?  Spring in the region does not last long.  Already in April, positive air mass temperatures were observed.  However, during this period, often the southwest winds from Central Asia were replaced by cold Arctic masses.  Therefore, spring weather is notable for its instability. </p>

    <p>  Summer in the mountainous regions of the Altai Republic is cool.  Here the air temperature does not rise due to the significant height of the ridges, the presence of eternal snows and glaciers.  Numerous cold lakes and rivers also influence it.  Moreover, the thermometer column falls when climbing into the mountains at a half degree degree for every one hundred meters of height.  Coolest at elevations exceeding 1000 meters.  So, at an average temperature of sixteen to eighteen degrees above zero in low mountains and mid mountains, at heights of more than two thousand meters, the thermometer column stops at around 10 degrees.  The hottest summers in the Altai Territory can be observed in the intermontane basins.  Here the air warms up to thirty-thirty-five degrees. </p><h2>  Precipitation and wind </h2><p>  In the summer, the Altai Territory is dominated by western and northwestern air mass flows.  They bring a large amount of moisture to this area, which is left in the <span>form of precipitation</span> at altitudes exceeding 1000-2000 meters.  Most often it rains on the western slopes of the ranges.  The highest rainfall is received by such elevations as Yuzhno-Chuyskaya, Katunskaya and Severo-Chuyskaya.  Here falls from 2000 to 2500 millimeters during the year.  More moisture remains in the <span>Belukha mountain</span> region <span>.</span>  Here, up to 3000 millimeters of precipitation falls annually.  In the midlands, there is less rain, only 500-600 millimeters.  More rains occur in the second half of summer.  Maximum precipitation falls in the month of July. </p><h2>  Unique natural area </h2><p>  Altai Territory is an amazing place.  Here, in the central part of the continent, at the junction of various natural zones, away from the oceans, nature created a unique edge of high cliffs and blue lakes, dry steppes and impenetrable taiga, as well as rich and extensive meadows.  The emergence of such a variety of microclimatic conditions was facilitated by the complex arrangement of mountain ranges, dissection of the relief, and significant height fluctuations.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Altai Territory is just over 167 thousand square kilometers.  And this relatively small space immediately contained six natural zones, namely, the tundra and forest, semi-desert and steppe, alpine and subalpine zones. </p><p>  The eccentricity of the Altai relief has generated the uniqueness of the plant world there.  In connection with the special climatic conditions of the territory, one can find here all the representatives of the fauna characteristic of the European regions of Russia, as well as the zones of Central and North Asia. </p><p>  The diversity of the landscape also explains the existence of a rich wildlife in Altai.  Here you can find squirrels and chipmunks, lynxes and ermines, moose and bears, golden eagles and sables, etc. </p>
