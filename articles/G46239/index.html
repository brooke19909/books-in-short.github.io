It is the students of vocational schools and <span>higher educational institutions that</span> more often than others have to settle in a dormitory of a corridor type.  After graduating from their alma mater, they break out of the temporary refuge with great pleasure, but there are people who have to exist in such conditions for almost their whole lives.  Today we‚Äôll talk about what a dormitory of a corridor type means, what are the conditions there, whether it is possible to buy a room there and how to make a stay in such housing as comfortable as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Unfinished apartment or new communal apartment </h2><p>  Dormitory - the very name of the accommodation speaks for itself.  These are rooms designed to compactly accommodate a large number of people for a short period of time.  Most often, these are houses with a special layout.  The project of the dormitory of the corridor type is presented in the following photo.  Few people do not know what kind of real estate this is, because almost everyone who arrived in a big city from a province had to live in such premises. </p><p>  At one time, dormitories were built in large numbers, they housed workers, students, and employees of various state organizations.  This has become a good alternative to communal apartments, which were mostly privately owned and accommodated huge families. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A dormitory room cannot be called a separate apartment, even with a big stretch, except for the so-called family rooms, especially since initially two to twenty people unfamiliar with each other can live in one room. </p>

    <h2>  Dormitory classification </h2><p>  According to the form of ownership, they can be state (municipal) or commercial.  The first are occupied by employees of budgetary organizations, it is almost impossible to legally rent an room there for an outsider.  In the second case, we are talking about residential buildings intended for corporate workers of a certain company that owns this property. </p><p>  Also, the dormitory is of sectional and corridor type, in which you can freely rent a room for an indefinite period of time privately.  This is convenient for people who have to travel on business, but cannot afford to pay for a hotel, as well as for tourists.  In this segment, premises are often provided with an order of magnitude better quality, both in terms of layout, and in terms of environment and sanitary conditions, in comparison with state-owned real estate. </p><p>  By type of layout, there are such options: </p><ul><li>  sectional dormitory; </li><li>  dormitory type. </li></ul><p>  Sectional or, as it is also called, block type is a type of housing, where the rooms are located in small sections.  Functional rooms in the form of a bathroom, shower and kitchen are shared among themselves by the owners of one section.  On one floor there can be several.  The hostel of the corridor type in our country is represented to a greater extent.  Therefore, we will talk about them in more detail in today's article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Corridor Housing </h2><p>  This is a traditional "hostel", it can be located in a high-rise building (9-16 floors), and in a building where there are only 2-3 floors.  A distinctive feature of such housing is that the rooms are located along a <span>long corridor that</span> permeates the entire building.  Usually at the end, designers provide a bathroom and shower, and at the end of the corridor is a kitchen with several stoves and sinks.  Launches are sometimes arranged in the housing of a new type, which are often organized in the basement.  These premises fall into the category of common areas. </p><p>  In modern commercial dormitories, specially hired personnel are engaged in cleaning the kitchen, bathroom, toilet and laundry, moreover, some institutions have similar practices in the tenants' private rooms.  But the traditional dormitory-type hostel is served by the residents themselves.  Tenants share <span>common areas</span> according to the schedule, and it also regulates cleaning issues in the corridors, in the kitchen, in the bathroom. </p>

    <h2>  All that is is yours </h2><p>  Despite the fact that quite a lot of settlers claim one room in the hostel, its area is not always large.  According to the law, 6 sq.m is provided for one person, in fact, up to ten people can be accommodated in a 5x5 m room. </p><p>  If we talk about "apartments" from student dormitories, then they most often comply with standards and students live in 2-4 people.  In such institutions, you can sometimes rent a room for people from the outside, but since such rental housing is semi-legal, there is always a risk of being evicted at the most inopportune moment. </p><p>  In houses that are rented to employees, conditions can be even worse, since this is housing from the lowest price category.  Settlers sleep in bunk beds, in addition to this, the room can have a wardrobe, several chairs, a table and a pair of nightstands.  Although there are exceptions, they do not apply to municipal dormitories, but to commercial ones.  In them, even the most inexpensive rooms are not crowded and have all the necessary living conditions.  Moreover, the premises can be fully paid on their own, then the manager will not add other residents to it. </p><p>  According to the standards, the room in the corridor-type dormitory should be equipped with a berth, a table, a pair of chairs, a bedside table, a hanger or a closet.  Some owners can equip the room with a refrigerator, TV, microwave. </p>

    <h2>  A bathroom </h2><p>  The dormitory toilet is designed for a large number of rooms at once.  Usually it is the only one on the whole floor.  However, not one toilet bowl is installed in the bathroom, but several; there are partitions between them.  Rarely (but it happens) there is a shower room in this room.  Often you have to wash in another room, which can be located on the ground floor, or even in the basement. </p><p>  In general, the bathroom most often causes special complaints from the residents of the dormitories, because there the plumbing often fails, there is constant unsanitary conditions.  The management of residential buildings should deal with these problems, but it often neglects its direct responsibilities. </p>

    <h2>  And in borscht, and in porridge ... </h2><p>  Food for residents must be prepared in the shared kitchen (above there is a photo).  The corridor-type dormitory is equipped with one kitchen per floor.  The interior of this room is often more than modest.  Depending on how many rooms the kitchen is designed for, 2, 3 or 5 stoves can be installed there, the number of sinks also varies. </p><p>  The availability of furniture depends on the manager and residents.  If <span>this is a</span> family-style <span>hostel</span> in which the same people live, it is usually equipped with a modern kitchen, with normal household appliances and furniture (cabinets, hanging cabinets, a table), but workers' dormitories rarely boast such an abundance.

    <h2>  The market of "common" real estate </h2><p>  Numerous guest rooms could become a typical project dormitory of the corridor type if the apartments in them were not equipped even with a small but separate kitchenette and a bathroom.  No matter how small such apartments are, many tend to purchase or rent such a property, because it is quite affordable. </p><p>  The same can be said of the dorm rooms.  Their privatization and implementation has become possible recently.  It should be noted that not in all hostels the purchase / sale of rooms will be legal.  If the house in the register is listed as a hostel, then all real estate transactions with premises located within it will be a violation of applicable law.  That is, you can buy a room in a hostel only when it is such only in planning, and not in fact. </p><h2>  How to make life in the hostel more comfortable? </h2><p>  Even a small in size and incomplete in functionality (but its own) real estate is better than a rented apartment.  And if you really need to live in a hostel for some time, you should make your life comfortable.  The main disadvantage of such housing is the lack of amenities in the room. </p><p>  It is impossible to equip a bathroom in a room, unless you want to take out buckets (then you can put a washstand and a small dry closet there), but any resident of a dormitory can create a compact kitchenette.  True, sometimes commandants forbid or restrict their settlers in this right, referring to fire safety.  If there are no problems of this nature, then you can cook on an electric stove or in a slow cooker, an electric kettle will be a good help. </p><p>  In large rooms, residents often make partitions, with the help of which it is quite simple to modify the situation.  This technique also allows you to delimit the room, creating separate zones. </p>
