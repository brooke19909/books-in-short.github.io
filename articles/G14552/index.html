  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Heel of the toe as the most critical job site</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No knitwear can compare with hand-knitted socks.  Without them, in the difficult climatic conditions of our country, just can not do.  These <span>socks, knitted</span> with hands on knitting needles, differ not only in their pleasant appearance, but also in their unique ability to create comfortable conditions for the legs.  They are worn with pleasure by people of almost all ages, including toddlers and the elderly. </p><p>  Socks can be knitted from almost any thread, but products made from natural sheep's wool or <span>goat down</span> are especially appreciated <span>.</span>  Many residents of our country have repeatedly been convinced not only of their ability to warm their feet in any frost, but also of the wonderful properties that can cure colds and coughs.  It is enough to put on such socks for the night, having previously poured dry mustard in them, and in the morning there will be no trace of a cold. </p><p>  Despite the apparent simplicity, not every craftswoman can tie socks in strength.  Even with detailed instructions, coping with this task is not easy. </p><p>  If you decide to master the technique of knitting socks, try to find a consultant who can show you all the steps and give detailed recommendations.  If this is not possible, take any manual and get to work.  As a rule, knitting magazines describe various methods of manufacturing these products.  The most difficult step in the work is the heel of the toe. </p><p>  If you decide to <span>knit socks with knitting needles, the</span> heel can be considered a kind of indicator of passing the most responsible and difficult stage in their manufacture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For work you need five spokes.  Four of them will have loops typed for work, and the fifth will be used for knitting.  Loops should be taken alternately, capturing each subsequent knitting needle the last loop on the previous needle.  The number of loops on each of them should be the same.  If you made the set of loops correctly, then you will get the correct square formed by four knitting needles with loops on them. </p><p>  Next, proceed to knit each side of the square one by one.  In this case, you knit the so-called ‚Äúbootleg‚Äù of the product.  First knit with a large viscous, and then go on to regular <span>stocking knitting.</span>  As a sample for work, you can use any <span>knitted sock.</span>  <span>Knit</span> in a circle on four knitting needles you will surely like.  The work is fast, and soon you will get the first result when you see the upper part of the sock. </p><p>  Do not forget that in front of you is waiting for the heel of the sock, which, as you know, is the most critical site.  Learning how to knit it, you can consider yourself a real master.  If you knit from real woolen threads without adding synthetic fibers, when knitting a section such as the heel of a sock, add cotton or synthetic thread to the wool.  This will not spoil the appearance of the product, and the heel of the toe will become durable.  Knit it is necessary not on four, but on three knitting needles.  To do this, first, the loops from two knitting needles are transferred to the remaining two.  Then a strip of 5-6 centimeters in length is knitted, depending on the size of the leg for which you knit the product. </p><p>  Next, we divide the knitted fabric into three knitting needles.  The number of loops on each of them should be equal.  When passing each row, one of the loops is knitted with the main part of the sock.  Do not forget that this is done on both sides. </p><p>  Having mastered knitting socks well, the heel will no longer seem to you such a difficult and crucial moment, and work will go faster.  For work, you can use threads of different colors, knitting ornaments and patterns on products.  These handmade socks can be safely presented to friends and acquaintances, they are not inferior to expensive souvenirs and can be considered an excellent gift. </p>
