    <h2>  Description and natural features </h2><p>  Ivanovo reservoirs are 4 <span>mountain lakes.</span>  All of them are distinguished by a sufficiently large depth and very icy water.  They are cascaded between the peaks called Ararat and Bobrovaya (the height of these peaks above sea level is 1546 and 1617 meters, respectively).  From the <span>upper lake</span> flows the Sarala River, which flows into the lower body of this system.  This place forms a wonderful waterfall.  It is worth noting that Ivanovo Lakes (Khakassia) do not have specific names individually, only a common one.  The largest of them are usually called Upper and Lower. </p><p>  <span>Ivanovo lakes</span> are located in the zone of eternal ice, because there are glaciers and so-called snowfields spread throughout the territory.  The reservoirs are very deep, with an average of 140 meters.  What is most surprising - the water is simply amazing in its transparency.  Fish are found in reservoirs, however, not in all.  For example, in the Upper Lake it is practically absent.  To explain this is quite simple: the water temperature in it is so low that such a cold is simply unacceptable for the animal world.  Ivanovo Lakes can boast of karst origin.  Khakassia is rich in such reservoirs: hence the presence of great depths.  Lakes ‚Äúfeed‚Äù on waterfalls and streams that receive water from snowfields. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo Lakes Khakassia photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147263.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What awaits tourists? </h2><p>  Lakes are unsuitable for tourist attractions: swimming and diving.  The water in them is so icy that it‚Äôs even dangerous for a person to plunge into it.  Also, in some reservoirs, the shores are simply absent in the usual sense of the word.  On the one hand here you can see steep slopes and rocks, on the other - smooth blocks surrounding Ivanovo Lakes.  Khakassia has always been distinguished by a large number of reservoirs with a dangerous descent. </p><p>  The canopies are only the western shores of the lower lakes, it is there that you can meet the parking of travelers.  Nevertheless, tourists are attracted by a picturesque view of the surrounding nature.  Eternal snow on the slopes of the mountains makes it possible to engage in winter sports all year round. </p><h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  The territory of Ivanovo Lakes is planned to be registered as a natural park, which is unique in its kind, because it is located in an alpine zone.  This is facilitated, in addition to the picturesque nature, by the unique variety of flora and fauna.  Some representatives of flora and fauna are listed on the Red Book.  The main goal of creating the park is to protect and protect some biocenoses (among them alpine <span>alpine meadows),</span> as well as rare plant communities - winding birch groves and unique tundra species.  Ivanovo Lakes (Khakassia) - the territory of the reindeer population.  This place is also rich in berries - lingonberries and blueberries. </p><p>  Closer to the Lower Lakes are tourist centers and hotels.  In the summer, excursions to the mountains and ponds are held here, and from November to May you can ride snowmobiles, skiing, and snowboarding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo lakes Khakassia how to get there" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ivanovo Lakes, Khakassia: how to get there? </h2><p>  To get to your destination, you must overcome a difficult path.  The distance from the largest settlement of Krasnoyarsk is 450 km.  You can travel by car, having passed the cities of Achinsk, Uzhur, Kopievo.  From the last village you need to go along the gravel road to the Priiskovy farm, overcoming a decent distance of 100 km.  And from this settlement to the lakes - a little more than 10 km.  The complexity of the route lies in poor terrain.  Almost all of the distance can be traveled only on an SUV or walk.  At the beginning of this path, tourist camps are usually set up.  In the same way, you can overcome the route and intercity transport. </p>
