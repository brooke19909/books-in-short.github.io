Why do many people prefer this particular vegetable?  Carrots are stored for a long time and will not fade in a matter of days.  It does not contain too much juice, so it does not try to pop out of your hands during cleaning and cutting.  By the way, carrots are easy to cut, although they are hard enough.  Crafts from carrots have a bright and juicy color, which cannot but please the eye.  So, what can be done from this fun and inexpensive root crop? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from carrots" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/986436.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Carrot pirate </h2><p>  To create an ominous pirate, take one large carrot, a balloon, cardboard and colored paper, thick threads (you can also take corn stigmas), paints, and an <span>office knife.</span>  It is better not to take a kitchen knife for such delicate work. </p><p>  Carefully and gently clean the root crop, cutting off its lower part.  Do not rush to throw it away, from this part you will cut the pirate's nose.  Choose the shape you like: circle, triangle, square.  On the carrots, cut out the nose recess, insert a short toothpick into the nose and put it in the groove.  Now take the nose and cut out the toothy mouth.  Make a horizontal notch at the bottom of the pirate's face.  Then divide it into a large number of vertical short notches.  Then cut one eye (you can insert a toy or decorative eye into the recess).  It was the turn of hair and a traditional pirate headgear.  Trim a bright balloon and pull it over the pirate's head like a bandana. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Under the ball, fix the pirate's hair made of thick strands or stigmas of corn.  From black paper, cut a round pirate blindfold.  From black paper we also glue a pirate cocked hat, on which we draw a skull and bones with white paint.  Paint the pirate's mouth and insert a cardboard dagger into it.  Carrot crafts, photos of which you see here, can be very realistic. </p><h2>  Carrot flowers </h2><p>  To create incredibly beautiful autumn flowers, you will need carrots, a plate, scissors and a knife.  Cut the vegetable from top to bottom about five times.  Do not get to the very end of the carrots.  Cut the vegetable as thin as possible so that in the middle there is room for other petals.  Repeat this process a couple more times.  You should get 3-4 layers of petals.  Just cut the core crosswise.  Children's carrot crafts can be very beautiful! </p><h2>  Carrot giraffe </h2><p>  Take a large carrot and in its lower wide edge insert four matches (or toothpicks shortened in advance).  Cut the narrower upper part of the fetus (this will be the neck of the giraffe).  We plant it with a match on the body.  We cut the head out of carrots, put it on the neck.  Eyes and ears are best made from plasticine and gently stuck to the head of your giraffe.  Giraffe from carrots - a craft that will appeal to any baby.  From the ends of matches with heads, make horns for the beast, now it has become even more realistic! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Carrot hare </h2><p>  To create a fun vegetable hare, take the largest carrot.  Make a cut at its base (so that your carrot crafts are stable and do not fall to one side).  On the opposite side, make a deep incision, cutting the orange root crop into two parts.  Thus, you will give your bunny ears.  You can make a rabbit's face out of any material that comes to hand, here only your imagination rules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fox carrot" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/986426.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can use beads, peppercorns, sunflower seeds, olives and so on.  Do not forget to make the hare a hairstyle of greens (for example, carrot tops, parsley or dill).  The fun carrot hare is ready!  And a fox from carrots can become a great girlfriend for him.

    <h2>  Gnome from carrots </h2><p>  Wash the carrots and cut off its end.  You will need the pointed part for making a hat, two more rings of carrots for your hands.  Cut three rings from the bottom of the fetus - these are the future legs and head.  There remains the middle part, which will become the body of your gnome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carrot giraffe" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/986423.jpg" width="500"></div>  Insert two toothpicks into the lower body - these are the legs of the gnome.  Toothpicks should be parallel to each other.  We attach two previously cut circles to the free ends of toothpicks - these are the shoes of a cheerful gnome.  Now in the same way we attach toothpicks-hands to carrots.  From carrot circles we cut out palms and put on free ends of hands.  Crafts from carrots not only entertain children, but also develop motor skills.  From a short toothpick we make a neck and attach to it a round head cut from an orange vegetable.  From the sharp end of the carrot we make the cap of the gnome.  By the way, from colored paper you can also cut a good cap and put it on a carrot cap.  Cut the vest from the same colored paper and put it on the gnome.  Draw him a funny face!  The craft is ready.

    <h2>  Carrot man </h2><p>  A flower, a hare, a fox, a pine cone, a giraffe from carrots ... Crafting can be even easier than you think.  Try to make a carrot man really fast!  Cut out the carrot head, torso, legs and palms of a person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from carrots photo" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/986416.jpg" width="443"></div>  Legs are not made from toothpicks, but from flat and round carrot blanks.  All parts are mounted on toothpicks or plasticine.  Then you can make a hat of beautiful and shiny foil.  If you trust the baby with scissors or a knife - watch his work even more carefully.

    <p>  Autumn is the best time to create crafts with your children!  Nature itself helps us in creativity, giving many fruits, vegetables and fruits, berries, colorful leaves and twigs.  Crafts made from carrots can also help mothers feed babies who refuse to eat such healthy vegetables! </p>
