    <p>  A constitutional monarchy is a form of government.  At the same time, the state has independent courts and parliament.  The power of the ruler is limited by the constitution.  Characteristic features of this <span>type of management</span> are a civil sheet and a counter signature. </p><p>  The latter is the fastening of an act of a ruler by the signature of a minister or head of government.  The countersignature indicates that the responsibility (both political and legal) for this act lies with the person who secured it.  Formally, this is due to the fact that the monarch himself, being the head of state, is not responsible for his actions.  The counter signature was introduced at the beginning of the 18th century in England.  Thus, an effective means of limiting royal power was created.  Since the appearance of the counter-signature, the monarchical form of government has finally won in England and a number of other countries. </p><p>  A civil sheet is the sum of money that is allocated each year for the maintenance of the king.  The amount of payment is established with the accession of each king to the throne.  Subsequently, the amount of money may be increased, but not reduced. </p><p>  In accordance with the degree of restriction of the royal power distinguish between the parliamentary and dualistic structure of government. </p><p>  Some Asian and African states have a dualistic system.  These are, for example, countries with a constitutional monarchy such as Morocco, Jordan, and others.  The dualistic system is considered the original kind of limited power of the king.  Its feature is the concentration in the hands of the ruler of a greater amount of authority. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The dualistic <span>constitutional monarchy</span> is a historical transitional stage from absolutism to the parliamentary form of limited government. </p><p>  In the dualistic type of government, <span>legislative power</span> (in principle) belongs to parliament.  He is chosen by his subjects or a certain part of them (under qualified suffrage).  Executive power is concentrated in the hands of the king.  He realizes it either directly by himself, or through the government.  <span>Judicial power</span> also belongs to the king.  However, it can be more or less independent. </p><p>  At the same time, the <span>separation of powers</span> in this type of government is usually incomplete.  Despite the fact that laws are passed in parliament, the king has the right to an absolute veto.  This act does not allow the enacted law to enter into force.  In addition, the dualistic constitutional monarchy presupposes the unlimited power of the king to issue decrees.  Thus, a ruler can adopt acts of an "extraordinary nature" whose force is equal to the force of laws. </p><p>  The main feature of the dualistic system is the king‚Äôs right to dissolve parliament, introducing absolutism in the state. </p><p>  If the structure assumes the existence of a government, then it is responsible for its actions only to the king.  Parliament can influence the government only through its rule to establish the state budget.  It should be noted that this is a fairly powerful method of exposure is applied only once a year.  At the same time, when they come into conflict with the government, deputies are under constant threat of the dissolution of parliament. </p><p>  The dualistic constitutional monarchy is distinguished by the presence of an <span>authoritarian political regime.</span>  Experts describe the <span>state regime</span> as a compromise between the ‚Äúruling elite‚Äù and the rest of society, where the king still prevails with his entourage. </p><p>  Among modern states-representatives of the dualistic type of government should be called Thailand.  Its constitution stipulates that the king ascends the throne not according to the law, but "in accordance with a respected tradition" and no punishment will be applied to him. </p>
