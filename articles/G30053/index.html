    <h2>  Oasis Beach Club </h2><p>  This is a completely new and so far the only water park in Astana in the open air.  The emphasis here is on a relaxing beach holiday.  This is an alternative to the not-so-clean <span>Ishim River</span> and Taldykel Lake in the Kazakh capital.  Thus, the slides here to regret are few.  And they are intended primarily for babies.  But in abundance there are sun loungers and beach umbrellas - free for visitors.  Also included in the price of the ticket is the use of rubber rings and mattresses.  And even sunglasses can be given to you if you forgot yours at home.  Do not worry if the weather is cool outside.  Pool water is heated to comfortable temperatures.  The purification systems here are of the latest generation - you will not feel any smell of bleach.  In addition to filters, once a day the tanks are also freed from small floating debris.  There are three pools in the Oasis Beach Club: for the smallest (20 centimeters deep), children's (one and a half meters) and adult (2.5 m). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park in Astana cost" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1928419.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about the Oasis Beach Club </h2><p>  Visitors claim that this water park in Astana is a great alternative to spending time on the banks of a river or lake.  Water is pure, sun beds - as much as you want.  On the territory there are playgrounds, a place for beach volleyball, a cafe with affordable prices.  The water park is new, and every year there are attractions.  In mid-2017, there are already eight slides for adults.  Plus countless mushrooms, fountains and other entertainment for the youngest visitors.  However, one should not forget that the pools are in the open.  In the rain or cold, your stay there will not seem so pleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alau water park in astana" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1928455.jpg" width="600"></div>

It should be remembered that the ice palace is a large entertainment complex, and even with a sports bias, and the water park with it is one of the units.  ‚ÄúAlau‚Äù is better known as a skating rink, it also has baths and other entertainments.  It is difficult to name two pools in ‚ÄúAlau‚Äù as a water park.  People come here to simply sunbathe and plunge into the cool water.  Nevertheless, entry here costs from a thousand tenge (180 rubles). </p><h2>  Sky Beach Club </h2><p>  This is a place of rest beyond competition.  And not only in the summer, but also in periods when you can only dream about the beach.  This is a fabulous water park in Astana, whose photos are fascinating.  It is like a piece of the Maldives, transferred by magic to the capital of Kazakhstan.  And there is some truth to this.  Sand for the tropical oasis was indeed brought from the Maldives.  In an exotic corner of the covered pavilion with glass walls, not only the water in the pools is heated, but the air is always hot and humid.  Even the white sand is heated, and it is so nice to sunbathe on it!  This paradise is located in the entertainment center "Khan Shatyr".  You can get here from different areas of Astana by city buses.  Of the rides there are only two slides.  But in one of the pools every two hours the ‚Äúocean storm‚Äù begins.  Sky Beach Club is basically a relaxing beach holiday.  In the evening, the backlight turns on, and the spectacle is simply mesmerizing, both outside and inside.  The ticket price is seven thousand tenge (1270 rubles) on weekdays and ten (1800 rubles) on weekends.  Children from five to eleven years go inside for 4000 tenge (725 rubles </p><p>  ) </p>
