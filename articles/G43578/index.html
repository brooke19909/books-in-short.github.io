It was on them that a significant part of worries about the state was held.  One of the most prominent statesmen of the era of <span>Ivan the Terrible</span> was Alexei Adashev.  A short biography of this associate of the great Russian Tsar will be the subject of our study. </p>

    <h2>  early years </h2><p>  About the early years of Alexei Adashev, practically nothing is known.  Even the date of his birth remains a mystery to us.  Therefore, the exact years of life cannot be called. </p><p>  At the same time, it is known that Alex was the son of the boyar and governor Fyodor Grigoryevich Adashev, who came from the not-so-famous Kostroma clan of the Olkhovs.  The name of the mother is also a mystery.  In addition, Alexey had a younger brother, Daniel. </p><p>  The first mention of Alexei Adashev in the annals dates back to his mature age, namely in 1547. </p><h2>  The first steps in the service of the sovereign </h2><p>  So, as already mentioned above, Alexey Adashev first came to the attention of the chroniclers in 1547, when he performed at the wedding of Tsar Ivan the Terrible the position of a movnik and a fake one, whose duties included covering the marriage bed.  His wife Anastasia is also mentioned there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After this event, Alexey Adashev became an unchanging character in various chronicles and chronicles; he was increasingly promoted, approaching the sovereign and influencing him. </p><h2>  Turning points </h2><p>  The turning point, which finally determined the rapprochement between Alexei Adashev and Ivan the Terrible, was the famous Moscow fire of 1547 and the subsequent events. </p>

    <p>  The ‚Äúgreat fire‚Äù that erupted in the summer destroyed more than 25,000 Muscovites.  People began to blame for the ‚Äúpunishment of God‚Äù the Glinsky family, relatives of Tsar John's mother, who by that time had a great influence on him.  The discontent of the people spilled over into the uprising, as a result of which one of the representatives of the Glinsky clan was torn to pieces by the crowd, and the clan‚Äôs property was looted. </p><p>  In the end, the rebels managed to persuade to stop the atrocities.  Nevertheless, this uprising made a significant impression on the young Ivan the Terrible and forced him to radically revise his policy.  He alienated Glinsky and other noble nobles, but brought closer new people who were not of such high origin.  Among them was Alexey Adashev. </p><h2>  State activity </h2><p>  After these events, the rapid rise of Alexei Adashev began.  Together with him, another noble man approached the king - the priest Sylvester.  They had a significant influence on the sovereign and helped him in the administration of the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In 1549, Adashev became the head of the <span>Chosen Council.</span>  It was a kind of government that Ivan the Terrible had just created.  The years of work of the Elected Council were marked by a number of ongoing reforms.  It was at this time that the first Zemsky Sobor in Russia was convened - an estate-representative body, somewhat reminiscent of the modern parliament.  In 1551, the Church of <span>Stoglavy Cathedral</span> was held <span>.</span>  In addition, Adashev Alexei Fedorovich took an active part in the development of the Code of Laws, which was published in 1550.  In the same year, Ivan the Terrible endowed him with the title of nothing. </p><p>  Distinguished Alexei Adashev and in diplomatic activity.  He negotiated with the Kazan Khanate, the <span>Livonian Order, the</span> Nogai Horde, the Kingdom of Poland and Denmark.  In addition, he took an active part in the <span>capture of Kazan</span> in 1552, directing engineering work. </p><h2>  Confrontation with the Romanovs </h2><p>  At this time, thanks to the marriage of Tsar John to Anastasia Romanovna, the Zakharyins clan, later known as the Romanovs, rose to Russia, giving Russia a number of kings and emperors.  They began to compete fiercely in the struggle for influence on the king with Adashev and Sylvester. </p>

    <p>  The turning point in this struggle was 1553, when Tsar Ivan Vasilyevich became seriously ill.  Then he demanded that all the courtiers swear as the future tsar to his son from Anastasia Romanovna - Dmitry.  This was to be done, among other things, by the cousin of the tsar, Vladimir Andreevich Staritsky, who, according to the old custom, has the primary right to the throne.  The close sovereign divided into two parties: one unquestioningly swore allegiance to the prince, and the other sided with Vladimir Staritsky. </p><p>  Adashev Alexey Fedorovich immediately swore allegiance to Dmitry, but his father, Fedor Grigorievich, refused to do this, fearing the further strengthening of the Romanovs.  After this incident and the recovery of Ivan the Terrible, the tsar ceased to relate to the Adashev family with the same favor. </p><p>  Despite the ensuing cooling in relation to Tsar Ivan Vasilyevich to Alexei Adashev, the latter had a significant influence on state affairs for a long time. </p><h2>  Opal </h2><p>  Nevertheless, this state of affairs could not continue continuously, and Alexei Fedorovich perfectly understood this.  He was not even misled by the fact that his father soon after the recovery of Ivan the Terrible received the rank of boyar.  The Romanovs increasingly strengthened their positions, and Adashev and Sylvester faded into the background.  Despite the death of Tsarevich Dmitry in the same 1553, the Romanovs began to influence the sovereign even more. </p>

    <p>  The limit of tension between the tsar and Alexei Adashev came in 1560.  Just shortly before, the Livonian War began in the Baltic states, and Alexei Fedorovich chose to go there, away from the yard.  This event could be considered a kind of honorable link.  Alexey Adashev was assigned the rank of governor.  His direct commander was Prince Mstislavsky. </p><p>  But Aleksei Fedorovich was not able to win military honors in the fields of Livonia, since the same year, Queen Anastasia died, which further embittered Tsar John with regard to the Adashevs.  Therefore, Alexey Adashev was sent to the Derpt Fortress on the territory of modern Estonia and was taken into custody. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  It was while imprisoned in Dorpat that Alexei Adashev died in 1561.  Death occurred due to a fever, which the former head of the Chosen One was ill for two months.  At the time of his death, close to Alexei Fedorovich were neither relatives, nor relatives, nor friends.  Thus ended the years of life of one of the most active people of our Fatherland of his time. </p><p>  However, such a death, quite possibly, saved him from the more difficult fate that Tsar Ivan the Terrible and the Romanovs prepared for him.  Evidence of this may be that shortly after the death of Alexei Adashev, his brother Daniel was executed with his son Tarkh.  A similar fate befell other representatives of the Adashevs, who practically ceased to exist.  The father of Alexei and Daniil Adashev, Fyodor Grigoryevich, died in 1556 a natural death. </p><h2>  Performance Assessment </h2>

    <p>  Of course, not every figure of the 16th century was as bright in Russian history as Alexei Adashev.  The characterization of his work by most historians is quite positive.  He is credited with the establishment of a number of state institutions and the widespread practice of reform.  True, this time did not last long.  Especially contrasting with respect to the period of Adashev‚Äôs active activity is the era of oprichnina and revelry of obscurantism that began after his removal from state affairs. </p><p>  Of course, the acts for the benefit of the Fatherland, Alexei Adashev, as well as his biography, are worthy of detailed study. </p>
