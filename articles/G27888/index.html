    <p>  This person is not only a symbol of the era, but also its greatest asset and mystery.  A brief biography of Leonardo da Vinci is a <span>life path</span> filled with enthusiastic work on a variety of projects.  One of the most unique people on our planet, he was the greatest artist, sculptor, researcher, scientist, anatomist, engineer, chemist, philosopher, botanist, musician, poet ... Yes, what the great Florentine did not do!  And at the same time in every field he achieved tremendous success. </p><p>  The biography of Leonardo da Vinci began in Italy on April 15, 1452 in a small town near Florence.  What is known about the mother is that she was a peasant, was not married and raised her son on her own until he was 4 years old.  After this, the father of Pierrot Vinci, a rather wealthy citizen, took him to him.  Leonardo received his <span>primary education</span> at home.  Even then, teachers noted the extraordinary abilities of the boy.  For example, he wrote not only traditionally, but also from left to right in <span>mirror image.</span>  Leonardo worked equally with both his right hand and his left. </p><p>  A brief biography of Leonardo da Vinci tells that in 1469 his father took him with him to Florence, where he moved to a <span>permanent residence.</span>  There he learns to be an artist, despite Pierrot‚Äôs desire to make his son a notary.  Already in 1472 he was accepted into the local guild of painters.  This has largely influenced the career development of the Renaissance genius.  In the years 1481-1482, Leonardo worked with Lodovico Moro, the ruler of Milan, as the organizer of the court holidays, and also - hydraulic engineer, architect and military engineer.  Even then, he developed several projects of an ideal city, a central-domed church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a short biography of da Vinci" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/308268.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A brief biography of da Vinci is an amazing and fascinating story about the search for truth, about the inquisitive mind of a scientist who saw the world through different eyes.  It is unfortunate that his scientific research was not in demand in his native Italy.  Therefore, he gladly responds to the invitation of <span>Francis I</span> and leaves for France to take the post of court painter there.  He took with him many of his works, both finished and sketches.  Many of them are today stored in the most prestigious museums in the world and private collections, causing delight. </p>

    <p>  A brief biography of Leonardo da Vinci tells that he died on May 2, 1519 near Amboise, in the castle of Clos Luce.  He bequeathed all the acquired good to his students and friends, but he did not forget his relatives.  In Italy, in one of the temples, he kept several hundred ducats, which were transferred to his brothers. </p><p>  A brief biography of Leonardo da Vinci can not convey the entire depth of the genius of this man.  Contemporaries described him as a very attractive man, very thoughtful, eloquent and active.  However, for all mankind, it remains a mystery: how many talents can be united in one person?  Some consider him an alien from an extraterrestrial civilization, others - an inhabitant of a parallel world, and still others - a wanderer in time.  However, whoever he was, he presented us with his amazing masterpieces, which people will always admire. </p>
