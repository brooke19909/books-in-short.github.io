However, this does not mean at all that each model is perfect.  In this article, we have to understand the features and specifications of the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 5S.  The smartphone went on sale in 2013.  It is an improved version of the "five".  At first glance, there are not many differences, but the developers have done a lot of work, making changes not only in the external design, but also in the internal ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  What will surprise this model of the "apple" brand?  The users were interested in the main technical characteristics of the iPhone 5S.  We are talking about a new processor, version of the operating system, an improved camera, and of course, Touch ID or in other words about a fingerprint scanner built into the Home key. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5s specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2180873.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware "stuffing" </h2><p>  This smartphone is the first where developers have implemented a 64-row system.  A7 chip works on two computing modules.  The maximum mark of the clock frequency reaches the limit of 1300 MHz.  A good addition is the RAM, with a capacity of one gigabyte.  With such a ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, the smartphone is able to cope with any tasks.  Resource-intensive applications open quickly and smoothly, there are no system crashes and freezes.  In this parameter, the "apple" brand, as always, remained at its best.  By the way, note that some Chinese processors, based on four or more cores, are not able to provide similar performance results.  The main reason for this is the optimization of the platform, and in this criterion Apple remains out of competition, as it is constantly improving its iOS operating system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is impossible to ignore the amount of internal memory, describing the technical specifications.  iPhone 5S 16 Gb - the "younger" version.  Naturally, the name already makes it clear that the manufacturer integrated 16-gigabyte storage for installing software and other files.  The average version already provides 32 GB.  But for the demanding user, the developers released a modification with 64 GB of internal memory.  It is recommended to take the volume of ROM seriously, considering all the nuances, since the manufacturer does not support working with flash cards, so it is not possible to expand the storage further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple iphone 5s specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2179828.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  iPhone 5S: screen specifications </h2><p>  The convenience of using a smartphone depends on many indicators.  However, the main one can be considered the characteristics of the screen.  In the model with the 5S index, it does not differ from its predecessor.  Its diagonal remained at the same level - 4 inches.  At first glance, the display may seem small, but the high resolution helps the situation.  For example, the pixel density per inch is 326 ppi.  Note that this is a rather high indicator.  Display Type - IPS LCD, Retina.  The picture is displayed on a screen of excellent quality.  The detail is high, the color is excellent (the tint range is juicy and bright), the brightness is enough even when working under the bright rays of the sun, there are no complaints about the viewing angles.  And, of course, when describing the technical characteristics of the iPhone 5S, you must specify a screen resolution of 1136 √ó 640 px, which undoubtedly deserves respect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="specifications iphone 5s 16gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2179829.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera Feature </h2><p>  Although the resolution of the main camera does not differ from its predecessor, however, the developers nevertheless conjured over the characteristics.  iPhone 5S received a matrix with an increased pixel size and a reduced aperture value.  As for the latter, it is f / 2.2.  Naturally, changing the parameters significantly improved the quality of images even in low light.  In order for photos taken at night to be detailed and clear, the developers installed a double True Tone flash. </p><p>  One thing can be said about the front camera - its resolution is only 1.2 megapixels.  Selfies, of course, you can do, but do not rely on high quality. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  An equally important point in the technical characteristics of the iPhone 5S is the battery life.  The smartphone has a 1560 mAh battery.  The chemical composition is lithium polymer.  Type of construction - fixed.  The rechargeable battery provides decent results.  For example, in standby mode, the device will last about 250 hours without recharging. If you limit interaction with the gadget at the average load level, you can safely count on 24 hours of work, after which you will need to connect the device through the charger to the mains. </p><h2>  Compare iPhone 5S and 6S </h2><p>  The technical characteristics of these models are not very correct to compare, since they were released with a difference of two years.  The development of the mobile industry is constantly being improved, so the 6S is much better equipped.  For example, compare <span>screens.</span>  <span>The size of</span> their diagonal is 4 ∫ versus 4.7 ∫ in favor of the latter.  Accordingly, in the sixth modification, the resolution increased (1334 √ó 750 px), but the density remained the same.  The changes also affected hardware. </p><p>  The iPhone 5S A7 processor has been replaced with a higher-performance A9.  Increased exactly half the RAM in the 6S.  Also in the lineup there was a modification with integrated storage of 128 GB, but the manufacturer refused the 32 GB version.  Developers have increased the resolution of the cameras.  The fifth generation was equipped with 8 and 1.2-megapixel matrices, and in the sixth it became 12 and 5 megapixels.  And, of course, when comparing these two gadgets, you need to pay attention to the battery capacity.  In the iPhone 6S, it was increased by 155 mAh, but it practically did not appear on the terms of operation (the test results are the same). </p>
