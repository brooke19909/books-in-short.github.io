Turkey is a popular destination, and it is one of the resorts visited by tourists.  In fact, this is a huge archaeological training ground.  It is a city of myths and imagination.  <span>Open-air museum.</span>  Many more nicknames were given to him by scientists and lovers of antiquity.  But, probably, the most famous building in it (which, by the way, has not been preserved) is the <span>temple of Artemis of</span> Ephesus.  The one whose fans argued with St. Paul, and then fell out of favor with the Christian emperors.  Yes, such that this wonder of the world was destroyed by decree of the ruler.  And only one column remained of him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ephesus Turkey" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/265622.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus</span> (Turkey), as mentioned above, is the brainchild of archaeologists.  In this country, a huge number of ancient Roman and Byzantine cities, which are gradually gaining their original appearance thanks to scientists.  Ephesus is one of them.  This huge museum can be reached in two ways, since it has upper and lower entrances.  But it‚Äôs best to do this when going down the mountain.  You can get here by transport if you have a car or an excursion is organized.  Ephesus (Turkey) is itself a settlement, and the nearest town near it is Selcuk.  Buses and trains go here.  And now the next four kilometers you need to walk.  Well, or hitchhiking - in Turkey this is not a problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

However, the researchers unearthed no more than fifteen percent of the territory of this ancient city.  But even what appears before our eyes indicates how luxurious and magnificent the civilization that created it was.  One of the most beautiful buildings discovered by archaeologists is the so-called Celsius library.  This building is unique in that it is not only a collection of books and manuscripts, but also the tomb of the Roman governor.  He ruled the entire province of Asia, and was buried in the city of Ephesus.  Turkey (or rather, its current territory) was then part of the Roman Empire.  And the provincial governor who lived here had 12 thousand books and was considered the owner of the world's third largest library.

The first of these is the iconic building of Ephesus, and its ruins are even depicted on <span>Turkish money.</span>  There are so many attractions that one list would take several pages.  Indoor (Odeon) and open theater (the latter was considered the largest in the <span>ancient world</span> and accommodated up to 40 thousand people), streets under marble porticoes and squares, villas with frescoes and mosaics, the Temple of Hekate and the gate of Hercules, and even a brothel with a path to it a sign - all this can be seen by visitors to the museum-city of Ephesus.

    <p>  Turkey is a Muslim country, but on its territory there are a lot of Christian shrines.  Ephesus is one such place.  Firstly, near the ancient city, on Ayasoluk Hill, there is a grave, which is considered the last earthly haven of the Apostle John.  Even under the Byzantine emperor Justinian, a basilica was built around it.  Now, ruins remained from it, since it was destroyed by an earthquake.  A few kilometers from Ephesus, tourists are shown the house where the Mother of God lived after death on the cross of her Son.  Muslims also revere this place, because, according to their faith, Mariam (this is the Arabic version of the name Mary) gave birth to the prophet Isa ... There is a temple on the site of this house, where followers of both religions come to pilgrimage. </p>
