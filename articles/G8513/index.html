Have a picnic, swim in cool water, sunbathe, and just spend time with friends.  Academic ponds are located in the Northern Autonomous Region of Moscow, on the territory of the Timiryazev Academy. </p><h2>  A little bit about the past of this place </h2><p>  The history of the ponds begins in the mid-eighteenth century.  The peasants who lived on the territory of the Petrovsko-Razumovskoye estate expanded and deepened the channel of the Zhban River and built a dam, after which a picturesque cascade of ponds formed.  In the second half of the 20th century, their shape was slightly changed, the islands were removed.  Only one Bird Island has survived to this day.  Today, the ponds belong to the Timiryazevsky Forest Park and are a conservation zone. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Ponds in Moscow are conventionally divided into two types.  On some beaches it is allowed to swim and sunbathe; on others, swimming is strictly prohibited.  There is also a division into paid and free stays in the reservoir.  The Big Academic Pond is one of the largest reservoirs in the capital, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 hectares.  In the summer it becomes a favorite vacation spot for Muscovites and guests of the capital.  Located at the intersection of Bolshaya Akademicheskaya and Pryanishnikova streets, not far from the Nauka stadium.  The pond around the perimeter is equipped with <span>reinforced concrete slabs.</span> </p><p>  In addition, the Academic Ponds are one of the official wintering areas.  Walrus Club meetings last from October to April every weekend from 12 to 14 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="academic ponds" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1944056.jpg" width="448"></div>

It works daily from 8:00 to 24:00, to ensure the safety of tourists, the territory is patrolled by the police.  In the beach season, a small fee is charged for entry, which fully compensates for the comfortable stay of vacationers.  The territory is regularly cleaned of garbage, there are comfortable changing rooms, a shower and a toilet are working.  The quality of the water in the pond meets <span>sanitary standards.</span>  At the height of the season, it is difficult to find a place on the beach that is not occupied by vacationers. </p><p>  During relaxation, in addition to swimming, everyone can find entertainment for their taste and wallet.  A boat station with rowboats and catamaran rentals is open until 22:00 on the beach.  There are also several water slides.  For the youngest visitors, a safe shallow zone, the so-called paddling pool, is equipped.  For lovers of beach sports, volleyball and badminton courts are equipped.

The water here is running.  She regularly comes from the river Zhbany and Koptevsky stream.  The pond is also significantly fed by the waters of the Khimki reservoir.  Due to this, rich flora and fish fauna formed in it.  Amateur fishing in the pond is allowed, unlike other metropolitan bodies of water.  However, according to eyewitnesses, the catch will also be "amateur".  And for those who prefer serious fishing, ponds near the Timiryazev Academy are recommended, but you will have to pay a fee for permission to fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="academic ponds beach" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1944058.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the beach of Academic Ponds in various ways, both by public and private transport.  The most convenient of them are: </p><ul><li>  from the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya metro station by buses No. 114, 179, 204 to the Nauka Stadium stop; </li><li>  from Voykovskaya metro station on trolleybus No. 57, by minibus No. 661 to the Nauka Stadium stop; </li><li>  from the metro station "Dmitrovskaya" on tram number 27 to the stop cinema "Baikal". <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large academic pond" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1944055.jpg" width="448"></div></li></ul><h2>  Pros and cons of such a vacation </h2><p>  Academic ponds are suitable as a holiday for families with children, as well as for lovers of outdoor activities.  While the kids splash around in the ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù and frolic on the playgrounds, parents can go fishing, cook kebabs, and try their hand at volleyball.  Tired of basking in the sun, you can walk around the territory of the Petrovsko-Razumovskoye estate, plunge into the historical past.  Right next to the pond there is a grotto - the oldest construction of the complex. </p><p>  Like any vacation spot, the beach has its pros and cons.  Its advantages include: </p><ul><li>  proximity to <span>public transport</span> ; </li><li>  comfortable changing cabins; </li><li>  the presence of a shower and toilet; </li><li>  there is a zone with barbecue facilities; </li><li>  children attractions; </li><li>  several sports grounds for adults. </li></ul><p>  But this beach has its drawbacks.  Vacationers most often note the following: </p><ul><li>  entrance fee will be charged; </li><li>  there is no rental of sun loungers; </li><li>  There is no car parking, which makes it difficult for visitors with a personal car to relax. </li></ul><p>  Academic Ponds Beach is one of the most popular Muscovites vacation destinations for good reason.  In hot weather, you can comfortably sunbathe and swim in a clean pond. </p>
