On this day, the Russian Bridge (Vladivostok) was put into operation, a photo of which immediately adorned the pages of leading domestic and foreign publications.  And this did not surprise anyone, since long before the opening ceremony, many world media called the construction of this building one of the most ambitious projects of the 21st century. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  It was decided to open the Russian bridge for traffic by the time the APEC Summit began, which was supposed to take place on the island of the same name.  Construction began in the second half of 2008 and was carried out over four years.  However, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding an object arose many decades before, and more than once.  During the 20th century, two projects were developed with an interval of almost 25 years, but none of the developments presented turned out to be viable. </p><p>  In 2007, new options were proposed.  Among the 10 architectural and engineering works presented by the leading design bureaus of our country, the experts singled out the original design of the cable-stayed bridge, although the possibility of erecting a suspension was previously considered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Foreign experts and the best engineering organizations of Russia actively participated in the work on the project. </p><p>  The company ‚ÄúUSK Most‚Äù became the general contractor for the construction, and the total amount of the contract was 32.2 billion rubles.  As for the curation of the project, it was entrusted to V. Kurepin. </p><p>  The new bridge was erected at an accelerated pace simultaneously from the mainland and from the coast of the island.  Toward each other moved two teams of builders, who met on April 12, 2012. </p><p>  A month after the opening, the object received its official name - Russian Bridge.  Vladivostok has acquired a new attraction, which today is considered the main architectural symbol of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  Thanks to a span of 1104 meters, the Russky bridge is the pride of the <span>residents of Vladivostok</span> and the largest object of its kind in the world.  The whole structure rests on the cables, which are durable cables.  They are secured with fasteners to poles.  The height of the Russian bridge in Vladivostok is 321 m, the distance between the arches and the surface of the water is 70 m. This circumstance allows heavy vessels to sail freely under it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The load on the pylons of the Russian bridge is evenly distributed.  For the construction of each of the pillars, 9,000 cubic meters of high-quality concrete were used.  One pylon could accommodate a residential neighborhood, and there are two such supports at the bridge. </p><p>  The length of the Russian bridge is 1885.5 m, and weight - 23,000 tons.  <span>The width of the carriageway</span> is 24 meters (four lanes). </p>

    <h2>  Bridge maintenance </h2><p>  The state of the structure is constantly monitored by a team of technicians and meteorologists.  Specialists serving the bridge climb 300 meters to the stairs arranged inside each pylon.  Occasionally, journalists and professional photographers are allowed to visit these premises.  Weather on the bridge, wind direction, visibility, sea waves are monitored for timely adoption of necessary measures. </p><p>  There is an observation deck at the congress.  It offers amazing views of the endless Pacific expanse. </p><h2>  Construction Features </h2><p>  Many experts call the Russian Bridge unique, and not only because of its length.  The construction of such a structure in the climate of Primorye can also be considered unusual.  High humidity, frequent squally winds, significant temperature differences created big problems and forced architects and engineers to look for extraordinary solutions.  <span>The cable-stayed system</span> for the Russian bridge was developed by French scientists who suggested using a special steel composition with a long operating period (up to 100 years), at temperatures from -40 ¬∫ in winter to +40 ¬∫ in summer.  In addition, the design was created taking into account the requirements of increased aerodynamic stability. </p>

    <h2>  Construction value </h2><p>  Russian Bridge plays an important role in the life of Vladivostok.  It has great economic and political importance, and also provides automobile communication between the mainland and island parts of the city.  At the same time, departing to Russky Island, it should be remembered that military bases have been located there for more than a century, and you can accidentally get into the territory, the entrance to which is prohibited for ordinary people. </p><p>  The administration of the region plans in the near future to place modern production enterprises, hotels, sports facilities, museums and attractions, residential neighborhoods and educational centers on Russky Island.  Thus, with the introduction of the bridge, broad prospects for investment in new housing construction and the creation of infrastructure facilities opened up.  It has also become the main highway through which FEFU students get to their new campus on Russky Island.  At the moment, there are already hostels in which up to 11,000 students can live at the same time.  In addition, on the campus there are several educational buildings, a high-rise building of the Student Center, as well as many sports facilities. </p>

    <h2>  Directions </h2><p>  Unfortunately, walking on the bridge will not succeed.  It is intended only for the movement of public and private vehicles, and today it is considered the fastest and most convenient road from the main part of the city of Vladivostok to the historical one.  However, even for drivers and passengers of cars, the passage on the bridge causes delight and admiration, since they find themselves at an altitude of 70 meters above the water surface. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Russian Bridge today is often used as a highway through which residents of Vladivostok go to the island of the same name on the weekend.  There is the historical part of the city, and the ruins of an old fortress have been preserved.  In addition, there are guns at the descent from the Russian bridge.  They once belonged to the Novosiltsevsky battery built in 1901. </p><p>  Some Vladivostok residents travel to Russky Island in summer to organize picnics and to sunbathe and swim.  In addition, some travel agencies organize sightseeing tours, including a tour of the city‚Äôs famous bridges.  A visit to the islands in Peter the Great Bay is also included in their program. </p>

This building is especially beautiful in the evening, in the lights of decorative lighting, so many travelers prefer to climb to the observation deck after sunset. </p>
