On the territory of the state are many attractions that combine centuries-old traditions with the latest achievements of civilization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alfanardubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of dubai" class="if uuid-2295220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2295220.jpg"></div><p>  Those who get into the UAE, of course, want, first of all, to see what he has already heard and read a lot about.  And there are plenty of such places.  Indeed, in this country there is a lot of the very same.  Here the highest skyscraper in the world was erected, and islands created by human hands.  This southern state has its own ski resort, and much more.  That is why, choosing excursions in the UAE for yourself, it is worth first of all carefully reading their list and prices in order to choose the most interesting for yourself from a huge list. </p><h2>  A little bit about the country </h2><p>  The administrative division of the UAE consists of seven emirates.  Before the unification of the state, they were separate principalities.  Among them are the following: Abu Dhabi and Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and <span>Dubai, Sharjah</span> and Fujairah, as well as Umm Al Qaiwain. </p><p>  In the occupied territory, the UAE is at 110th place in the world.  Their area is 86 thousand square meters.  km  The population density is approximately 100 people per square kilometer.  As for the latter indicator, when considering it, it is worth considering that almost 80% of the territory of the UAE is occupied by a lifeless desert.  Most of the population is concentrated on the coastline of the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many are mistaken in believing that the capital of the Emirates is the city of Dubai.  This is not true.  The political capital of the country is the city of Abu Dhabi, located in the largest emirate of the same name, which is located on the territory, accounting for 89% of the entire country.  The majority of the population of the Emirates lives here - 35%. </p><p>  As for Dubai, it is a recognized economic and tourist capital.  Its area is only 5% of the total, and the population is the same 35%.  That is why the emirate of Dubai is very crowded on its territory, which became the main reason for its expansion in the form of the creation of bulk islands, which today are one of the main attractions of the state.  Sand and stones taken from the desert (and there are a lot of them there) made it possible to build the island of Palma.  And if you are faced with the question of where to go on trips to the UAE, then it is worth noting that it is not recommended to miss such a sight.  So many tourists believe that when visiting the Emirates they will certainly strive to see such a miracle as a man-made island, on which there are not just houses, but whole skyscrapers.  And its inspection can be carried out as part of one of the most interesting excursions in the UAE. </p><h2>  Palm island </h2><p>  Getting acquainted with what kind of excursions are in the UAE, it is worth noting that due to the relatively small size of the country, you can visit any emirate here during the day, having reached it by bus.  The one who chose Dubai as his vacation destination is offered a city tour, which will definitely include a visit to the island of Palma.  It will be possible for those who stayed in other emirates to stay at these man-made structures.  Regardless of the place of residence of the tourist, he will also be offered interesting excursions to the UAE, which involve a visit to an artificial island, the size of which is such that it is visible even from space and is considered the second wonder of the world after the Great Wall of China.  The diameter of this structure is 6 km, and the length of its outer circle is 11 km. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.commitbiz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="palm island" class="if uuid-2295228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2295228.jpg"></div><p>  The UAE government has developed a large number of projects and plans related to bulk sand type islands.  After all, oil reserves in the country are not unlimited, and after the loss of the main resource for financing public spending, the tourism sector can become an excellent alternative.  His country is actively developing today, offering tourists diverse and very interesting excursions in the UAE.  At the moment, many of them involve a visit to the island of Palm Jumeirah.  This is the only completed grandiose project.  The construction of the island was started in 2001 and required about $ 7 billion.  Today it is one of the most famous attractions in the world, which can be seen by signing up for one of the most popular excursions in the UAE. </p><p>  Palm Island is located in the Persian Gulf.  Why does he have such a name?  Yes, because it is built in the form of a date palm, a plant, which is a symbol of the country.  Having implemented the plan, the UAE government has significantly extended the coastline of Dubai. </p><p>  The fact that the island looks like a palm tree is especially clearly visible from a height.  This is the only way to consider the "trunk" of the tree, as well as its "spreading crown", consisting of 17 branches.  The largest artificial reef in the world was built near the island.  Various marine creatures live in its waters, even those that are not characteristic of the area.  Thanks to this, the coastal waters of the island of Palma attract divers who come here from all over the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Anyone who chose to visit the island of Palma from a variety of excursions in the UAE, reviews about it leaves the most enthusiastic.  Tourists are attracted by the rich architecture of this place, which has 26 styles.  Among them are not only typically Arab, but also European. </p><p>  The island has everything you need for a carefree and comfortable stay.  It has many luxury hotels.  The most famous among them is Atlantis The Palm.  This hotel has a large number of boutiques and restaurants, as well as an aquarium and an aqua park. </p><p>  Otsrov offers entertainment for tourists of all ages.  For them, there are surfing and diving centers, a water entertainment center, a dolphinarium and much more. </p><p>  However, you can get to the island not only as part of the tour.  In the UAE, public transport is well developed.  It runs between the mainland and the island.  You can get to the territory of the latter by road.  However, the most convenient form of transport is still the monorail metro, by the way, the only one in the entire Middle East.  The capacity of its line is 40 thousand passengers (one way and the other).  The timetable for metro trains depends on the time of day.  So, during peak hours they collect passengers every 3-4 minutes.  The rest of the time, tourists are forced to wait for the arrival of the next train for 15 to 20 minutes.  The price of a one-way ticket for the subway is approximately $ 5 (20 dirhams). </p><p>  For those who are not interested in independent trips and who have chosen to visit the island of Palma in their own list of the best excursions in the UAE, they must contact one of the Dubai travel agencies.  Groups are formed for organized trips and directly to hotels. </p><h2>  Dubai </h2><p>  What excursions should a tourist visit in the UAE if he came to the country's economic capital for the first time?  Of course, first of all, you need to get acquainted with the city.  Of course, the first question in this case will be the following: "What are the excursions to visit in the UAE?"  The reviews of tourists who have already been here recommend starting your acquaintance with the city from an organized trip called Modern Dubai.  During this excursion, tourists get acquainted with the metropolis, called by many "Paris of the Persian Gulf."  Moreover, there are indeed similarities between these cities.  Today, Dubai is as gorgeous and smart as the capital of France.  On the territory of this metropolis there are a lot of amazing, interesting and very-most things that have no analogues in the world.

Tourists should keep in mind that bathing in it is not provided for by the tour plan.  If you wish, you can visit the water park on your own.  Those who nevertheless decided to do it in an organized manner should carefully study the description of excursions in the UAE and use another route option. </p><p>  The one who gets to know the city for the first time is better for a sightseeing trip.  The reviews of tourists visiting Dubai on a trip to the UAE indicate that they were also delighted by the moment when they watched the magnificent skyscrapers from the window of a bus traveling through the central part of the metropolis.

After sunset, Dubai is an extraordinary sight.  In its central part, a diverse and beautiful pendant attracts attention, which makes the city especially attractive and mysterious.  From Dubai, evening excursions to the UAE are also organized to the island of Palma.  Here at night the Atlantis Hotel is especially beautiful.  After that, the guide will certainly offer a walk along the Dubai Marina.  It literally drowns in the light of the lights that light up on countless skyscrapers located here.  The excursion group is waiting for a visit to a restaurant located in a five-star hotel.  Here, each of the guests will be offered a welcome drink for free. </p><p>  The excursion ‚ÄúNight Dubai‚Äù, as well as daytime, ends at the fountain show, which takes place late in the evening.
