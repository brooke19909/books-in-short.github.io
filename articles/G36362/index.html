    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Judging by the comments left, our compatriots were pleased with the rooms offered in the hotel in question.  Of course, since this is an economy hotel, you should not expect luxurious spacious apartments with new furniture and modern appliances.  However, there is everything necessary for living, the rooms are clean and comfortable.  In addition, the vast majority of tourists spent a little time at the hotel, coming here mainly just to spend the night.  A small minus, some tourists considered the lack of free Wi-Fi in the rooms.  So, you could connect to the Internet for about 300 rupees for several days of stay.  However, as travelers say, free Wi-Fi is available in almost all cafes and beaches, so you can always chat with family and friends staying at home. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in Nirvana Holiday Villas includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, they are standard for most 2- and 3-star hotels in Goa.  So, in the morning you will be offered scrambled eggs or omelet, vegetables, toasts with jam, fresh fruits, one Indian dish and tea or coffee.  In general, according to most tourists, this is enough to eat at the beginning of the day. </p><p>  Guests can also have lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Vacationers note that the cooking here is very good, and the prices are reasonable.  However, most tourists ate outside the hotel.  After all, both on the beaches and in the city there are lots of cafes for every taste. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The nearest beach from White Square Nirvana Holiday Villas 3 * (India, Goa) can be reached in about 10 minutes.  The hotel provides a beach shuttle twice a day.  So, a free bus for guests leaves the hotel at 10 a.m.  And at five in the evening you can return to the hotel territory on it.  You can also take a taxi or get to the coast in tuk-tuk.  Many travelers also prefer to rent a motorbike for their entire stay in Goa. </p><p>  After all, this opens up unlimited opportunities for movement around the island, and you can freely visit local attractions and various beaches.  In addition, renting a scooter will significantly save on taxis and tuk-tuk.  However, experienced travelers are advised to soberly assess their ability to manage a motorbike, taking into account the rather chaotic and also <span>left-hand traffic</span> in India.  However, most of our compatriots have no difficulties with this. </p><p>  As for the beaches themselves, despite the fact that Calangute is the closest to the hotel, tourists are advised to visit other places.  All the popular beaches on Goa have plenty of cafes and bars where you can have a bite to eat, have a drink and sit on comfortable sun loungers. </p>
