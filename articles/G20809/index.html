Moreover, these difficulties were associated not only with the rejection of consumers who preferred to purchase smartphone models from leading manufacturers.  Often, domestic manufacturers offered their customers outdated, uncompetitive solutions.  But now, in many ways, the situation has changed. </p><h2>  The modern digital technology market </h2><p>  It just so happened that each nation has its own unique features.  For example, the Germans are famous for the high quality of their cars, and Japan, China and Korea traditionally produce up to 90% of all electronic devices.  Indeed, if you carefully study the digital technology market, the vast majority of the represented companies will come from the east.  More than 70% of all equipment is made in China.  At the same time, some users are distrustful of eastern manufacturers and choose equipment from the USA and European countries.  However, Russian citizens can now not seek out a truly high-quality European brand, but pay attention to the respectable Russian phones and other new digital products of domestic production.  This fact is surprising for many, because who would have thought that in Russia they would start producing good smartphones and tablets.  There are not too many truly worthy companies, but they exist.  It should be noted right away that Russian technology refers to products of a Russian manufacturer, but not of a Russian production.  In the modern world it is much more expedient to place production in the <span>countries of the East</span> with cheaper labor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Highscreen - a leader among domestic manufacturers of digital technology </h2><p>  Perhaps, one should start with Highscreen as the most successful.  The company began operations in 2009 and is currently owned by Vobis Computer.  Initially, the company ordered equipment from Chinese manufacturers, changed the design and interface, and sold it under its own brand.  Such a Russian phone was notable for its decent build and workmanship and low price. </p>

    <p>  Of the models of recent years, Highscreen Boost 2 should be noted. The peculiarity of this smartphone is that this device can work up to two weeks from a single charge.  The kit includes two 6000 mAh and 3000 mAh batteries.  The Zera line of smartphones and the flagship Highscreen Thor also deserve attention. </p><h2>  Explay </h2><p>  Another respectable domestic company in the digital technology market is Explay.  The company was founded in 2005 and at first was exclusively engaged in the sale of music players and navigation equipment.  Since 2009, Explay has entered the top five best phone providers in the budget market.  New Russian phones from this manufacturer include many models with two SIM cards.  Of the new products, a few words should be said about the Explay Fresh smartphone, which has very good technical characteristics for a device of its class.  Quad-core processor, 5-inch IPS display, two SIM cards, Android 4.2 shell installed on top of Yandex.Shell. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Texet </h2><p>  Many have heard about the Texet brand, but not everyone knows that it represents Russian phones.  Cell phones of this brand have different diagonal screens, the line includes even a smartphone with 4 SIM cards.  The range also includes rugged smartphones designed specifically for builders, athletes, hunters, and military. </p>

    <p>  Texet can only be called Russian relative, since the brand‚Äôs products are manufactured by another <span>Chinese company.</span>  The company‚Äôs office is located in St. Petersburg, the year of foundation is 2004. In addition to low-cost mobile, it offers its customers portable radios, e-books, navigators and tablet computers. </p><h2>  Yota Devices - the pride of the domestic digital technology market </h2><p>  And one can not help but say a few words about such a company as Yota Devices - a truly domestic manufacturer that created a completely unique Russian mobile phone.  This relatively young company was founded in 2011 and became famous for the production of high-tech LTE equipment. </p>

    <p>  The first YotaPhone was introduced at the end of 2014.  It was the first of its kind Russian Yota phone <strong> </strong>  with two displays.  The first display has a regular 4.3-inch matrix.  And the second monitor is made using Eink technology, which is used in e-books.  The remaining characteristics of the smartphone were at the level of the beginning of 2013.  But already at the start of sales, the manufacturer requested about 20 thousand rubles for the device.  The smartphone was not as popular as the manufacturers planned.  Let us dwell on this interesting model in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  YotaPhone Review </h2><p>  Officially, the innovative Russian <span>phone with two screens</span> was presented at the CES exhibition, held in Las Vegas, where it became the best mobile device.  This model has no analogues.  The gadget with a unique idea was introduced to customers at the end of 2013.  What are the advantages of a smartphone with two displays?  If you use the E-ink monitor to view service messages, the battery is used more economically.  Such a display is easy to read, reduces eye strain, and reads well in the sun.  In addition, the smartphone has a productive chipset, although somewhat outdated, supports 4G networks, is the owner of 32 GB of internal memory and a 13 megapixel camera. </p>

    <p>  By its characteristics, this Russian-made phone turned out to be very interesting.  Its only drawback is the lack of Full HD, which is striking. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  If you compare YotaPhone with any of the modern fragments, it will be clearly visible how much less its monitor.  Moreover, the housing of the smartphone is hardly small.  Around the screen a large frame, a decent thickness.  It should be noted that the device looks more interesting from the rear than from the front.  And here the whole feature of the device is revealed - a curved Eink display. </p>

    <p>  Against the background of the flagships, Yota stands out with a thickness of almost 1 cm. The unique Russian mobile phone is not too heavy, but due to its wide enough frame and large sides, it seems very large.  Now global manufacturers of digital technology are trying to minimize the empty space around the screen so that the smartphone looks less bulky, but this is not the case with Yota.  The sides of the phone are covered with soft-touch plastic, the screens are covered with <span>Gorilla Glass, the</span> assembly is made at a very high level.  It is very nice to hold such a device in your hand, but due to the large thickness and angular shapes it is not too convenient. </p><p>  Above the display is a camera, speaker and a set of sensors.  The volume control button is located on the left side, and the power button is located not quite conveniently - on the upper end. </p><h2>  E-ink screen </h2><p>  The new Russian-made phone from Yota with an additional E-Ink display has no analogues on the market.  Often we do not release the smartphone from our hands, checking for news, notifications and messages.  At the same time, the backlight of the monitor requires a lot of energy, which negatively affects the battery life.  In the Yota phone, the necessary events will be displayed on both monitors, with EInk working independently of the main display, and its low power consumption allows for greater autonomy.  Important messages when using the additional screen will not go unnoticed, and the performance of the device will be much better. </p><p>  Events that fall on the secondary display are configured directly by the user.  You can set a list of topics from which contacts to display messages.  There are settings for all occasions, but we should not forget about the confidentiality of information, since the display works constantly.  In addition to various messages and notifications, it can show the weather.  You can also select background wallpapers and widgets.  While there are not too many programs, but over time, the list of available applications will expand. </p><p>  If you slide your fingers down the monitor, information from the main monitor will be displayed on the secondary display.  You can create important events on the calendar and receive notifications.  And of course, this screen is great for reading.  An additional monitor will not fade in the sun, which even the most advanced smartphones cannot boast of. </p><h2>  Main monitor </h2><p>  It should be said about the main monitor.  Its resolution is only 780 * 1280 pixels, excellent viewing angles, the glass does not have an air gap.  The maximum brightness is 550 cd / m2.  In this indicator, Yota is on par with the iPhone 5. The contrast ratio is also very good and reaches 745: 1.  Another advantage of this device is its excellent anti-reflective coating, which suppresses spurious reflections. </p><h2>  Testing YotaPhone </h2><p>  These external characteristics are distinguished by modern Russian phones.  Cell phones from Yota are original and have no world analogues.  Consider the internal component of the device.  The processor of the smartphone operates at a frequency of 1.7 GHz, has two cores and 2 GB of RAM.  In tests, this unit shows itself from an excellent perspective. </p><p>  There is no memory card, but it is unlikely to be needed with its own memory of 32 GB.  The speaker is very good, but the headphones have a small volume margin. </p><h2>  Russian phone Yota 2 </h2><p>  The second generation of phones from Yota introduced in Barcelona in 2014.  And if the first model can be considered a breakdown of the pen, the second generation has an excellent design, advanced features and great features for an additional monitor.  Russian telephone Yota 2 received awards at two exhibitions - MWC and CES. </p>

    <p>  He is not fat and heavy as his predecessor was.  The front panel has Super Amoled in five inches with a <span>resolution of 1080 * 1920.</span>  The second display is curved with <span>a screen resolution of</span> 460 * 960 pixels and a diagonal of 4.7. </p><h2>  Final YotaPhone Rating <strong></strong></h2><p>  The phone path from Yota was long and long.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa second monitor, duplicating the main one in order to reduce energy costs, is certainly excellent.  And if the first model had too many shortcomings, then Yota 2 turned out to be much more convenient and thought out.  However, the original development is very expensive, so the circle of potential consumers will be clearly narrowed.  On the side of YotaPhone is the originality of the idea that has become its symbol. </p>
