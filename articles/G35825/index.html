Types of non-equity securities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The existence of man at all times has been associated with the invention of new fields of activity.  This helped people to evolve and reach certain heights in their development.  Today, a person is not just a creature that is adapted for physical work, but a person whose inner world is meaningful and morally determined.  Together, these factors have spawned many different branches of modern science and technology.  It is also worth noting the exceptional importance of the financial sphere of activity.  Working with money has become one of the main attributes for people. </p><p>  If you pay attention to the state of modern markets, you can see that they are at the peak of their development.  Currency transactions allow people to create huge capital.  However, financial value is not only money, but also securities.  This terrible at first glance name characterizes a significant share of the modern market.  However, in the context of this article we will talk about a specific type of securities - non-issue documents.  They have many interesting characteristics, and are also valuable in their own way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-equity securities it" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The concept of securities </h2><p>  The turnover of financially significant documents is carried out on the stock market.  Securities, "walking" on it, have many features.  They are documents created within the established framework and having all the details required by applicable law on the basis of which the actual transfer of property rights from one person to another takes place.  The existence, circulation, issue of securities and other aspects of activity with them are enshrined in the provisions of various regulatory acts of our country.  Moreover, this category is so significant and extensive that it is quite possible to divide it into several types, one of which is <span>non-issue-grade securities.</span>  This allows you to study the category in more detail and highlight its key points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="issue of non-equity securities" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Securities Regulatory </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, there are certain legislative acts that enshrine the basic provisions on securities.  In this case, we are talking about a whole legislative system that governs the issue.  The structure of such regulations includes: </p><ul><li>  Constitution of the Russian Federation. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-equity securities" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503286.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  <span>Civil Code of the Russian Federation.</span> </li><li>  Federal laws: ‚ÄúOn the Securities Market‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn Joint-Stock Companies‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  It is in the provisions of these acts that you can find all statements about the documents presented in the article and their main features. </p><h2>  The concept of non-equity securities </h2><p>  Documents for the transfer of property rights are divided into several main types.  One of them is non-issue-grade securities.  These are documents, the release of which occurs in limited quantities and is not related to the procedure for their state registration.  In other words, non-issue-grade securities are not created for the masses, but in order to achieve any financial results.  Working with such documents is much easier, because they do not need to be legalized in the manner prescribed by law.  However, this fact does not exclude the extension of common features for securities to a non-issue type. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Properties of Non-Issued Securities </h2><p>  Legally relevant documents are always characterized by certain functional properties.  As for securities, they are also endowed with certain features that you need to know about.  Thus, non-issue documents have the following properties, namely: </p><ul><li>  appealability and accessibility for all citizens without exception; </li><li>  serialization and documentary; </li><li>  liquidity and market value; </li><li>  implementation risks, etc. </li></ul><p>  They are characterized by a specific issue (non-issue-grade securities are created randomly, without following any procedures). </p><p>  An important point is the very fact of state regulation of non-equity securities.  It testifies to the existence of an exceptional form and requirements for documents that must not be violated. </p><h2>  What securities are classified as non-issuable? </h2><p>  To date, the presented type of legally significant documents remains a mystery to many people, including economists.  Nevertheless, in non-issue-grade securities there is absolutely nothing complicated.  The main thing is to understand the types of documents that are among non-issuing documents, as well as know their most specific features.  This will allow you to fully explore the category and all its main points.  It follows that it is necessary to consider the following types of non-issue-grade securities, namely: </p><ul><li>  bills; </li><li>  checks </li><li>  bills of lading; </li><li>  depositor certificates of deposit. </li></ul><p>  Non-equity securities, the list of which is presented above, are endowed with many interesting points.  Therefore, each document must be considered separately from others. </p><h2>  Features of Bills </h2><p>  The very essence of the security is of great importance.  A prime example is a bill of exchange.  The turnover of this object is carried out by using the norms of special legislation.  Thus, bills of exchange, as non-issue-grade securities, are documents that certify a financial liability.  In other words, a bill represents a specific form of monetary agreement.  Today in the Russian Federation these securities are very popular in the field of financial activity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of non-equity securities" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503282.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that there are several varieties of bills, namely: simple and transferable.  In the first case, we are talking about the existence of an unconditional type of obligation, when a certain amount must be paid within the allotted time.  <span>A bill of exchange</span> has a completely different purpose.  It enshrines only a payment proposal addressed to the debtor.  Promissory notes are often characterized as non-issue-grade securities of the bank, because in the field of activity of precisely such organizations they are found most often. </p><h2>  Check concept </h2><p>  Another important document that is directly related to the bank is the check.  This security has nothing to do with promissory notes and other similar securities.  A check is a written order to issue money.  Moreover, the executor is, as a rule, a banking organization.  Such a non-issue-grade security is a rather convenient way of calculating and receiving money.  However, recently its popularity began to fall more and more.  This is due to the development of the information sphere and increasing the efficiency of electronic payment cards.  In simple terms, money can be received on a card much faster than with a security. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-equity securities market" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503284.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is a bill of lading? </h2><p>  The issue of non-equity securities occurs, as a rule, in the daily activities of certain enterprises, organizations and structures of a different nature.  An excellent example of this thesis is a bill of lading.  This security is a formatted document in a standard form.  An interesting fact is that bills of lading originated as a result of rich international practice in the field of transportation.  The bill of lading secures the exclusive right to load, unload and transport cargo from one point to another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-equity securities list" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Savings certificate statements </h2><p>  Certificates of deposit are currently characterized as non-issue-grade securities.  This is a document that confirms the rights of the depositor to receive interest on the future amount.  In other words, a certificate of deposit allows a bank client to earn money on the organization by pre-investing their own funds. </p><h2>  Non-equity securities market </h2><p>  The field of activity with the documents presented in the article is limited, as a rule, to work in a certain field.  The absence of a centralized issue does not allow trading in non-issuable securities.  Nevertheless, on the Internet today you can find many records about the "non-issue-type securities market".  As we understand it, its existence is impossible, since non-issue documents are not the object of sale and bargaining. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what securities are classified as non-issuable" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1503288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, in the article we examined the main non-issue-grade securities.  Of course, other categories are assigned to this type of documents, however, the four types described are the most popular in the Russian Federation.  Activities with securities is quite simple and operational.  Let's hope that the legislator will not change these advantages in the near future. </p>
