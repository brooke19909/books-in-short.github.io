As the guests claim, the hotel does not remember the theft cases.  Cleaning is done daily, and quite high quality. </li><li>  <em>Beach.</em>  According to holidaymakers, the beach here is quite spacious, everyone has enough sunbeds.  Mattresses are free.  The sand is clean, but still you can often see small debris.  The sea is quite clean, but sometimes it storms, and then it seems dirty, why do not really want to go into it.  Along the coast there are many algae.  Vacationers did not notice jellyfish.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, convenient.  The sea is quite warm, the water temperature is about 25 degrees. </li></ul>
