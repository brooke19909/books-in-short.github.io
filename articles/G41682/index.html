This is a fairly ancient city, the first mentioning of which was recorded in the annals of 1146.  There is definitely something to see here: the local Kremlin and other Tula attractions are waiting for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of tula" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/302743.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <h3>  <strong>Tula Kremlin</strong> </h3><p>  The visiting card of the village is the <span>Tula Kremlin.</span>  This magnificent building was built in the years 1514-1521 on the banks <span>of the Upa River.</span>  The Kremlin was extremely necessary, since this territory was at that time the southern outskirts of the state and was constantly attacked by enemies.  He became the center of the city and its main artery.  It was thanks to this building that in 1552 the city held back the siege of the troops of Khan Devlet I Giray.  The Kremlin has a rectangular shape, fenced with brick walls with 9 towers.  This is not all the <span>sights of Tula,</span> so we move on. </p><h3>  <strong>Annunciation Church</strong> </h3><p>  The oldest building in Tula after the Kremlin is the picturesque Annunciation Church.  As the inscription on the stone slab says, it was built in 1692.  By the end of the 17th century, the wooden church was almost destroyed, and a stone church was built in its place.  According to the type of construction, the Annunciation Church can be attributed to the ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù churches: the refectory (the so-called warm extension) adjoins it on the west side, the apse is on the east side, and the bell tower is located behind the refectory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tula city attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/302742.jpg" width="300"></div>
