    <h2>  Climate in Kirillovka </h2><p>  Climatic and natural conditions have a beneficial effect on the development of marine flora and fauna.  Sea storms mix water with bottom rocks.  Due to this, the water of the Sea of ​​Azov includes about a hundred chemical elements.  The climate in the village is warm steppe.  In summer, the air temperature is +21 ° C, in winter - -6 ° C.  In summer, a small amount of rainfall occurs in Kirillovka.  The sea in Kirilovka warms up to +28 ° C and above.  Due to the gentle coast, the coastal waters have time to warm up by the end of spring, so in this area the holiday season begins a month earlier than on the Black Sea. </p><p>  The height of the holiday in Kirillovka falls in mid-June and until mid-September.  The Azvian Sea is not as deep as the Black Sea, therefore it is considered a great place to relax with children.  One of the comfortable recreation centers in this area is Sunny Beach.  Kirillovka has another plus.  It consists in the fact that the Sea of ​​Azov will not bother with swimming seaweed and jellyfish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The history of Kirillovka dates back to 1805.  Its founders were Dukhobor sectarians who, without their consent, were resettled here from Russian provinces.  The first resident was Kirill Kapustin.  In honor of his name, the village is named.  Already in 1838 the population of Kirillovka increased to 130 people.  After some time, the local Dukhobors were sent to the Caucasus.  After 1864, Cossacks from the Azov army became residents of Kirillovka.  They were given the task of protecting the territory during the Crimean War.  Settlers were also fugitive recruits and those who had previously been in serfdom.  The population raised livestock and was engaged in agriculture.  In 1890, F. Nalivaiko discovered the healing properties of estuary mud.  Soon he built a mud bath on the Dairy Estuary, but an official institution of this type was opened in the 1920s. </p><p>  Kirillovka is a resort that attracts vacationers with spacious sandy beaches, warm gentle sea and healing air that saturates the body with microelements and promotes healing.  This is the best place for those who prefer comfort, chic nature and value their health! </p><h2>  Infrastructure of Kirillovka </h2><p>  Holidays in Kirilovka, the prices for which are quite reasonable, annually attract a huge number of vacationers.  The village is simply teeming with entertainment, and each of the visiting guests without fail finds for themselves something suitable.  There are a huge number of cafes, bars, sea attractions.  Tourists who come to rest in Kirillovka visit places such as the Oscar Dolphinarium and Treasure Island water park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The infrastructure of the village is not much different from the city.  There is a bus station in Kirillovka, there are markets, shops, ATMs, a cinema.  It is important to note that there is no railway station in Kirillovka, but this does not complicate the transfer of tourists.  At the peak of the season, buses and fixed-route taxis leave every 15-20 minutes from the bus and railway stations.  When planning to send home, it is worth ordering tickets a few days before the trip, as the bus station is crowded during the holiday season. </p><p>  In the village of Kirillovka, the Sunny Beach base is ready to welcome tourists from May to mid-September. </p><p>  If there is a route Kirillovka - Peresyp Spit, "Sunny Beach", then it is not difficult to implement.  Traffic in this area works great.  The center of the village is the administrative part, where the main components of the infrastructure are located.  For the comfort of tourists on the spits of Peresyp and Fedotov, rental boats, catamarans, scooters, parachutes and other attractions of such a plan are provided. </p><h2>  Housing in Kirillovka </h2><p>  In the center, vacationers, as a rule, are offered accommodation in guest houses and rooms in the private sector.  Housing prices in the central part differ from other places.  Here they are much lower.  This is because the private sector can please tourists with less comfortable living conditions in terms of infrastructure.  Often these are rooms in a guest house where you have to share the kitchen with other vacationers.  All amenities in many cases are provided on site. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  It is also worth noting that the private sector is located at a remote distance from the <span>coast of the Sea of ​​Azov,</span> therefore, to get to the beach on foot, you need to spend 15-30 minutes.  The lack of their own access to the sea in the center of the village affects the cost of vacation in Kirilovka.  Prices for accommodation at the bases located on the braids are much higher compared to hotels located in the village itself.  Accommodation on the first line will cost 1000-1500 rubles (350-550 UAH) per room per day. </p><h2>  Fedotova spit </h2><p>  <span>Fedotova spit</span> is an alluvial sand spit, the length of which is 45 km.  It is the border for the Sea of ​​Azov and Ulutsky estuary.  The spit is covered with sand and shell rock.  In these places, tourists have the opportunity to relax on the spacious sandy beaches.  In the center of the spit is the village of Stepok.  There are many private facilities and several guest houses.  Fedotova Spit has more than 150 recreation centers, so everyone can find the most suitable option for themselves from a financial point of view.  Fedotova spit boasts a developed infrastructure.  On its territory there is a chic water park called “Treasure Island”, an Oscar dolphinarium, Luna Park, where you can ride a Ferris wheel and enjoy beautiful views of the sea and the estuary.

The development of resort areas in this place began in the USSR period.  Many guest houses have dining rooms where guests can order a comprehensive meal. </p>
