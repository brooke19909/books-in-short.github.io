    <h2>  Ready objects </h2><p>  The pioneer in the construction of completely new objects for the city in St. Petersburg is <span>RosStroyInvest.</span>  <span>The feedback from</span> real estate investors was primarily inspired by magnificent fountain complexes <span>(Lenin Square,</span> Finland Station, Moscow Square), where light and music shows became the favorite spectacles of Petersburgers.  Visitors willingly and for a long time walk here, one can say that the fountains began to play the role of the city's calling card. </p><p>  The skyscraper ‚ÄúAlexander Nevsky‚Äù, also the brainchild of the company ‚ÄúRosStroyInvest‚Äù, became a special pride of the second capital.  Reviews of real estate investors mention the unique panoramic view of the river and the whole city from the observation platforms of St. Petersburg.  And, of course, the apartments of the residential complex - there is truly a new quality and absolute convenience.  The architecture of the city, magnificent in this respect, not only did not suffer from innovations, high-rise residential complexes only complemented and adorned St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Report </h2><p>  Since the inception, buildings with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than one million square meters have been commissioned.  All this was built by the <span>RosStroyInvest</span> construction company <span>.</span>  Investors' <span>reviews</span> list the advantages of commissioned buildings as unique in architectural solutions, in the development of infrastructure of all residential complexes, and also note the relative availability of high comfort. </p><p>  In addition, excellent transport accessibility distinguishes all commissioned facilities.  The apartments have high-quality finishes from the best materials, extremely comfortable layouts.  RosStroyInvest has always rented out new buildings and is delivering them on time, which, of course, is expected by each client who plans to purchase an apartment directly from the developer.  If a person is oriented correctly, he does not fail, making such an important purchase.  Choosing a company is the most important thing.  RosStroyInvest (St. Petersburg) selects reliability. </p>

    <h2>  Activities </h2><p>  In choosing a developer it is also important to inquire about the number of completed orders from the state and the scheme for concluding an apartment sales contract.  In its activities, the company "RosStroyInvest" chooses a large scale construction work.  Its assets include designing and reconstruction of both local and federal significance; much has been done in the framework of the state order.  For example, the aforementioned musical and light fountain complexes.  A lyceum of radio engineering was built on the Smolenka embankment, in the Nevsky district - a beautiful building of the police department, where Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev attended the opening ceremony. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is simply impossible to list all the projects in this article, and therefore we will dwell on some, but we will do a more specific and wide overview.  The developer "RosStroyInvest" puts high responsibility to customers, its facilities guarantee reliability and quality.  That is why the company was awarded a number of prestigious awards, including in the project "Builder of the Year".  RosStroyInvest sells apartments with an additional guarantee of protection of all interests of clients, registering contracts, clearly agreeing with the Federal Law on shared construction.  This company can be trusted. </p><h2>  On the banks of the Neva </h2><p>  At the "Real Estate Fair" it was announced the sale of finished apartments of the next stage of construction of residential complexes "Peter and Catherine the Great", being built near the metro station "Rybatskoe" on the <span>banks of the Neva.</span>  Among the apartments for sale there are studios, one-, two- and three-room apartments, which are offered both complete with decoration and without it.  RosStroyInvest does not raise prices, despite the times of the global crisis.  This offer was the most advantageous in the real estate market. </p><p>  For example, a studio of twenty-five square meters costs only a half million rubles.  There are installment programs without interest with a down payment of ten percent, and the price of the apartment remains the same as it would be with a 100% payment.  The main banks of the city provide mortgage programs.  This is an extremely good price for high quality construction.  Each apartment has magnificent glazing, spacious balconies - up to twelve square meters.  Silent high-speed elevators, wheelchairs, intercoms.  And the design decoration of the halls, with which little can be compared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  There are two residential buildings in the complex: twenty-four and thirty-two floors, where there are premises for shops and other services.  There is a kindergarten, an educational center and a museum exhibition in the cultural center.  Themed playgrounds have already been organized, as well as recreation areas and walkways.  Motorists will receive indoor parking, as well as an outdoor car park. </p><p>  The architecture of the complex is original, despite the fact that it preserves the purity of style, because the images of this ensemble represent the great Russian emperor and empress.  The species characteristics of this residential complex are simply excellent: most of them overlook the bend of the Neva and the city.  Other commissioned and still under construction, but already well-known complexes: "House with chimes", "Alexander Nevsky", "Old Fortress", "Morning Star", "Kremlin Stars", "City of Masters", "Golden Domes", "Strawberry Glade "- accepted into their ranks no less remarkable creation from RosStroyInvest. </p><h2>  Specifics </h2><p>  The personalities of the great Russian emperors inspired the RosStroyInvest group of companies so much that the buildings are not inferior to them in regal grandeur.  In addition, the picturesque place, as if personifying the country that the emperors ruled over, adds to the atmosphere of this complex a sense of beauty and comfort.  Moreover, the infrastructure, both internal and external, is very well developed.  The views are simply breathtaking, not only the bend of the river is visible, but also a forest park and an exceptionally beautiful city. </p><p>  The location of this <span>residential complex</span> provides the most optimal transport accessibility: the Ring Road is close, which is very convenient for motorists, there is a guest parking.  Social routes are quite ramified and are still developing, although residents now do not wait for long periods at stops.  And lovers on foot will be delighted with the beautiful scenery of the picturesque surroundings.  The distance to the metro is about two kilometers.  The maximum of services, however, can be obtained directly inside the residential complex: a kindergarten is in the yard, a school is close.  This is a modern corner of the Nevsky district, provided with all social infrastructure, one of the most beautiful places in St. Petersburg, as well as one of the most comfortable. </p>

A studio costs 1,622,070 rubles, for example, and a three-room apartment starts at 4,512,600 rubles.

    <h2>  LCD "City of Masters" </h2><p>  RosStroyInvest presented St. Petersburg residents another magnificent residential complex within the city.  Monolithic reinforced concrete with a hinged ventilated porcelain tile facade soared to a height of sixteen floors, where there is affordable housing comfort.  Only one and three bedroom apartments are provided here, not too burdensome for the price, compared with other developers.  In the depths of a quiet quarter you can breathe easily and freely, despite the location in the city center.  You can forget about it, without going far anywhere. </p><p>  The architecture is unique, since the project was created in a synthesis of arts, a bright and unique contribution was made to the formation of the character of St. Petersburg by this building.  Neo-Gothic and Classicism, Art Nouveau, Baroque and Constructivism - all this is inherent in the city.  Here the styles became friends in close communication - in the design of individual fragments of sixteen-story buildings, forming two half-cars, where the courtyards are separate.  A miniature separate city in the city, where associations with various guilds of masters are born, whose work adorned different eras. </p>
