The needlewoman knows that any images on the fabric have their own special meanings.  Since each drawing on the canvas is symbolic, it is not by chance that women choose butterflies on the patterns of embroidery with beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twlwone.appspot.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Butterfly Buneopsis" class="if uuid-3091315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3091315.jpg"></div><h2>  The miracle of God's creation </h2><p>  Nature has created many beautiful creatures that are so unique and inimitable in their beauty. </p><p>  Butterfly is an amazing insect, which in different cultures symbolizes the ability to transform and transform.  It is a symbol of the soul and immortality.  This is an amazing creation of God that women try to embroider in paintings in order to decorate their homes with them and bring happiness to them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded picture" class="if uuid-3091219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/118445/3091219.jpg"></div><h2>  Symbolism in the cultures of the world </h2><p>  Butterfly on beadwork patterns is a fairly common image.  In many countries, women are very sensitive to these paintings in the house. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since ancient times, peoples of different countries associated butterflies with higher sacraments.  Who would have thought that such a small creature is capable of such grandiose transformations.  The butterfly transformation cycle has been linked to human life.  The caterpillar was considered a mundane life in material cares, the chrysalis - a kind of escape from fuss, and the butterfly - the resurrection of the soul and gaining freedom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of embroidered butterflies" class="if uuid-3091217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/118445/3091217.jpg"></div><p>  In China, this insect has for centuries been known as immortality.  Therefore, to present a picture-embroidery with beads according to the "Butterfly" pattern is considered a benevolent sign of attention and a wish for longevity and health. </p><p>  In ancient Mexico, a butterfly was attributed to the attributes of the god of spring, greenery and lush vegetation - Xocipilla.  He was associated with the sun, bringing fiery warmth. </p><p>  In Japan, a young girl is associated with a fluttering butterfly, which protects home comfort and warmth.  She is considered a family charm.  It is not surprising that women choose precisely butterflies on beadwork patterns to decorate their homes. </p><h2>  The connection of the Great Goddess with a butterfly in the ancient history of mankind </h2><p>  Did you know that long ago there was a supreme deity that was associated with a fluttering insect?  It was the Great Mother Goddess.  She personified both heaven and earth, or rather life and death.  From these times it was considered auspicious to have beadwork with a butterfly on a black background.  This sign symbolically united the afterlife and the world of the living.  The white butterfly, which fluttered against a black background, gave a feeling of a surge of energy, strength and health. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="on a black background" class="if uuid-3091332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3091332.jpg"></div><p>  The butterfly remains symbolic even in religion.  In Christianity, she personifies life, death, and resurrection.  If you look closely at religious paintings, you can often see a butterfly in the infant hand of Jesus Christ, as a symbol of rebirth and resurrection of the soul. </p><p>  Among the Slavs, the insect was primarily associated with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe soul.  People talked about the butterfly as the soul of the deceased or a harbinger of death.  As you understand, there is quite a bit of symbolism in such a small fluttering insect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thrtnfiv.appspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="butterfly embroidery patterns" class="if uuid-3091648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133/3091648.jpg"></div><p>  Each needlewoman should pay attention to ready-made kits for embroidery with beads of butterflies.
