    <h2>  Novia Lucida Beach: traveler reviews from Russia </h2><p>  As you know, today a lot of people when planning a trip pay great attention to the issue of choosing a hotel.  And this applies to both domestic and foreign hotels.  The modern traveler is no longer satisfied with the official description of the hotel and the advice of the manager of the travel agency, but also tries to study the maximum possible number of comments of those who have already visited the place of interest to him.  This approach allows you to create a more complete and closer to reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you during your vacation.  After all, no one wants to come on vacation to experience unpleasant surprise.  In this regard, we suggest you save time and effort in searching and get acquainted with the generalized reviews of our compatriots who had a rest in the five-star Turkish hotel ‚ÄúNovia Lucida Beach‚Äù.  It is immediately worth noting that the vast majority of comments are positive, because almost all tourists were very pleased with their choice.  As for the details, we will talk about them later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="novia lucida beach hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/993848.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to vacationers, the apartments are quite spacious, pleasantly decorated, bright.  It is noticeable that recently a repair was made.  The appliances and furniture in the rooms are new, everything is in working order.  If some kind of breakdown happens, then after contacting the reception the problem will be fixed as soon as possible.  There were no particular complaints about the work of the maids at the hotel.  So, they cleaned every day, replenished supplies of bath-toiletries and the contents of the minibar.  Bed sheets and towels were updated regularly.  As some guests noted in their reviews, sometimes the maids forgot to put fresh towels or soap supplies.  In this case, just call the reception, and you will quickly bring everything you need. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Our compatriots also liked the fact that during check-in the administrators do everything possible so as not to condemn the guests who arrived early for a long wait.  So, upon arrival at the hotel, they will immediately put on your bracelets and offer to go for a snack or take a fact-finding walk around the territory.  If the hotel has available rooms of the category you have booked, you will be offered to check in almost immediately after arrival.  Otherwise, you have to wait until the previous guests have left.  But, as tourists note in their reviews, almost everyone managed to get into rooms not at the scheduled two o'clock in the afternoon, but much earlier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="novia lucida beach reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/993847.jpg" width="600"></div>

The only drawback, according to our compatriots, was the fact that there was not such a wide selection of Turkish desserts, so beloved by many tourists.  However, they could be fully enjoyed during Turkish evening, when the restaurant serves local cuisine, and guests are entertained by national dances and music. </p><p>  Many guests also note very tasty pizza and other similar dishes in their reviews, which during the day could always be enjoyed in the snack bar.

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  For tourists traveling during the swimming season on the coast of Turkey, this issue is more than relevant.  Judging by the comments of our compatriots, at Novia Lucida Beach Hotel you can safely count on an excellent beach holiday.  So, the distance from the hotel to the sea is only a couple of hundred meters.  The beach here is pebble.  The entry into the water is the same.  Moreover, it is necessary to walk a few meters to the depth, so that children and people who do not know how to swim will be comfortable here.  Many tourists in their reviews note that the water even near the coast is very clean.  You can even see small fish that strive to lightly bite your leg.  According to the guests, the sensations from this are not painful at all, but, on the contrary, pleasant.  The hotel does not have its own pier.  But many tourists used the pier of the neighboring Xena Hotel. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, there is a sufficient number of sun loungers and parasols.  Moreover, they do not need to be occupied early in the morning, as there are enough sun loungers for everyone.  Beachboy will always be happy to move the lounger as you like.  By the way, some vacationers in their comments note that they liked to lie directly on the pebbles, laying a towel.  By the way, the beach offers a beautiful view: on the one hand the azure sea, and on the other - the hotel and beautiful mountains.  Many travelers are pleased to note that it is always clean.  After all, on the beach not only ballot boxes are installed in a large number, but also a cleaner works tirelessly. </p><p>  A small minus was considered by some tourists the fact that used beach towels for clean ones can be exchanged at a not very convenient time (from 8:30 to 10:30).  However, most vacationers would like to be able to exchange towels after dinner, on the way from the beach to the room. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Many tourists praise the large pool available on the territory of Novia Lucida Beach (Turkey, Kemer).  It is equipped with sections of different depths, as well as water slides.  So both children and adults can relax here.  Nearby there is a sun terrace with lots of sun loungers.  However, according to our compatriots, hotel guests occupy almost all the sun loungers early in the morning.  Moreover, during the day there are not so many people by the pool.  There is also a bar with a wide selection of drinks and snacks. </p><p>  The hotel is entertained by animators all day.  They unobtrusively offer everyone who wants to do aerobics, water aerobics, step, yoga, dance a zumba, shoot archery or an air rifle, take part in funny contests, and also play beach volleyball or darts. </p><p>  In the evening, entertainment shows are held for hotel guests.  This is done by the forces of both animators and guest artists.  After the show, a fun disco takes place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="novia lucida beach ex lucida beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/993844.jpg" width="600"></div>
