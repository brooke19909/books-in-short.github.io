A modern house is filled with electrical equipment, devices and appliances, which are supplied from a regular 220 V network. It is obvious that a typical service line cannot always guarantee the stability of circuit parameters, so ordinary consumers are faced with the task of choosing a suitable UPS.  APC Back-Ups CS <span>650VA (BK650EI)</span> is included in the middle segment of household stabilizers that are suitable for protecting a standard set of equipment.  APC strived to create a high-quality and functional device in accordance with the corporate principles of UPS development.  In many ways, it turned out, but for the final choice, it‚Äôs still worthwhile to become more familiar with the capabilities of this device. </p>

During operation, the device should not be exposed to sunlight, elevated temperature and humidity.  Connection points should be protected from contact with liquids.  Before the first, the use of the UPS must be fully charged - it should take at least 8 hours. </p><p>  After the first start-up, two indicators should light up through the power button: green indicates the presence of power from the network, and yellow indicates that a self-test has been carried out.  After a while, in normal mode, the APC BK650EI should leave only one - a green signal.  This will indicate the operational status of the device.  If the green light initially turned on without yellow, it means that the battery is not connected.  This will be additionally reported by a red indicator, as well as a sound signal.  Other informants and signals should be considered separately. </p><h2>  Status and Accident Informants </h2><p>  During operation, even with the battery connected, a red indicator will indicate cases when the energy consumption exceeds the power potential of the UPS itself.  It is equally important to monitor the sound signals that the buzzer sounds.  So, if the device goes into battery mode, four signals will be notified about this every 30 seconds.  A constant signal with a constant tone indicates overload of the outputs, which provide for the possibility of power supply from the battery pack. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the device does not pass regular self-test tests, a high-pitched signal will indicate this.  Provided in the APC BK650EI and a kind of mechanical informant.  The safety system button, which is located on the rear side of the unit, leaves the pressed position if a reboot causes the device to disconnect from the mains.  In this case, it is recommended to disconnect devices that are less important at the moment from the device. </p><h2>  Connect to target devices </h2>

    <p>  The unit has four outlets for servicing target devices.  Three of them provide backup power supply, and the fourth only provides protection against power surges. </p><p>  Moreover, among the functions of the backup part, voltage equalization and suppression of the unwanted electromagnetic background are also listed.  Connect appliances and equipment to outlets only when the UPS unit is turned off.  APC Back-Ups CS BK650EI connects to the network and starts via the button only when all target consumers are connected to it.  Further, in the event of a power failure in the network, the apparatus will begin to provide energy if it is in the on state. </p><p>  If the UPS is disconnected from the mains and from the battery pack, then voltage will not be supplied to consumers.  However, the outlet, which is responsible only for voltage equalization, will provide power even when it is turned off, but subject to the availability of mains power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Battery Replacement Instructions </h2>

    <p>  UPS batteries are, in a sense, consumables.  At high loads in continuous use, updating the battery will be a normal measure.  To replace, turn the case on its side, slide and remove the battery cover.  The battery itself extends so that it does not damage and the communication elements with terminals and wiring can be released.  Now you can reverse drive the new battery to power the APC BK650EI.  The price of batteries is within 1 thousand rubles.  For comparison: the block itself in this modification can be purchased for 7-8 thousand. </p><p>  As for the connection, the red cable connects to the positive terminal, and the black cable to ground.  The compartment with the new battery closes until a distinct click is heard.  By the way, the need to update the battery does not have to be associated with its damage and complete loss of performance.  Often it is updated due to a significant loss of capacity, and this process is inevitable.  The first signs of loss of useful potential may appear within a month.  In the future, the intensity of capacity reduction will depend on the nature of the operation of the UPS. </p>

    <h2>  Sensitivity Adjustment Instructions </h2><p>  Typically, ordinary UPS owners do not use this opportunity, but if serviced devices are increasingly sensitive to input voltage levels, then the setup procedure is indispensable.  Regulation in this case is not only a way to increase stabilization efficiency, but also a condition for the electrical safety of the APC BK650EI unit.  Instructions for setting sensitivity parameters provide the following sequence of actions: </p><ul><li>  The device is connected to the network. </li><li>  The start button is activated and held for 10 seconds, after which all indicators light up - a sign that the device has entered programming mode.  At this stage, a table will be displayed with the designation of the current voltage and sensitivity parameters. </li><li>  To decrease the sensitivity, press the button until the yellow indicator blinks. </li><li>  A similar action is performed before the yellow and red indicators light up, if you need to set the average sensitivity level. </li><li>  For the upper level you will need yellow and two red indicators. </li><li>  If you want to exit the mode without changes, the button is pressed until one green light flashes. </li><li>  If in programming mode the user does not perform any manipulations in 5 seconds, the device will automatically exit from it and return to its previous state. </li></ul><h2>  Machine Maintenance </h2><p>  During maintenance, the functional elements of the device should be checked.  For example, the fuse box is removed, inspected for damage and installed in its original position.  Then its function is checked by the indicators and the button of its launch.  A similar procedure is performed with the battery.  If too low a voltage is observed, then the first thing to check is the quality of the power supply from the main line.  To do this, it is recommended to connect a lamp to a conventional outlet and evaluate the quality of illumination.  Also, the integrity of the APC BK650EI enclosure should be checked regularly, and dust and dirt should be cleaned of its surface.  Special attention should be paid to sockets and ports that have not been used for a long time.  Again, you should not expose the unit to excessive physical exertion and the risks of waterlogging. </p>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The model has a long history of being in the market, so owners have been testing its capabilities for years.  And even 10 years of operation did not disappoint many users in the main operating parameters.  In conditions of constant power outage, the device stably replenishes power, extending the operating time by several minutes.  As the average computer maintenance practice shows, the APC Back-Ups BK650EI uninterruptible power supply is capable of supporting its operation for about 30 minutes.  Of course, this applies to cases of unloading other outlets.  Users note the ease of maintenance with the replacement of the same battery.  Both the case and components are provided with thoughtful ergonomic devices for assembly and disassembly. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are some complaints about the correct operation of the indicators and the capacitive resource of the battery, but this is rather an exception to the rule.  But the mass of the case and its impractical white color got unambiguously negative judgments.  The fact is that the <span>APC</span> BK650EI <span>uninterruptible power supply</span> is heavy enough for regular transport, for example, to the country.  There are also comments on the price level, but the cost below 7 thousand rubles only in rare cases can provide the device of the same reliability. </p><h2>  Finally </h2>

    <p>  The model is an optimized and balanced solution for the needs of an undemanding user.  All equipment in the house with the capacities of this unit cannot be serviced, but computer support with peripheral devices is quite possible.  And the APC BK650EI unit itself is focused on the control and management tools of a new generation.  It includes a USB cable, a disk for programming the regulation functions, and an RS 232 cable. On the whole, it turned out to be a functional, ergonomic source of voltage maintenance in the event of an accident, which, although it cannot boast of increased performance, is within its task range performs properly. </p>
