Perhaps, recently these countries can be considered one of the most popular.  Tourists from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus with great pleasure go on vacation there.  And this is far from accidental.  These states willingly open visas to our citizens, requesting a very modest package of documents, and a lot of attractions, as a rule, appeal to everyone, even the most capricious travelers. </p><p>  By the way, in the old days, in a purely practical sense, for example, the border of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was always considered one of the simplest, there were almost no traffic jams, and the staff was distinguished by amazing politeness and a high level of professionalism.  In Hungary, there was always a sympathetic attitude towards young travelers, special attention was paid to married couples, sometimes they were even missed without much screening and queuing. </p><p>  What has changed now?  Will not those who traveled in this place 10, or even 15 years ago, be disappointed? </p><p>  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Slovakia - Czech Republic.

This event occurred in the ninth century, far from us.  The sanction, issued at the beginning of the XVIII century, according to which all Czech lands were included in the structure of Austria-Hungary, abolished this cordon.

    <p>  However, in 1918, when the independence of Poland and Czechoslovakia was fully restored, the border reappeared and existed until 1939, after which, in connection with the proclamation of Slovakia as an independent country, a border was created between Poland and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, which lasted until the outbreak of World War II .  It disappeared because the Soviet-German agreement on the borders established in the occupied territory of Poland was signed. </p><p>  In 1958, a cordon between the countries was again created and territories were exchanged as part of border adjustment.  In particular, Poland transferred 1205.9 ha to Czechoslovakia, and 837.46 ha to Czechoslovakia to Poland.  This fact led both countries to the so-called ‚Äúborder debt‚Äù, which amounted to 368 hectares.  The Czech-Polish Border Commission has been regulating this debt since 1992. </p><p>  Three years ago, Czech radio broadcast a message that the Czech Ministry of Internal Affairs wants to give Poland 365 hectares of territory located in the Liberec Region and on the so-called Friedlant Peninsula, between Swierad√≥w-Zdr√≥j and Bogatynia.  The day after this announcement, Polish Minister Jerzy Miller publicly stated that such a correction of the borders had nothing to do with border debt, but only with the administrative procedures that needed to be carried out as a result of changes in river valleys. </p><h2>  Opinions of residents of border areas </h2>

    <p>  However, a few years ago, the region, which lay near the border ‚ÄúSlovakia - Czech Republic,‚Äù suffered enormously from unemployment.  In particular, the Czechs themselves found it difficult to find a job there, which, of course, was not good. </p><p>  Now, after the accession of both countries to the European Union, this problem has disappeared. </p><h2>  The nuances of crossing the border.  Are they there? </h2><p>  Due to the Schengen agreement between the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic, crossing the cordon does not cause any difficulties. </p><p>  Unless border guards from Poland and Serbia can stop a car or even a bus and check documents, as well as search, which will take at least an hour. </p><p>  But for the most part, crossing the border is calm and quick. </p>
