    <p>  A person perceives the world subjectively, with the help of his own sensations, which are sometimes deceiving.  It seems to us that the Earth’s surface is flat, it itself is motionless, and the Sun revolves around the Earth.  But the knowledge gained back in school tells us the opposite.  Not the Sun “rises and sets,” but the Earth rotates around its own axis, which creates the illusion of the rising and <span>setting of the Sun.</span>  The sunrise and sunset we observe is the objective reality subjectively perceived by us. </p><p>  Philosophers (materialists and <span>objective idealists,</span> in contrast to subjective idealists) will explain to us that the world exists independently of the consciousness of the subject perceiving it. </p><p>  Objective reality for a materialist is something, a kind of mechanism that works on its own in accordance with the laws of nature.  Representatives of agnosticism believe that it is unknowable in principle.  Materialists believe that the world is knowable, but this process is endless in its approach to the truth.  And only <span>subjective idealists</span> (solipsists) prove to us that objective reality does not exist at all, but only a complex of our sensations, perceptions, and ideas about the world.  And this is the true reality, in their opinion. </p><p>  Reality and reality are parallel concepts, but differing in meaning. </p><p>  Reality (translated from Latin as “real”, “material”) is that which exists independently of the subject, it can be possible and real. </p><p>  The category of reality expresses the aspect of continuous movement, constant change.  Reality is <span>the being of</span> being in action.  That is how objective reality reveals itself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At Aristotle, the concepts of energeia ("energy") and entelechia ("completeness", "fulfillment") are quite close, that is, if we simplify its complex constructions a little, we can see that it brings together essence and movement.  We can find world perception through energy, movement in <span>German classical philosophy,</span> in Protestant ethics, in Hegelian dialectics, and also in phenomenology.  The German philosopher M. Eckhart introduces the concept of wirklichkeit ("reality") as a translation from the Latin language - effective.  Note that in German, as in Russian, the category of reality contains an element of action, in Latin and Greek it is closer to truth, and in English and French to reality.  If we consider social reality, then the component of the action there is very important and significant, since it is constructed, created by people. </p><p>  Physical reality is a concept that characterizes the primary empirical basis of natural science theories.  This fundamental principle can be fixed and modeled in various ways, presented at various levels of the cognitive process.  The term “physical reality” itself was coined by Albert Einstein.  This category, on the one hand, is connected with the content of the concept of “objective reality”, by which scientists understand the physical world, and on the other hand, with the categories of <span>subject and object of cognition.</span> </p><p>  Therefore, physical reality can be determined at the level of observation and experiment.  For example, as a manifestation of the phenomena of the microworld in macro-objects, which can be registered with the senses of the researcher-experimenter and with special devices.  After that, the same physical reality is considered at different levels of its manifestation - empirical and theoretical.  Physical reality at the empirical level can be represented by some generalizations, systematization of data, and on a theoretical one - by logical reconstructions of the results in the form of physical theories and models of the investigated reality. </p>
