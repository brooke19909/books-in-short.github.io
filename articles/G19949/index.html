Besalu (Spain) has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãslightly less than five square kilometers, while its population is 2.5 thousand people.  It is difficult for residents of megacities to imagine that a village with such modest parameters can have the status of a city.  But here, as it turns out, there are such miracles. </p><h2>  Historical monument </h2><p>  Besalu in Spain is considered a national monument of the country, therefore, there is always increased attention from tourists.  There are many interesting historical and cultural monuments in the city, therefore it can rightly be called a real open-air museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="besalu spain" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Along with medieval <span>sights, in</span> Besalu (Spain) on the streets are quite modern souvenir shops, shops, cafes and restaurants.  In the most amazing way, modern and ancient objects are harmoniously combined with each other.  The city managed to keep its original appearance intact.  Therefore, while relaxing in Catalonia, you should definitely visit Besalu (Spain). </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city is located at the confluence of the river Kpeljades and Fluvia, in the province of Girona.  The story of Besalu began with the construction of a count's castle on top of a hill.  There are references to it in the annals of the tenth century.  Currently, only the ruins remained from the building, however, the church of St. Mary, which was in a single complex with the castle, was partially preserved.  It was from this place down to the Fluvia river that the city began to grow gradually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Historians also offer an earlier version of the birth of the city of Besalu.  So, for example, there is a version about its ancient Roman origin.  But, unfortunately, from those times no evidence has come except for the shards of Romanesque and Iberian ceramics found. </p><p>  Besalu (Spain) became the center of local social and political life only after 894, when the Barcelona countess Bethred I the Hairy donated the county to his brother.  It is worth noting that Bethred is generally a legendary person in the <span>history of Catalonia.</span>  It was he who laid the foundation for her complete independence from the Frankish kings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Besalu spain attractions" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After his death, the county became independent, so Besalu received a powerful impetus in order to strengthen its position as a capital.  The county had a considerable area - from Campradon to Girona.  It was part of the buffer zone, which was a network of outposts to protect the Franks from the Moorish offensive. </p><p>  As an independent county, the city did not exist for long - only until 1111.  The last representative from the dynasty of counts Besalu died early, and he had no heirs.  Therefore, the city again falls under the patronage of Barcelona.  At the same time, the city lost its leadership position, losing them to neighboring Olot.  This is where Besalu's flowering ends; it seems to freeze in development.  But at the same time, local residents continued to live and work, not allowing the desolation of the city.  Thanks to this, medieval Besalu (Spain) has retained its sights to this day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is the current city? </h2><p>  Currently, Besalu is one of the best preserved Romanesque settlements in Catalonia.  Due to the presence of historical attractions, Besalu (Spain) in 1966 was awarded the title of national historical monumental complex.  Large restoration work was carried out in the city.  Currently, the city is included in the route "Roads of Romanesque art of Catalonia."  In it you can not only see the medieval buildings, but also stroll through the narrow winding streets and sit in beautiful modern cafes. </p><h2>  Description of Besalu </h2><p>  As a rule, the tourist route begins with a defensive - fortified bridge.  It is on it that it is most convenient to enter the city, since you immediately get into the historical part of Besalu.  The seven-span bridge has long been a hallmark of the city.  This is the most photographed building in the city.  Many argue that the bridge is the most beautiful among other structures.  It was built in the eleventh to twelfth century.  The construction is designed in the Romanesque style.  In general, Roman architecture is characterized by massive solidity, clear silhouettes, round arches, laconic decoration, which, in fact, is most consistent with defensive goals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval spain besal√∫" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968506.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order to fully verify the scale and fortress of the bridge, you need to go down to the Fluvia River.  The harsh beauty and power of the building are clearly visible from below. </p><p>  The bridge has a broken shape, and this is not an accident.  Just building on a foundation of natural origin - huge river boulders.  In the fourteenth century, the bridge was supplemented by a watchtower, behind which there was a building in which they accepted payment of state duty.  At one time, a fee was charged for entering the city from each person, as well as for donkeys. </p><p>  Over the entire period of its existence, the bridge has been repeatedly rebuilt, repaired and reconstructed.  During the Civil War, the bridge was blown up, as a result of which two spans were destroyed and a third was partially damaged.  It was restored only in 1965.  Since the appearance of the original structure was preserved only on one of the engravings of the time of Napoleon, the architect Pons Sorolla was guided during the restoration precisely on it.  At the same time, he was able to fully recreate the original image of the structure. </p><h2>  Jewish quarter </h2><p>  Directly behind the bridge leading to the city of Besalu (Spain), the Jewish quarter begins.  In the Middle Ages, the Jewish community played an important role in the life of the city.  She was allowed to build her own temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="besalu spain reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968504.jpg" width="600"></div>  But the situation completely changed in 1348.  At that time, a plague raged throughout Europe, and it reached Spain.  The culprits of the terrible disease were Jews who poisoned Christians with their poisons.

    <p>  This is the conclusion residents.  Therefore, mass arson of Jewish houses and pogroms began.  And in 1492, all Jews were expelled from the city and even outside of Spain.  Of course, since then the synagogue has not survived, but during the excavation a room was found for rituals, which remained the only monument in the history of the country from the Jews. </p><h2>  Unusual chairs </h2><p>  Walking along the winding streets of the city of Besalu (Spain), you will surely come to one more attraction - these are chairs attached to the outer walls of houses under the roof itself.  There is a legend explaining such an original arrangement of furniture.  So she says that chairs are needed so that evil spirits (witches) can fly on them, flying over the city.  Better that dark forces spend the night on the street and do not try to enter houses.  In such a simple way, local residents fought against evil spirits.  It is worth noting that the chairs were attached with legs to the walls, and accordingly, it would be impossible to sit on them, which means that the witches quickly left the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãbesalu spain catalonia reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another highchair can be seen on one of the streets, it reaches a height of two meters.  But he has a completely different story.  This is a gift to the local amateur theater, which took pride of place in the competition from grateful spectators.  They say that initially there were more chairs, but they were stolen corny, so the last instance was tightly fixed to a concrete slab. </p><h2>  Freedom Square </h2><p>  The path of each tourist invariably leads him to the main square of the city - this is Freedom Square.  It houses the City Hall and the Royal Curia Building.  In the Middle Ages, Curia was the administrative apparatus, it included the church and secular elite of the city.  Later, the building housed the residence of the royal court, and then the Palace of Justice.  Recently, the church school was located in the building.  The building currently houses the Royal Curia Themed Restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Besalu city" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Liberty Square is surrounded by semicircular arches and has a medieval look.  In ancient times, there was a brisk trade.  And now, every Tuesday, the local market operates.  On <span>holidays</span> , celebrations are held on the square.  On weekdays, cafes are open, lined around the perimeter.  In each of them, guests of the city and travelers are welcome. </p><h2>  St. Peter's Meadow </h2><p>  A short street connects the square with St. Peter's Meadow - it is an area covered with paving stones.  It once housed an old monastery cemetery.  This place never received the official status of the square, and therefore they began to call it Lug in order to avoid all sorts of superstitions. </p><h2>  St. Peter's Church </h2><p>  In ancient times, there was an old <span>Benedictine monastery</span> in the city <span>,</span> which was founded back in 997.  To this day only his church has survived, which bears the name of St. Peter.  The temple is perfectly preserved and is a significant monument of Romanesque art of Catalonia.  The church facade is decorated with a huge window with figures of lions, which personify the power and strength of the church.  But I interpret the images of a snake and a monkey as symbols of evil and paganism.  Historians say that initially the figures symbolized Muslims and Jews. </p><h2>  Cornell's House </h2><p>  On the Meadow is the Cornell House, which was built in the twelfth century.  The secular building is very well preserved.  It is built in the same Romanesque style.  The house is still privately owned, and therefore you can admire it only outside.  Outside, the facade of the building is very flaky, but the arrangement and beauty of the courtyard of the house with high galleries is of real value.  The building is surrounded on three sides by arches and columns, and a stone staircase leads to the second floor. </p><h2>  St. Julian's Hospital </h2><p>  Right behind St. Peter's Church is another architectural monument of the twelfth century - St. Julian's Hospital, which, according to legend, treated the knights who returned from the Crusade.  Later, Benedictine monks turned the building into a haven for pilgrims.  The house itself attracts with its beautiful portals decorated with columns.  There is a bas-relief of a two-headed lion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Besalu story" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968503.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another interesting temple of the city is the church of St. Vincent, founded in 997.  Its main facade is decorated with a magnificent window in the Gothic style.  Some relics are kept in the temple - a fragment of the True Cross of the Lord, as well as a sculpture of the Mother of God. </p><h2>  Modern sights of the city </h2><p>  Reviews about Besalu (Spain) suggest that it also has modern attractions that are worthy of the attention of tourists.  You should definitely visit the Museum of Miniatures.  Its exposition is considered one of the richest in Europe.  It consists of 2,000 exhibits, which are exhibited in size - from larger to smallest.  By the way, the famous needle is kept in the museum, through the eye of which a camel caravan passes.  This work belongs to the famous Russian master from Omsk Kononenko Anatoly.  The exposition of the institution is simply amazing.  You simply freeze over each miniature, examining the smallest details in a microscope. </p><h2>  Reviews for Besalu (Catalonia, Spain) </h2><p>  Besalov should be visited by those tourists who like to contemplate all kinds of historical monuments.  There are plenty of them in the city.  A special atmosphere reigns here, thanks to which you are transported to the old days.  It feels like the city has remained somewhere far away in the Middle Ages.  Besalu is shrouded in legends and traditions.  Literally with every historical building there is a legend.  Of course, the most informative will be a walk around the city as part of some excursion group. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Besalu description" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1968527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the independent study of medieval streets is no less interesting.  The beauty and cleanliness of Besalu fascinates; here you can wander for hours, stopping to rest in the lovely street cafes that complement the look of the city.  According to tourists, you should definitely buy souvenirs that will remind you of a great time.  There are a lot of them on the streets, and some have a completely unusual meaning, each of the merchants will certainly devote to the value of the statuette you have chosen. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  According to tourists, the city of Besalu (Spain) itself resembles a miniature.  It is so compact and small that you do not even need a transport in order to get around it.  But at the same time, incredibly many historical objects are concentrated on its streets.  No less interesting is the history of the city itself, so rich and rich.  It is now difficult to imagine that so many events once happened on the narrow streets of Besalu.  Nevertheless, getting into it, you find yourself in the real Middle Ages, plunging into the atmosphere of past eras. </p>
