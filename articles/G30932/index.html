The products of this manufacturer are in any mobile phone shop.  And she is popular.  It is difficult to say how the company manages to survive in conditions of hard dumping by Xiaomi and Meizu, but the sales at Huawei are traditionally high.  Even though its products cannot be called cheap.  What attracts users to Huawei products?  We will try to answer this question by parsing the smartphone Huawei P9 Lite.  Its characteristics are ambiguous.  It can be attributed both to gadgets of the middle price segment, and to budget devices.  Such a <span>"borderline" state</span> affects the price of the gadget.  So what kind of apparatus is this?  Let's take a closer look at it.  But first, a few words about the history of the manufacturing company. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  Huawei Telecommunications Company was founded in 1987.  She immediately set about producing a variety of network equipment.  The company's arsenal included products such as modems, routers, network cabinets, wireless devices, and much more.  In this field, the manufacturer has achieved impressive results.  However, some condemned the methods by which these very results were achieved.  Many accused the Huawei of industrial espionage.  There were really precedents.  As a compromise, the company said that it was the unauthorized actions of some unscrupulous employees.  However, it was thanks to these actions that the company began to occupy a leading position among all telecommunication offices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With smartphones, a completely different story.  They are all completely original.  The proof of this is the Huawei P9 Lite.  The characteristics of this device are really impressive. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the mobile unit at Huawei has appeared relatively recently.  The first Android smartphone was released in 2010.  It immediately became popular in Belarus, because the local mobile operator Life offered it in installments on very favorable terms.  The following models were more developed, so they began to enjoy success without promotional sales.  Now Huawei products occupy a prominent place in the modern mobile device market.  She settled there quite firmly, and does not intend to give up her positions.  The company has a very strong both the budget segment and the premium device sector.  The middle price segment is also in the hands of Huawei.  And a vivid proof of this is the smartphone Huawei P9 Lite.  Its characteristics are excellent, but they belong to the middle price segment.  Consider the design features of this device. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  This time, the designers of Huawei decided to abandon metal cases.  And it is right.  So they reduced the final cost of the product, and high-quality plastic looks no worse than metal.  So the case of the P9 Lite is completely plastic, but the back panel has such a structure that I really want to call it metal.  Huawei P9 Lite Black, the characteristics of which we will analyze a little later, looks completely all-metal.  On the front panel is a relatively small screen (compared with modern devices of other brands).  There are no navigation buttons below it.  All of them are emulated programmatically on the screen.  But there is a place for the company logo, although one could do without it.  Above the screen is a speaker grid, light and proximity sensors and a front camera module.  The entire front panel is covered with tempered glass Corning Gorilla Glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The back panel is made entirely of plastic.  The upper part (where the camera is located) has a slightly different structure.  It is made for beauty.  Under the camera itself is a fingerprint scanner of an impressive size.  This sensor can also be used as a touchpad.  Hence, such dimensions.  Below the scanner there is nothing more than a company logo.  The speaker slots are at the bottom.  However, only one of them hides a speaker.  The second is made for purely aesthetic reasons.  There is no practical benefit from it.  The Huawei P9 Lite smartphone, the technical characteristics of which we will analyze a little later, has only a headphone jack on the upper edge.  Mechanical volume control buttons are located on the side, as is the power button.  There is no surprise here.  Solid assembly, high-quality plastic.  All in the corporate style of "Huawei". </p><h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  Let's continue the analysis of the Huawei P9 Lite Dual Sim.  Screen specifications look something like this.  The diagonal of the screen is 5.2 inches.  This is quite enough for all tasks.  However, the resolution looks best of all - full Full HD (1080 by 1920 pixels).  For this size, this is a gorgeous resolution.  Pixelization of fonts is generally invisible.  The screen is based on an IPS matrix.  This allows for almost realistic color reproduction.  But the most important thing is that such screens simply have huge viewing angles, so the colors do not distort even with a fair turn of the gadget.  The display is covered with Corning <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> which also has <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  Also, there is no air gap between the glass and the screen, which allows to improve color reproduction, but it turns into problems during repair.  Instead of replacing the glass, you have to change the entire screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Now about the brightness of the screen of this gadget.  About it, users leave quite favorable <span>reviews.</span>  <span>Huawei P9 Lite has the</span> following brightness characteristics: the screen of the device in question is quite large.  It is comfortable to use even in direct sunlight.  The presence of anti-reflective coating plays a significant role.  Meanwhile, some applications are integrated into the operating system of the device, which will help to adjust the color rendering of the display "for themselves."  And they are pretty good at this task.  On this screen, it‚Äôs quite comfortable to watch movies, not to mention surfing the Internet.  We can say for sure that the display is the most successful and high-quality component in the entire device.  And this fact is impossible to dispute. </p><h2>  Device Hardware Platform Features </h2><p>  Now consider the main technical characteristics of the Huawei P9 Lite.  It has a 64-bit eight-core processor manufactured by Huawei under the name HiSilicon Kirin.  The processor clock speed is 2 gigahertz.  This is a very good result.  RAM in the device as much as 3 gigabytes.  Such a successful tandem of components allows the gadget to easily cope not only with applications, but also with many modern games.  For multimedia capabilities meets the powerful graphics chip Mali T830 MP2.  It has full support for OpenGL and DirectX, which plays a positive role not only in games, but also in the playback of high-definition video.  The device easily plays Full HD video in MKV format.  And this is far from all of his possibilities. </p>

    <p>  The internal storage has a capacity of 16 gigabytes, but only 10 is available to the user. You can, of course, increase the free space due to Micro SD memory cards up to 128 gigabytes, but there is one problem.  The fact is that the smartphone uses a hybrid slot, which provides the ability to install either two SIM cards, or a memory card and one SIM card.  This enthusiasm for hybrid slots by manufacturers is not very clear, because it limits the functionality of the phone.  Other features of the Huawei P9 Lite Gold look like this: support for the LTE (4G) communication standard, the latest generation Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmitters, advanced cameras, a loud speaker, a capacious battery, a lightning fast fingerprint scanner (with touchpad function), a navigation module, and a lot of different sensors. </p><h2>  Front and main cameras </h2><p>  Now it's time to pay attention to the camera of the device Huawei P9 Lite.  Overview of the characteristics of the main camera is a little incomprehensible.  More precisely, it is not clear to which category this component belongs: to top-end sensors or to cameras in the middle price segment.  Judge for yourself.  The device uses a 13 megapixel sensor from Sony.  The lens is wide-angle and fast.  However, the main "trick" is not this.  There is a completely manual mode for controlling all the characteristics of the camera: ISO, shutter speed, focus and much more.  But the most valuable thing in this camera is the ability to save pictures in RAW format for subsequent processing in the appropriate editor.  Photos are very high quality, clear with realistic color reproduction.  In terms of the main camera, the Huawei has everything as always: at the highest level.  Now take a look at the front camera. </p>

    <p>  As the front camera, a fast, wide-angle module of 8 megapixels is used.  This camera does not have its own flash.  It uses a screen that turns on at full power for a second and glows with bright white light.  A very dubious implementation, but the results are not bad.  The camera also can shoot video in Full HD.  Yes, and 8 megapixels - this is quite enough for selfie and communication via skype.  There is also a shooting option when determining a smile.  A very useful feature for those who are keen on selfies.  These are the components for shooting in the Huawei P9 Lite.  A review of the characteristics of the front camera suggests that the company is not used to saving on users.  Apparently, this is why devices from the Chinese are so popular all over the world.  Now let's move on to other features of the smartphone. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  So, the gadget uses the Android operating system version 6.0 with the proprietary EMUI 4.1 shell.  The OS works pretty fast, which is not surprising when you consider the power of the "iron" components of the gadget.  Huawei P9 Lite Black, whose characteristics allow you to cope with any games, is unlikely to slow down when working with the operating system.  The proprietary EMUI interface also looks pretty nice, and doesn‚Äôt particularly load the device.  The animation is smooth, transitions are fast.  There are no failures.  But the most valuable thing is that Huawei regularly updates the version of the operating system.  This allows you to always have the latest OS with all the corrections and improvements. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor p9 lite specifications" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2036135.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The gadget is equipped with a non-removable lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh.  Is it a lot or a little?  Given the computing power of the device, it seems that such a battery is categorically insufficient.  But this is only a first impression.  In fact, the smartphone may well work all day in intensive load mode.  It is capable of playing video for 10 hours at maximum screen brightness.  The device plays music for 18 hours.  And this is not to mention that data transmission also consumes a lot of energy.  But during the game he will live much less - 4-5 hours.  Depending on how demanding the game is.  In principle, the results are pretty good for a smartphone of this level. </p><h2>  Comparison with competitors </h2><p>  The nearest competitors of the P9 Lite in this segment are devices such as the 2016 Samsung Galaxy A5 and Sony <span>Xperia M5 Dual.</span>  All of them have similar parameters.  But there are differences.  The first one is the price.  These two competitors cost 8,000 rubles more than the smartphone in question.  Further, if you look at the Huawei P9 Lite Mini, whose characteristics are known to us, and at the same creation from Sony, we will see that the latter uses a weaker processor from MTK, which is a significant minus.  And if you compare Huawei with Samsung, then the latter has less RAM, fewer megapixels in the front camera, a weaker graphics chip, and the model itself is quite outdated.  It turns out that the P9 Lite is not only more powerful than its closest competitors, but also cheaper.  Of course, Xiaomi also has decent phones with Meizu, but they are in a completely different price category.  And their quality is far from the same as that of the Huawei. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei p9 lite gold specifications" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2036134.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Reviews - this is what allows you to find out how the device behaves in real conditions and whether it is worth buying at all.  As for the Huawei P9 Lite, the characteristics and reviews of which we are now analyzing, then everything is clear.  Almost all users are delighted with their device.  Almost all owners note excellent performance even in the most difficult games.  Indeed, World of Tanks Blitz at maximum graphics settings go just fine.  As well as Asphalt 8. Fans of mobile photography are delighted with the main camera and the possibility of manual adjustment.  With this smartphone you can create real works of art.  And this is not an exaggeration.  Also, many people like the design of the smartphone, the location of the controls and the quality of the materials.  Everything is done sensibly and efficiently.  Some owners praise the device‚Äôs battery, arguing that its charge lasts for two days.  Not ignored by users and such an important positive nuance of the phone as its relatively low cost.  As you can see, most <span>reviews of the smartphone Huawei</span> P9 Lite are positive. </p><p>  However, some users also note the shortcomings of this model, as indicated in their reviews.  Huawei P9 Lite, the characteristics of which we examined in detail, some buyers do not like because of the plastic case.  Some users say that it would be nice to make the device a metal case.  Also, some buyers do not like the lack of wireless charging and a Type C connector. For this reason, you need to consider that only flagships that far from everyone can afford such options.  Many buyers note that the device uses a hybrid tray for a SIM card and memory card.  Users believe that it's time for manufacturers to listen to the opinions of users and stop using hybrid slots in order to compete with analog products and not lose their customers.  Thus, summing up all the positive and negative reviews, we can say that the Huawei P9 Lite phone, whose characteristics look very attractive, was able to win the love of users. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the smartphone Huawei Honor P9 Lite.  Its characteristics make it clear that we have before us a very high-quality and versatile device from the middle price segment.  But despite this, the gadget has almost flagship performance and an excellent camera.  There is also a very quick fingerprint scanner and a capacious battery.  The device will appeal to the vast majority of users.  And the low cost of the smartphone makes it the number one candidate to buy.  Moreover, its closest competitors can not stand any comparison. </p>
