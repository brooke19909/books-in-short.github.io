    <h2>  History of the Yaroslavl region (Moscow, Russia) </h2><p>  The history of the area can be traced back to the mid-18th century.  In accordance with archival documents, at this time there was Taininskaya volost and the village of Small Mytishchi.  The name of the village comes from the word "wash", which means "duty collection".  The fee was collected when moving through Yauza in Mytishchi.  The village was located near the Ichki River.  This settlement was small and numbered about 200 people.  It was located directly at the intersection of the Ichki River and the road, which was the only way for merchants and pilgrims.  The population of the village was engaged in fishing, hunting and trade.  Since the main road was very busy, in the middle of the XVIII century a large trading hut was built, where pilgrims often liked to stop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Moscow Yaroslavl region" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53041/1871215.jpg" width="350"></div>

He supplied Muscovites with clean water.  By this time, the population of the village had doubled.  By the end of the 19th century, a railway to the city of Yaroslavl was laid and operated.  This attracted a large number of summer residents, as the rich natural resources, the river, the lake and the forest became much more accessible, and thanks to the Elk Island, which this region now borders on, there was always wonderful fresh forest air. </p><p>  After only half a century, <span>rural residents</span> began to deal with housing and trade thanks to convenient communication with Moscow.  In addition, pilgrims who stopped in these places passed along the road.  The local cuisine was especially attractive to the guests.  Teahouses and taverns were favorite places to visit.  Often in the village there were Moscow nobles and even the rulers of Russia. </p><p>  In the 30–40s of the last century, the village of Malye Mytishchi grew significantly and numbered 1,500 people.  At the same time, the construction of the Moscow Ring Road began, and after a couple of decades, mass development. </p><h2>  Royal possessions </h2><p>  Near Maly Mytishchi, the village of Raevo Myza was located - it was the estate of Catherine I. At that time it belonged to the Taininskaya volost and was called the village, since the settlements with the estates of the gentlemen had exactly that name.  It was assumed that the empress would rest here during visits to the Sergius Monastery.  After Elizabeth Petrovna came to power and the construction of the Travel Palace, it was given to the Choglokov, who subsequently received Prince Peter Fedorovich and Catherine II there.  Also there was Count Razumovsky and other close associates of the royal family.  Further, Major General Alenina owned the village (until the end of the sixties of the XVIII century), after which it passed into the possession of Khotyaitseva, and in the middle of the XIX century.  to Myasoedova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Swao Yaroslavl district" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53041/1871223.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is a clean area with developed infrastructure, many educational institutions, one of which is among the top ten.  For 2017, the Yaroslavl district of the <span>city ​​of Moscow</span> is among the ten safest areas. </p><p>  Recently, there is an active construction in many districts of Moscow.  Yaroslavl region is no exception.  Active development is on: </p><ul><li>  st.

Residents, for example, complain of constant traffic jams on the Yaroslavl highway.  They are associated with congestion and high traffic density.  Even despite the four-level traffic interchange, traffic at rush hour is difficult.  Another negative point is the high content of harmful impurities in the air.  Many residents note that health care in the area is rather poorly developed.  In some budgetary medical institutions there are constant queues, and you need to sign up to the doctor for a month.  Meanwhile, private medical centers operate in the region, where patients are admitted without waiting lists, but for a fee. </p>
