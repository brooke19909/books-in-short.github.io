    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not only positive, but also negative aspects are characterized by the Hotel Favorit (Gelendzhik).  Reviews of tourists contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  Doesn‚Äôt show TV very well; </li><li>  despite the fact that there are two table lamps in the room, only one is on; </li><li>  there are no mosquito nets on the windows, and therefore mosquitoes just torture you; </li><li>  too good audibility between numbers; </li><li>  there are not enough outlets in the apartment; </li><li>  the rooms really lack bathrobes and slippers; </li><li>  the windows look directly at the neighboring hotel, and therefore its guests will see everything that happens in your room. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Novelty is one of the main advantages that characterizes the Favorite Hotel in Gelendzhik.  Reviews indicate that in the rooms you will not find old and shabby furniture, and plumbing will not leak.  Everything works just fine, and the cleaning is very clean and done every day.  In addition to all this, it is worth saying that the cost of living is quite low - one of the most advantageous offers in this city.  The only criticism is poor insulation, as well as the fact that half of the light bulbs in the rooms may not work. </p><p>  Guests at this hotel are especially notable for service.  Each of the employees is a true professional in their field.  All are very polite and welcoming with guests.  None of your requests will be left without attention.  No matter what time you go to the reception, you will always receive comprehensive answers to your questions.  It is convenient enough that the hotel provides its guests with a shuttle to the airport or train station.  By the way, this is much more profitable than using a taxi.  It is also worth noting that in the mornings an excellent breakfast will be served in the dining room.  With a relatively low cost of 300 rubles, you can eat for a whole day, as well as form a good brake for snacks. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Favorite Hotel has a very favorable location.  Of course, you will have to walk to the sea for about 10 minutes, but the road will be pleasant, because it runs along the promenade and souvenir market.  There are many shops, restaurants and various entertainment venues in the area.  In addition, there is incredibly beautiful nature.  It is worth noting that, despite such a rich tourist infrastructure, the hotel is quite quiet and calm. </p>
