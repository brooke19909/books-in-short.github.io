The revolutionary movement demanded the abolition of feudalism and the implementation of democratic principles.  At the beginning of 1848, the French people, poured into the general mood, demanded civil rights and freedoms.  King Louis-Philippe I of the Bourbon dynasty defended the interests of the financial elite of society, but a tough struggle did not bring results.  February 22, 1848 the monarch abdicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knowyourmeme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riots of 1848" class="if uuid-3122011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3122011.jpg"></div><h2>  Proclamation of the Republic </h2><p>  The Provisional Government was immediately created.  Oppositionists in it refused to proclaim the Second French Republic, arguing that an important decision should be made by the people.  On February 25, a group of citizens appeared at the Town Hall, threatening a new revolution.  Under their pressure, the republican system of government was recognized. </p><p>  In June 1848, after the suppression of armed uprisings, the formation of authorities began.  The interim government ceded to the Democrats in their demand for universal suffrage.  France became the only country with electoral law limited only by age.  Another law adopted was a decree abolishing slavery in the colonies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fineartamerica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of Paris 1848" class="if uuid-3122018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3122018.jpg"></div><h2>  President elections </h2><p>  On May 4, an elected Constituent Assembly proclaimed the 2nd Republic in France (years of existence: 1848-1852).  The constitution, which rejected revolutionary methods of struggle, entered into force on June 4.  The foundations of the Republic were family, labor, and property.  The use of democratic freedoms was limited to the borders of the rule of law.  By proclaiming the right to work, the government paid tribute to the revolutionary masses.  The remaining principles of the Constitution satisfied the bourgeoisie more than ordinary people. </p><p>  Legislative power was vested in the elected National Assembly, while executive power was vested in the president, elected by universal suffrage.  The Chairman of the Assembly, Jules Grevy, pointed out the danger of general popular elections.  His arguments were not heard.  Three quarters of voters on December 10 voted to elect Charles-Louis-Napoleon‚Äôs nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte as president.  The votes in his favor were given by the workers, the army, the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie and the monarchists.  Power fell into the hands of a political adventurer, giving out empty promises.  Bonaparte's nephew began preparations for the restoration of the monarchy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte" class="if uuid-3122621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3122621.jpg"></div><h2>  National Assembly Elections </h2><p>  Conservatism has become the main feature of the political system of the Second French Republic.  By mid-May, French political activity had weakened, with only two-thirds of voters coming to the polls.  As a result, 500 of the 750 members of the Assembly were monarchists and supporters of church authority.  Republicans got only 70 seats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  France of the period of the 2nd republic has an inherent <span>reactionary policy of the</span> government: opposition manifestations were severely suppressed.  The President did not interfere with the Assembly.  On the contrary, every mistake of the lawmakers added him advantages.  The parliament did not have mechanisms for influencing the president and turned into a structure without authority and political power. </p><h2>  Roman expedition </h2><p>  In February 1848, a bourgeois-democratic revolution took place in one of the Italian states ruled by the Pope of Rome.  In an atmosphere of constant struggle between the political movements of the Second French Republic, Catholicism remained the only unifying force. </p><p>  To enlist the support of the clergy, the president, contrary to the opinion of the majority of deputies, sent troops to Rome.  The Roman Republic, established less than four months ago, was liquidated.  The head of parliament, Odilon Barro, recalled that Napoleon was flattered by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing a defender of the church. </p><h2>  Legislative policy </h2><p>  The government of the Second French Republic adopted a series of unpopular laws approved by the president.  Napoleon later abandoned them, shifting responsibility to parliament.  The Press Act established strict censorship and restrictions on information.  The system of public education fell under the control of clergymen, from secular to spiritual.  Electoral law was limited to a three-year stay in one commune, depriving many workers of the opportunity to vote. </p><p>  To avoid unrest, in November 1851 the president convened the National Assembly and demanded that the election law be repealed.  Parliament refused.  Napoleon skillfully used the conflict and enlisted the support of the people who believed in his sincerity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Debate in the National Assembly" class="if uuid-3121968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3121968.jpg"></div><h2>  Coup </h2><p>  In 1852, the term of office of Louis Napoleon expired.  He could be re-elected only after a four-year term.  Supporters of the president twice proposed a review of the restriction.  Parliament opposed. </p><p>  On the night of December 2, 1851, Charles-Louis-Napoleon, with the support of the army, carried out a coup d'etat, taking a number of steps: </p><ul><li>  dissolution of the National Assembly; </li><li>  restoration of universal voting right; </li><li>  the introduction of martial law. </li></ul><p>  The streets were full of proclamations.  Bonaparte's signature was supplemented by the signature of his younger brother, Minister of the Interior Charles de Morney.  In an appeal to the people, Louis Napoleon explained his own actions as the impossibility of working in conditions of constitutional restrictions and disapproval of a parliament hostile to him.  The proposal was accompanied by a proposal to re-elect him in case of disagreement with the coup. </p><p>  Louis Napoleon suggested: </p><ul><li>  ten-year presidency; </li><li>  subordination of ministers to the head of state; </li><li>  Council of State for legislative initiative; </li><li>  The legislative body formed by popular vote, instead of the Assembly; </li><li>  bicameral parliament instead of the previously unicameral parliament. </li></ul><p>  MPs did not expect a decisive move that would go against the current Constitution;  opposition leaders were arrested.  Weak legislative protests were ignored.  The Supreme Court, gathered to discuss the situation, did nothing.  The decree of the Minister of War, threatening to be shot without trial, blocked street riots.  People gathered on the streets of Paris on December 4 to protest were shot.  The survivors were waiting for the link.  Single uprisings in the provinces were severely suppressed.  Pius IX, restored by Napoleon to the papal throne, and the clergy supported the coup. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inquiriesjournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris 1951" class="if uuid-3122022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3122022.jpg"></div><h2>  New constitution </h2><p>  On December 20, the people of France, through a plebiscite (popular poll), approved the actions of the president.  The plebiscite was held under police pressure and suggested the approval of the new Constitution.  Only a tenth of the respondents dared to vote against this. </p><p>  On January 4, 1852, the Second French Republic became acquainted with the new, essentially monarchical, Constitution.  The president was called a responsible person, but no control institutions were envisaged.  The legislative body was left only the right to discuss laws, shared with the Senate.  The development was entrusted to a state council led by the president.  Executive power was vested in the president and his ministers.  The publication of the Constitution was followed by the announcement of decrees restricting freedom of the press. </p><h2>  Proclamation of the Empire </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.icollector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor Napoleon III" class="if uuid-3122006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3122006.jpg"></div><p>  The establishment of the authoritarian regime of the 2nd republic in France was a step towards the restoration of the Empire.  However, the president doubted.  In March 1852, at a session of the Legislative Corps, he spoke about the preservation of the Republic as a way to calm society. </p><p>  On November 7, 1852, the Senate proclaimed the Empire.  On November 21, a popular vote approved the president‚Äôs actions, and Napoleon III was solemnly proclaimed emperor.  2 the French Republic ended. </p>
