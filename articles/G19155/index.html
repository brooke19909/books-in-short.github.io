In this regard, the module acts as a modular training tool.  It should be noted that the <strong>technology of modular education in the school</strong> sets itself the following tasks: </p><p>  - for the student, the pace of work should be comfortable, therefore its capabilities and abilities should be taken into account; </p><p>  - the content of the training should be flexible; </p><p>  - types and forms of work should be integrated; </p><p>  - the paramount task is the formation of students' ability to engage in self-education, which will ultimately achieve high results. </p>

    <p>  The module is a kind <span>of training program,</span> individualized in its essence, the pace of educational and cognitive activity, <span>teaching methods, the</span> level of independent activity of students.  Therefore, the <strong>technology of modular learning</strong> enables the student with a certain degree of independence to study the individualized program offered to him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modular training is distinguished from other educational systems by parameters such as content and goals, methods and forms, ways of mutual cooperation between the teacher and his students.  These parameters allow you to define the <strong>principles of modular learning</strong> . </p>

    <p>  Methods, content and forms of modular learning examines the principle of modularity.  According to him, training is based on the principle of combining material into module nodes, work on which allows you to achieve the didactic goals set by the teacher.  The training material inside the modular blocks is divided into separate training elements. </p><p>  In addition, the <strong>technology of modular training</strong> provides for the principle of dynamism, according to which the opportunity is opened to supplement, modify and develop educational material. </p><p>  The principle that separate elements are distinguished from the training content allows, within each module, to consider the material under study as a single holistic system. </p><p>  Thanks to the principle of flexibility, the construction of the program and modules, the content of training and the ways of its assimilation are adapted to the individual needs of students. </p><p>  Inextricably linked with other didactic principles, the <strong>technology of modular training</strong> provides for a principle that implies the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge and knowledge systems.  While studying, students acquire knowledge and skills in the process of independent work on problem solving, while applying knowledge in practice, showing resourcefulness and initiative. </p><p>  According to the principle of a conscious perspective, it is necessary to manage the educational process so that the students can understand and realize the goals set for training. </p><p>  The principle of versatility of methodological counseling provides for the professionalism of the teacher and a high degree of preparedness of the student for cognitive activity. </p><p>  Likewise, the <strong>technology of</strong> <strong>modular education at school</strong> includes the principle of parity.  It requires ensuring close interconnection and fruitful cooperation of the teacher and his pupils during the educational process. </p><p>  The principles of modular learning are in constant interaction and, at the same time, they are associated with general didactic principles. </p>
