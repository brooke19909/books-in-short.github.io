In this article we will talk about additional accessories.  For example, we‚Äôll study how to use the fisheye lens. </p><p>  First of all, it is worth understanding the very concept of why the lens is so called and what is its main feature and difference from others.  Fisheye is a wide angle lens.  Its viewing angle is close to 180 degrees.  It got its name due to the fact that the principle of its operation is similar to the fish eye. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hdrtist.wordpress.com" data-author=": David C. Baker, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fisheye lens" class="if uuid-2436451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2436451.jpg"></div><h2>  Different kinds of lens </h2><p>  The first type is circular.  This kind of lens is used to take unusual-looking panoramic shots that will look like 360-degree ones.  This kind of lens is good at shooting sky and nature.  The thing is that it does not cover the entire frame, but only an inscribed circle. </p><p>  The second view is diagonal.  It is so named because in this case the fisheye lens will distribute all 180 degrees of the horizontal view.  Thus, the frame fits into the maximum viewing angle. </p><p>  And the next type of such lenses are mechanisms that have a viewing angle greater than 180 degrees.  There are very few such accessories, and they are usually used by professional photographers in special cases.  Despite the fact that such lenses are rare, you should not forget about them either. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why is a lens of a similar plan necessary? </h2><p>  The fisheye lens for the camera has been used for quite some time - approximately since the beginning of the last century.  That's just it is used very rarely.  Most often for photographing narrow streets, corridors and small rooms.  At the moment, they have begun to use a similar lens more often.  Where exactly?  For example, street athletes for their events. </p><p>  This kind of lens is used because it captures a large space around the athlete, which means that the atmosphere of the event is reflected much stronger and brighter.  More attention is paid to the trick performed by the athlete.  In addition, the ‚Äúfisheye‚Äù is used to photograph objects that served as a platform for performing tricks, regardless of whether tricks were performed on any vehicle or manually.  Video shooting with a device of this kind is also relevant today. </p><p>  In addition, a camera of this type is used to shoot architectural objects or to create three-dimensional, so-called 3D panoramas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="digital-photography-school.com" data-author=": Rick Berk, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fisheye lenses" class="if uuid-2436456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2436456.jpg"></div><h2>  Camera structure </h2><p>  Photos taken with this kind of lens will have certain drawbacks due to the peculiar arrangement of the lenses in the mechanism itself, and this was done specifically by manufacturers to create special photographs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first drawback is a barrel-shaped deviation from the norm.  Pictures look in such a way as if the foreground is very far forward, and the background goes far into the distance.  Due to such lenses, straight lines are distorted in the image.  What is in the foreground is much larger and more massive than those objects that are located in the background.  But this is precisely what attracts photographers who risked acquiring such a thing. </p><p>  The next drawback of such accessories is related to the hood.  Due to the small size of the mount, they may not be suitable for most types of cameras, such as Nikon or Canon.  Of course, you can use special adapters that increase the size, the only problem is that in this case the lens hood will become part of the frame being shot, so manufacturers usually install them immediately during production. </p><p>  This is the reason why it is not possible to mount a variety of light filters on the lens.  And when installing them in front of a convex glass, there will be little sense.  For this reason, gelatin filters are usually installed behind the last lens.  This leads to the fact that there is no way to quickly replace it.  That is why today, manufacturers of "fish eye" equip the lens with a system in which filters with a standard set of colors are in a state of rotation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fisheye Camera" class="if uuid-2436467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2436467.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to use the lens </h2><p>  There are a lot of lens options.  One of them is the one that is used for the phone.  You can buy them in almost any store specializing in the sale of mobile gadgets.  Their price is very low, which makes fisheye lenses on the phone publicly available.  They can also be purchased on any Chinese site for a penny, even whole sets. </p><p>  The most high-quality and equipped devices usually go for the iPhone.  When shooting with them, sometimes there is doubt that the picture was taken on the phone, as it looks very high quality and professional.  They can also be purchased at chain stores selling mobile phones, or at Chinese sites. </p><p>  But you can make a fisheye on the phone yourself from improvised means.  With skillful handling of materials, as well as in the presence of "direct hands", the result can be significantly surprising, but often such an event is not crowned with success. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldeyecam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fisheye camera shooting" class="if uuid-2436469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56513/2436469.jpg"></div><p>  Similar items are used during security events, as indicated in the picture above.  Allowing you to see what is happening not in length, but in general, the camera perfectly captures violations - from lazy workers to thieves. </p><p>  Also, the fisheye camera can be used in the house, for example, to watch the baby. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  I would also like to remind you that you should not neglect to clean the lenses on the camera.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if she is a telephone or any other.  Preventive cleaning should be carried out as often as possible with a special pencil, which can also be purchased at the store.  After all, a stained lens will not make your picture more beautiful, and a frame that is damaged due to this reason will be insulting. </p>
