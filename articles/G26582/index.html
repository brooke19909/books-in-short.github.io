Experienced tourists are advised to take an individual transfer.  So you will get to the right place much faster. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the entire Lemon Tree hotel chain has a convenient location relative to the main infrastructure of the resort.  Therefore, the hotel described by us positions itself as a place suitable for family vacations. </p><h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Nearest beach to Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 * - Candolim.  It is considered one of the best in the district and is characterized by snow-white sand.  The beach area is quite well equipped, but if desired, vacationers may not rent sunbeds.  They have the opportunity to soak up the hot sand absolutely free by spreading towels. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline.  Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 * and Candolim are separated by about two hundred and fifty meters.  It's nice that they pass through the hotel.

    <h2>  A few words about infrastructure </h2><p>  Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 * refers to small hotels with less than a hundred rooms.  Therefore, its infrastructure is rather modest, which is noted by all tourists in their reviews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In one of the sections we mentioned that most of the guests gather near the pool.  It has a shallow depth: in the middle of an adult, the water level will be about the chest.  The disadvantage of this recreation area is the lack of sunbeds.  This is especially noticeable when on a weekend the Indians' families settle in.  They begin to occupy the sun loungers literally from six in the morning, and lovers to soak in bed will definitely remain out of work. </p><p>  The hotel has one restaurant and bar.  If desired, guests can spend time at the spa.  His services are paid extra, as well as the work of the business center.  He, however, is empty most of the day. </p><p>  The front desk has great functionality.  There is a luggage room, currency exchange and tour desk.  Reception staff are always very friendly, but understand absolutely nothing in Russian.  They also do not speak English perfectly, but judging by the reviews of Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 *, this does not complicate the understanding too much.  Everything can be explained using simple gestures. </p><p>  The hotel is equipped with parking, which is highly appreciated by tourists who love independent trips on rented vehicles. </p><h2>  Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 *: services </h2><p>  Almost all vacationers note that the services provided at the hotel are consistent with four stars.  However, some believe that their level could be improved.  However, this is a purely personal opinion of a certain group of guests. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is excellent on site and in rooms.  But do not forget that you can connect to it only one device in the apartment.  Moreover, the password is individual for each number. </p><p>  Guests can take the opportunity to send dirty clothes to the laundry or dry cleaning.  Ironing service is also available. </p><p>  Vacationers give a good assessment of massage.  This service is also paid, but hotel guests write that they provide it at the highest level. </p><p>  The complex offers car rental.  Of course, the choice of transport here is not too wide, but, in principle, you can always find something suitable. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned once every two days, while the maids themselves determine the quality criteria of their activities.  Sometimes, as tourists write, all towels or bathrobes disappear from the apartment.  The next day they can be returned in a completely different quantity.  But such trifles are usually resolved rather quickly and cannot spoil the rest of the positive-minded guests. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel compliments </h2><p>  The hotel complex offers two types of complements for guests: </p><ul><li>  for birthday; </li><li>  newlyweds. </li></ul><p>  If when booking your room you will inform about the name day, then the hotel will give you a magnificent cake on this holiday. </p><p>  Newlyweds also receive a cake from the administration.  But do not forget to inform the hotel about your event. </p><h2>  The contingent of the hotel complex </h2><p>  This nuance in the reviews is noted by almost all tourists.  When booking a room in this hotel, do not forget that there are always quite a lot of local residents.  As you know, Indians are a very, very noisy nation.  Therefore, from the very early morning until late at night you will have to listen to laughter, screaming, screeching and singing. </p><p>  If you are ready for this state of affairs, then feel free to go to Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 *.  Otherwise, you better look for another hotel complex, where it will be much quieter and calmer. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel offers its guests a variety of dining options.  Most often, tourists choose only breakfast, because there are quite a few cafes and restaurants around the hotel.  The main feature of the food in the restaurant of the complex is the focus on local flavor.  Most of the dishes are full of spices, which is not suitable for every tourist.  In addition, many of them are vegetarian, this is also not like vacationers.  For breakfast, several types of quite European dishes are served, such as scrambled eggs, rolls, sausages and so on. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the restaurant at the Lemon Tree Amarante Beach Resort 4 * hotel is one.  However, it is divided into several different zones, which are separate institutions: </p><ul><li>  Citrus Cafe.  This is where the breakfast buffet is served.  He works no more than eighteen hours a day. </li><li>  Palmeria Grill.  Grilled dishes are prepared in this part. </li><li>  Mango Bar.  This institution is seasonal. </li><li>  Pool Bar.  The bar serves drinks and light snacks. </li></ul><p>  In general, guests are satisfied with the work of the restaurant and bar.

    <h2>  Brief description of the number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has sixty rooms.  Those apartments located on the ground floor have their own access to the garden.  Room types are few in number, there are only two: </p><ul><li>  Plaza.  Three can accommodate here, because the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is twenty-five square meters. </li><li>  Pavillion.  Room size is identical to the previous one, but it is divided into a bedroom and a living room.  Only three guests can check in here. </li></ul><p>  It is nice that the hotel has several rooms for people with disabilities. </p><p>  Each air-conditioned room has a tea / coffee maker and satellite TV.  However, among the nine hundred channels it is impossible to find a single Russian.  This upsets many tourists. </p><p>  Daily maids bring drinking water to the room.  One and a half liters of liquid is put on each guest, sometimes it is issued even in excess. </p><p>  Some vacationers complained in reviews that the technique does not always look new and works well.  But overall they were satisfied with the condition of the rooms. </p>
