Among the new buildings is the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex.  The developer, the IPS company, classifies its offspring as the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù class, in connection with which mostly small-sized housing will prevail in the buildings being built. </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The IPS company has been operating in the real estate market for quite some time and has an excellent reputation.  The developer submits all its facilities on time, as a rule, no claims are received from customers.  In addition, the company uses an integrated approach in its activities, in connection with which all work, from the creation of the project <span>to the commissioning of houses, is</span> carried out without involving third-party organizations.  This explains the high pace of construction and the absence of shortcomings in the delivery of facilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Neva Star" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288241.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the exception was the LCD "Nevskaya Zvezda".  The IPS developer began to erect the residential complex literally before the economic crisis began, in connection with which the deadlines for commissioning the facilities had to be reviewed.  However, work on construction sites did not stop for a minute, today their progress is fully consistent with the schedule, and potential buyers hope that all houses will be completed on time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  Nevskaya Zvezda is a <span>residential complex</span> that will include five multi-sectional houses of different floors.  In this regard, the construction progress was decided to be carried out in stages.  To date, one house for 404 apartments has been commissioned, work is underway on the construction of buildings of the second and third stage.  Construction is carried out using frame-block technology.  In parallel with residential buildings, infrastructure facilities are being built.  The construction of the second-stage high-rise building is planned to be completed by the end of 2016, and the third-stage house will be commissioned in 2019. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva star housing estate" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288242.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Already today it is possible to purchase on an equity basis one of the apartments that have attracted attention in the building that is being prepared for delivery.  Which is very beneficial for potential customers, since at this stage the apartments are sold at the lowest cost. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and ecology of the area </h2><p>  Nevskaya Zvezda is a residential complex characterized by an extremely attractive location.  It is being built almost on the border with the suburbs, in connection with which a forest and a river are located not far from the buildings.  What today is very valuable for a resident of a metropolis.  In addition, in the region where the construction of buildings is underway, there is no industrial production, so from the point of view of the environmental situation, the situation in the Nevsky district is very favorable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not far from the residential complex is located the metro station "Proletarskaya", which can be reached in just five minutes, which is another undoubted advantage.  Near the houses there are bus stops from which buses and fixed-route taxis leave regularly, so residents of the complex can easily reach any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  Motorists, on the other hand, can use <span>Obukhovskaya</span> Oblast Avenue to get to the center, or take the exits to the roundabout to go onto the autobahns of the Leningrad Region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="housing estate Neva Star" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex is located in an area with an already existing social, shopping and entertainment infrastructure, so residents of high-rise buildings will definitely not experience a shortage of its facilities.  Near the houses there are schools, and gardens, and supermarkets and much more.  In addition, commercial buildings will also be located in the buildings on the first floors, so that you can get all the necessary services after the construction is completed literally without leaving home. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Since the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex belongs to the economy class segment, it mainly consists of studios and one-room apartments.  There are two and three bedroom apartments, however there are much fewer of them.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidential premises is from 30 to 70 squares.  The layouts of the apartments are thought out very carefully, the designers took into account every centimeter of the precious area.  Studios and many odnushki are equipped with combined bathrooms, they are separate in larger premises.  Each apartment has a balcony, in the hallway there is a niche for a dressing room.  The kitchens are spacious, equipped with electric stoves.  Regardless of the format, each type of apartment has five types of layouts, so everyone can choose the one that suits their taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva star housing estate developer IPS" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All apartments are for rent with a fine finish, that is, you can immediately celebrate a housewarming after checking in. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex offers potential buyers to purchase housing at fairly affordable prices.  The cost of one square meter is about 77 thousand rubles.  The studio will cost the buyer about 2,500,000 rubles, odnushka - 3,000,000, kopeck piece - 4,500,000, and for the three rubles it will be necessary to pay about 6,000,000 rubles. </p><h2>  What do the owners of apartments in the residential complex "Nevskaya Zvezda" say </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> receives good <span>reviews</span> .  A lot of people like it, no one makes any special claims in this regard.  The quality of construction work and decoration is not bad, except that some are not completely satisfied with the wallpaper design in their apartments, but this is a purely individual matter.  People don‚Äôt quite like the fact that the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex is located far from the clinics, but there is a metro and a bus stop nearby, so the claims are clearly overstated.  People like transport links, they are pleased that there are many shops, cafes and restaurants near the houses.  It also matters that there are three schools nearby, which residents also consider a big plus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neva star housing estate reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288245.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The cost of housing is also not particularly complaints.  Of course, I would like it to be cheaper, but if you compare it with other offers, you can see that the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex is one of the best options available today in the economy class segment. </p>
