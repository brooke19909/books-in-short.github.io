Currently, it is a large telecommunications company, which is one of the five largest domestic telecom operators.  Almost all of its shares are owned by Russian Railways.  The company itself is one of the largest providers of backbone communication services for corporations and operators, one of the leaders in the market of broadband Internet access for ordinary users.  The subscriber base of Trans TeleCom is almost two million subscribers. </p><h2>  history of the company </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mosoblreclama.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Office TTK" class="if uuid-3072287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072287.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews on the Internet in the "TTK" are different.  One thing is certain, every month there are more and more users of this company, as it constantly spreads its influence in new regions and cities. </p><p>  TransTeleCom has been leading its history since 1997, when it was founded at the initiative of the Federal Ministry of Railways.  Then the main goal was the construction of a backbone digital communication network, which was required by domestic railways. </p><p>  For three years, a fiber optic network was built with a length of about 45 thousand kilometers.  It covered 71 regions of Russia, almost a thousand settlements.  The company officially started commercial operation of the network in 2001, in fact becoming one of the largest providers of Internet access via a dedicated line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By 2003, the company's revenue had tripled; it had about a thousand corporate clients.  In 2008, it became known that "TTK" enters the retail market, starting to offer broadband Internet access to the population.  By the spring of next year, the company‚Äôs branches were opened in all major cities of the country with the exception of Moscow.  For a long time, the company could not enter the capital's market. </p><p>  Since 2012, TTK has been providing cable television services.  Among the recent large-scale projects, it should be noted the construction of equipment for digital terrestrial broadcasting as part of the implementation of the corresponding federal target program, which was implemented in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). </p><h2>  Guide </h2><p>  The Russian Railways Open Joint Stock Company owns 99.9 percent of the shares of TTK. </p><p>  The direct president of the company is Roman Kravtsov, who has been heading it since 2016.  He began his career at the Novosibirsk branch of Rostelecom.  Under his leadership, a new management team was formed, which began to carry out a set of measures aimed at improving the operational efficiency of the TTK business. </p><p>  In particular, to date, it has already been possible to increase its share in the international transit market in several key areas at once.  For example, with Azerbaijan and China.  In this segment alone, for one year, the company's revenue grew by 650 million rubles. </p><p>  The chairman of the board of directors is Evgeny Igorevich Charkin, who at the same time holds the post of head of information technology at Russian Railways. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the market, the company has a fairly aggressive takeover and merger policy.  To date, she has already managed to acquire several large providers who worked in one or several regions of Russia at once.  In particular, these are Tron-plus, Dartel, Ivtelecom, Informtek, Electro-com, Dars-IP, Maginfo, TV-Kom.ru, Integrated Transport Network "," TeleSOT "," Severlink ". </p><p>  In addition, the company "TTK" has already managed to take almost 75 percent of the shares of one of the largest manufacturers of fiber optic cable in the country - the company "Transvok", which provides its services throughout the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  mobile connection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vostokmedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet TV TTK" class="if uuid-3072284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072284.jpg"></div><p>  Another fundamentally new novelty from TTK was the launch of its own mobile operator based on the infrastructure of Tele 2.  The first subscribers who were able to test the quality of the provided communication were customers in the Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Region.  Soon, the network began to extend to other regions of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Currently, subscribers are provided not only cellular communications and the ability to send SMS messages, but also access to mobile Internet. </p><p>  During its existence, the operator has expanded its presence in the Ryazan, Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and Chelyabinsk regions, in the Altai Territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In particular, the service "Single Account" is offered to subscribers.  In this case, you can pay for your mobile phone bill, broadband Internet access from home via a dedicated line, as well as interactive home television. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vostokmedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet Service Provider Reviews" class="if uuid-3072283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072283.jpg"></div><p>  If at first the regional branches of the company were directly subordinate to subsidiaries of Russian Railways, then since 2014 the situation has changed dramatically. </p><p>  The reorganization process was completed, after which the TTK company was transformed into a single federal company with a network of its own branches.  There are currently eight of them. </p><p>  The center of the macroregion of the Far East is located in Khabarovsk, Siberia - in Krasnoyarsk, Western Siberia - in Novosibirsk, the Urals - in Yekaterinburg, Verkhnevolzhsky - in Nizhny Novgorod, the North - in Yaroslavl, the Caucasus - in Rostov-on-Don, the Center - in Moscow. </p><h2>  Address </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.750707" data-lng="37.532812000000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/1/8/5/14185.png"></div><p>  The head office of the company is located in Moscow at the address: Testovskaya street, house 8. The management of the company is located in the territory of the Severnaya Tower business center. </p><p>  This is in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Third Transport Ring, not far from the Botanical Garden of the Metropolitan State Medical University.  Not far from the office of the company are the metro stations "Mezhdunarodnaya" and "Business center". </p><h2>  Services </h2><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Internet" class="if uuid-3072289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072289.jpg"></div><p>  Internet provider "TTK" in Russia provides various services, they may vary depending on the region.  Moreover, both in cost and in description.  However, in most regional offices, a single approach is still being implemented with a common pricing and corporate policy. </p><p>  In particular, now the Internet provider "TTK" provides Russians with high-speed Internet, satellite TV, and also provides package offers of services. </p><p>  For example, within the framework of the package ‚ÄúOn Top‚Äù, the client has the opportunity to immediately access both the home Internet and interactive television.  There are two options for the package: basic and advanced. </p><p>  The cost of the basic tariff is 470 rubles per month.  For this money, the client receives an Internet speed of up to 100 Mbit per second and 107 channels.  In an expanded version of the package, the Internet speed remains the same, and the number of channels increases to 138. </p><p>  It should be noted separately that to connect interactive television, the client will have to additionally purchase a set-top box. </p><p>  Also, you can connect the Internet and interactive television separately.  The tariff ‚ÄúOn top‚Äù when connecting high-speed Internet will cost you 380 rubles a month in the first year after connecting, then the price rises to 430 rubles. </p><p>  This tariff includes the Home Internet service and Wi-fi router.  It is worth noting that the tariff payment system is credit.  If in the first year after connecting, the subscriber decides to terminate the contract or change the tariff plan, he will have to pay a one-time payment for connecting this service in full.  It also includes the full cost of equipment that was installed in accordance with the contract of sale. </p><p>  The company offers two main tariffs for high-speed Internet.  "TTK 60" (speed up to 60 Mbit per second, cost 400 rubles per month), "TTK 100" (speed up to 100 Mbit per second, cost 450 rubles per month). </p><h2>  Interactive tv </h2><div class="photo" data-original="3ojlotou.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TTK Internet Service Provider" class="if uuid-3072285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072285.jpg"></div><p>  The company offers a variety of tariffs for connecting interactive television. </p><p>  When connecting the ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù tariff, the user receives 60 channels for 49 rubles per month, the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù tariff involves 107 channels for 150 rubles per month.  Finally, the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù tariff allows you to watch 138 channels for 249 rubles per month. </p><p>  There are also additional packages.  As a rule, they are thematic: </p><ol><li>  Package "Sport" - 6 channels, 149 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "Children's" - 13 channels, 199 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "For Adults" - 4 channels, 359 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "Cognitive" - ‚Äã‚Äã19 channels, 249 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "Match! Football" - 3 channels, 380 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "Match! Premier" - 1 channel, 219 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "Cinema" - 16 channels, 249 rubles per month. </li><li>  Package "Shant Premium HD" - 1 channel, 240 rubles per month. </li></ol><p>  The company provides a subscription to video rental as part of connecting services.  Separately, you can connect Amediatek for 299 rubles per month, ivi service for 149 rubles per month, START video service for 199 rubles per month. </p><p>  When you connect interactive television, a prefix for five thousand rubles is purchased.  Its purchase can be issued in installments. </p><h2>  TV development </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.verstov.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Company TTK" class="if uuid-3072288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072288.jpg"></div><p>  Interestingly, the development of interactive television is a new segment in the company's work.  Since 2017, TTK has been providing customers with the opportunity to watch channels in the highest quality and independently manage the broadcast, if necessary.  To do this, pause, rewind, and viewing already completed programs are provided. </p><p>  Currently, interactive television services are available to subscribers in 142 cities of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.verstov.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TTK Services" class="if uuid-3072290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3072290.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews about the Internet television, TTK predominantly has to deal with negative comments about the work of the company. </p><p>  In terms of connecting additional TV packages, the greatest indignation is the connection of paid services without the consent of the user, they do not even notify him about this.  Moreover, if you turn to them with a complaint, then the call center operators solve these problems according to the standard scenario.  They begin to convince the client that they called up at the mobile phone number indicated by him when they connected, he allegedly gave his consent to connect these services, and now as if he does not remember this. </p><p>  To prove their case, subscribers have to go to their service provider to get a printout of incoming calls.  Only in this way is it possible to prove that the company simply brazenly lied.  But even after that they refuse to return at least some money, claiming that the service was connected, the subscriber used it, which means that they fulfilled their obligations in full, for which they can take the money that they owe for it. </p><p>  This attitude towards customers leads to a large number of negative customer reviews about TTK.  To the Internet, which users receive through a dedicated line, there are also enough complaints.  We will talk about this in more detail. </p><h2>  Internet which is not </h2><p>  Even the users who have been using the services of this company for many years leave bad reviews on the TTK Internet.  They note that if earlier it was a really high-quality company that provided high-quality services and took care of its customers, now the situation has changed dramatically.  In the reviews on the Internet in "TTK" this fact is noted by the vast majority of users. </p><p>  Users in almost all regions of Russia emphasize that the company constantly has problems with stable communication, which it is not able to solve.  In the reviews about the Internet provider ZAO Intelbi TTK, many complaints are related to the fact that customers are constantly deceived with the status of the account.  Money from him constantly disappears somewhere, to restore the real history of payments is very problematic. </p><p>  In the reviews of TransTeleCom (TTK), subscribers complain that the company constantly debits money even for those time periods when there was no communication due to their fault.  For example, due to breakdowns or other technical reasons.  According to reviews, establishing contacts with TTK is extremely problematic.  If any problems arise, the operators are reluctant to meet, they are not at all interested in resolving issues and complaints that arise from consumers. </p><p>  Home Internet from "TTK" in reviews is constantly scolded.  The standard situation is observed in almost all regions of the Russian Federation in which the company has its own representative offices. </p><p>  It turns out that it is especially difficult to restore the Internet if it disappeared due to some technical problem.  In the reviews about the home Internet in ‚ÄúTTK‚Äù, users admit that their application for restoring access to the network has been ignored by the provider for several weeks.  As a result, it is increasingly possible to find estimates that this is the most terrible provider of the existing ones.  In the customer reviews on the Internet from "TTK" they admit that with a dedicated line problems exist constantly, they are solved slowly and reluctantly.  As a result, the promised connection does not happen for weeks. </p><p>  All this leads to a large number of negative reviews about the Internet provider "TTK".  Those who now use the services of this company, strongly recommend that you bypass it. </p>
