    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of positive comments, there were some gaps in the work of the Baiyoke Sky Hotel 4 * resort.  Reviews indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  the air conditioner works like a beast, and therefore you can catch a cold very quickly (but if you turn it off, it will be incredibly stuffy); </li><li>  the carpets in the rooms are very dusty, as if they had never been vacuumed (especially allergic people will feel this); </li><li>  ventilation is arranged somewhat strange, and therefore in rooms located near the restaurant, there is often a smell of products from the kitchen; </li><li>  the pool is small enough for so many rooms; </li><li>  when checking into the hotel you have to leave a deposit ($ 100 or their equivalent in local currency); </li><li>  the rooms lack balconies where one could breathe fresh air or dry things; </li><li>  very high prices in restaurants; </li><li>  quite often there are problems with the return of the deposit (be sure to keep a receipt); </li><li>  the choice of excursions is rather scarce, but the prices are simply sky-high; </li><li>  due to the fact that there is a market around the hotel, access to it by taxi is very difficult; </li><li>  when you arrive at the hotel, no one will meet you at the entrance and will not help with your suitcases; </li><li>  there is no ramp, and therefore you have to literally drag your luggage up the stairs; </li><li>  the whole impression of the room is spoiled by an old, leaky, dusty carpet; </li><li>  in the low category rooms are just miniature televisions; </li><li>  the plumbing is already a little thin, and therefore leaking; </li><li>  only a small part of it works from the entire observation deck, and all the rest are closed for repairs (because of this, constant crowds are created, and it is simply impossible to admire the city); </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is positioning itself at a very high level, tables and chairs are wrapped in plastic in the dining room, as in a cheap eatery; </li><li>  when paying for services, carefully monitor the actions of staff and require a check, as often money is often debited from the card twice; </li><li>  this situation often arises that you may not be accommodated in the apartments that you paid for, but in a room with a class lower, so control this process; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel's feature is in the panoramic windows, they are rather dirty, and therefore the whole impression of the city landscape spoils. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A rather interesting accommodation option is the Baiyoke Sky Hotel (Bangkok).  Reviews about him, as you can see, are quite contradictory.  The hotel is interesting in that it is one of the main <span>attractions of Bangkok</span> due to its height.  Accordingly, you can enjoy stunning views both from the windows of the rooms and from the observation deck.  Nevertheless, there are some flaws that are simply unacceptable at such a high cost of accommodation.  We are talking about dirty carpets, old plumbing, as well as frequent misunderstandings with payment for services and the return of collateral.  In general, the hotel is worthy of the attention of travelers. </p>
