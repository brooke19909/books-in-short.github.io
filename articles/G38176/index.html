This can be an act of vandalism, theft, damage during an accident.  Other types of damage are not excluded.  Casco is popular due to the wide range of costs that insurance covers.

    <h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  This is not to say that such car insurance is a cheap option, but it is precisely it that is the most popular today.  Thus, if you want to protect your budget from unforeseen, unnecessary expenses, it's time to study the rules of CASCO.  Insured events can be different: not the most successful parking, theft, causing any harm.  If any such trouble has occurred, a person who has a hull issued will be fully compensated (in accordance with the damage). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Mini hull - what is it? </h2><p>  The modern <span>market of insurance</span> services provides its customers with a ton of offers, for example, there are different types of comprehensive insurance.  What is this ‚Äúmini‚Äù option for this insurance?  He really deserves attention. </p><p>  This is such an insurance product that motorists are offered in almost all the leading domestic insurance companies.  In fact, we are talking about a simplified CASCO program, which guarantees reliable protection against risks, protects a person from serious losses.  What troubles will such insurance help? <br><br></p><ul><li>  car theft; </li><li>  loss of a car or its damage due to natural disaster or fire; </li><li>  Accident or work accident; </li><li>  damage due to actions of utility or technical services (for example, damage was caused by representatives of law enforcement agencies or rescue services). </li></ul><p>  The list of risks that the ‚Äúmini‚Äù offer will cover varies significantly - it all depends on the particular company.  However, there are still common features: a fairly low cost (when compared with the full policy), and the insurance policy has significant limitations.  As a rule, people save up to 30% of the price of comprehensive insurance if they choose the ‚Äúmini‚Äù package. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What is the plus? </h2><p>  The main advantage of an incomplete package, when compared with a full-fledged CASCO policy, is impressive financial savings.  This <span>form of insurance is</span> ideal for inexperienced, young drivers, as well as those people whose car is already worn out.  If the warranty from the manufacturer has already ended for the vehicle, you should also pay attention to the "mini" option Casco.  This tool is also convenient in such a situation when the car enthusiast does not want to insure the car against all possible risks, if, for example, you need to drive only several times a month, and the rest of the time the car is in the garage or in a paid parking lot. </p><h2>  Franchise in CASCO </h2><p>  Surely someone had heard about the CASCO franchise.  What it is?  This is the name of the part of the insurance damage that the owner indemnifies himself if an insured event occurs.  As a rule, we are talking about a fixed <span>insurance amount,</span> although many firms express this value as a percentage.  The situation is as follows: CASCO provides the client with a significant discount on its services, but any minor repairs (agreed in advance with representatives of the insurance company) will have to be carried out by spending money from your own pocket.  There are two <span>types of franchises</span> for cars <span>:</span> conditional and unconditional. </p>

    <h2>  Unconditional franchise </h2><p>  In the insurance policy, this procedure is stipulated approximately like this: the owner of the car assumes an obligation, which consists in the fact that he compensates a certain amount in the event that he receives damage.  It is worth considering a simple example: there is a car that is insured under this program.  The franchise limit is, say, 5,000 rubles.  If an insured event occurs, for example, for 15 thousand, the company will pay the owner of the car only 10 000. </p><h2>  Conditional Franchise </h2><p>  What can be said about this proposal?  Under a conditional deductible, the insurance company fully compensates for all the damage caused to the car only when its size is higher than a certain level.  If you pay attention to the reviews on CASCO, then in this situation everything looks like this: if the car crashes, but the amount of damage is less than the franchise bar, the owner pays for the repair work.  If the damage is greater than the data in the contract, the owner will be paid for the restoration of the car. </p>

    <p>  Everyone must decide for themselves whether it is worth using a franchise with hull insurance.  What is it - many have understood from our article.  It is enough to pay attention to the situation in big cities - there is a great risk of just minor damage (scratches on the bumper, wings).  Insurance companies calculate the deductible in such a way that the repair cost is slightly lower than the established payment level.  That is, before making a choice, you need to try to take into account all the nuances.  A franchise is really a wonderful way to save money, especially its maximum option.  In such a situation, you will have to pay about half as much for the hull as in the usual case.  That is, even owners of fairly old cars can seriously think about the CASCO insurance policy - today it is real. </p>
