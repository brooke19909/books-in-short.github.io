To answer this question, one should turn to the origin of the name of the state.  The word "Japan", as we call it, is an exonym and has passed from German.  Residents themselves refer to their homeland as "Nihon" or "Nippon."  Both the first and second versions are recorded using kanji.  "Nippon" - the name is more official.  As a rule, it is applied on stamps, yens, in the names of any events of national importance.  In everyday life, "Nihon" is most often used. </p><p>  The Japanese themselves call themselves "nihondzin," the language they speak is nihongo.  Officially, the state is called Nippon Koku or Nihon Koku.  The latter option literally translates as "home / source of the Sun."  This name appeared for the first time in correspondence between the Emperor and representatives of Sui (Chinese dynasty).  "Nihon" is often translated as "Land of the Rising Sun".  Actively, this name began to be used approximately from the Nara period.  Until that moment, the state was called "Yamato". <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japan culture" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/414352.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  History of Japan </h2><p>  For the first time, the archipelago began to populate around the 40th millennium BC.  e.  The ancient Japanese were engaged in gathering and hunting, made coarse tools.  At that time there were no ceramic products, in connection with which that period is also called the "period of pre-ceramic culture." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After him, the time began.  According to the archaeological periodization of states, it corresponds to the Neolithic and Mesolithic.  A characteristic feature of that time was the formation, in fact, of the archipelago itself.  During this period, ceramic products began to appear in everyday life. </p><p>  Around 500 BC  e.  the time has begun.  This period is characterized by the appearance of irrigation rice cultivation, a <span>loom</span> and a <span>potter's wheel, the</span> beginning of the processing of metals (iron, bronze, copper), the construction of protective settlements.  All these innovations have come about thanks to visitors from Korea and China.  For the first time, "Land of the Rising Sun" is mentioned in one Chinese chronicle - "Hanshu."  The "land of Ba" (the so-called Chinese archipelago) is described in more detail in the "History of the Three Kingdoms".  According to the information, the principality of Yamatai was the most powerful in the third century.  He was led by the ruler Himiko. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fine art of japan" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/414353.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  State and political system </h2><p>  The land of the rising sun - Japan - is a constitutional parliamentary monarchy.  According to the Basic Law of the State of 1947, the Emperor is "a symbol of the unity of the people and the state."  All decisions and appointments are made and implemented by him in accordance with the submission of the Cabinet of Ministers.  The emperor at the diplomatic meetings acts as the Head of State.  The board has been in the hands of Akihito since 1989. </p><p>  The parliament acts as the supreme body of state power and a single legislative structure.  It includes two chambers: representatives and advisers.  The latter is updated every 3 years by 50%.  There are 480 deputies in the House of Representatives.  They are elected for 4 years.  The House of Councilors consists of 242 deputies elected for 6 years.  In accordance with the Constitution, parliament is vested with absolute legislative power and has the exclusive right to manage finances. </p><p>  All residents over the age of twenty can take part in the elections.  The election of deputies to the chambers is carried out by secret ballot.  There are two main parties in Japan.  In 2009, the Democratic Party of Social Liberals replaced the liberal-democratic conservative association in parliament, which ruled for 54 years with the majority of votes. </p><h2>  Japanese culture </h2><p>  From the end of the first millennium AD, literature began to actively develop.  The first texts of the Japanese anthem date back to the 9-10th centuries.  Some monuments of architecture and painting of the beginning of the second millennium have also been preserved.  During the formation of the culture of Japan, China, and then Western Europe, had a great influence on it. </p><p>  Traditionally, the folk epic was rich in various stories about monsters, ghosts, strange creatures.  The most popular were ekai.  Each of these characters had unique goals and traits that were associated with their death.  In the process of development of society, many images were "modernized."  In Japan, there is a fairly popular legend.  The Tale of Hanako Dressing is a modern version of the Yurei myths.  When conducting a survey of the population of modern Japan, it was possible to collect more than a hundred different stories about monsters.  Common to all "yurey" features were different deformities.  For example, the mouth hidden behind the hair, the absence of the lower half of the body, like that of the chopped-up Reiko Kashima, now moving on her elbows and chopping a braid of people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="country of the rising sun photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/414354.jpg" width="301"></div>

    <h2>  Painting </h2><p>  The fine art of Japan is, first of all, gorgeous paintings made on paper, painting the walls of palaces, fabrics, screens, fans and <span>theater masks.</span>  Early works include illustrations for short stories, tales, and stories.  They date from 8-12 centuries.  The ancient art of the Land of the Rising Sun is primarily a tribute to the beautiful, natural, natural.  In the 14th century, landscape painting technique penetrated ink.  Japanese artists have reached a truly unprecedented level of their skill.  Using black, they created truly masterpieces and conveyed a riot of colors of nature.  One of these masters is Sesshu.  His creations look very lively and natural.  In the paintings the mood of the painter is excellently conveyed. </p><h2>  Wall painting </h2><p>  This form of art reached its heyday by the 12th-13th centuries.  It was at that time that the walls of the palaces began to be covered with majestic colorful paintings.  As a rule, they illustrated the lyrical characters of the stories that were popular at that time.  Thanks to the painting of the walls of the palaces, a technique such as woodcut - woodcuts - entered the <span>art of Japan</span> .  These masterpieces were created not only by artists, but also by masters who cut special printing boards, as well as a printer who worked on prints. </p><p>  The production of icons and amulets began in the 13th century.  But it should be said that woodcut was recognized as an independent art form only in the 17th century.  Until the 18th century, engravings were black and white.  In the 17-19th centuries, a new style of woodcut was formed - Ukiyo-e.  This name can be translated as "illustration of a floating world."  This type of engraving is considered one of the areas of "edo" - art, the main theme of which was the festive and everyday life of citizens. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what country of the rising sun" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/414355.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Great masters </h2><p>  Japanese engraving has been glorified by a number of artists.  Among them, first of all, Tosyusya Sharaka should be highlighted.  Engravings by the master were illustrated by Kabuki actors, vividly describing and somewhat exaggerating the character traits of each of them.  Another author - Kitagawa Utamaro - portrayed beautiful women in his works.  Katsushika Hokusai created 36 Views of Fuji. </p><p>  It should be said here that the use of color in woodcuts came from China.  At first, the craftsmen applied a limited number of shades.  By the 18th century, the color technique took a leading place in woodcut.  At that time, art was mainly concentrated on such genres as Yakusha-e and bidzing.  The main theme of the latter was the charm, living in the "green quarters" (entertainment houses). </p><p>  It should be noted that the color in these engravings was not only an artistic, but also an informative tool.  The plots illustrated the residents of cities with new fashion trends, different directions from the life of the capital, the activities of artisans and merchants, their families.  Works of the Yakusha-e style can be attributed to the advertising stream.  They were very similar to posters and portrayed actors who played in famous theaters and were the favorites of the public. </p><h2>  The science </h2><p>  The country of the rising sun - Japan - is considered one of the leading in the field of science, robotics, biomedicine.  In various research works involved about 700 thousand specialists.  Japan is in third place by the funds spent on the development of science.  The state leads in the use and production of robots.  Japan also holds a leading place in fundamental science.  In the state, 13 scientists are Nobel laureates in medicine, chemistry and physics.  In the country itself, more than half of the developed and released robots are used. </p><h2>  Space exploration </h2><p>  Aeronautical, planetary and space research is carried out by the Aerospace Agency.  Its staff also designs satellites and rockets.  The Agency has the ability to launch artificial satellites into orbit of the Earth, interplanetary stations of automatic type.  In addition, the research complex takes an active part in the International Space Program.  So, in 2010, a satellite was launched to study the planet Venus.  In addition, preparations are underway for the study of Mercury, it is planned by 2030 to build a base on the moon.  Japan, as you can see, is conducting large-scale space exploration.  In 2007, the 2nd artificial satellite was launched.  His work is aimed at collecting information about the appearance and development of the moon. </p>
