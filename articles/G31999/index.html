That is, the state‚Äôs pension system now insures the risk of the fact that the insured person of the PFR will be left without means of subsistence, that is, retired.  What insurance cases does the law now consider?  The cases of insured persons are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Retirement after reaching a certain age. </li><li>  The loss of the breadwinner.  Moreover, at any age, if a person alone can‚Äôt get a livelihood. </li><li>  Loss of (full or partial) disability.  Also at any age from the moment of birth. </li></ol>

    <p>  <span>The federal law</span> prescribes all definitions and conditions regarding guarantee fees, reimbursements and restockings of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  Everything related to the personal account of the insured subject can be found in the personal account of the PF. </p><h2>  Insurance coverage of insured persons </h2><p>  Insurance coverage upon occurrence of the above insured events shall recognize: </p><ul><li>  old-age labor pension; </li><li>  the accumulative and insurance part of the pension for loss of working capacity by a person; </li><li>  survivor insurance benefits; </li><li>  payment for the burial of a pensioner who no longer worked. </li></ul><p>  The basis of the entire financial system of the pension fund is those funds that are accumulated in the fund itself, as well as the money accumulated in the personal account. </p><h2>  FIU Functions </h2><p>  The Pension Fund is designed to provide the population with all kinds of benefits.  In a civilized state, a person should not be afraid that, having lost his ability to work, he will remain without the protection of society.

    <p>  If you already have a personal activation code, enter it in the "Personal Data" section of the public services.  To register with ESIA, the insured needs a passport, insurance certificate data and mobile number. </p><p>  The PFR website no longer needs to enter personal data after this.  You just need to go to the page of the site - "Office of the insured person" and click on "Login".  The system will recognize you. </p><h2>  Innovations on the PFR website </h2><p>  My account has greatly simplified the communication of the pension fund and citizens.  After all, insured persons are those who need the help of this state body, and all services should be clear to all customers of the system.  Recently, the service has been expanding its services. </p><p>  Now, those citizens who are still abroad can see their state of the savings account online.  Earlier for this it was necessary to write a statement and wait for an answer.  And also quickly now it is possible to fill out a statement stating that the person‚Äôs employment status has changed. </p><h2>  Rights and obligations of those insured </h2><p>  The rights and obligations of these entities are defined in Article 14 of Ch.  3. The Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Individual Registration in the Compulsory Pension Insurance System‚Äù.  The insured person as a subject of legal relations undoubtedly has its rights. </p>
