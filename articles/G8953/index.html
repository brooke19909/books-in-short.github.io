The best option would be a children's camp, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Such places in Russia are unthinkable.  Of course, before buying a ticket you should familiarize yourself with the reviews.  According to a large number of people, including schoolchildren, one of the most worthy of institutions is the camp "Signalman". </p>

    <h2>  Virtual tour </h2><p>  Last year, the complex turned 59 years old.  At the same time, 420 young guests are accommodated here, starting from the age of six.  It should be noted that the children's institution receives not only enthusiastic cheers from guests, but also diplomas from the Federation of Trade Unions for the quality and professional performance of duties.  Now about the location: the complex is located an hour's drive from St. Petersburg, in the picturesque and quiet village of Petrovskoye, next to the lake.  A similar camp "Signalman" (Sergeevka) is located in Belgorod. </p><p>  The abundance of mixed forest has a beneficial effect on health.  The whole territory is planted with flowering shrubs, garden trees, fragrant flowers, which creates a feeling of complete harmony.  Where, no matter how in nature, you can fully take a break from stressful everyday life and a series of unpleasant events! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The institution employs experienced teachers and friendly counselors.  Interesting programs are being developed for children aimed at revealing the talents and abilities of each child.  Numerous circles and sections will help the student understand what attracts and takes him.  In addition, <span>sports relay races,</span> competitions, and active contests are held with children.  Not a single child will be left without attention. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Children up to 15 years old are admitted to the Signalman camp in the Leningrad Region.  The guys are divided into 14 groups and are housed in rooms.  In the protected area, two-story buildings of brick were erected, in which cozy rooms for up to six people are concentrated.  The rooms are connected to the central communications, in cold weather heating is performed. </p>

    <p>  The rooms have standard conditions for living: beds, bedside tables, wardrobe.  In common use the bathroom is located on the floor.  In the lobby there is a TV with upholstered furniture.  In warm weather, children can be accommodated in wooden houses for 10 people (toilet and shower on the street).  Also, a five-story building with comfortable rooms for 4 people with a private bathroom was built on the territory.  The choice is up to the parents! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  Any adequate parent is always worried about the quality of nutrition of his child.  It seems to many that in institutions of this type they feed poorly and tastelessly.  We hasten to dispel all doubts and disputes, since the Svyazist signal camp for children, like no one else, strictly monitors the freshness and quality of products.  Cooks are prepared in accordance with the norms of SanPiN. </p>

    <p>  Holidays spent in this spirit will give the child a lot of pleasure and a portion of positive emotions.  Depending on the interests of the student, he will be offered a list of sports activities: yoga, gymnastics, wrestling, dancing.  Counselors organize competitions between teams in order to develop a spirit of competition, teach teamwork and cohesion. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  In summer, the beach season opens.  The pond is 70 meters from the residential buildings.  The beach is cleaned with enviable regularity.  The beach is strewn with small sand for the convenience of children.  The counselors and rescuers strictly monitor the order and safety.  Children's camp "Signalman" is equipped with a medical center and treatment rooms. </p><p>  A library and a room with computers are open for children.  Every day in the cinema, cartoons are scrolled, theater performances with the participation of young talents are organized.  In the evening, music plays and a disco takes place.  During the day, children attend mugs to choose from: fine arts, dancing, decoupage, acting, etc. </p>

    <p>  For active and sports children, there is a <span>wellness center</span> with a swimming pool, a gym and even a ski run.  In the presence of a billiard room, table tennis, intellectual games (checkers, backgammon, chess).  The open area is ennobled by bicycle paths, gazebos, benches.  A playground has been built for younger students. </p><h2>  Children's camp "Signalman": reviews of parents and children </h2><p>  The guys enthusiastically, with smiles of happiness on their faces, talk about summer vacations in this institution.  Comfortable and clean rooms did not cause any discontent.  An absolute advantage is the presence of a swimming pool, where children can frolic and swim a lot.  There is where to spend the accumulated energy.  Adults and children were pleased with the food, characterized by freshness, diversity and calorie content.  In conclusion, I would like to summarize that the ‚ÄúSignalman‚Äù camp helps schoolchildren spend their holidays in a fun, active and entertaining way. </p>
