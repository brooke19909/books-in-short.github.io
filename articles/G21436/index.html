Its mild climate, colorful population, rich history, developed service, affordable prices attract a huge number of tourists every year.  In this country there are several resort cities, which are especially popular with guests.  Kemer also belongs to them.  This is a city with an ancient history, which has more than 2500 years.  A few years ago, vacation in Kemer was not in demand, and its inhabitants lived at the expense of fishing.  With the influx of tourists into the country, the situation has changed, and now a large number of people dream of getting here. </p><p>  Beaches surrounded by mountains, citrus and coniferous gardens, olive plantations, clean air and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãazure color make your vacation in Kemer unforgettable.  The city has a large National Park with olive and orange groves, pine forest, sandy and pebble beach.  It is so large that you can walk around it all day.  Kemer is often compared to Switzerland.  Such a comparison came from the baths of this city, which, according to many tourists, work wonders.  Due to their mineral composition, they contribute to the rejuvenation of the body and the cure of certain diseases.  In order to make your vacation in Kemer as useful as possible, you should visit the town of Pamukkale.  Here you can make a bath in <span>Cleopatra‚Äôs bathtub, the</span> mineral waters of which not only enrich the body with minerals and calcium, but also make micro massage with bubbles.  Another interesting procedure is called foam scrubbing.  During her two men exfoliate the body with a special composition of <span>apricot kernels,</span> ground coffee and foam.  It is worth warning that during the procedure they massage the whole body, not excluding any of its parts.  Continuing the theme of purification, you should go to Manavgat.  Here is the famous Manavgat Falls, which, according to legend, washes away all sins.  You can get there by boat.  It is worth noting that Kemer has everything you need for sailors.  On its coast, it is possible to moor up to 180 yachts at a time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A vacation in Kemer with children is very popular among tourists.  There is absolutely everything here to keep the child busy on vacation.  In the city there is a dolphinarium, where there are daily performances with dolphins.  You can go to the water park.  It is not as big as in Antalya, but all children and adults will like it.  Almost all hotels have their own mini zoo, where children can get acquainted with exotic animals.  If tourists have chosen an all-inclusive hotel, then you can not worry about food and drinks.  There are so many of them in the public domain that some vacationers never have time to try everything during their vacation.  The cuisine is very diverse.  The turkey and lamb are especially tasty at local cooks.  For vegetarians, there is a menu that provides them with a very large selection of all kinds of dishes. </p><p>  Many tour agencies offer last-minute trips to Kemer, the cost of which is almost two times lower than the reservation.  They allow for a small fee to spend an unforgettable vacation in one of the most beautiful corners of the world.  If last-minute tours to Kemer were purchased, then you should not worry about which hotel will go to it.  Service at this resort is at a very high level, regardless of the stardom of the hotel.  Young people love to relax here, because the city has a large number of chic nightclubs and restaurants.  You can also go diving or climbing.  This makes it possible to see all the splendor of the nature of these places with my own eyes.  Have a nice rest! </p>
