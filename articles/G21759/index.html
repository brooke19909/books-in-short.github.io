Making crafts contributes to the development of fine motor skills of hands and fingers, thinking, memory and mindfulness, perseverance and accuracy.  During operation, step-by-step manufacturing schemes are often used, so you need to be able to read them, understand the sequence of bends.  At the same time, the ability to navigate in space, visual memory, logical thinking develops. </p><p>  Origami lessons with a child can begin as early as 3-4 years.  Children are most interested in making toys, so we will devote our article to the study of the simplest schemes that children can do.  Parents can also try their hand at folding paper figures to show the pattern to their children. </p><p>  How to make origami is shown in detail in the diagrams, and step-by-step instructions will help to correctly complete the task. </p><h2>  Paper boat </h2><p>  Boys like to play with boats, run them into the river, then into a simple puddle after the rain.  At any time, if desired, you can make the <span>easiest origami</span> for the game using improvised materials, such as an old newspaper or a magazine sheet.  The paper should be rectangular in shape. </p><ul><li>  Making origami from paper with your own hands begins by folding the sheet in half. </li><li>  Then the corner bend is rotated at right angles to the center of the sheet. </li><li>  The lower bifurcated ends of the paper are wrapped exactly up, on one side and the other. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper boat" class="if uuid-2470354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470354.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The corners sticking out at the edges need to be carefully bent.  It turns out the shape of a triangle. </li><li>  How to make origami next?  You need to take the figure by the edges and connect them together.  Thus, the triangle transforms into a square. </li><li>  Its lower corners are bent upwards so that again a triangle is formed.  For corners, a similar connection of the edges in the center is performed. </li><li>  It remains with a slight movement to push the upper edges in opposite directions and open the finished boat. </li></ul><p>  The origami technique for beginners is quite simple, so that any child will cope with the task.  The main thing is to smooth all the folds with your fingers well.  You can play with the craft immediately after manufacturing.  And if the child wants, you can paint the craft with markers or pencils. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dog </h2><p>  This is the easiest origami.  Such work can be done by the child of the younger group of the kindergarten in the application class.  First, the child does the folding of the paper after the tutor, and then sticks on small details - eyes and nose.  You can make a mouth and a cup of black stripes. </p><p>  The teacher prepares for each child a square sheet of paper.  Showing an origami master class to children, it is imperative to explain how important it is to precisely align the edges when bending and rubbing the bends with your finger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami dog" class="if uuid-2470330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470330.jpg"></div><ol><li>  You need to unfold the sheet with the corner down and wrap the paper so that it turns out to be a triangle. </li><li>  The corners of the figure on the left and right are bent down by the same distance.  These will be ears for our dog. </li><li>  It remains to raise the bottom corner and make an even fold.  Thus, the nose of the dog is formed. </li><li>  How to make origami, the children have already understood, it remains to perform the gluing of small parts on the face of the beast.  For young children, the teacher cuts out the elements for the lesson on their own, and the children only stick on the model and oral explanation. </li></ol><p>  Older children already know how to use scissors and are able to cut out the necessary details themselves. </p><h2>  A more complex version of the dog </h2><p>  A step-by-step instruction of origami will help to cope with this version of the dog: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The sheet is also prepared in a square shape, and the first stage is similar to the previous version, that is, the workpiece unfolds with the corner down and the paper folds until a triangle forms. </li><li>  The ears of the dog are made by folding the paper several times.  First, the corners on the left and right are wrapped inward overlap.  Then they turn in opposite directions and the sharp corners hide inward. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami puppy" class="if uuid-2470336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470336.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Then the craft turns over to the master, and the two lower corners open in different directions. </li><li>  The outer layer of paper is folded up, and the bottom is on the back of the craft. </li><li>  The edges of the triangles are wrapped inward, and the lower part of the muzzle takes the form of a trapezoid. </li></ul><p>  The dog will look spectacular if it is made of colored dense paper, and the bend of the mouth remains white, as in the picture in the article.  After doing origami from paper with your own hands, you only need to draw a marker with the nose and eyes of the pet. </p><h2>  Fox </h2><p>  To show the table theater, you can make such a fox out of paper: </p><ol><li>  A square sheet in a familiar way is folded in half by corners. </li><li>  The upper part descends to the level of the lower side of the triangle. </li><li>  Lateral corners on the contrary - rise up. </li><li>  The craft is turned over to the other side and the fox is painted. </li></ol><p>  You already learned how to make origami.  This is completely uncomplicated.  The main thing is to be careful and carefully smooth the folds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami fox" class="if uuid-2470327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470327.jpg"></div><h2>  Origami master class: fish </h2><p>  For this work, you need to take a square sheet of thick paper and fold it in half once, then fold again.  It turns out again a square, only a smaller size.  Next, you need to act, exactly following the step by step instructions of origami: </p><ul><li>  With a slight movement, the upper layer is pulled over and the lower corner is lifted up.  It turns out a triangle. </li><li>  The workpiece is turned over with the back side and perform a similar action. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make origami fish" class="if uuid-2470346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470346.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The tail of the fish is performed as follows: first, the triangle is turned forward with the apex and the upper edge is lowered so that a sharp corner peeks out from behind the body of the fish;  lower, on the contrary, lift similarly up. </li><li>  Crossed corners act as a tail fin. </li><li>  The craft is turned on the back side, and the fish is ready. </li><li>  Small details can be glued from colored paper or simply painted with wax crayons. </li></ul><h2>  Bird </h2><p>  Origami lessons teach children attentiveness and perseverance, so it is so important to complete the task with children of preschool age, because the acquired skills will be useful to them in further studies at school. </p><p>  The following sample work shows how to quickly make a volumetric bird.  Having assembled a silhouette from paper, you can stick on additional elements to create a figure of a rooster or chicken, sparrow or any other bird. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami birds" class="if uuid-2470341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2470341.jpg"></div><p>  Step-by-step instructions for origami birds will help you complete the task with ease: </p><ol><li>  To get started, you need a square sheet of thick paper, you can take a color double-sided. </li><li>  The sheet is bent diagonally and rotated downward. </li><li>  Further, the upper left and lower left sides are turned inward so that they are connected along the center line together. </li><li>  The workpiece is turned over to the back side, and work continues by bending the figure in the center. </li><li>  The diagram at number 6 shows that the sharp corner is turned down and smoothed out well. </li><li>  Then the workpiece is returned to its original position and folded in half. </li><li>  Then you need to act with light movements so as not to tear the paper.  At the same time, both edges are lifted upwards, that is, the tail of the bird and its head.  The bird’s neck should be inside the craft. </li><li>  Still thoroughly smoothed. </li><li>  It remains to push a small edge into the head and the work is completed. </li></ol><h2>  DIY decoration </h2><p>  If you want to make a cock or a chicken, you will need to cut a scallop and two wings.  The comb has a double design.  It will be more convenient to attach origami birds to the slot on the head.  To do this, double-sided paper in red or orange must be folded in half and draw waves on the top.  After cutting with scissors, glue is applied to the fold from the outside and pressed with fingers in the center of the head. </p><p>  In order for the wings to be the same size, you can cut two wings from the folded sheet in half according to the drawn contours.
