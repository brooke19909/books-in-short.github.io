How to turn on if it does not turn on?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nokia phones have a long history due to the long period of work of the company.  We saw, for example, the lineup consisting of Lumia phones, which includes dozens of different devices;  or older versions not related to any series.  One such ‚Äústand alone‚Äù is the <span>Nokia C6</span> phone <span>.</span>  This model is not new - it was released back in 2010.  Nevertheless, at that time it was a worthy device, and we will talk more about it in this article. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Launching smartphones at Nokia began quite early.  As we can see, this device, which is quite suitable for the category ‚Äústrong device with touch control‚Äù, was released even before the presentation of the iPhone 4 and, as expected, has won many fans around the world.  We do not have data on how widely Nokia C6 was sold, however, according to the reviews presented now on various sites, we can conclude that this phone is quite popular. </p><p>  And honestly, this can be understood.  At that time, the processor with a clock frequency of 434 MHz seemed something ultra-technological;  and the Symbian operating system could satisfy all user requests.  Another device belonging to the category of smartphones can be evidenced by a sliding QWERTY-keyboard.  Of course, it is difficult to imagine it on modern devices, but at that time it was clearly one of the company's experiments on how to get the best mobile phone. </p><p>  Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, but start the characterization of the smartphone in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Define any device follows from its appearance.  The Nokia C6 case, given the model year of manufacture, looks quite technologically advanced - all functions are presented quite conveniently.  The case of the device is implemented in plastic, which also has a ‚Äúmetal‚Äù trim (around the perimeter).  The back is covered with an aluminum plate.  Despite the fact that real metal parts are not used on the front side, the device looks quite stylish. </p><p>  The <span>Nokia C6 itself</span> (photos confirm this) fits easily in the palm of your hand.  Due to the round and smooth corners, the model does not press in the hand.  According to customer recommendations, working with him is quite convenient. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  About how the interaction with the phone should be discussed separately.  The smartphone Nokia C6 installed a not quite classic control system, which is expressed in the presence of a special retractable physical keyboard.  As you can guess, it includes all the buttons presented in a regular QWERTY-set.  The orientation of the device when interacting with it is horizontal.  The device extends into two parts quite smoothly - at the end of the stroke a special spring mechanism helps.  In general, the idea with physical keys is implemented at a high level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the Nokia C6 case (the review includes photos that you can see for yourself) has other buttons.  These navigation elements include buttons for adjusting the sound and turning on the screen. </p><p>  On the front panel, directly below the display, there are also physical navigation buttons.  This is the classic ‚Äúreception‚Äù and ‚Äúreset‚Äù of the call (green and red keys, which are available in all phones), as well as a button to go to the main menu.  She, as the reviews show, works quite quickly - without delays and braking. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Given that the device was released back in 2010, it is not surprising that the screen here is capable of transmitting only 16 million colors.  It works on TFT technology and has a resolution of 360 by 640 pixels.  Judging by the photo, the picture is not the clearest;  the image, of course, changes color depending on the viewing angle (it becomes darker, then completely brightens). </p><p>  The screen size is only 3.2 inches, however, given the size of the phone as a whole, the display cannot be called small - it fits perfectly into the concept of the smartphone. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the sensor can be noted on the positive side, since there are practically no fading or freezes on it.  Thus, we have a functional, fairly quick device with the capabilities that modern smartphones are endowed with. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Regarding the technical ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of the device, it should be noted that the ARM-11 processor is used here, we have already mentioned its clock rate (434 MHz).  Of course, for the smartphones with which we are interacting now, this is just a ridiculous parameter (since there we are talking about thousands of hertz).  In our case, we have an apparatus that does not require large computing power.  The operating system is Symbian 9.4 (and not ‚Äúbulky" Android), so there are no problems with the processor.  Moreover, the developers, obviously, optimized the interaction of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device and its software shell, due to which we have such high performance.  In practice, it is expressed by smooth, without delays, work. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As <span>Nokia C6</span> reviews show, the phone has a strong battery.  At least the technical parameters indicate a 1200 mAh battery.  Even compared to those devices that are currently on the market, this is a good indicator.  Therefore, we have up to 7 hours of talk on one charge (or up to 30 declared hours of operation in the audio player mode). </p>

    <p>  The battery on the Nokia C6 is removable - you can remove it after removing the cover from the back of the device.  In addition, the battery is also fixed with a special ‚Äútooth‚Äù, which is located in the lower part of the housing.  In order to access the SIM card slot, the battery will have to be completely removed.  On the forums, buyers ask questions about the Nokia C6: ‚Äúhow to disassemble the device?‚Äù.  Everything is extremely simple: just use the lowest key on the right side panel, after which the back cover will rise.  After removing it, you will have access to all the inside of the device (including bolts around the perimeter, allowing you to completely disassemble the phone). </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  If you look at the back cover of the device, you can see the peephole of the main camera.  Near her is a flash.  If you believe the technical characteristics, the resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãquite modern - it is 5 megapixels, which allows you to take pictures in the size of 2592 by 1944 pixels.  Hardware makes it possible to enlarge the image up to 4 times. </p><p>  There is also an additional front camera on the front panel of the case.  Its matrix resolution is not specified - it can take pictures of 320 by 240 pixels.  Obviously, it‚Äôs difficult to boast of such a size - and to figure out why one can use such ‚Äúoptics‚Äù is also not easy.  However, in spite of everything, the presence of two cameras on the 2010 phone is already not bad. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The device with a preinstalled <span>Symbian OS</span> can act as a multimedia player.  In addition, you can download various applications and games here, which already creates the need to expand the internal memory of the smartphone.  The section of our article is devoted to this. </p>

    <p>  The reviews devoted to Nokia C6 indicate that only 240 megabytes of memory is available here, which, of course, is not enough for most of the tasks that the phone can handle.  Therefore, the developers have provided the ability to work with memory cards.  The maximum allowable amount is 16 GB, which is already quite enough on such a device. </p><p>  RAM on the device is 128 MB, which is not so much by modern standards, but enough for an optimized smartphone that is easy to use. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The possibilities from the point of view of communication with which the device is endowed go beyond the boundaries of what we are familiar with.  The phone has a WiFi module that is already converting Nokia C6 (the instruction of which provides a guide on how to work with wireless Internet networks) into a potential gadget for surfing, social networks and checking mail.  A 3G module is also installed here - with mobile Internet, this model also becomes a portable access point to online. </p><p>  Among other things, the phone has a GPS function, with which the device is able to navigate the terrain and show the exact location coordinates.  For user-friendly output of data on its location, the Nokia Maps application is used. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned, Symbian 9.4 is installed on the smartphone.  If previously you did not have experience with this platform, then for the first time you will be surprised how outwardly the shell resembles the Android OS.  Take at least the ability to unlock the screen using the ‚Äúslider‚Äù (the strip on which you need to slide to unlock). </p><p>  Carrying out further actions with a mobile phone, you will only be convinced of similarity of platforms even more.  The dialing screen here is classic, organizing the phone book and call log as well.  The model has a set of all the necessary office applications (calendar, converter, clock, email notes and others), as well as a built-in file manager that allows you to conveniently organize the information stored on the device. </p><p>  Separately, mention should be made of the standard Nokia Web Browser, which is implemented in a fairly convenient form for carrying out some basic actions, such as viewing HTML pages, saving them, adding to bookmarks, searching them, and so on.  The application is quite convenient, despite the fact that most standard applications of this nature do not differ in their flexibility, mobility and comfort of user interaction. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  To begin the characterization of the media capabilities of the device follows from the fact that all applications can be downloaded from the Ovi store.  This is a kind of analogue of Google Play for Nokia devices.  In principle, here you can find everything you need to constantly use the phone: office applications, various ‚Äúreaders‚Äù, players and a lot of other things.  However, standard programs are also installed here - this is one game (Bejewelled Twist), as well as Facebook, QuickOffice, Friendster, Bloomberg, Adobe Pdf, Shazam, Youtube, ‚ÄúDrawing‚Äù and others.  As you can see, with them you will not feel a lack of content, and you can always download new ones if something happens. </p><p>  Audio and video player here is a standard, designed specifically for Nokia.  The advantage of the device is the ability to work with headphones from another manufacturer (and not just the ‚Äúnative‚Äù headset, as it was before).  Reviews show that the sound quality in the device has improved markedly compared to the previous generation of Nokia. </p><p>  Also in the C6 model provided the ability to listen to the radio.  Here they installed a new FM-receiver, which has a lot of flexible settings.  The function works only with headphones (they are known to be an antenna in such cases), although sound can also be output to an external speaker. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  As the reviews discussing this phone model, as well as ours, describing the Nokia C6 review, demonstrate that the device is quite serious, even though it was released 5 years ago.  The model has a lot of strengths: attractive appearance, comfortable and thoughtful controls, high-quality case materials, optimized hardware and software shell.  The ‚Äúbonuses" of the gadget are the camera, a hardy battery, the ability to expand memory up to 16 GB, as well as support for WiFi, 3G, GPS communication systems. </p><p>  All this makes the model described by us a sufficiently strong smartphone, the popularity of which is clearly not accidental.  This is even evidenced by photos related to the Nokia C6 <strong>.</strong> </p><h2>  Problems and their solution </h2><p>  After the review, as part of the same article, I would like to discuss some of the problems that users of the device face.  To make the article even more useful, we will try to provide rational solutions that will allow us to get rid of them. </p>

    <p>  So, one of the fairly common problems is the situation when the sensor does not work on the Nokia C6.  Users note the following typical ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù: the device worked properly, after which the reaction to any touch by the owner suddenly disappeared.  In this case, the device did not get into a humid environment and, possibly, was not subjected to shock and other damage. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Nokia C6, the sensor does not work for many.  Judging by the recommendations of users, it is impossible to solve the problem on your own - for this you need to contact a service center.  They will conduct a complete disassembly of the device, its diagnosis and, thus, establish what the reason is.  From a technical point of view, the problem may be hidden in the main board of the smartphone.  It is something that needs to be replaced. </p><p>  Another problem may be the situation when just Nokia C6 does not turn on.  Yes, any user of the device can learn just a couple of times how the procedure for turning the smartphone on and off occurs.  So, in the situation that we are describing, the familiar method does not work.  Again, if you believe the published reviews, in this case, the best solution could be a repair in the workshop.  Specialists can replace the cable connecting different parts of the device, replace the board or light sensors.  One of these options should definitely help.  Also, as an alternative reason, you can talk about clogged or damaged power terminals, which can also cause such symptoms on the Nokia C6.  How to turn on the device when it is malfunctioning?  Obviously, it needs to be fixed.  Doing this yourself at home, without any special knowledge, is not recommended. </p><p>  The reasons for such failures are unknown.  Perhaps the whole thing is in the technical equipment of the device, some low-quality board that was installed initially, and so on.  The fact is obvious - judging by many reviews, the owners of this model have a similar defect.  It is decided solely by replacement.  Of course, there are other types of problems - but they are less common. </p><p>  In general, the phone deserved attention at the time of its release, so he gained such popularity at the time.  And today at Nokia we already see other models related to a completely different line of devices. </p>
