Among its advantages are noted: </p><p>  - the hospitality and friendliness of the staff, always ready to help in resolving all the misunderstandings and problems (there were cases when people who had difficulties with plane tickets were allowed to stay at the base for a day longer than the time indicated in the ticket); </p><p>  - cleanliness and landscaping of the territory; </p><p>  - simple but comfortable and clean rooms; </p><p>  - excellent food; </p><p>  - relatively low prices. </p><p>  The disadvantages noted in the reviews are as follows: </p><p>  - Does not have its own well-equipped Anberanda beach (recreation center, Sochi, Anchor slot, see photo of the beach near the base above). </p><p>  - lack of a professional doctor; </p><p>  - insufficiently frequent cleaning of rooms by the base employees (those who wish are provided with accessories for self-cleaning in their room, but not everyone likes it); </p><p>  - a single menu for all vacationers (some want a wider variety of dishes); </p><p>  - poor soundproofing in the rooms; </p><p>  - in some cottages the presence of ants. </p><p>  The conclusion from all of the above is this: this base is ideal for young people, couples of any age and vacationing with children, for those who are looking for a good budget holiday and do not see the problem that you need to get to a comfortable beach and places of entertainment by public transport or by car. </p>
