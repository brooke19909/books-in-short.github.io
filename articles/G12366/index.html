  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Director Viktor Tregubovich: biography and creativity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Director Viktor Tregubovich is the standard of Soviet cinema.  His work even today is admired by many film critics, not to mention the distant Soviet times.  Perhaps that is why the current generation of directors cite Tregubovich‚Äôs paintings as a good example. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1117509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27963/1117509.jpg?1541476742"></div><h2>  early years </h2><p>  So, what is remarkable about his biography?  Victor Tregubovich was born on November 30, 1935 in the small Siberian village of Yuryevka, which is located in the Bogotol district of the Krasnoyarsk Territory.  His father was the <span>chairman of the collective farm</span> .  Kalinina Ivan Stepanovich, and his mother Ekaterina Grigoryevna.  In addition to Victor, the Tregubovich family had three more sons.  In those years, life in the Siberian Territory was very harsh.  Therefore, boys from an early age were accustomed to physical labor, which tempered their character. </p><p>  Victor Tregubovich from childhood was drawn to the world of art.  He was a member of the local troupe of artists and regularly performed at the Bogotolsky House of Culture.  Also, the future director loved to read and could spend more than one day on this matter.  Rumor has it that he had a huge library, numbering more than one hundred books. </p><p>  Ultimately, the theater was so fond of Victor that in the future he saw himself only as an actor.  Alas, his dreams were defeated by the death of his elder brother, who drowned in a local pond.  Having lost one breadwinner, the family decided that it would be better if Viktor Tregubovich graduated from the Prokopyevsky Mining College.  After all, this will allow him to get a prestigious job. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And so, obeying the decision of the family council, in 1953 he entered the institution that he hated.  However, a year later, the young artist‚Äôs heart does not pass such a test, and he decides to leave their technical school.  In order not to worry his parents, he adjusts everything so that he is taken to military service in the army. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1117854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1117854.jpg?1541476742"></div><h2>  Creative career </h2><p>  In the army, Viktor Tregubovich quickly found something to his liking - he became the head of the military theater.  He independently prepared scripts for performances, recruited actors and directed the entire process during the performance.  Victor was so fond of the leadership of the military unit that they even began to persuade him to stay in long-term service. </p><p>  Returning home, Victor got a job at the local Komsomol district committee, but he obviously did not like this occupation.  Therefore, in 1958 he entered the Moscow State Institute of Cinematography, the directing department.  Thanks to this, soon the whole Soviet world will find out who Viktor Tregubovich is.  Films released under his auspices, one after another, become small masterpieces of Russian cinema. </p><p>  As for his first work, it was the short film "Last Summer", released in 1962.  And although this project was conceived as a simple term paper, the audience liked it a lot.  And now, a few years later, in 1965, his first full-length film, ‚ÄúSultry July,‚Äù was released.  But, unfortunately, the young director‚Äôs debut was not very successful, as the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwork was poorly received by the masses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Everything was changed by his next picture, entitled ‚ÄúIn war as in war‚Äù, released in 1968.  Written according to the famous novel by Russian writer Viktor Kurochkin, it became a model of war cinema of that time.  After that, all the tapes of Viktor Tregubovich were perceived properly and found their place in the hearts of Soviet people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1117852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1117852.jpg?1541476742"></div><h2>  Victor Tregubovich: films </h2><p>  We list the most famous and loved by the audience work: </p><ul><li>  1962 "Last Summer" - a short film, coursework at VGIK. </li><li>  1965 "Hot July" - a debut film about the relationship of fathers and children. </li><li>  1968 "And in war as in war" - a tape about the Second World War. </li><li>  1971 "Dauria" - a movie novel about the civil war in Transbaikalia. </li><li>  1973 "Old Walls" - a film about the life of a woman director. </li><li>  1975 "Trust" - a historical tale of the events that occurred on December 31, 1917. </li><li>  1977 Feedback is a production drama. </li><li>  1978 ‚ÄúLeaving - go‚Äù - Soviet comedy. </li><li>  1979 "Journey to Another City" - a life drama. </li><li>  1981 ‚ÄúThree times about love‚Äù - a melodrama about life in the countryside. </li><li>  1982 "Highway" - a feature film based on the story of V. Barabashov. </li><li>  1984 "Prokhindiada, or Running in Place" - a satirical comedy. </li><li>  1985 "Here is my village ..." - a social drama about the problems of the village. </li><li>  1987 The Tower is a psychological drama. </li><li>  1991 "Hop" - a feature film, the last work of the director. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1117506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27963/1117506.jpg?1541476742"></div><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  The popularity of Tregubovich led to the fact that in 1984 he was appointed artistic director at one of the Lenfilm film studio.  A little later, in 1990, he completely gets at his disposal a whole film studio, which he calls "Ladoga". </p><p>  Alas, his happiness did not last long - on September 21, 1992, the great director dies.  The reason for this was the usual fall from the stairs, during which he breaks his arm.  Significant loss of blood and adulthood leads to the fact that he does not tolerate surgery and dies under anesthesia. </p>
