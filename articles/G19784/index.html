  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to calculate maternity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Working expectant mothers on the eve of the upcoming decree is always interesting to find out how to calculate maternity.  After all, the financial component will be very important for the mother, who will be forced to interrupt her work activities for the birth and upbringing of the child.  To understand how to calculate maternity, you should familiarize yourself with the labor legislation governing payments in this situation. </p><p>  The main provision guaranteeing payment in the event of pregnancy and childbirth is the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  In particular, article 255 provides for the entitlement of a pregnant <span>woman</span> <span>to maternity</span> leave.  This leave, often called a decree, is accompanied by the payment of an allowance, which is transferred by the employer on the basis of a supporting document - a sick leave issued in consultation at the place of observation of the pregnant woman.  Payment occurs at the beginning of the vacation, after 30 weeks of pregnancy, once - with one amount for the entire period.  Since calculating maternity is rather difficult, you should study the main provisions of the current law.  Knowing them will avoid subsequently misunderstandings and misunderstandings.  In addition, knowing how to calculate maternity, a pregnant woman can think through her budget in advance during the waiting, birth and upbringing of the future baby. </p><p>  Calculation occurs according to certain schemes.  However, in any case, a single principle applies, how to calculate maternity: the number of vacation days is multiplied by the average daily earnings for a certain period. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If until 2012 there was a double calculation scheme, according to which a woman had the right to choose the period that was taken into account when calculating the average daily earnings (last year or the last two years of work), then from January 2012 the last two years of work began to be taken into account.  In this case, the amount of payment could be significantly lower for those who did not have time to accumulate two years of experience, as well as those women who, having left one decree to care for their first child, were expecting a second baby.  Numerous appeals have led to a review of the law.  As a result, future mire-makers can expect to receive payment, as before, according to two schemes. </p><p>  <span>How to calculate maternity</span> according to the old scheme? </p><p>  Until December 31, 2012, the old calculation scheme allows you to include earnings only for the last year of work.  In the case of choosing the old scheme, how to calculate maternity, a woman is obliged to write a statement to the accounting department with a request to apply the old version of the Federal Law (No. 255-FZ). </p><p>  In this case, the accounting department determines the average daily earnings of the last year of work, taking into account all payments that are taxed by insurance premiums, with the exception of <span>accrued vacation pay</span> and earnings received during business trips. </p><p>  The calculation procedure is as follows - all working days are calculated, the sum of all money paid by the employer is calculated, from which vacation and travel payments are taken.  Then the entire amount of earnings should be divided by the sum of all working days.  To get the final amount of maternity, the <span>average daily earnings are</span> multiplied by the number of days on maternity leave (in standard terms, the period will be 140 days). </p><p>  How to calculate maternity according to the new scheme? </p><p>  If a woman wants to calculate maternity according to the new version of Federal Law No. 255, there is no need to write a statement, since this type of calculation is done by default.  In the case of calculating <span>maternity payments</span> in a new way, the amount of all earnings for the last 2 years, including vacation pay, is divided by the number of days (730 calendar) and multiplied by 140 (number of vacation days). </p><p>  In addition, there is the possibility of choosing an accounting period.  For example, if a woman was on leave to care for her first baby in 2010, then she can choose the accounting period 2008-2009.  To do this, you need to write a statement to the accounting department. </p><p>  What <span>calculation of maternity</span> will be from 2013? </p><p>  Subject to the amendments adopted by the State Duma, the new scheme will work in full force from January 2013.  However, the interests of women will be taken into account in the new calculation scheme: days of maternity leave, maternity leave, days of sick leave, leave for caring for an older child, caring for a child with a disability, as well as days for a woman to be released with full pay will be deleted from the accounting period or partially).  Thus, the period during which the employee received only limited payments, incomplete salaries, will not be taken into account when calculating the average earnings. </p><p>  As experts expect, amendments to the new edition of Federal Law No. 255, adopted in the interests of women, will better protect pregnant women financially. </p>
