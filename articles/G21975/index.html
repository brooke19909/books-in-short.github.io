Initially, many came to her resorts on tour packages, but over time, having learned this country, they began to plan trips on their own.  Thus, the Russians got the opportunity to see the most hidden corners of Spain, fully revealing the soul and history of this amazing country.  If you are not attracted by beaten paths and battered hiking trails, then take a look at the town of Guardamar del Segura in Alicante.  This place is unlikely to be advised by travel agencies, and on the forums you will hardly find information or reviews about it.  But this is not at all connected with its unpopularity.  It‚Äôs just that Russians know almost nothing about him, unlike the Scandinavians and the French, who prefer to spend their holidays in this amazingly beautiful town.  Today we‚Äôll talk about what a vacation in Guardamar del Segur can be like if you decide to buy a ticket here and head towards the vast sea and miles of wide beaches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="estate-spain.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãon the map" class="if uuid-2547022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2547022.jpg"></div><h2>  Some general information </h2><p>  Guardamar del Segura is a village in Spain located at the mouth of the Segura River.  It is here that it flows into the Mediterranean Sea, so tourists can enjoy not only sea views, but also take a walk along the wayward river, which transformed local landscapes into something bizarre and amazing.  The city is part of the province of Alicante, known for its beautiful nature and a certain leisurely flow of life.  The entire territory of Guardamar del Segura is part of the autonomous community of Valencia.  This left a significant imprint on the culture, architecture and lifestyle of local residents.  Many tourists in reviews of Guardamar del Segura write that the town seemed truly unique and significantly different from other places in Spain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The location of the city is quite convenient for tourists who do not like to stay in one place for a long time.  From Guardamar del Segura they can go to Alicante or Torrevieja.  For example, the provincial capital can be reached by breaking only thirty-five kilometers.  This is easy to do using public transport or renting a car. </p><p>  The population of the city is just over fifteen thousand people.  But with the onset of the tourist season, the situation changes dramatically, as crowds of vacationers rush here.  During this period, the population increases almost three times.  However, this does not affect the situation in Guardamar del Segur.  It is always quite calm and quiet here, because the city is designed for relaxation, romantic walks and admiring sunsets.  It is not worth it to go to active young people, eager for parties and other noisy entertainments. </p><h2>  A few words about the historical past </h2><p>  The history of Guardamar del Segura in the reviews about the vacation is practically not reflected.  It is also difficult to find this information in other sources.  But we all found some fragmentary data about this mysterious place. </p><p>  It is known that the name of the city was granted by a river flowing nearby.  If you translate it from Spanish into Russian, you get a very beautiful phrase - "Guardian of the Sea."  Indeed, Guardamar del Segura is located by the sea, surrounded by incredible dunes and pine forests.  They were planted specifically so that the sands caused by the river and the sea would not cover the whole city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In ancient times, the river served as the main source of drinking water.  She supplied precious villages to the surrounding villages.  Also along the river, communication was carried out between all the settlements in the Segura delta. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guardamardelsegura.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãbeaches" class="if uuid-2548206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2548206.jpg"></div><h2>  How to quickly get to the resort town? </h2><p>  Those who nevertheless decide to go on vacation on the Costa Blanca in Guardamar del Segura should take into account that there is no airport in the city.  Therefore, your plane is likely to land in Alicante, and from here you already have to get to the resort using various options. </p><p>  Many tourists prefer to rent a car.  This is a very common practice in Europe, in addition, it allows you to independently explore the surroundings of resort towns.  If you take advantage of this offer, you will be in Guardamar del Segura already twenty-five minutes after arrival. </p><p>  Some travelers, having arrived in Europe for the first time, doubt themselves a little and refuse to rent a car.  The option with public transport is more suitable for them.  There is a bus station in Guardamar del Segur, so buses run in this direction regularly.  For example, Autocars Costa Azul transport runs from the airport to the city.  Its traffic interval is one hour, and the cost of tickets varies within four euros.  The trip itself lasts no more than half an hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can also go to the resort and from the bus station in Alicante.  However, in this case, the trip will take a little longer - about forty-five minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeaway.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embankment of the city" class="if uuid-2548210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2548210.jpg"></div><h2>  High and low tourist seasons </h2><p>  The weather in Guardamar del Segur almost all year round is suitable for relaxation, because most of the time there is sunny days, and some daredevils begin to swim in the month of March. </p><p>  High season at this Spanish resort begins in April.  This month, air temperature reaches twenty-five degrees Celsius, and water in the sea often warms up to twenty degrees Celsius. </p><p>  In June and July, the most tourists come to the city.  The Spaniards also join the foreigners, who like to relax here as families throughout the summer.  It is during this period that you can observe some fuss on the beaches and in the cafe, as the inhabitants of Spain are used to doing everything at the same time.  This means that in the morning the beach will already be crowded, and at two in the afternoon it will be difficult to find a free table in the cafe.  In mid-summer, the air temperature reaches its most comfortable mark - twenty-six degrees above zero. </p><p>  August and September in Guardamar del Segur is characterized by scorching heat.  Usually at this time, the influx of tourists begins to decrease.  And this is not surprising, because at a temperature often reaching forty degrees, it is difficult to wander around the city and enjoy its beauties. </p><p>  From October to December, the weather again becomes comfortable and relaxing.  Elderly couples and romantically inclined young people are rushing in Guardamar del Seguru these months, ready to wander around the picturesque dunes for hours. </p><p>  It rains infrequently at the resort.  Their season begins in December, and in January precipitation is already disappearing. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the water off the coast of the resort is very clear, which attracts vacationers with kids. </p><h2>  Where can I stay on vacation? </h2><p>  Holidays in Guardamar del Segur are significantly different from the traditional ideas of tourists about their vacation on the beach.  The fact is that almost no one settles in hotels here.  Of course, they exist at the resort, but they are not in special demand.  The vast majority of vacationers prefer to stay in Guardamar del Segur in apartments. </p><p>  To rent a suitable apartment is not difficult.  Landlords usually have streamers with attractive offers on central streets.  Housing options are many.  It can be cozy studios designed for a maximum of two people, and spacious apartments consisting of several rooms.  It all depends on what means the tourist has. </p><p>  The cost of living in apartments equipped with everything necessary starts from two and a half thousand rubles.  The price of an apartment in a modern condominium with access to the pool and the proximity of the sea can reach up to six and a half thousand rubles per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guardamardelsegura.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the city's attractions" class="if uuid-2548207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2548207.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the resort town </h2><p>  Usually Guardamar del Segura (Spain) attracts tourists with its unusually beautiful nature.  For this, you can come here at least once in a lifetime. </p><p>  The main feature of the city are the dunes.  They were formed by sea and river sand, so they are located on both sides of Segura.  Today, the length of these amazing sand hills is close to fourteen kilometers.  Enterprising Spaniards created a natural reserve from this incredible beauty.  Absolutely anyone can enter the Dune Park, because admission is free.  The reserve is spread over eight hundred hectares and includes not only the dunes themselves, but also thickets of coniferous, citrus and eucalyptus trees.  In addition to them, quite a lot of palm trees are planted here.  All this creates a simply indescribable atmosphere. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the resort town is quite small, it can please tourists with its historical cultural monuments, which the locals are very proud of.  Fans of exploring such places should definitely visit La Fonteta.  These ruins were once a Phoenician port located at the mouth of the river. </p><p>  In addition, Guardamar del Segur has preserved the oldest watchhouse in the country.  It was built by the Arabs around the tenth century and is located among the dunes. </p><p>  Guardamar Castle or rather what is left of it deserves more close attention of tourists.  In the thirteenth century, when it was built, the castle was an impressive building that protected citizens from any enemies from the sea.  Despite the fact that part of the fortress collapsed in the first quarter of the nineteenth century after a strong earthquake, part of the wall with loopholes, guns and several halls remained intact.  As tourists write in reviews of Guardamar del Segur, the fortress offers scenic views of the city and its surroundings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelesposeidon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dune Park" class="if uuid-2548211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2548211.jpg"></div><h2>  Where can I go for a walk in the city? </h2><p>  If you like to walk in beautiful places, then plan a visit to two of the city‚Äôs most beautiful parks during your vacation. </p><p>  King Alfonso Park is located in the dunes.  It is an ennobled piece of land planted with coniferous trees.  Here silence and tranquility reign, which are liked by couples of lovers, sitting on benches among dunes and plants.  The park has hiking trails and paths for cyclists. </p><p>  Queen Sofia Park is the exact opposite of the park described above.  It was opened a little over twenty years ago, and youth and children are always going here.  The park has many playgrounds, and in summer attractions are open.  In addition, artificial reservoirs, waterfalls and various hills were created.  Peacocks, ducks, turtles, wild rabbits and other animals live here.  All of them can be fed directly from the hands, and some representatives of the animal world are pretty spoiled by human attention.  For example, ducks prefer fresh shrimp to bread. </p><h2>  Museum museums </h2><p>  Even if you are not too interested in history and archeology, we advise you to visit the Guardamar del Segura Archaeological Museum.  It contains truly unique artifacts found during excavations within the city.  Once there were Muslim, Phoenician and Egyptian settlements.  Also, the Greeks, Iberians and Romans left their mark in the history of the city.  The exhibits include household utensils, weapons, ceramics and many other unique items. </p><p>  Of great interest to tourists is the Francisco Mira House Museum.  This talented engineer managed to save the city from the sand by planting about six hundred thousand trees along with local residents on the coast.  The exposition consists of Francisco's personal items, his books, tools and photographs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="estuary" class="if uuid-2548209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2548209.jpg"></div><h2>  Spain, Guardamar del Segura: interesting facts </h2><p>  Having arrived at this resort for the first time, tourists notice how reverently the locals relate to their history.  On numerous stalls and shops they attach streamers with the image of old photographs.  You can see on them what the city was a hundred years ago, what its inhabitants looked like and what they did. </p><p>  Historical motifs can be traced in mosaic compositions.  The panels are framed by benches, which, by the way, are also laid out from mosaics.  Thus, even visitors who are not interested in the past of Guardamar del Segura, get to know him, strolling through the parks and streets of the city.  Our compatriots often mention that the panels themselves are made with great taste and are real works of art. </p><p>  Interesting facts about the city include the enthusiasm of its inhabitants for graffiti.  These drawings adorn the walls of houses, fences along the roads, gates and gates.  The city‚Äôs authorities do not fight with artists, but encourage them, considering graffiti the pride of Guardamar del Segura.  It is difficult to argue with this, because almost all the drawings are professionally made and delight the eyes of passers-by. </p><p>  Surprising for tourists is the love of local residents for street cafes.  The fact is that the Spaniards rarely cook at home, and in small towns, which is Guardamar del Segura, this is done only a few times a year.  The townspeople spend most of their free time in a cafe: in the morning young mothers gather in them, who took their children to school or kindergarten, and men are pulled to dinner tables.  And in the evenings, the number of visitors only increases due to the appearance of tourists, elderly Spanish couples and sports enthusiasts who need to be watched without fail with a glass of cold beer. </p><p>  Fishermen often gather at the mouth of Segura.  The place where it flows into the sea is ideal for fishing.  However, this was remembered not only by humans, but also by mustached predators - cats.  Their colony has been living here for several centuries.  Cats usually spin around local fishermen who will definitely leave them a fish or two.  This has become a tradition of the townspeople.  Often, furry beggars feed tourists, but it is worth bearing in mind that for this action you can get a fine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.espana-live.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="walk through the dunes" class="if uuid-2548204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2548204.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  All tourists vacationing in Guardamar del Segur, claim that the city is suitable for a quiet and family vacation.  It is good to walk here, breathe in the healing pine air, sunbathe on the wide white beaches and swim in the gentle waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  Many people compare the resort with Soviet provincial towns, where you could safely let the kids go for a walk and everyone knew their neighbors not only at home, but also on the street. </p><p>  Therefore, if you expect complete relaxation from your vacation, you should buy a ticket to Guardamar del Segura. </p>
