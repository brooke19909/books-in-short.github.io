This is done primarily to attract customers to more budget options.  So, guests of a four-star hotel have the opportunity to use the entire infrastructure and pools of the "five".  We observe this situation in the case of Tangerine <span>Beach 4 *</span> (Sri Lanka, Kalutara).  It stands on the same territory as the Royal Palms Beach Hotel 5 *.  Since both resorts are managed by the same owner (Tangerine Hotels) and management, guests can use the entire infrastructure, including restaurants, bars, pools, the beach and a night disco club.  Of course, this is a tangible plus for tourists staying in the Quartet.  After all, they actually use the service of a five-star hotel!  And what else can please Tangerine Beach Hotel tourists?  We will talk about this in our article.  We will give you full information about this resort hotel - we will tell you about its territory, rooms, food, beach, facilities and services.  And our main help in the description of the hotel will be the reviews of those who have already had time to relax there.  Tourists not only praise the hotel, but also post photos of this place on the networks.  And judging by them, you will find a paradise holiday at the Tangerine Beach Hotel.  Turkey and Egypt with their ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù just fade in your eyes when you visit Sri Lanka.  After all, this is a real exclusive vacation! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tangerine beach hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395815.jpg" width="600"></div>

Although its name is Tangerine Beach Hotel Kalutara, the closest settlement to it is Waskaduwa.  But this, by and large, is not a city, but a resort area, which belongs to the Kalutara district.  Nearby is another village - Wadduva.  And the hotel described by us is located approximately in the middle between Kalutara and the capital of the island state, the city of Colombo.  The main international airport, Bandaranayyak, where liners from Russia arrive, is located in Katunayyak, seventy-four kilometers from the hotel.  However, reviews claim that the road will take about two hours - because of the way the Sri Lankan drivers drive.  By the way, tourists dissuade to rent a car on the island - for the above reason.  The capital of Sri Lanka Colombo is only forty kilometers away.  Tangerine Beach Hotel is a front line hotel.  A private sandy beach with golden sand is only seventy meters away.  You will be met by the Indian Ocean with its warm embrace and power.  The beach on which the hotel is located is called Wadduwa Beach, and it enjoys the well-deserved fame of the best on the entire southwest coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tangerine beach hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395818.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, the territory is quite vast - almost four hectares.  The garden is decorated in Sri Lankan style.  And many reviews admire the well-groomed and green territory of the two hotels.  The three-story building ‚ÄúTangerine Ayurveda and SPA‚Äù was built a long time ago - in nineteen eighty-third.  But since then it has been repeatedly and completely repaired.  The last renovation took place last year.  Among the green bushes and flowering tropical plants, sun loungers for relaxation are placed under tall palm trees.  Noteworthy is also the Hydropark, divided between four- and five-star hotels.  Hotel Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * Kalutara itself specializes in newlyweds.  Here they can organize wedding ceremonies, as well as arrange the holding of a honeymoon or marriage anniversary.  The hotel presents gifts and a compliment to such guests.  But, unlike most hotels specializing in the honeymoon, Tangerine accepts children.  Walking along the shady alleys of the park, you will find a wonderfully equipped playground.  Naturally, the four-star hotel also has a swimming pool, which was designed by a professional landscape designer. </p><h2>  Number of rooms at the Tangerine Beach Hotel </h2><p>  In this "Quartet" there are only one hundred seventy-nine rooms for guests.  All of them are located in a three-story building, decorated in a <span>colonial style.</span>  The interiors are designed in warm colors.  The rooms at Tangerine Beach Hotel are divided into categories.  The cheapest is the Standard Garden View.  To admire the Indian Ocean from the balcony, you need to pay extra.  But in its content, ‚ÄúStandard with Sea View‚Äù is no different from ‚ÄúGarden View‚Äù.  This is a spacious (about forty square meters) room, which adjoins a balcony or terrace.  It is equipped with satellite TV, air conditioning, safe, minibar.  According to the English tradition, the room has an electric kettle and everything that is supposed to be for brewing hot drinks yourself, with dry cream inclusive.  The private bathroom includes branded toiletries and a hairdryer.  A higher category of rooms is Studio Junior Suite.  This is also one room, but with a dedicated living area.  The Duplex Junior Suite is highly praised.  These rooms are split-level.  On the ground floor there is a living room and a bathroom.  Upstairs is a bedroom and a toilet.  Above all praise, the chic rooms of the Executive Suite and Lakshari categories.  They consist of two rooms (living room and bedroom).  They have a terrace or a very spacious balcony with ocean views.  The bathroom has a jacuzzi.  Guests are offered a collection of varied pillows and soaps.  Cleaned in rooms twice a day.  In the morning (but during the absence of guests) the rooms are washed, and in the evening they prepare the bedroom for bed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Tangerine Beach Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395810.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Dining at Tangerine Beach </h2><p>  The Tangerine Beach Hotel reserves the right to choose the number of meals.  Many Russian tourists prefer only to have breakfast at the hotel.  Morning meals are served buffet style at the main restaurant, Paruva.  According to reviews, breakfasts are always the same, but the number of dishes on offer is so great that you won‚Äôt try everything for a week's vacation.  Most tourists had lunch and dinner at a nearby cafe.  Prices in Sri Lanka are not very high even at the resort.  But there were also those guests who tried dishes from the chef in the restaurant of the Tangerine Beach Hotel.  They claim that the food was worth the money.  The restaurant, although more expensive, but the dishes are many times tastier than in the cafe.  There are two bars on the territory of the hotel - in the lounge and by the pool, the Lotus cafe, as well as a coffee shop with a hookah.  The hotel can also pay half or full board.  But if you fork out for three meals, then it‚Äôs better to choose the All Inclusive program.  Do not forget that the guests of the Quartet have access to the restaurants of their more chic neighbor.  All reviews recommend tasting seafood and fish - they are divinely prepared in Sri Lanka.  On the quality of food, tourists leave exclusively positive reviews.  People are delighted that the restaurant serves freshly squeezed juices, lots of fruits and vegetables.  Of course, there are well-prepared meat dishes, ice cream, desserts.  Drinks in bars are available both local and foreign production. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tangerine Beach Hotel Sri Lanka Kalutara" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  The Tangerine Beach Hotel has direct ocean access.  Wadduva Beach stretches for ten kilometers.  It is quite wide, so there is enough space on the golden sand for everyone.  But reviews warn: the coast is flat, without lagoons and bays.  Therefore, ocean waves roll on the beach serious.  If you are a mediocre swimmer or come with children, it is better not to take risks.  There are always tuk-tuks on duty at the hotel‚Äôs gate, ready to take you to the nearest lagoon.  Here there is quiet and smooth.  But for surfers on Wadduwa Beach a real expanse.  Those who like to fight the wave write real laudatory odes to the beach.  Well, if you are afraid to swim in the ocean, and you don‚Äôt want to go to the lagoon, there remains a pool.  It is clean and spacious.  There is also a shallow pool for children.  Solarium terraces are lined with a sufficient number of sunbeds under umbrellas.  Also in the garden, in picturesque places, you can sunbathe on the sun loungers.  Sun beds, according to the guests, are soft, with mattresses.  Beach towels are provided free of charge at least several times a day.  Even if you do not dare to rush into the powerful arms of the ocean, you will still succumb to its charms.  After all, wandering along the water's edge, watching the foamy waves roll on the golden sand with noise, is already a pleasure.  And when a loved one is nearby, this condition is called happiness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tangerine Beach Hotel Kalutara" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395809.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services at Tangerine Beach Hotel </h2><p>  At the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * (Sri Lanka, Kalutara), guests are trying to instill a love of oriental culture.  Therefore, here you can sign up for yoga classes.  And here there is a real Ayurvedic center.  This hotel not only organizes weddings and similar celebrations, but also holds more serious events.  To receive delegations there is an extensive conference room for four hundred people, two rooms for business negotiations, a business center with the necessary technical equipment.  Ladies will be able to tidy themselves up in the beauty salon, where experienced hairdressers work.  Guests do not need to think about how to wash their clothes, as there is a laundry service at the Tangerine Beach Hotel.  If you suddenly feel worse than expectations or some kind of trauma happens, the hotel has a doctor's office where you will be provided with the necessary assistance.  But this service will be free only if you have a medical insurance policy.  The hotel specializes in newlyweds and weddings.  Many tourists in their reviews mention richly decorated with blankets elephants that ride the bride and groom along the beach.  For those who are not interested in romance, but in mercantile matters, we inform you: the hotel has an ATM, currency exchange, shops, one of which is jewelry. </p><h2>  Entertainment at Tangerine Beach </h2><p>  At the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *, guests are invited to join in sports games.  Beach volleyball, darts, water polo, table tennis, chess, badminton - all this can be done absolutely free.  For team games, teammates will be entertained by animators.  They conduct classes in water aerobics in the pool.  Yoga school for all comers is free, provided that you will be engaged in a group.  Individual lessons with a trainer require additional funds.

Tourists recommend visiting the center of Ayurveda, whose services are also not free.  As for evening entertainment, three times a week in the hall of the five-star Royal Palms Beach Hotel, discos are held.  You can also sing in karaoke, which is set in such a way that "amateur activity" does not interfere with other tourists.  The hotel has Wi-Fi, but it is paid and pulls only in the lobby, near the reception.  But reviews suggest: in the coffee shop there is also access to the Internet.  One has only to order a drink or take a hookah, and you can chat with friends on a skyline - Wi-Fi is included in the price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Facilities for children at the Tangerine Beach Hotel (Sri Lanka) </h2><p>  Although the hotel is positioning itself as a venue for a honeymoon, young guests are also welcome here.  Of course, you cannot call a hotel a children's resort - there is no necessary equipment for feeding infants, but you can already go here with a baby from eight months of age.  Young tourists enjoy big discounts.  The restaurants have high chairs for feeding a small child.  And at your request, a crib will be put in your room.  Reviews warn: the local beach is not suitable for bathing very young children.  The waves are quite powerful, they can knock you down, and there are also ebbs and flows that can drag the child into whirlpools.  Thus, if you have already decided to relax with your children in Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *, reviews advise you to go to Bentota beach - this is the most beautiful, and most importantly, safe coast of Sri Lanka.  The hotel also has a small ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù for the baby, with fresh water well warmed up.  The guys from there just do not want to get out.  There is a playground for children with different swings and slides.  It is located by the adult swimming pool, which is convenient: parents can monitor their children without getting up from sun loungers.  And for those children who came to Sri Lanka during the "rainy season", there is a playroom. </p><h2>  Resort Features and Excursions from Tangerine Beach Hotel (Sri Lanka) </h2><p>  Kalutara is a small town that, despite its status as the capital of the district, looks very provincial.  But if you lack the hustle and bustle of the metropolis - Colombo is only forty kilometers away, and you can get to it quickly and cheaply by rail or bus.  But in Kalutara there is something to see.  Even before entering the city, a gigantic stupa of Gangatilaka Vihara appears before the eyes of travelers.  This sacred building, in addition to religious significance for Buddhists, has architectural value.  It is hollow inside, which is a rarity.  You can compare with the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra to Dagob Kalutar Viharu.  This is one of the oldest temple complexes in Sri Lanka.  It is built on the spot where, after spiritual enlightenment, Buddha Shakyamuni himself preached.  Inside, the astonished tourist will find a collection of seventy-four frescoes that depict the scenes of all 550 reincarnations of Prince Siddhartha.  In the courtyard of the temple complex, a Bo tree grows.  It is also a shrine.  After all, it grew out of the appendix of that anemone under which the Buddha gained enlightenment.  A sacrifice in the form of flowers or fruits should be offered to the tree in order to find harmony in the soul or fulfillment of a cherished desire.  In the south of Kalutara County is the beautiful Bentota Beach.  Reviews are advised not to be limited to one city in their sorties.  Do not trust the barking guides on duty at the gates of the Tangerine Beach Hotel.  Kalutara, or rather, its stores, where rollbacks are promised to such "guides", will be your only place to visit.  Hotel guides can take you to the Turtle Farm, to the waterfalls, in Colombo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 Sri Lanka Kalutara" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1395821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists really like the well-groomed green area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe two hotels.  Gardeners work wonderfully.  On the alleys you can see tropical birds and animals (harmless).  The hotel rooms are very spacious and tastefully decorated.  Many of the tourists, having settled in Standard, paid extra for Deluxe only to enjoy the ocean around the clock.  The rooms are cleaned very carefully.  The staff is smiling, friendly.  At the reception, one of the employees explained a little in Russian.  Many liked the fact that, living in the Quartet, you can use the infrastructure of a five-star hotel.  But Tangerine Beach Hotel reviews are called not quite a good choice for a vacation with very young children.  The sand on the beach is coarse-grained, the entrance to the sea is steep.  Although, as already mentioned, for such kids there is a swimming pool and other entertainment.  But from the age of eight, the child will appreciate the beauty of the ocean, since jumping in the breaking waves is quite fun.  This hotel is suitable for either newlyweds (or couples in love) or professional surfers. </p>
