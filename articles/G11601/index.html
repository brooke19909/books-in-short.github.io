On the coast of a crystal clear lake there is a large sandy beach.  Due to its shallow depth, the water in this area warms up in summer to the highest temperatures on Lake Baikal, and therefore Zuun Hagun Bay is a great place to relax. </p>

    <h2>  The unusual lake Baikal </h2><p>  Baikal is the oldest, deepest and cleanest lake on the planet.  It contains about 20% of the world's fresh water reserves.  The lake is still being actively explored.  Scientists continue to equip expeditions, but the exact age of Lake Baikal is still not known.  Disputes about its origin of the lake also do not subside.  You can easily drink water from the lake, because it contains so little salt that it is considered distilled.  It is so transparent, not silted up, due to the endemic microorganisms living in it, that on a clear day you can see stones, aquatic inhabitants and individual objects at a depth of about 40 meters.  More than 1800 species of inhabitants of the aquatic and animal world have arisen and live only here, in this lake and nowhere else.  Baikal is also unique in that there are more than 300 clear days in the year - this is more than in the Black Sea resorts.  However, the water in Baikal is very cold even in summer - because of the depth.  Perhaps the lake is a new nascent ocean?  After all, its shores diverge, and collapses periodically occur, the earth goes under water.  According to one version, the word "Baikal" itself means "a reservoir similar to the sea." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Olkhon Island </h2><p>  Olkhon Island (translated as ‚Äúdry‚Äù and ‚Äúwooded‚Äù) is the largest of the three dozen Baikal islands.  It is located in the central part, evenly extended along the coast.  This mysterious, mystical place is called the heart of Lake Baikal, as well as the homeland of shamans.  One day is not enough to see the whole island, yet its length is 71 km. </p><p>  About two thirds of the local plants and inhabitants are unique, and nowhere else on earth can they be found.  The highest point of Olkhon Island is Mount Zhima, its height reaches 1276 meters above sea level.  And literally 10 km from it is the deepest basin of the lake - 1637 meters. </p><p>  This is the only island where people live permanently.  Local residents are engaged in cattle breeding, forestry, fish farming and agriculture.  You can book a water or bus excursion here, there is a ferry.  In summer, festivals, concerts, fairs are held here.  In recent years, trips to these places have been very popular among local residents, as well as among foreigners who are interested in Buryat culture, traditions and ancient customs. </p><p>  A pond located between the island and the coast of the lake is called the Small Sea.  It is here that Zuun Hagun Bay is located.  Baikal is the most hospitable for tourists here: bears, snakes, lynxes are not found here, there are no <span>encephalitis ticks.</span>  But amazing freshwater seals - <span>Baikal seals</span> - have chosen these places and allow tourists to admire themselves.  The weather here changes often, a sharp wind may rise in an instant, but when the lake is calm, trees are reflected in its surface, as if in a mirror.  The fog standing above the lake is amazingly beautiful - this sight is worth seeing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mount Shaman </h2><p>  At <span>Cape Burkhan</span> , the famous Shamanka Mountain is located - the main symbol of Lake Baikal, a place of ancient power.  Knowledgeable people say that there are only a few places around the world </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center zuun hagun" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/472344.jpg" width="600"></div>  .  Everything is shrouded in mysterious traditions and legends.  The mountain is famous for the fact that at the water level there is an entrance to the famous Shamanic cave - a surprisingly beautiful and very powerful place that is called the heart of Olkhon.  They say that Cape Burhan is the residence of an ancient spirit.  The cave is famous for the fact that since ancient times, shamans held their rites and rituals here.  In winter, the water around the cave does not freeze.
