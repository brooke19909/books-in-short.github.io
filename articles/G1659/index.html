    <h2>  A variety of jewelry on the neck </h2><p>  Perhaps the question of how to make <span>jewelry on the neck</span> might seem difficult to someone <span>.</span>  In fact, this is not unusual.  Just for starters you need to decide what exactly needs to be done. </p><p>  Necklaces come in many types and styles.  The most famous are beads and necklaces, which can be easily stringed by any woman if she knows how to hold the needle in her hands. </p><p>  Pendants on chains look interesting, especially if both of them are made manually according to an individual plan. </p><p>  Of course, the top of perfection is a necklace made of stones and beads.  This is the most festive accessory, and not every craftswoman can collect it.  But to try to do something simpler is completely within the power of everyone.  Thus <span>, fashionable</span> jewelry will easily settle in the box of any woman who is not afraid to experiment with form and texture. </p><h2>  Manufacturing methods </h2><p>  Making a beautiful jewelry on the neck with your own hands is not at all difficult.  The main thing is to choose the right technique.  And there are several of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stringing of beads and beads is the simplest and oldest of them.  It is enough to choose the appropriate color and size of the working material and start creating.  If you master more complex techniques of weaving, you will get truly exquisite and unique products. </p><p>  With the help of a crochet hook, you can create knitted jewelry on the neck.  Do not confuse them with a scarf.  These are exquisite subtle accents that complement the image of a lady, if her outfit allows the use of relatively coarse knitting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted jewelry on the neck" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749507.jpg" width="467"></div>

    <p>  In the last couple of years, textile dyes have been very popular.  They are created on the basis of small flaps that act as independent decorative elements or decorate large beads, changing their appearance. </p><h2>  For those who know the basics of Irish lace </h2><p>  You can make a knitted jewelry on the neck with your own hands based on the technique of Irish lace.  It is rich in various forms of flowers and leaves, which are then collected in a single canvas.  The same elements make sense to use independently. </p><p>  For example, take the simplest piece of paper.  He knits on the basis of a chain of air loops.  First, on one side, a number of double crochet stitches are knitted.  In the last loop they are best done 3-4.  Then we perform the same procedure on the other hand.  At the bottom we will have a tail that can be easily attached to the base of the jewelry. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By linking several of these motifs, you can combine them into one decoration or add any flowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fashion jewelry" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749506.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  As for <span>crochet colors, it's</span> also worth experimenting.  Tie a few options that you like best and connect them using a loop of thread.  It will turn out unusually light and original summer knitted jewelry on the neck.  No one else will have something like that. </p><h2>  And again about the beads </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest decorative materials, which has not lost its popularity today.  To make an ornament on your neck from it with your own hands is easy.  Even if you string 5-7 strands of beads, you will already get a magnificent necklace.  Then a little fantasy with him.  Before putting it on and buttoning, we will try to twist a tight tourniquet out of it.  This is a completely different decoration than it was a minute ago. </p><p>  There is a beautiful brooch in the house.  Excellent!  We fasten it to a bead necklace and get a completely unique jewelry. </p><p>  In the last couple of seasons, bead clamps and snoods have been very popular.  They are made very simply: the same threads with strung beads should be so long that they can be wrapped around the head without a fastener a couple of times.  But do not forget about the quantity.  The more magnificent such fashionable jewelry, the more spectacular they look. </p><h2>  Little tricks </h2><p>  To make an ordinary bead string unusual, you can fantasize a little.  It can be an exquisite base for an unusual pendant.  The main thing is to catch that fine line when these two elements are ideally combined with each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded necklace master class" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749510.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  The pendant can be made using the most of acrylic sewed rhinestones.  They are perfectly combined in a flower and in a twig of several leaves.  Next, we select a harmonious and slightly <span>contrasting color of the</span> beads and create the basis on which we will present our product. </p><p>  The tricks include various nodules.  These are the simplest elements of weaving.  A long bead bundle can be tied into a knot exactly in the middle and then fastened.  This will be a massive accent.  It is quite appropriate for a dress made of heavy fabric, such as velor. </p><p>  A not very thick bundle of bead threads can be tied in the middle, instead of several times throwing them over your head.  Such a decoration visually slenders any figure. </p><h2>  Interesting combination </h2><p>  It is not necessary to use the beads on their own.  You can use it to create more interesting jewelry that will definitely be unique.  Consider a necklace of beads, a master class on the creation of which involves the use of a bijouterie chain as the basis of jewelry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet neck" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749508.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  On their own, both of these materials look a bit scanty.  But their combination gives an unsurpassed effect. </p><p>  We take the chain and fasten the thread or fishing line to the extreme link.  Next, we sew the chain back and forth, but at the same time we do not forget to string one bead each time, which does not crawl through the link hole.  A chain braided in this way can be supplemented with two or three pendants with small crystals of the same color. </p><p>  This elegant combination of different materials gives the effect of light elegance and unusualness with all the simplicity of its implementation.  Small earrings made according to the same principle are perfect for such jewelry. </p><h2>  Each bead separately </h2><p>  Beads come in many sizes.  Especially large beads can be strung in a slightly different way than a simple thread.  The result is a very original and elegant necklace made of beads.  We are going to analyze his master class now. </p><p>  You need to start from the fittings.  We will need special bijouterie pins and long connectors for 5-7 loops.  We string each bead onto a pin, twist the free end into a loop and bite off the excess.  We do the next bead in the same way, but before completely closing the ring, we penetrate the previous element into it.  In this way 5-7 threads are woven.  Each of them should be slightly longer than the previous one in order to create a tiered effect in the finished product. </p><p>  Fasten the finished threads in ascending order to the connector.  All this ends with a castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make neck jewelry" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749503.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  That's all.  An unusual and simple <span>bead necklace is</span> ready.  Making earrings for him is also not a problem.  In the same way, you can weave short threads that are attached to the base of the earring. </p><h2>  Tandem Bead and Hook </h2><p>  A couple of years ago, a technique for working with beads using an ordinary crochet hook appeared.  To do this, you no longer need to study complex patterns of stringing beads.  Now you can crochet a <span>necklace</span> from beads.  The schemes of such products are extremely simple, and the result is simply charming. </p><p>  The easiest way is elongated air loops.  In ordinary knitting, these loops tighten tightly to get a neat, uniform product.  But in the bead version, we need the effect of light chaos.  We take a fishing line and string a large amount of beads on it.  After that, we begin to knit a chain of air loops.  There are two points to consider in this process.  We pass several beads into each loop.  We try to stretch all the loops, not to let them tightly tighten. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful necklaces" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749502.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  We fold this workpiece with an accordion in accordance with the length of the future necklace.  We fix the ends and attach the fasteners.  The necklace is ready! </p><h2>  Who can make jewelry? </h2><p>  Coco Chanel also said that jewelry was created for women who have a taste.  You must be able to wear such products.  Therefore, if there is no suitable accessory in your casket, you need to urgently make a jewelry on your neck with your own hands.  The advantages of this method of replenishing your collection are many: jewelry is just right for a certain outfit, it will be unique and inimitable, the creative process will bring pleasure, and the jewelry will have its own soul. </p><p>  Each woman is created in order to create beauty around herself.  Therefore, to create any masterpiece under her power, if there are all the reasons and the corresponding conditions. </p>
