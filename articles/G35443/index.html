He not only lands on the surface of the moon, but also sets the <span>American flag,</span> remembers everything he sees around, collects soil for further research in laboratories.  He is a vivid example for modern youth, a man who has achieved success in conquering outer space. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Neil Armstrong is an astronaut known to mankind as the one who took his first steps not on planet Earth.  He was born in 1930, on August 5.  Despite being known as landing on the moon, Neil was also an aviation veteran.  In his career - 78 combat missions.  Only after their successful implementation did he join NASA, becoming a test pilot. </p><p>  In 1969, he became commander of the Apollo 11 mission.  Its main task is to land on the moon.  Together with teammates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, he successfully completes the mission.  During the landing, he uttered the famous phrase about a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind. </p>

Everyone seeks to ask about feelings, emotions and impressions.  Despite this, he is reluctant to give interviews, since most of the information is classified.

In 2012, he undergoes complex heart surgery.  But complications arose, after which Neal passed away at the age of 83. </p><h2>  Earth satellite flight planning </h2><p>  The American government first visited the idea of <span>flying to the moon</span> because it did not want to lag behind the USSR in the process of space exploration.  At first the fight was on an equal footing, but after Yuri Gagarin, the United States remained far behind in the race.  Therefore, <span>John Kennedy</span> in 1961 instructed the American astronautics to land on the moon in the next decade.  Then astronauts and scientists had little idea how exactly this could be done.  The mission was allocated $ 24 billion - a fabulous amount. </p><p>  Specialists began training, they even helped the German rocket engineer Verne von Braun.  Thanks to him, in 1967 the Saturn-5 rocket was launched into orbit.  She can deliver to the moon up to 50 tons.  Then follow the trials of the Apollo.  The first attempt was extremely unsuccessful.  Astronauts are plagued by difficulties, both technical and physical.  Moreover, the first flight on the Apollo did not take place at all, because of the fire the entire crew died. </p><p>  Subsequent tests become more successful, and Apollo 11 fulfills the assignment of John F. Kennedy.  No particular difficulties were observed, as captain Neil Armstrong is an astronaut with great experience, as well as both of his partners.  The ship sets safely on the surface of the moon, and also delivers the entire crew to Earth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Moon landing </h2><p>  In July 1969, Neil Armstrong assumed command of the crew of the Apollo 11 ship.  His mission is to deliver astronauts to the lunar surface.  On July 20, the Nile becomes the first person to walk on the only natural satellite of our planet. </p>

The dust settled quickly enough, visibility became good.  Astronauts leave the ship, go into the open near moon space.  Armstrong, along with one of his partners, spends 2.5 hours on the moon.  During this time, it is possible to do everything that was planned.

    <h2>  View from the lunar surface </h2><p>  The Apollo 11 mission was planned so that the sun would not rise high above the horizon.  Since there is no atmosphere on the moon, astronauts will be completely defenseless before the rays, there is a risk of blindness.  Therefore, it was not possible to make out a star from the surface. </p>

Astronauts could not distinguish certain shades.  However, when the sun rose slightly above the horizon, the color became more distinguishable.  The surface was compared with the desert, brown shades prevailed. 
      <br>

    <p>  The land during landing turned out to be more distinguishable than the Sun, it was almost at its zenith.  Two colors prevailed - blue and white (due to water and clouds, respectively).  Despite its small size, astronauts noted that it was a very colorful sight. </p><h2>  Human Stay on the Moon </h2><p>  Neil Armstrong on the moon spent more than 2 hours.  During this time, he managed to test many of the movements that people often perform on Earth.  Difficulties were created due to the spacesuit, since it was equipped with a satchel, so the center of gravity shifted. </p><p>  To take a few steps on the moon, you need to make a lot more effort.  I had to "accelerate."  Stops after walking also did not work right away.  It was necessary to take several steps before completely stopping the movement. </p>

They reached two meters.  If you push harder, you can jump higher, but then it‚Äôs more difficult to maintain balance.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Falls did not cause discomfort.  It was quite possible to climb after them.  During the fall, the speed slows down again due to a slight attraction. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Neil Armstrong is an astronaut who died in old age, his feat was remembered by mankind for many years, his name will sound for centuries.  The team of engineers and scientists, as well as the captain of Apollo 11, together with their crew accomplished the impossible, they proved that space exploration is quite accessible with modern technological achievements of mankind. </p>
