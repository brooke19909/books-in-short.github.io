    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Once upon a time there was a fishing village on the site of Kemer.  And today, the resort is considered one of the largest in the Mediterranean.  Those who choose a vacation in this direction can choose a cheap hotel and luxury premium apartments.  Many of them are located directly by the sea.

    <p>  The overwhelming majority of Russians call the poor soundproofing in the rooms the only big minus.  Even with the windows and doors closed in the early morning, they were awakened by extraneous sounds. </p><p>  Some were confused by the small size of the shower and the presence of ants in the rooms.  There are never any problems with hot water. </p><p>  The work of the staff of Naturella Hotel Apart has received a lot of attention.  There were no negative reviews about the hotel staff.  Friendly staff work here who are always ready to help. </p><p>  As for nutrition, the opinions of Russians differ.  Some guests find it meager and monotonous.  Others believe that the food for a three-star hotel can be considered tolerable.  Many positive reviews were left regarding desserts. </p><p>  The beach also left a double impression: some did not like its remoteness, while others did not like pebble. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that almost half of the Russians expressed a desire to relax again in this hotel. </p>
