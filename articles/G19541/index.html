If you know what this or that icon on the diagram means, then you can deal with any pattern and create beautiful crafts for your home.  First of all, you need to learn the basic elements on which most knitting patterns are based.  And then you can move on to more complex ones. </p><h2>  Air loop </h2><p>  So, we begin to master crochet.  The symbols described below will help you understand the essence of the knitting process.  An air loop (aka a chain) can rightfully be called the foundation of any craft created with a hook. </p><p>  It is indicated on the diagrams by a small dot, filled with a black circle or white inside a horizontal oval with pointed tips.  To create a chain of air loops, it is necessary to take the working thread on the <span>index finger of the</span> left hand and draw a hook under it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet symbols" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776119.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <p>  Then turn the working material to the right so that you get the first curl.  Fix its position with your fingers, holding on to the crossing, and pull the thread through it with a hook.  That is, the chain is created by the principle of pulling one loop through another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Please note: the hook must be held in your right hand, like a pencil.  If there is a special dent on it, the fingers should be on it without changing its position.  The material itself and the finished part of the product at this time are on the left. </p><h2>  Connecting post </h2><p>  The same crochet symbols, the photos of which will teach you this type of needlework, are repeated on many patterns.  The following basic element belongs to such common signs - a connecting column. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="symbols for crocheting a fluffy column" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/776418.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is indicated by two short lines crossed at right angles to each other.  It is used when they knit a final row and individual parts that need to be combined among themselves.  It is based on knitting a chain located on the inside.  It is used, for example, to create Irish lace.  This chain can be made by turning the thread so that the hook is on its right end.  Then it is introduced into the previous loop, grabbing the thread by it and sticking it through both of these curls. </p><h2>  Single crochet </h2><p>  Deciphering crochet symbols is not possible without <span>double crochets.</span>  This is a separate category of signs, based on which you can create beautiful lace creations.  Even a small child can master this knitting technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776115.jpg" width="411"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A single crochet column is indicated on the diagrams in the form of the letter "t".  To use this technique, first bind a standard chain.  Then insert the tip of the hook into its penultimate loop and pull the thread through it.  Repeat these steps again so that you get two new loops and connect them with yarn.  To make the edges of the crafts equal, each row must be completed with an additional air bend. </p><p>  This element is often used to make crochet patterns.  This type of legend will help you create four kinds of patterns: </p><ol><li>  Smooth pattern.  To work on it, it is necessary to knit the hook in the front hour and under the edges of both loops while knitting the second and all subsequent rows using single crochet columns. </li><li>  Striped pattern.  The hook enters the front under the front loop. </li><li>  Raised.  We introduce the tool under the back loop in its front part. </li><li>  The final row of the product.  When working on it, you cannot change the position of the product.  At the same time, we knit columns without a crochet not from right to left, but vice versa.  The hook is inserted in the upper part under the two loops located on top.  With it, we grab the main thread and pull out a new crinkle.  Then make another one and combine it with the previous one. </li></ol><h2>  Half columns </h2><p>  Half-columns are also very common symbols when crocheting.  They are indicated as a <span>vertical line</span> with a small perpendicular dash in its central part. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet loop symbols" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776114.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This element is executed as follows.  First we knit the chain and rotate it so that the tool is on the right end of the workpiece.  Now we throw a thread on his head, pull it through the third loop located on the chain.  Thus, on the hook we form 3 curls.  Pass the thread through them so that you get one new crinkle. </p><h2>  Double crochet </h2><p>  A crochet column is another of the basic elements on which crochet is based.  The hinge symbols look like a vertical bar.  Depending on how many crochets you need to make, it will be crossed out with a certain number of strokes or stay clean. </p><p>  In the latter case, we make a single crochet column, which is created according to the following principle.  We knit a chain, throw one turn on it, insert the hook into the third gyrus and pull a new one out of it.  After that, three twists should form on the instrument.  Hook the thread with the head and pull it through two of them, and then another through them.  After that, you should have only one loop left.  We knit the next column on this bend or where the scheme requires it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet legend description" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776120.jpg" width="600"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  So that the craft can be safely deployed, while its edges remain smooth, each row ends with two additional airy convolutions.  When you knit the next row, consisting of columns with a single crochet, enter the head of the tool under a pair of upper loops.  If the pattern requires several of these elements in one place, they should go out from under the two curls of the base. </p><h2>  More crochets </h2><p>  Symbols for crocheting are quite easy to decipher, if you understand the principles of their creation.  So, a <span>double crochet column is</span> indicated in the form of a vertical stick with a pair of small perpendicular dashes in the center.  It fits in the same pattern as the previous look.  But in this case, with the help of a working thread, two crochets are made, and the hook must be inserted into the fourth loop on the base and fastened together with each pair of curls. </p><p>  Columns with three, four and any other number of these elements are knitted according to the same principle.  It‚Äôs just that in each case the required number of crochets is made, and the instrument is inserted into the loop, which is two curls further.  Then a thread is threaded through these convolutions, so that as a result only one of them remains. </p><h2>  Lush column </h2><p>  We continue to consider the symbols for <span>crocheting.</span>  <span>The lush column</span> on some schemes is depicted as a strip crossed out by several arcs.  On others, it can be seen in the form of a vertical oval with a pointed top and bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet legend photo" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776116.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Using this element, you can create a convex effect on the craft.  It is created thanks to four to five crochets, after which the hook enters the main loop, connecting all the formed coils. </p><p>  Using crochet symbols, you need to know how a knot (or pico) is denoted.  It is depicted in the shape of a black triangle.  To make it, you need to make three air loops and connect them to the first. </p><p>  Another common element is a horizontal bar.  It looks like a arrow on the diagrams, above which three dots stand in a row.  You need to make a triple of air loops, then the yarn.  After that, insert the hook into the first curl and, in turn, tie the subsequent meanders to each other. </p><h2>  Two types of fringe - one sign </h2><p>  When you decipher <span>crochet patterns,</span> symbols can have different meanings.  This applies primarily to the fringe badge.  It is always depicted in the form of a loop, but this element itself can be performed in two ways: on the inside and on the front. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoding of crochet symbols" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776117.jpg" width="500"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  When it is made outside the product, the first row is knitted as follows.  The thread is thrown over the <span>thumb of the</span> left hand to form a loop.  Then a hook is placed on top and introduced into the main curl on the previous row.  After this, the single crochet is tied with a thread.  When the fringe is done on the wrong side, the yarn is wound on a pencil, and the operation ends in the same way as in the previous case. </p><h2>  Other designations </h2><p>  When you master crochet, the legend of the loops you in the process.  If you need to connect several columns that go from one point, the scheme will help to understand how many of them should be.  They are depicted in the form of rays connected to each other from below or from above.  Embossed columns are indicated in the form of a stick with an arc in its lower part.  Crossed - in the form of stripes intersecting each other in the center. </p><p>  Crochet symbols of Japanese magazines are depicted in the form of hieroglyphs.  This practice is quite common in the east.  But it‚Äôs enough for us to remember the set of special characters and the principles by which they are created in order to learn how to freely read knitting patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="symbols for crocheting a fluffy column" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/776118.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Using these and other crochet tricks, you can create beautiful napkins, stylish lace clothing or elements for decorating it (for example, brooches in the shape of flowers) or even luxurious vintage tablecloths.  Special schemes that you will get the hang of deciphering at first glance will help you work on simple and intricate patterns.  Remembering the basic notation, you even learn to draw such instructions for needlework yourself. </p>
