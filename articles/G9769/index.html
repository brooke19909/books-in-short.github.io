Star of Solomon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The legendary Solomon (1011‚Äì928 BC) is the third Jewish king, the son of David from Bathsheba.  Under him, Israel reached the pinnacle of its influence and power.  After the reign of Solomon (965‚Äì928 BC), the country began a period of civil strife and the collapse of the once united state.  This monarch became famous for his wisdom and justice.  Its main achievement is the construction of the Temple on <span>Mount Zion</span> , about which the righteous David so dreamed. </p><h2>  Rise to power </h2><p>  Solomon was one of his father's youngest sons, which did not prevent the influential prophet Nathan from distinguishing him from other children of David.  A capable boy grew up a worthy man.  Formally, he was not considered the heir to the throne, but a chain of several events led to the fact that he became the king of Israel. </p><p>  After the death of the two elder sons, David promised his beloved wife of Bathsheba to transfer the throne to Solomon.  Adonia did not like this decision.  This son of David, who became older due to the death of Avshalom and Ammon, decided not to obey his father‚Äôs will.  He was supported by several influential people, including the high priest Evyatar and the military leader Yoav.  On the side of Solomon was the prophet Nathan. </p><p>  The party of Adonia openly announced its claims to power and began to gather new supporters.  Meanwhile, the dying David commanded to anoint the kingdom of Solomon (as stated in the <span>biblical legend</span> of King Solomon).  After the sacred ritual, the people swore allegiance to the heir.  Frightened by his brother‚Äôs revenge, Adonijah hid in the sanctuary, but left when the new ruler promised to save his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  David soon died.  Adonia persuaded Virsania to ask his son for permission to marry Avisaga, one of the concubines of the late father.  According to ancient laws, such a marriage gave the right to the throne.  King Solomon, whose biography shows an example of a visionary politician, understood the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rebellious brother and ordered the murder of himself and some of his high-ranking minions.  This was the only time that the monarch authorized the death penalty. </p>

    <h2>  Foreign and domestic policy </h2><p>  Having defeated the dynastic rival, Solomon proceeded to the full rule of Israel.  He hastened to make friends with Egypt.  Having married the daughter of the pharaoh, the Jewish monarch received in his dowry the city of Gezer.  The reign of Solomon was also marked by the continuation of friendship with the Phoenician sovereign Hiram, who had good relations with David. </p><p>  The ruler of the Jews loved horses and ordered the creation of the first Jewish cavalry.  Neighboring kings and profitable trading yielded large incomes.  Solomon spent them on a grand scale, trying to achieve greatness in everything.  His grandiose enterprises placed a heavy burden on the common population.  Because of this, the government began a conflict with the tribes of Menashe and Efraim.  The story of King Solomon, with all the grandeur of his personality, was also distinguished by his own mistakes.  Forcing the obstinate tribes to work harder, the ruler strengthened their separate moods.  Partly for this reason, the collapse of Israel after the death of Solomon was a natural and logical outcome of the internal Jewish conflict. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Temple Construction </h2><p>  No matter how controversial King Solomon may be, the biography of this monarch of antiquity is best known for the construction of the Temple.  Even his father David conquered Jerusalem belonging to the Jebusites and transferred the Ark of the Covenant there.  He, together with the judges from the Sanhedrin, prepared a plan for the future Temple.  David did not have time to complete the construction of the main religious building of the Jews and bequeathed the execution of this plan to his son. </p><p>  King Solomon, whose biography is an example of one of the best diplomats of antiquity, before starting to build the Temple, enlisted the support of foreign experts.  The governor of the Phoenician city of Tira, Hiram, helped him by sending many artisans and carpenters to Jerusalem (including his best architect, Hiram Abiff). </p><p>  Building materials were supplied from Lebanon: sandstone, cypresses, cedars.  The stones were trimmed with masons of both Hiram and Solomon.  The copper needed for the utensils and temple columns was mined in the copper mines of Idumea, in the south of the Israeli Highlands.  Almost 200 thousand workers were involved in the construction. </p>

    <h2>  Completion of construction </h2><p>  The construction of the Temple lasted seven years and was completed in 950 BC.  e.  Elders of all sorts and tribes arrived at the celebration dedicated to its solemn consecration and lasted two weeks.  The <span>Ark of the Covenant</span> was transferred to the Temple <span>,</span> after which the king read a prayer.  Construction has become a matter of national importance.  It has become the personification of the unification of all of Israel. </p><p>  The temple was conceived as part of the complex, which included the royal palace as well.  This magnificent building dominated all the buildings of Jerusalem.  A separate entrance connected the religious building with the palace of Solomon.  The entire complex was built for another nine years. </p>

    <h2>  Idolatry </h2><p>  According to the Torah, God appeared to Solomon twice.  The first time this happened during one of the sacrifices.  King Solomon, whose biography characterizes him as an intelligent ruler, asked God for wisdom and talent to rule his own people (which was given to him). </p><p>  The second time the revelation occurred after the construction of the Temple.  God promised to take the David clan under his protection if the people did not fall away from Solomon.  However, closer to old age, the king began to tolerate pagan cults.  Contemporaries associated this change with the influence of the monarch's foreign wives.  On Mount of Olives, Solomon even built a temple for Moloch and Kmosh, gods alien to the Jews.  This act caused the discontent of many zealous Jews for faith.  For this, God took power over Israel from the son of Solomon, which led to the collapse of the country. </p>

    <h2>  Ruler of Judea and Queen of Sheba </h2><p>  The biography of Solomon is connected with the legendary figure of the Ancient East - the Queen of Sheba.  This woman ruled the Arabian state of Saba.  Having heard about the glory and wisdom of the king of Judah, she arrived in Jerusalem in order to experience it in riddles.  This visit is described in detail in the Old Testament. </p><p>  After a friendly visit to the ruler of Saba in Israel, a period of prosperity and prosperity began.  Some researchers believe that Solomon had an affair with the queen.  From this connection emperors of Ethiopia came from.  Their dynasty was called Solomon. </p><p>  In Europe, interest in the plot of the relationship between the king of Israel and the queen of Sheba revived during the Renaissance.  The frescoes of the famous artist Piero della Francesca were devoted to the legendary ruler.  In literature, Queen of Sheba fell into the works of Bocaccio, Heinrich Heine, Gustave Flaubert, Rudyard Kipling and many other writers. </p>

    <h2>  Six pointed star </h2><p>  To emphasize his respect for the late father, the king of Judah made his sign a state symbol and seal.  So the famous six-pointed star of Solomon appeared.  In the Middle Ages, it was also associated with the occult pentagram and the Maltese cross, used by the Knights of St. John. </p><p>  The star of Solomon was used in alchemy, magic, Kabbalah and other mystical practices.  The king of Judah wore a signet ring on which this ancient symbol was depicted.  With the help of a powerful artifact, Solomon subdued 72 genies - fiery desert demons.  The star was his military mascot.  Solomon did not part with him in any battle. </p>

    <h2>  The Wisdom and Death of Solomon </h2><p>  An important embodiment of the <span>wisdom of Solomon</span> was his work.  Historians believe that he was the author of several Old Testament books, which are important parts of the Bible.  During his life, Solomon voiced more than a thousand parables, some of which formed the basis of the Book of Solomon's parables.  This work became the 28th part of the Tanakh.  Also, the authorship of Solomon belongs to the Book of Song of Songs and the Book of Ecclesiastes. </p><p>  The death of King Solomon occurred in 928 BC.  e on the fourth ten of his reign.  Nearby, not believing the death of the elder, did not bury the deceased until the worms began to eat his staff.  In Arabic sources, Solomon is called Suleiman and is considered the forerunner of the prophet Muhammad. </p>
