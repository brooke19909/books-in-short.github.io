Currently, it is one of the most popular tourist centers in Georgia.  What is the interest of this city?  What sights of Kutaisi are worth seeing? </p><h2>  The capital of the ancient kingdoms </h2><p>  Historians are inclined to believe that the city of Kutaisi was founded before our era, in about 6-5 centuries.  The first written sources that mention it date back to the 3rd century BC.  e.  Apollonius of Rhodes in the poem "Argonautics" reports that Kutaisi was the city into which the Argonauts sailed in search of the golden fleece. </p><p>  The city was the capital of the kingdom of the ancient Georgians - kolkhs.  Ancient sources describe this region as full of populous villages in which they make good wine and grow delicious fruits. </p><p>  Later, the city becomes part of Imereti as part of the united <span>Georgian kingdom.</span>  In the XV century, when Imereti separated and gained independence, Kutaisi became the capital of the Imereti kingdom, and later - the Imeretino-Abkhaz kingdom. </p><p>  As usual, these lands often suffered from Turkish raids.  The kingdom repeatedly requested the help of Russian troops, but only under Catherine II did the Russian Empire decide to provide assistance.  Having liberated the inhabitants of the Imereti kingdom from the Turks, the region was turned into the Imereti region of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  As part of socialist Georgia, this city was part of the USSR and was one of the important industrial centers.  Now the city is the parliamentary <span>capital of Georgia.</span>  Many sights of Kutaisi suffered significantly during the Turkish raids, then during the USSR, but recently they have been actively restored. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A little about Kutaisi </h2><p>  The city is part of the territory of Imereti, and since 2012, <span>the Georgian parliament</span> has been located here <span>.</span>  Kutaisi is located in the western part of the country.  By some standards, this is a small city (about 150 thousand people live here), but in Georgia it is considered the second largest. </p><p>  It is located on both sides of the Rioni River.  Many original bridges cross the river, which gives the city a special highlight and distinguishes it from other places in the country.  Bridges here can be safely recorded in bright sights. </p><p>  Kutaisi is often called the city of May, the city of roses, but its name translates as "stone".  That's because in ancient times it was located on the northern rocky side of the river. </p><p>  It is completely easy to get to Kutaisi, not far from the city, 14 km, the international airport is located.  Also in the city there are two railway stations. </p><p>  Kutaisi Airport officially opened only in 2012, mainly it accepts low-cost flights.  Its name is associated with the name of the king of Georgia - David the Builder, who ruled in medieval times.  In terms of size, Kutaisi Airport is the second in the country and is able to receive even long-haul aircraft. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the city of Kutaisi, quite a lot of famous personalities visited.  Vladimir Mayakovsky studied here, and the poetess Lesya Ukrainka wrote the famous drama extravaganza "Forest Song" in this city.  Such creative personalities as Akaki Tsereteli, Niko Nikoladze, Titian Tabidze and many others also visited the city. </p>

    <h2>  Bagrat Temple </h2><p>  Bagrati, or Bagrat‚Äôs Cathedral, was built during the reign of Bagrat III, in 1003, and was the main cathedral of the united kingdom of Georgia.  The temple is lit in honor of the Assumption of the Virgin.  It used to be part of a huge palace complex.  Here the most important events of the kingdom took place, for example, in the XI century the coronation of David the Builder took place in this cathedral. </p><p>  The temple is visible from almost anywhere in Kutaisi, as it is located on Ukimerioni Hill.  He suffered greatly during the Russo-Turkish struggle in the 18th century and was restored in our time.  Some ancient fragments of the temple were partially preserved. </p><p>  Before the cathedral was decorated with molding and carving.  The floor and walls inside were decorated with mosaics, and you can see it now.  In the lobby was a fresco depicting the Virgin. </p><p>  This is a monumental and majestic building, representing a monument of Caucasian medieval architecture.  And from the top of the hill on which the Bagrat temple is located, you can see not only the whole of Kutaisi, but also the Rachinsky ridge in the distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Church by the sky </h2><p>  There are a lot of temples in Georgia, which are located on the tops of the hills, but this one is unique in that it is located on the top of a tower formed in a natural way.  The pillar of Katshi is a 40-meter limestone monolith.  It used to be a symbol of the god of fertility, and later Christians built a temple on it. </p><p>  The pillar of Katshi is a place where, literally and figuratively, one can become closer to God.  The temple on the top of the pillar was erected on the ruins of the once existing temple on this site.  Its architecture is a repetition of the previous structure.  The stone church building is small and fairly simple.  Nearby is the crypt. </p><p>  Prior to this, many rulers wanted to climb a mountain, for example, Bagration in the XVIII century.  Their attempts were crowned with failure.  For the first time after many years of lack of people, they climbed to the top of a pillar in 1944.  Archaeologists have carefully examined the area, concluding that religious life has been going on here since the VI century, when the first church was built. </p><p>  The Bolnisi cross is carved at the foot of the mountain.  And now the iron staircase leads to the top.  The remains of an unknown monk were found near the church.  Locals often call the mountain "fortress of solitude." </p>

    <h2>  Monastery of Saints David and Constantine </h2><p>  Motsameta Monastery is located in an incredibly beautiful place: on the rolling hills above the Rioni River.  From the neighbor - Gelati Monastery - it is separated by a picturesque canyon.  A path through the canyon leads from one monastery to another. </p><p>  A legend about Arab conquerors who came to Georgian lands is associated with this place.  The Arabs burned the ancient church of the VIII century and wanted to convert local residents to Islam.  The brothers David and Constantine decided to resist the Arab invasion, but, alas, lost the battle and were captured.  Refusing to convert to Islam, the brothers suffered brutal torture for a week.  Then they drowned in the river. </p><p>  Locals discovered the bodies of the dead and at that moment heard the voice of God, who ordered them to go east and leave the bodies in the place where the dawn would catch them.  This place, of course, turned out to be a burnt church, where the locals erected a monastery in honor of the brothers. </p><p>  The relics of the saints are stored in the monastery, and on October 15 of each year a festival is held in their honor - Mozametoba. </p><p>  The monastery itself is very small and cozy.  Two round towers with hipped orange domes rise above the structure.  All the paintings in the monastery are new and do not represent historical significance, but the bell tower is old.  The age of the bell tower is not known exactly.  On the territory of the monastery there is a fountain with healing water, according to locals. </p>

    <h2>  Colchis Fountain </h2><p>  On the central square of the city of Kutaisi there is a fountain decorated with 30 unusual figures.  These figures are enlarged copies of archaeological finds from the Colchis Lowland.  In the original, these are golden figurines with images of animals. </p><p>  Facing the fountain is made of Kharagaul stone.  The main figures of the fountain are the horses of King Eet.  One of the figures - the golden lion - is a repeat of the lion figurine found in the Alazani Valley, which dates back to the III century BC. </p><p>  The fountain was created in 2011 under the leadership of architect David Gogichaishvili.  At the site of the fountain, at first there was a <span>statue of David the</span> Builder, which was transferred to the forecourt. </p>

    <h2>  National park </h2><p>  In the south-west of the main Caucasian ridge, on the mountain of the same name, is Sataplia National Park.  The subtropical climate and mountains around it make it very attractive for rare animals.  About 20 species of endemic species live here. </p><p>  The most interesting thing for children in the park.  There is a crater of a long-extinct volcano, karst caves, where you can look at natural wells, stalagmites, stalactites.  And in a special pavilion you can look at the tracks of dinosaurs. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Kutaisi is a beautiful city with a rich history.  Kutaisi sights such as the monastery, Bagrat Cathedral, the Pillar of Katskhi are surrounded by incomparable nature, the picturesque national park tells about prehistoric times, and the fountain in the city center tells modern Colchian history.  All this is certainly worth seeing. </p>
