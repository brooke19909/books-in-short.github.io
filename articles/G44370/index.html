    <p>  Recently, many prefer to purchase gadgets over the Internet.  However, in some cases, the seller may not provide a warranty period.  We strongly recommend giving preference only to trusted points of sale.  In this case, you will receive not only a high-quality gadget, but also a warranty period for it. </p><h2>  Tablet Accessories </h2><p>  Today, tablets are actively used not only at home, but also at work, school and in any other place.  That is why the selection of accessories for the device plays an important role.  As a rule, a standard unit includes a charging unit, a USB cable, and in some models also headphones. </p><p>  A 7-inch tablet case is an accessory that protects your gadget from dust, moisture, and scratching.  The classic model can be purchased for 200-400 rubles.  However, a cover made from a skin substitute will not last long.  Over time, the material will crack and the accessory will not look attractive. </p><p>  Genuine leather covers last as long as possible.  They always look stylish and neat.  The cost of such an accessory ranges from a thousand rubles.  Such a cover for a tablet (7 inches) will last at least three years.  You can also order the manufacture of accessories according to individual design.  Today, many craftsmen create unique covers made of genuine leather at low prices.  Often accessories for tablets are ordered in online stores.  This is no coincidence, because it is possible not only to save money, but also to choose the most attractive cover. </p><p>  Another important accessory is a <span>tablet keyboard.</span>  7 inches is a small <span>screen size.</span>  That is why some people are not comfortable typing on the touch keyboard.  However, this problem can be easily solved.  To do this, you need to purchase a keyboard built into the case or buy it as a separate accessory.  Such an addition will turn the tablet into a small netbook. </p><p>  Headphones are considered the most problematic accessory.  Despite the fact that not all models have been supplemented with equipment, a headset is still necessary.  Many users use it to listen to audio recordings or turn it on when watching movies.  However, it is this accessory that most often fails.  In order for the headphones to work properly for as long as possible, it is necessary to give preference to the original models.  Some can not afford it.  However, among budget models there are high-quality ones.  It is important first of all to pay attention to the cable density and the cost of the headphones.  It is worth noting that with proper operation, budget models will last as long as possible.  It is no secret that the cheaper the model, the worse the material from which it is made. <br>  We recommend purchasing headphones in a special case.  Use it for transportation, and the headset will be less confused and last longer. </p><p>  When buying a tablet, it is important to immediately stick a protective film on its screen.  It will protect the gadget from scratches and damage when dropped.  We do not recommend to engage in gluing the film yourself without experience.  Many, wanting to save money, acquire coverage and decide to install it without the help of a specialist.  Under the film that was pasted incorrectly, air and dust accumulate.  Such a protective layer looks messy. </p>
