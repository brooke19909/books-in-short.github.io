    <h2>  From the history </h2><p>  Once in 1688, young <span>Peter I</span> in one of the outbuildings of the royal estate discovered the old boat "St. Nicholas".  Today it is in honorary storage at the Naval Museum in our northern capital.  Often, history buffs ask the question: “What is the name of the boat of Peter 1?”  So, it was this ship that they later called the "Grandfather of the Russian Navy." </p><p>  On this boat, the young king began to master the intricacies of controlling a ship on <span>the Yauza River.</span>  When the country's navy appeared at the beginning of the 17th century and the first victories were won, the tsar of All Russia ordered the boat to be transported to St. Petersburg and issued a Decree on this subject. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boat of Peter 1 Pereslavl Zalessky" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/589741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the Neva and the Gulf of Finland, the boat was solemnly welcomed, including by ambassadors of foreign countries.  The great reformer king himself stood at the helm; fleet admirals sat on oars.  "The Grandfather of the Russian Navy" was greeted with a cannon fire, drum roll.  By decree of Peter was to forever keep the ships on which he began to study maritime affairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Amusing flotilla </h2><p>  In 1688, Peter I arrived in Pereslavl and was fascinated by the size and beauty of Lake Pleshcheyev.

    <p>  In the spring of 1689, the first ship was launched, and in the summer of 1692, many ships were already at the shipyard.  They were equipped with artillery.  On them amusing troops of the sovereign were trained in military operations and navigation. </p><h2>  The death of the amusing fleet </h2><p>  As a result of a severe fire in 1783, all the ships of the flotilla burned down.  Only the bot “Fortune” survived, which, according to legend, was built by Peter I. During the fire, he was stored in a room on Mount Gremyach, not far from the Tsar’s Palace, and did not stand on the lake with other ships. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drawings botan petra 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/591181.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <h2>  White Palace </h2><p>  Museum "Boat of Peter 1" presents its guests a beautiful palace.  It was founded in 1853 and was intended for dinner parties, receptions, balls.  The White Palace was built on donations from citizens.  To prevent the house from being empty, the nobles and merchants of Pereslavl organized here "Pereslavl assemblies."  In the summer, lovers of dancing and card games gathered at the Palace. </p><p>  After the revolution (1917), the geographical station of Moscow State University was opened in the White Palace.  In the thirties, the famous Soviet writer M. Prishvin worked here.  In the late twenties Kukryniksy visited the Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="as the boat of Peter 1 is called" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/589738.jpg" width="600"></div>

The exposition “At the Beginning of Glorious Deeds” was presented to visitors, which covers a long period, from the creation of a fun flotilla until the arrival of Emperor Nicholas II in these places (1913). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boat of Peter 1 in re-glory" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/589744.jpg" width="379"></div>

In this room you can see interesting details of the wooden palace of Peter the Great - doors, a watch dial, mica windows, etc. </p><p>  The second hall of the Museum "Boat of Peter 1" is a reconstruction of one room of the Peter's Palace.

    <h2>  Reconstruction of the boat of Peter I </h2><p>  It must be said that many modern masters strive to create a ship from the flotilla of Peter I, using ancient drawings.  The boat of Peter 1 was made in Petrozavodsk.  The construction was dedicated to the 300th anniversary of the Russian fleet.  The creation of the vessel became the original thesis of ten young and talented masters, graduates of the school at the IICC. </p><p>  The remake of the historic boat, which was created in Petrozavodsk, is an indispensable participant in city holidays. </p><h2>  Rotunda </h2><p>  In the ensemble of the museum, the rotunda is of particular interest and admiration for visitors.  She recreates the interior of the <span>Petrine era</span> to the smallest detail <span>.</span>  Today, fascinating theater programs and various exhibitions are held in this building.  The museum exposition includes details of the vessels of the first Russian fleet - a bronze eagle, a resin boiler, elements of ship's gear, and parts of a clockwork. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boat of Peter 1 Pereslavl Zalessky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/589751.jpg" width="573"></div>

    <p>  Museum "Boat of Peter 1" has been restored for a long time.  The Rotunda Hall was desolate.  This building was built for receptions.  It was created in memory of the great Russian ruler - Peter I. Funds for its construction were raised by the nobles of the Vladimir province. </p><p>  Today, in the reconstructed building with restored interiors of the Petrine times, which, according to the general opinion of visitors, adorns the Museum “Peter's Boat 1”, a permanent exhibition is being held.  It is represented by various works of art in which famous masters immortalized the vivid image of the reformer king.  Peter I appears in various images - from the king carpenter to the "Roman emperor", whose head is crowned with a laurel wreath. </p><h2>  Bot "Fortune" </h2><p>  A unique exhibit, which the Peter the Boat 1 Museum in Pereslavl is rightfully proud of, is the Fortuna boat, the last vessel to survive the fire.  Judging by the chronicles, the bot was made by the hands of young Peter I. The material used is pine, oak.  Its length is 7.34 m. The width of the vessel is 2.38 m. It is a Dutch single-mast ten-boat.  In the manufacture of the boat was carefully caulked, coated with resin, and then painted.  Management was carried out by a mounted steering wheel, which had an iron tiller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boat of Peter 1 Pereslavl Zalessky" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/591193.jpg" width="600"></div>
