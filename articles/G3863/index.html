Tourists traveling alone around the country or vacationing with a group on the beaches of Goa are tormented by doubts: does it make sense to go so far as to see a village?  And even the fact that the village of Hampi is included in the UNESCO list as a World Heritage Site does not bring clarity.  I would like more details.  Well, let's first make a virtual journey into the fabulous world of monkey-like Vanaras and the capital of the ancient empire.  We will see underground temples and aqueducts among the jungle, amazing mountains, as if built by the hand of a giant child.  This is the world of Hampi <span>(India).</span>  <span>Photos</span> will make our virtual tour more spectacular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hampi India Photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/595279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  At the entrance to the village, the first thing you pay attention to is the strange, as if composed of huge cobblestones, hills.  It is hard to believe that these mountains are not man-made embankments, but a whim of nature.  The height of such cobblestones is 18-20 meters, and the hardness of these stones is like that of meteorites that fell from space.  Ancient Hindus believed that this place was built by Hanuman, the god of monkeys.  This friend of Rama seemed to have brought here a piece of the great Himalayas.  A scientific explanation for such a strange structure of hilly relief was found only in the twentieth century.  Many millions of years ago there was a powerful release of magma from the core of the earth.  Rising to the surface, it solidified, and hardened giant pieces of rock flew out.  Because of this alone, the village of Hampi (India) could claim a worthy place in the list of attractions of the country.  But when you see an unusually solid ‚Äúcobblestone‚Äù the height of a three-story house, smoothly, like a razor, cut in half by ancient people, you don‚Äôt know what to think.  It‚Äôs just beyond understanding.  But from these stones temples, giant statues, houses, shopping arcades, aqueducts and bridges of the abandoned city were made!  How, by what technologies? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hampi History </h2><p>  If you believe the Indian myths, then a few millennia ago the Vanaras lived in this place - people like monkeys.  Their kingdom was called Kishkindha, and where the village of Hampi is now located, the capital was located.  Archaeologists have come to the conclusion that the village was founded much earlier than the majestic city of Vijayanagara - the very one which thousands of tourists from all countries rush to the ruins of today.  No one knows for sure whether the inhabitants of ancient Hampi had monkey heads ... India is always full of mysteries and there is no rational answer to questions about being.  But with the city of Vijayanagara, everything is more or less clear.  It was founded in the middle of the XIV century and for two hundred years played the role of the capital of the last great empire in the south of Hindustan.  In the 16th century, Vijayanagara was destroyed by Islamic conquerors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="India Attractions Photos and Description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/595260.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Ancient city </h2><p>  The small village of Hampi is located in the heart of the ruins of an ancient metropolis.  Because of this, she became associated with Vajayanagara - the capital of the empire.  Even on the UNESCO list, temple complexes and the ruins of the city are listed as ‚ÄúMonuments of Hampi (India)‚Äù.  In addition, the village continues to be an important religious place of worship for devout Hindus.  The ancient temple of Virupaksha is still valid today.  Founded in 1336, Vajayanagara reached its peak of development by the middle of the 16th century.  And in 1565, he, and the whole empire, was captured by Muslim sultans.  The place for the construction of the capital was not accidental: giant boulders served as excellent building material.  And strategically, the ancient Vajayanagara was protected by the Tungabhadra River on the one hand, and on the other by high hills. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Historic Monuments of Hampi </h2><p>  Muslim rulers deliberately, for religious reasons, harmed the monuments of the ancient capital.  Since the Koran forbids religious images, and the polytheism of Hindus was revered for idol worship, many temples and murtis (giant statues) were destroyed.  But in the XVI century there was no dynamite, so the city remained.  The Islamic conquest of South India did not last long.  The northern neighbor was forced to retreat, but the population of the city did not return to their desecrated temples.  Now the village of Hampi (India) has only two thousand local residents.  And in the middle of the XVI century, the city had half a million people - a real metropolis of the Middle Ages!  And now the ruins of former power are spread over 26 square kilometers.  Only a list of all the attractions of the ancient city will take a lot of time.  Here you will find the temple of Acyutarai, and the royal scales, and the statue of Narasimha.  Reviews are advised to meet the sunset on Matanga Hill and visit the archaeological museum in Kamalapur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hampi city" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/595310.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Practical recommendations: how to get </h2><p>  The city of Hampi (some think so, although this is a village) is located 353 km from Bangalore.  The administrative center of the Hospet district lies thirteen kilometers from the village.  The nearest airport is Bellary, 75 km from Hampi.  He takes planes from a larger city, Bangalore.  Hospet has a train station and a bus station where transport from Goa, Hyderabad and Bellary arrive.  Since the roads in India are very bumpy, traveling by train will be more convenient (a ticket from Bangalore will cost 750 rupees).  From the district center to Hampi can be reached by bus.  The fare in it is 15 rupees.  But if you arrive at the railway station, you need to get to the bus station, which is one and a half kilometers away.  It is much more convenient to take a tuk-tuk (about a hundred rupees). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hampi tour" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/595282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  The map of Hampi shows that most of the territory of the <span>modern village</span> is located on the other side of the river, in the Virupapurg area.  Almost the lion's share of hotels and guesthouses are located there.  The museum complex can only be reached by motor boat (the ferry is located at the local market).  The cost of transportation across the river is small - only 15 rupees - but the boats run only until six in the evening.  If you hesitate, you have to go on a tuk-tuk to the nearest bridge.  Such a journey of 40 km will get you at a nightly rate of 500-600 rupees. </p><h2>  How to get around Hampi (India) </h2><p>  The photos represent the open-air museum as a giant venue.  Seeing everything in one or even two days for your two is simply unrealistic.  If you have at least minimal driving skills, rent a scooter.  A trip like this will cost you 200 rupees with your used gasoline.  You can put behind you an individual local guide who will show you the way to the most interesting places.  At the entrance you will be offered to rent a bicycle.  Note: the terrain is hilly, and the temperature in the daytime is around +30.  Another option is knock knock.  Arrange a price rickshaw right away, and discuss the duration of its services.  The usual price is around 500 rupees per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hampi Map" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/595301.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Do not be afraid to independently understand the basics of local culture.  This is India: attractions, photos and descriptions of objects are duplicated in English, so there should not be any big difficulties in understanding.  But if you are not confident in your capabilities, hire a better official guide from a travel agency.  The cost of his services is strictly fixed: for four hours of work 500 rupees, for eight - 800. But even those of our compatriots who rest on Goa have the opportunity to visit Hampi.  The excursion can be either one-day or two-day.  A 500-kilometer-long road will be covered by minivans or large air-conditioned buses.  All the time tourists will be accompanied by a Russian-speaking guide. </p>
