Almost everyone has lush tropical forests, mountain ranges and even smoking volcanoes, as well as sandy beaches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bali-indonesia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indonesia beach vacation" class="if uuid-3240923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3240923.jpg"></div><p>  So, which resort to choose for a vacation in Indonesia?  The best place many consider the island of Bali.  On its territory are the most famous resorts of the country.  Many believe that Bali is a real paradise.  Here you can escape from your problems and enjoy all the charms.  The peculiarity of the island is in close proximity to tropical thickets with sandy beaches.  The most famous resorts of Bali, tourists consider Seminyak and Kutu. </p><p>  The latter, by the way, is considered the largest resort of the island.  Kuta is of interest to young people and those people who want to have fun.  Tourists note that the beaches of Kuta are very comfortable.  But not all places are suitable for swimming.  The coastal waters are very turbulent, so there are often waves due to strong currents.  For this reason, the resort was chosen by surfers.  But shopping lovers are not bored here.  Local stores regularly conduct sales. </p><p>  If you want to find an all-inclusive vacation in Indonesia, you should pay attention to Seminyak.  Respectable tourists come here.  The resort has a lot of entertainment, as in Kut, but the prices are higher and the conditions are much better. </p><p>  It is worth recalling another resort.  Sanur is another famous holiday destination.  The resort's beach is large.  Its length reaches five kilometers.  On the coast, you can safely swim with children, because it is protected by reefs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacations to Indonesia are the best" class="if uuid-3240927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3240927.jpg"></div><p>  The most fashionable resort of the island is Nusa Dua, located on the Bukit Peninsula.  Everything is created for a luxurious vacation - chic restaurants, tropical gardens, pools and shopping centers.  There are no noisy merchants on the local beaches, and the sea is clean and warm.  But you can swim in it only in the morning and in the evening, because in the afternoon the water leaves. </p><h2>  Reviews about Bali </h2><p>  According to tourists, among the islands for holidays in Indonesia, most often travelers choose Bali.  Its resorts are beautifully appointed and offer plenty of entertainment.  In addition, here you can find not only fashionable establishments, but also more budget places.  Tourists are invariably delighted by the beautiful sandy beaches and lush vegetation.  It is not for nothing that Bali was called the paradise island. </p><p>  The best hotels on the island are located on the coast.  Such establishments have their own beaches.

You can get to the island only as part of the tour. </p><p>  Many people know the island of Borneo.  But it is not very favorable for visiting due to the unstable situation.  Previously, it was of interest to lovers of ancient monuments. </p><p>  Java is probably the most visited after Bali.  It is cultural.  the political and administrative center of Indonesia.  On its territory there are two active volcanoes, temple complexes and a national reserve. </p><p>  According to tourists, the most famous resort of the island is Bogor.  The city attracts with its natural landscapes and cultural attractions.  No less famous is the mountain resort of Bandug with its hot springs and tea plantations. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  According to reviews, a vacation in Indonesia is very comfortable.  Not the last role in this is played by the excellent hotels of the country.  Tourists note that local hotels are very comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alilahotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indonesia islands for holidays" class="if uuid-3240936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3240936.jpg"></div><p>  They fully meet the stated stardom.  At local resorts you will find 3 *, 4 * and 5 * hotels.  By the way, many fives have a deluxe level.  In all hotels you will appreciate the cleanliness and comfort.  It is not customary to drink tap water.  Bottled water is provided for guests.  There are hotels in the country's resorts that offer all-inclusive meals.

In Jakarta, for example, you can find accommodation for every taste: mini-hotels, hostels, guest houses.  Among the hotel complexes there are establishments belonging to the famous international chains.  At local resorts, villas, cottages and bungalows are in demand.  By the way, in Bali you can even stay at the campsite.  In general, the choice of housing depends on your preferences and financial capabilities. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Indonesia is a world of exoticism and entertainment.  At local resorts, tourists can find a variety of entertainment.  In Bali, the main centers of nightlife are concentrated.  The most famous resort in this regard is Kuta.  Bars, clubs and restaurants are open until morning.  Kuta is considered a youth recreation center. </p><p>  People fly to Indonesia primarily for a beach holiday.  Stunning beaches with white and black sand, tropical greenery and reefs attract thousands of tourists.  Resorts for divers are no less attractive.  After all, there is an amazing opportunity to admire the picturesque corals of the Indian and Pacific Ocean.  Very beautiful underwater gardens.  Divers usually seek to visit the island of Sulawesi, which has a marine reserve.  Experienced tourists also recommend visiting Jakarta, the island of Sanur, Lombok, Padang Bay.  These places have long been chosen by divers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventurewomen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Indonesia when it is better to go" class="if uuid-3240943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3240943.jpg"></div><p>  Indonesia resorts are good for surfers, as there are big waves on the islands throughout the archipelago.  Most often, for surfing, choose the coast of the islands of Java, Sumatra and Bali.  For real professionals, there are very interesting places where not everyone will be able to curb the wave. </p><p>  According to tourists, the most interesting for guests of the resorts are numerous attractions.  There are a lot of them on every island.  Tourists have a choice: visit national parks or focus on architecture.  The culture and nature of Indonesia is an inexhaustible source of positive emotions. </p><h2>  Reviews about holidays in Indonesia 2018 </h2><p>  Most of them are enthusiastic.  The only experienced travelers recommend paying attention to the season.  For a vacation in Indonesia is not suitable every month of the year.  Regular rains and high humidity are not for everyone.  True, it is worthwhile to understand that significant humidity is the daily realities of the entire archipelago, which is associated with the peculiarities of the local climate. </p><p>  As for reviews about holidays in local resorts, they can be safely called controversial.  Among the tourists there are people who remain in love with Indonesia, and those whom she disappointed.  The first disappointment concerns the beaches.  Some travelers believe that it is better not to choose Bali, but other islands.  The popular resort is crowded with guests and local merchants who are too intrusive.  During the ebb-tide on the coast throws a lot of garbage that does not fit with the fabulous scenery.  Unfortunately, this problem is typical for many resorts in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bali-indonesia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Indonesia in May reviews" class="if uuid-3240919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3240919.jpg"></div><p>  The local population lives very modestly.  The main source of income is tourists.  Therefore, merchants are trying to sell you anything.  This is not very pleasant, but you can not pay to such trifles.  But in Indonesia, you can admire the stunning nature and active volcanoes.  Tourists do not recommend contacting street agents who offer trips.  Here you are definitely deceived. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you do not pay attention to the minor flaws of resorts that are available around the world, then we can draw the following conclusion: Indonesia is very attractive in all respects for tourists who love exotic.  Come and see for yourself! </p>
