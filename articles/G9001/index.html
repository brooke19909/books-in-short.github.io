    <h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  The first settlements on the Uvod River appeared at the beginning of the 14th century.  It is believed that the village of Ivanovo is named after the famous John the Baptist.  In 1871, it was annexed to the Ascension Posad.  As a result, a new city arose - Ivanovo-Voznesensk.  It has long been a center of light industry.  It was here, at one of the textile manufactories, that the first steam engine appeared. </p><p>  Many of Ivanov‚Äôs sights are connected with the revolutionary activity of the working people of the city.  Spontaneous riots and strikes of workers dissatisfied with working conditions often flashed here.  Due to this, in 1905 the first Council of Workers' Deputies was formed here. </p><p>  Ivanovo sights, photos and descriptions of which are in all advertising booklets of travel agencies organizing trips to this city, should begin to be examined from the Monument to the fighters of the revolution.  It was installed in 1975 on the Revolution Square.  According to art critics, the composition is ambiguous.  It consists of two parts.  The first is a dark rectangle symbolizing prison casemates, from which fire breaks out - a symbol of revolution.  And inside the granite monument - illuminated crystal, very reminiscent of a beating heart. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second part of the monument is a sculptural group and is called ‚ÄúRaising the Banner‚Äù.  The team that created the monument (artist M. Milyutin, architect E. Kutyrev and sculptor D. Ryabichev) was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1978. </p><p>  The sights of Ivanov are a lot of museums, ancient churches, houses of manufacturers, magnificent estates.  In addition, the unique beauty of nature should be noted.  Thick spruce and pine forests, birch oak groves and groves create an atmosphere of romanticism and mystery, give the feeling of a fairy tale and give a little mystical touch to these places. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Ivanovo and Ivanovo region.  Monasteries </h2><p>  History buffs are encouraged to start exploring the sights of Ivanov from the Holy Vvedensky Monastery.  <span>The Vvedenskaya church of</span> this complex is located on Bazisnaya street, 23. By the way, at any kiosk selling printed products, you can buy a map of the city, which lists all the sights of Ivanovo with addresses. </p><p>  This temple was decided to be built at the gathering of residents of Ushakovo and the Pit in 1900.  Land for construction was provided by Count Sergei Dmitrievich Sheremetyev.  In those days, he owned many lands in Ushakovo.  In the spring of 1901, the solemn laying of the temple in Ivanovo took place.  Sights, photos of which can be seen in this article, replenished with a new exhibit.  The church was built on private donations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Six years later, in the summer of 1907, construction was completed.  The temple was consecrated by Archbishop of Vladimir Nikolai. </p><p>  The design of the church clearly shows the motives of Byzantine architecture.  A three-tier iconostasis was installed, made in the workshop of A.I. Shirokov.  The floor is covered with metlah tiles. </p><p>  In 1909, a two-story house was built in the courtyard of the complex, which in its appearance resembled 17th-century <span>boyars' chambers</span> .  It housed the apartments of the watchmen and prosphora.  The entire territory of the temple was surrounded by a metal fence with three gates. </p><p>  In 1938, the religious building was closed.  Divine services were resumed only in 1989.  It should be noted that the return of the temple to the parishioners was accompanied by tragic events.  Four women went on a hunger strike and spent 11 days and nights on the porch of the church, demanding an immediate solution to the issue of returning the temple. </p><p>  In March 1991, the Holy Vvedensky Convent was opened here, and the construction of monastic buildings began on its territory. </p><p>  The city of Ivanovo, the sights of which, as a rule, have no centuries-old history, nevertheless, tourists are interested in its more ‚Äúyoung‚Äù buildings. </p>

    <h2>  Holy Assumption Monastery </h2><p>  This monastery was built with the blessing of Patriarch Alexy II in May 1998. </p><p>  At the end of the 18th century in the southeast of Ivanovo was the Assumption Cemetery.  In 1815, a wooden church was transferred to this land from the <span>Pokrovsky monastery.</span>  A little later, a bell tower appeared, created in the style of classicism by the architect Petrov.  In 1924, the temple was transferred to the Renovationists, and in 1933 the cemetery was destroyed.  In its place, an amusement park of the Melange Plant was arranged.  Citizens often call this place "the park of the living and the dead."  The church was transferred to the Ivanovo Electric Networks, after which it was rebuilt and changed beyond recognition. </p><p>  After the church was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1995, a community began to gather here, choosing the monastic path for itself. </p><p>  The construction of a new temple can be called a nationwide affair.  Both parishioners and philanthropists took part in it, including famous people such as Nikita Mikhalkov, <span>Andrey Bykov,</span> Mikhail Chepel. </p><p>  The monastery takes pilgrims.  Everyone can come here and stay for three days. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  As you know, this city is inextricably linked with the textile industry.  During the Patriotic War, local enterprises practically clothed and shod the entire Soviet Army.  Therefore, it is quite natural that acquaintance with him often begins with the <span>Museum of Ivanovo Chintz.</span>  It is located in the mansion of the manufacturer D. G. Burygin.  The building was designed by architect A.F. Snurilov.  This building has a complex architectural layout - carved doors, decorative tiles, stained-glass windows and other original decor elements.  Some exhibition halls, a library, stock rooms are located in the building of a carriage shed in the courtyard.  It was built in 1914.  Unfortunately, the name of the architect is unknown. </p>

    <p>  The central exposition of the museum tells about the history of Ivanovo textiles, about how this production was born in the Ivanovo region.  Here you can see a unique collection of fabrics, which began to form back in the late 19th century. </p><p>  Locals are very hospitable.  They are proud of their city.

    <p>  The museum‚Äôs employees are especially proud of the collection of Russian art of the 18‚Äì20th centuries.  It includes more than five hundred paintings and drawings by such outstanding masters as Aivazovsky, Repin, Shishkin, Surikov, Polenov, Levitan and others. </p><p>  In addition, the museum houses one of the best Russian collections of Palekh and Kholuy.  Here you can buy the album of the city of Ivanovo.  Attractions, photos and names are indicated in it in great detail. </p><h2>  Museum of Military Transport Aviation </h2><p>  Many mistakenly believe that all the sights of Ivanov are associated exclusively with the textile industry.  This is far from the case.  A museum of military transport aviation is located on the territory of the combat training center for the flight personnel of the Severny garrison. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo sights photos and description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/471013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building in which it is located has historical value - the legendary Normandy-Niemen fighter squadron was formed here. </p><p>  Today, the museum exposition is presented at the airport and in the exhibition halls.  She acquaints visitors with the history of formations and regiments of military transport aviation.  You can see aircraft models, historical photos, maps, interesting documents. </p><h2>  What to see for children </h2><p>  Ivanovo authorities took care of the small residents and guests of the city.  Attractions for children are primarily the zoo, the circus and the Impromptu Children's Theater under the direction of Lyudmila Ivanovna Ivanova, People's Artist of Russia. </p><h2>  Impromptu Theater </h2><p>  This is a musical theater.  The performances always sound live music.  There are twenty artists in the troupe.  The directors of the theater are V. Bayscher and N. Timofeeva.  Composer - V. Friedman. </p><p>  Nowadays, when more and more action films and horror stories are shown on television more and more often than children‚Äôs films and cartoons, in the theater of L. I. Ivanova you can always see wonderful Russian fairy tales - the embodiment of folk wisdom.  They teach kindness, empathy for the fate of heroes. </p><h2>  Ivanovo Zoo </h2><p>  Arriving in the city with children, do not forget to visit the zoo.  It is located on Leningradskaya Street.  From the city center you can walk to it in 20 minutes.  In the collection of the zoo are artiodactyls, primates, predators, rodents, birds.  Despite the fact that there are many animals, they all look very well-groomed, clean, well-fed.

    <h2>  Circus </h2><p>  The building was built in 1983.  At first it was designed for three thousand places.  The project of this building was first published in 1931.  Architect - S. A. Minofiev.  A wooden hemispherical dome with a diameter of 50 meters was built in two years.  In February 1933, the circus received its first visitors. </p><p>  In 1975, by decision of the Ivanovo State Council, the old building was blown up.  In its place, a new circus was built in the style of typical Soviet architecture.  It seats 1700 spectators. </p><p>  Children's Theater, Zoo, Ivanovo Circus - attractions (reviews of young guests only confirm this), a visit to which will give the children a real pleasure. </p><h2>  Cities of the Ivanovo region </h2><p>  I must say that this is a very small region of Russia.  The main of its cities is, of course, Ivanovo, about which we have already talked a lot.  A distinctive feature of the region is the glory of the "textile land". </p><p>  The most famous and visited place is Ples.  In those days when Levitan sang it, it was a provincial town of the Nerekht district of the Kostroma region.  In the 19th century, this city was the main port of the textile region.  He later gained fame as a resort town.  Artists and summer residents mastered it back in imperial times. </p><p>  The reach is very picturesque - representatives of creative professions appreciate the unusual relief of the banks of the Volga in these places.  Today it is the cruise capital of the Ivanovo region.  In this small provincial town, a well-groomed promenade, clean streets.
