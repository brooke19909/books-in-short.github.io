At the beginning of 2015, <span>the</span> bank‚Äôs <span>regional network</span> included over 28 representative offices. </p><h2>  Company Overview </h2><p>  CJSC JSCB RUSSLAVBANK is a universal financial organization.  The main thing when working with clients is an individual approach, solving problems in accordance with the needs of individuals and SME representatives who apply to a specific network division.  Such goals are set by the Contact Bank. </p>

    <p>  The addresses of the offices and representative offices of this financial institution can be easily found if desired.  However, it should be borne in mind that information about some regional representatives of the company, indicated on the official website of the bank, is rarely updated.  In this regard, some customers who visited the nearest branch at the address where the Contact Bank should be located (Moscow) are faced with a very unpleasant phenomenon - there is no office there. </p><h2>  The most demanded services of Contact Bank </h2><p>  The institution specializes in operations such as: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  private lending; </li><li>  sending and receiving transfers; </li><li>  servicing individuals and business owners; </li><li>  work with deposit accounts of the population; </li><li>  issue of plastic cards valid on the territory of Russia and abroad; </li><li>  servicing operations with issued bank cards. </li></ul><p>  By contacting Contact Bank, you can also use other services, such as: </p><ul><li>  operations with bills; </li><li>  depositary operations; </li><li>  remote banking service. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank Contact Moscow" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32091/754251.jpg" width="450"></div></li></ul><h2>  Head office location </h2><p>  The main unit of CJSC JSCB RUSSLAVBANK is located in the Russian capital.  Kontakt Bank (Moscow) is engaged in attracting free funds of <span>individuals</span> in deposits, credit and bill transactions, sending and receiving money transfers. </p><p>  You can find the central office of the bank at the address: 111049, Moscow, st.  Donskaya, house 14, 2nd building.  Phone for information: 8 (495) 627-57-57. </p><h2>  Quality of service in offices related to the Contact Bank network </h2><p>  Reviews of company visitors are quite diverse.  Many customers are satisfied with the level of banking service of CJSC JSCB RUSSLAVBANK.  The quality of service on deposit operations (opening deposits to individuals) is excellently evaluated.  Customers are very pleased with the interest rates on term deposits offered by Contact Bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Employees of this financial institution deserved reviews with a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign.  Many clients write about the attentive attitude and professionalism of bank employees, about the competence and efficiency of office staff. </p><h2>  Features of bank operations for money transfers </h2><p>  CJSC JSCB RUSSLAVBANK is known, first of all, for a transfer system with the same name.  CONTACT payment system was founded in 1999.  There were no such banking agents in Russia before.  CONTACT transfer system, which does not require opening accounts for individuals, is still considered one of the simplest, most convenient and reliable banking systems to this day.  We‚Äôll try to find out how customers evaluate the ‚ÄúContact‚Äù translation themselves. </p>

    <p>  Banks provide private individuals with the opportunity to send money unaddressed to almost all settlements of the Russian Federation.  To obtain information on whether a particular bank carries out operations to send and receive such transfers is quite simple.  Data on this is contained in official sources (on the bank's website).  Or you can just visit one of the nearest banks and ask the staff working in the operating room about whether the company has an agreement with ZAO RUSSLAVBANK to make such transfers.  In banks that accept and pay money using the Contact system, there is always an advertisement with the payment logo of this system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  User opinions of the CONTACT translation system </h2><p>  Of course, not all customers are satisfied with how Contact Bank works.  Reviews are also unflattering, they often come from senders and recipients of funds that were dissatisfied with the work of the payment system.  Most often, customers voice the following negative information about the bank: </p><ul><li>  Money delivery by transfer to the former Soviet republics, as well as from neighboring countries to Russia, takes too long.  Money is not paid to the recipient right away - many banks require their customers to submit a preliminary application for a certain amount of <span>money in cash.</span> <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Contact Bank Credit" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/754971.jpg" width="576"></div></li><li>  When sending transfers abroad to some of the addresses indicated in the base of the payment system, there are only post offices, and there are no cash points for contact systems.  Therefore, the money does not reach the destination, and the cost of the commission paid to the sender is not returned. </li><li>  It is impossible to send a ruble transfer from the Russian Federation to Ukraine, since the banks of this state refuse to work with Russian currency.  The sender will be asked to forward the transfer in euros or dollars. </li><li>  You can return the sent transfer only at the bank institution where the paperwork was made.  Funds transferred through electronic terminals will not be returned to the sender, since these payment devices only send payments and transfers. </li></ul><h2>  CJSC JSCB RUSSLAVBANK: features of the issuance of credit funds </h2><p>  What are the conditions for obtaining loans at Contact Bank?  Credit, as you know, is one of the main services provided by the company to individuals and businessmen.  Currently, the bank offers its customers many interesting programs.  Any citizen of Russia aged 25 to 75 can get a loan.  A mandatory requirement is the availability of a residence permit or temporary registration in the region where the bank offices are located.  All applicants to one of the Contact Bank representative offices will be able to become borrowers, provided that they have a certain work experience (total - at least 12 months, in the last place - at least 4 months).  Applicants who are on well-deserved rest and receive a pension in the region where Contact Bank is located will also be able to get a loan. </p>

    <p>  A loan of up to 600 thousand rubles can be issued very quickly - on the day the applicant appeals to a financial institution.  The maximum term of a loan agreement is 60 months.  The interest rate is set by the borrower individually.  From the documents you need only a passport.  The remaining papers are provided at will (certificates confirming receipt of a stable income, and a photocopy of the work book). </p><h2>  Opinions of former <span>bank</span> borrowers <span>: reviews</span> with a plus sign </h2><ul><li>  Borrowers have an excellent opportunity to extend the terms of a loan agreement drawn up at ZAO RUSSLAVBANK CJSC, as well as restructure debt on a loan from another financial institution.  The loan term and the terms of the new obligation are negotiated with the borrower individually. </li><li>  Even individuals who do not have Russian citizenship can get small loans from the bank.  Short-term loans in the amount of 10 to 30 thousand rubles are issued in the presence of a passport, migration card and a document confirming the registration of the borrower (permanent or temporary) in our country.  In addition, the client needs to confirm the fact of their employment. </li></ul><h2>  Opinions of former <span>bank</span> borrowers <span>: reviews</span> with a minus sign </h2><ul><li>  Clients most often complain about SMS mailings provided by Contact Bank.  Negative reviews also apply to telephone calls by company employees demanding repayment of non-existent debt.  Numerous letters and complaints from customers indicate that the bank does not comply with the requirements of the law on the personal data of its borrowers. </li><li>  The information on credit products on the organization‚Äôs website is very different from the actual data on interest rates and other conditions for obtaining loans. </li><li>  Not too responsible and solvent customers are faced with rudeness and rudeness of loan officers who systematically call them about making another payment or repaying all the debt. </li><li>  Borrowers are having difficulty paying a loan, since it‚Äôs rather difficult to find contact points for the Contact Bank network (Ufa). </li><li>  Customer reviews suggest that the employees of this financial company in a rather strict form impose a service on insurance of various risks to customers. </li></ul><p>  Let's try to find out what his employees say about the work of this institution. </p><h2>  Reviews of employees of JSCB RUSSLAVBANK with a rating of "5" </h2><p>  Words of gratitude are usually written by employees who have achieved some definite success at work in one of the offices that Contact Bank is rich in.  The reviews of these people make it possible to find out that in the institution everyone can achieve a good career and personal growth with decent pay.  Many company employees believe that they work in a good and friendly team. </p>

    <p>  The management of the institution also earned a positive assessment.  However, this moment is 100% dependent on which office the person is employed in. </p><p>  Work in a financial company allows you to combine core business with study.  There are no problems with the provision of holidays and time off. </p><h2>  Reviews of employees of JSCB RUSSLAVBANK with a rating of "2" </h2><p>  Employees who have already left Contact Bank have a completely different opinion.  Reviews about the bank reveal the following shortcomings. </p><ul><li>  During an interview, a potential bank employee cannot obtain reliable information about the conditions of their employment (place of work due to payment). </li><li>  Quite often, the company dismisses employees allegedly ‚Äúof their own free will‚Äù without paying compensation. </li><li>  The management of the institution without notice to employees makes them lower wages, deprives bank employees of bonuses.  Many employees believe that management should be softer towards their subordinates - do not go too far in relation to punishment. </li></ul><p>  At the time of employment, you should carefully familiarize yourself with all the clauses of the employment contract. </p><h2>  Bank Call Center </h2><p>  Customers who encounter problems with making payments are trying to find out the details of the banking operations they are interested in using the available phone numbers.  However, they cannot get through as these numbers are non-working.  Those who are more fortunate often encounter overt rudeness of Call-center employees.  Having heard a certain phrase, for example, ‚Äúsent a transfer‚Äù, a bank employee switches to another number, after which the connection is simply interrupted. </p>

    <h2>  The action of the electronic wallet "Contact 24" </h2><p>  This type of service is an alternative to numerous foreign wallets such as WebMoney and Qiwi.  The developer of the electronic settlement tool is Contact Bank. </p><p>  User reviews of the domestic wallet indicate that this service is quite popular and in demand by our compatriots.  Many begin to use it out of curiosity, and then completely abandon other methods of payment for services and goods.  In order to ensure maximum security of operations conducted using Contact 24, an identification should be made on the corresponding website. </p><p>  From the negative points: Internet customers say that it‚Äôs not easy to figure out which site you should go to when you need to use this payment method.  The fact is that the online service ‚ÄúContact 24‚Äù and the Contact payment system itself place information on various sites.  In addition, it can be difficult to deal with the situation when the money sent by the client does not go to the account where they should be credited, because the connection with the bank is not very well established. </p><p>  It should be noted that this is by no means a complete list of services that Contact Bank provides to individuals and business owners.  Feedback on deposits, credit transactions, transfers and cash services help potential customers make the right decision.  However, do not forget that how many people have so many opinions, so the choice is always yours! </p>
