It is considered one of the oldest in this territory and has a rich and eventful history.  The modern state is divided into 12 administrative areas, each of which has its own center.  Recently, the choice of tourists more often falls precisely in Uzbekistan.  Andijan - this is what city attracts their attention! </p><h2>  The location of the city and its population </h2><p>  Andijan is located in the eastern part of the Ferghana Valley, surrounded by picturesque mountains and hills, there is a subtropical climate, thanks to which favorable conditions have been formed for the cultivation of "white gold" - cotton.  In a surprisingly hospitable country (Uzbekistan), Andijan occupies the 3rd place by area (its territory is 120 km <sup>2</sup> ) and the 4th place by population.  The city is the administrative center of Andijan region. </p>

The most common religion is Sunni Islam, but in the city there are a sufficient number of churches of various Christian denominations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The economic development of the city </h2><p>  For many indicators (namely: cotton production, gas export, gold mining, etc.), the Republic of Uzbekistan occupies a leading place in the global economy.

    <h2>  What does modern Andijan look like? </h2><p>  Every year it becomes more beautiful, modern buildings are being built instead of obsolete buildings, new schools and colleges are opening, and with the development of small business, the whole city is literally buried in numerous shops, hotels, beauty salons, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  What does the oldest city of the Republic of Uzbekistan Andijan look like?  It can be conditionally divided into two parts: it is the Old City, where ancient monuments (mosques, workshops and cultural monuments) have been preserved, and the territory of the New Bazaar, which adjoins all of modern Andijan.  Citizens believe that it is here, in the area called "Eski Shahar", is the heart of the city.  The whole day the noise of loud sellers of oriental goods does not fade away at this place, here at every step there are cozy cafes and canteens offering travelers traditional Uzbek dishes, and one more novelty is a huge number of ticket offices.  It is not surprising, because many residents leave for neighboring countries in search of work, so it is not difficult to buy a ticket for Uzbekistan (Andijan has its own airport). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights and cultural monuments </h2><p>  The state of Uzbekistan has the most ancient, interesting and exciting history in Central Asia.  Andijan is exactly the city that managed to preserve some cultural monuments.  To this day, they tell tourists about the former glory and grandeur of the Mughal empire once known to the whole world.  Of course, there are not many ancient structures in Andijan, such as, for example, in Samarkand or Bukhara, but those attractions that have been preserved are worth coming to this sunny city for their sake! </p>

    <p>  The most interesting monuments are mosques and madrassas, decorated with domes and stars, as required by the canons of the Islamic religion.  The oldest Friday mosque is located in the Old Town area and dates from the 18th century.  Another attraction is the Jami minaret, its height is more than 32 meters (this is the tallest building in the whole city). </p><p>  The city is famous for its amusement parks, which have a large number of attractions.  The most visited is the park to them.  A.S. Pushkin, it is located in the city center and is a favorite place not only for children but also for adults. </p>
