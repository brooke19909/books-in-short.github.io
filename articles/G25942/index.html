  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marx Square in Novosibirsk: history, infrastructure, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital of Siberia is considered the most beautiful city in the region.  The metropolis, spread on the banks of the Ob River, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 505 square kilometers.  The main transport arteries converge in several infrastructure nodes.  Karl Marx Square in Novosibirsk is the main logistics center of the left bank. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.9812817" data-lng="82.89644169999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/6/2/7/5627.png"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Until the middle of the last century, only the right bank of the Ob was actively built up.  Authorities, cultural and educational facilities, and educational institutions were concentrated there.  The situation was changed by the Great Patriotic War.  Then, trains with machines, equipment of evacuated enterprises began to arrive in the regional center.  Shops of new plants were built on the left bank.  Around industrial facilities grew working quarters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nevsedoma.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marx Square in front of WWII" class="if uuid-2626707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2626707.jpg"></div><p>  The enterprises of the Leninsky and Kirovsky districts required an uninterrupted supply of materials.  New roads were built for this.  The strategic highways of the left bank converged on Marx Square in Novosibirsk.  Over time, the importance of recreation only increased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  The main roads intersecting the left bank with other areas of the city intersect at Marx Square in Novosibirsk: </p><ul><li>  Titova Street leads to Stanislavsky Square, from where you can get to the large South-Western housing estate, Tolmachevo Airport. </li><li>  Marx Avenue leads to the Communal Bridge.  Here, the Ob divides the Lenin and October districts of the city. </li><li>  It is easy to reach the Dimitrovsky Bridge along Blucher Street.  Immediately after it, the highways leading to the Central, Dzerzhinsky districts, to the railway station begin. </li><li>  Sibiryakov-Gvardeytsev Street connects recreation with another important industrial zone.  In the Kirov region there are large factories, Zatulinsky, North Chem housing estates. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pk25.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transport interchange on Marx Square" class="if uuid-2626730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2626730.jpg"></div><h2>  Passenger Logistics </h2><p>  Novosibirsk Marx Square is the largest passenger flow distribution center.  It has 7 public transport stops.  The routes of two trams, five trolley buses, sixty-seven buses, and sixteen taxis pass through the logistics hub. </p><p>  The appearance of the letter "M" on the Marx Square of Novosibirsk was eagerly awaited by residents of the left-bank regions.  The opening of the subway station in the summer of 1991 made life easier for half a million citizens, who had to spend hours getting to work by storming crowded buses.  An electric train comfortably delivers passengers to the city center in just 30 minutes.  From there, metro lines lead to the Kalininsky and Dzerzhinsky districts, to the station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Shopping Center </h2><p>  Back in the Soviet era, the city authorities decided to make the logistics hub the main trading cluster of the left bank.  In the fall of 1979, he received the first buyers of the GUM "Russia", located at the address: Marx Square, 1, in Novosibirsk.  This was a significant event.  The five-story complex with spacious halls and escalators impressed the townspeople.  Not far from GUM, a branch of the famous "Birch" was opened, the jewelry boutique "Crystal" began to work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dooh.xyz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="GUM building in Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-2626746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2626746.jpg"></div><p>  During the years of perestroika, the largest clothing market was formed here, second only to the famous flea market on Volochaevskaya Street, where shuttles from all over Siberia were selling.  The era of wild trade ended in the summer of 2005. The containers and stalls were removed.  Merchants settled in the premises of the multi-storey building of the Alexandrovsky shopping center.  In the vacated place, active construction began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TC &quot;Versailles&quot; on Marx Square" class="if uuid-2626756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2626756.jpg"></div><p>  At the time of the commercial boom, investors willing to finance promising projects were enough.  Therefore, shopping centers began to open one after another.  In addition to the already mentioned facilities, Omega Plaza, Sun City, Versailles, and Granit Shopping Center operate here. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Today Marx Square in Novosibirsk looks great.  But it was not always so.  In the Soviet era, it was often called a monument to long-term construction.  Two large unfinished buildings, fenced with gray concrete fences, spoiled the landscape.  The construction of the Sibselmash recreation center was completed by a new investor who turned a potential cultural center into a profitable shopping center.  Another symbol of the era of socialism has been in an unfinished state for exactly half a century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="backdor.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Tourist&quot;" class="if uuid-2626763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2626763.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer of 1968, work began on the preparation of the foundation for the Tourist Hotel.  A comfortable hotel with a cinema hall, a restaurant, high-speed elevators was to become a model institution.  The construction of the panel box of the 17-story building was completed in 1979. However, it turned out that the quicksand under the structure reduces the bearing capacity of the foundation.  To strengthen the structure requires a large amount of concrete.  The construction was stopped.  Several times the question was raised about the completion of the hotel.  But every time it didn‚Äôt reach the realization of the projects.  The prospects of the object are best determined by the paraphrased winged expression - "you can‚Äôt finish building." </p><div class="photo" data-original="nskbezkupur.nethouse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to A. Pokryshkin" class="if uuid-2626778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2626778.jpg"></div><p>  The square in front of the Omega Plaza adorns the monument to the most famous native of the city - Air Marshal A. Pokryshkin.  The fearless pilot, whose name terrified the aces of the Luftwaffe, completed 650 sorties in four years of the Second World War and shot down 65 enemy aircraft.  The bronze statue of the hero is placed on a 6-meter pedestal.  At the feet of Pokryshkin, an eagle spread its wings - a symbol of military glory. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It will be useful for tourists to find out some interesting information about this picturesque place in the capital of Siberia: </p><ul><li>  Citizens are sometimes called recreation with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo towers.  One of them is the unfinished Tourist Hotel.  Another object is a water unit built of red brick in 1939. </li><li>  The interiors of the Marx Square metro station in Novosibirsk are decorated with marble and red granite.  The outlines of the relief decoration resemble the contours of the Kremlin wall. </li><li>  The logistics center serves more than 100 thousand passengers daily. </li></ul><p>  The importance of recreation for the city is difficult to overestimate.  Here, freight and passenger flows are formed, allowing the metropolis to actively live and develop. </p>
