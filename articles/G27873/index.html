The company got its current name thanks to the main shareholder Oleg Tinkov, who owns 68% of the shares.  Until 2006, the bank was called Khimmashbank.

    <p>  Tinkoff <span>Credit Systems, a</span> review of which an increasing number of people are interested in, works with its customers using advanced technologies, that is, through the Internet.  At the moment, there are no branches of the Tinkoff Credit Systems bank.  Service takes place exclusively via the Internet or by phone.  It is worth noting that this method of service significantly facilitates contacting the bank.  However, this system is not clear to everyone, for example, many middle-aged people still consider service via the Internet to be very unsteady. </p><p>  But even taking into account this nuance, the number <span>of bank customers has</span> already amounted to more than 2 </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank credit systems reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12725/84615.jpg" width="600"></div>  million people.  The method of servicing via the Network and telephone clearly indicates the target audience with which the bank would like to work.  Namely - young and active people who value their time.  It is worth noting that Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank receives various reviews about its <span>work with clients</span> , but all efforts are made to ensure that they turn out to be only positive.

    <p>  The bank only works with the MasterCard payment system.  Lending offers differ in small nuances, such as currency.  However, they all have a grace period of up to 55 days.  Although Tinkoff Credit Systems receives mostly positive feedback on <span>plastic cards</span> , bank customers are advised to be careful and try to monitor the status of their cards on their own.  It is strongly recommended that you use credit cards only when paying for purchases in the store, trying not to cash out money at ATMs.  The Bank, commenting on customer reviews, also notes the need not to rely solely on bank employees, because no one is immune from technical malfunctions in the work, because of which information may not reach you on time. </p><p>  So, if you are ready to use Tinkoff Bank‚Äôs credit plastic card, then you have four offers: MasterCard Gold credit card - World of Books, MasterCard Platinum - Classmates or Tinkoff Platinum, MasterCard World ¬ª-" All Airlines ".  Each of the offers has its own unique bonuses.  For example, discounts on airline tickets or books. </p><p>  Tinkoff Credit Systems has received numerous reviews, however, first of all, contact a consultant who can best find the right credit card.  This will avoid misunderstanding, and, consequently, a negative impression of the bank. </p><p>  There is only one contribution to the Tinkoff Credit Systems bank, reviews of which are striking in its positivity, SmartVkont.  It is universal for all currencies, each of which has its own conditions.  Namely, the interest rate (6-11%), which also depends on the terms of the deposit (from three months). </p><p>  Tinkoff Credit Systems comments on itself with great pleasure and timely corrects nuances that do not suit customers.  The bank is trying to keep up with the times, as we are told by the creation of the Odnoklassniki card.  Many have already chosen Tinkoff, 2 million - a solid figure! </p>
