Has multiple rewards.  During the battles he showed high skill and showed heroism and courage.  He is an honorary citizen of the city of Gomel in Belarus.  Let's get acquainted in more detail with the facts from the life of this outstanding person. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich was born on December 15, 1917 in a peasant family.  He was born in the village of Koshelevo in the Gomel region.  By nationality, Belarusian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artyushenkooleg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golovachev at the beginning and end of a career" class="if uuid-3165729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165729.jpg"></div><p>  In 1936 he graduated from the school of FZU and acquired the profession of a turner.  Today it is vocational school No. 56 of the city of Gomel.  After studying, he worked at the forestry plant as a milling machine operator.  He was fond of football and played in a team, showing good results.  At work, he had a reputation as a qualified specialist. </p><p>  Perhaps he would have successfully developed further in this area.  But near the place of his work was an aeroclub.  Watching the flight of the aircraft, the young man dreamed of being in the cockpit of one of them.  Having set a goal, Pavel Yakovlevich began to achieve it.  During the day he worked, and at night he studied airplane navigation, engine structure and aerodynamics.  He soon began to fly. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  In 1940, Golovachev graduated from the Odessa Military Pilot School with the rank of junior lieutenant.  He was sent there two years earlier.  After studying, Pavel Yakovlevich was distributed in the Crimea.  It was here, in the 168th regiment, that he served when the war broke out.  Participation in the fighting pilot Golovachev began under the settlement of Iasi.  He stormed the Nazi troops on the I-16 fighter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first combat flights were not successful for Pavel Yakovlevich.  He could not bring down any enemy aircraft and nearly died.  He was rescued by a comrade who hit the enemy from the first shot.  Major Yaroslavtsev after the battle pointed out to him the lack of endurance, which was the reason for the failure in the battle.  On the second day, Golovachev shot down the first plane, but was seriously injured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wio.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="War time photo" class="if uuid-3165745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165745.jpg"></div><h2>  69th Odessa Aviation Regiment </h2><p>  Pilot Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich attended the awarding of the heroes of aviation with the Order of the Red Banner.  The event took place in Kirovograd.  These were the pilots of the regiment under the leadership of the hero L. L. Shestakov.  Golovachev met them, and later found out that he remains part of this unit.  The pilot vowed that in the future he would be worthy of the high honor shown to him. </p><p>  In October 1941, Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich was officially transferred to the 69th Odessa Aviation Regiment.  He underwent retraining and acquired LaGG-3 aircraft control skills. </p><h2>  Heroic deeds </h2><p>  In the summer of 1942, Golovachev almost died in an air battle with the fascist Me-109 fighter.  Attacking an enemy aircraft, Pavel Yakovlevich blew it up with its first line of fire.  Carried away by the victory, he did not notice a new danger and was wounded in his right hand.  The armored seatback was a salvation for the pilot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He hardly reached the airfield, but it turned out that it was impossible to release the chassis.  The system has been damaged.  Golovachev put his knees on the control knob and extended the chassis with one surviving hand.  After landing the plane, the pilot got out of the last forces from the cockpit and was immediately sent to the hospital. </p><p>  Golovachev took part in the battles for Stalingrad.  The duty of Soviet aces pilots, among whom was Pavel Yakovlevich, was the destruction of Nazi equipment, delivering ammunition and food to a group of enemies in the environment.  Golovachev successfully coped with the task. </p><p>  The Soviet pilot showed exemplary courage and perseverance in battle.  Having received the order to destroy the enemy FW-189, the pilot rushed to the attack.  Having received a fierce rebuff, he did not give up.  Under fire, risking his life, he made one after another attempts to crack down on the enemy and retreated only when he saw that he had completed the mission. </p><p>  During the battle near Orekhovsky, pilot Pavel Golovachev flew into a column of enemy equipment and shot down one Junkers.  But the enemy managed to shoot the Soviet hero in the face.  The pilot lost consciousness, and the plane began to lose altitude.  Recovering, Golovachev managed to level the car and crashed into the bank of the Don.  Having lost its tail, the plane landed.  As a result of the wound, the pilot lost the opportunity to see.  Dr. Filatov restored his vision, and a month later the hero returned to the place of service.  After the perfect feat, Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and was awarded a high award - the Order of the Red Banner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="m.fishki.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golovachev near the plane" class="if uuid-3165783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165783.jpg"></div><p>  He mastered the Yak-1 and took command of the link.  At the same time, Lieutenant Golovachev for the first time performed the functions of presenter.  During one of the military operations, Shestakov turned the course of the attack in such a way as to enable the new unit commander to try to lead the group.  Golovachev successfully coped with the task and subsequently often performed these duties. </p><p>  In total, in the battles for Stalingrad, Pavel Yakovlevich made 150 flights in which he shot down eight enemy aircraft on his own. </p><h2>  Donbass and Dnieper </h2><p>  As part of the famous 69th regiment, Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich, a Soviet pilot, made a long combat journey.  He also participated in the battles for Donbass.  Here, the pilot shot down six aircraft in fifteen battles. </p><p>  In May 1943, Golovachev in the convoy of Yak-1 fighters entered into battle with a hundred enemy bomber aircraft and sixty fighters.  Soviet pilots managed to show their martial art and destroy forty-two units of enemy equipment, while losing only three of their units.  Golovachev contributed to this by shooting down one plane. </p><p>  In August 1943, a pilot destroyed a bomber and a fighter in one battle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="illustrators.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yak 9th Golovacheva" class="if uuid-3165792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165792.jpg"></div><h2>  Crimea </h2><p>  In Melitopol, Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich fought on the "Aerocobra" and performed the duties of a leading group.  He took part in thirteen air battles and destroyed six more units of fascist technology.  In October 1943, the pilot counted already two hundred twenty-five sorties, ninety-two battles and seventeen personally shot down aircraft.  Statistics spoke of the high skill and great heroism of a military pilot and was the basis for conferring the highest rank to Pavel Yakovlevich Golovachev - Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  On November 1, 1943, he was awarded two awards: the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal.  In the same year, his native lands were liberated from the Nazi invaders. </p><h2>  End of war </h2><p>  In 1944, the hero Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich was already fighting in the skies of the Baltic states and East Prussia.  In December of the same year, taking off, he saw an enemy reconnaissance aircraft that skillfully maneuvered and dodged the attack.  The Soviet pilot was at an altitude of nine kilometers.  Finally he managed to aim at the enemy and shoot, but then a terrible thing happened.  At high altitude, the guns froze and the salvo failed. </p><p>  Golovachev, realizing the severity of the situation, went to extreme measures.  He decided to act as a tyrant.  The pilot pressed the gas and came close to the enemy, and then hit the tail with a screw.  The fascist plane crashed, and Golovachev managed to align his trajectory and fly to the airfield.  This was one of the last rams in the history of the war, and it was completed with the highest level of skill.  Pavel Yakovlevich was again awarded the Golden Star medal. </p><p>  At this time, the pilot flew already on La-7 and could appreciate all the advantages of the characteristics of this technology.  Until the end of the war, he worked on this plane, after which he handed it over to one of the museums. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ava.org.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the cabin of La-7" class="if uuid-3165761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165761.jpg"></div><h2>  On the way to victory </h2><p>  1945 Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich met in the sky of Germany.  On January 18, in two battles, he destroyed four aircraft in one day.  In February 1945, the hero fought in the ranks of 900 fighter regiment.  On March 18, a group of Soviet attack aircraft led by Golovachev met with a well-trained Me-109 brigade.  Soviet pilots forced the enemy to flee after the loss of two Messers.  One of them was destroyed by Pavel Yakovlevich. </p><p>  The pilot met victory in Berlin, and won his last military victories there.  On April 25, he led a group of three aircraft.  On the way, they met twenty opponents.  Soviet pilots covered the crossing, they could not admit the enemy to it.  Without a moment's doubt, Golovachev gave the command to attack.  He knocked out the first enemy aircraft of the first six, after which the remaining enemies fled. </p><p>  The Soviet pilot turned to the next group and knocked out their leader.  The rest in a panic dropped bombs on their own troops and fled.  The pilot of the crashed plane was captured by Soviet fighters.  This was the last battle of Golovachev.  For all the time he destroyed thirty-one units of enemy equipment and visited 125 battles. </p><h2>  After the war </h2><p>  With the onset of peace, Golovachev Pavel Yakovlevich continued to serve in the Soviet army.  In 1951, he graduated from the Air Force Academy.  The pilot studied many types of aircraft and held various positions in the command. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geleon5.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Major General Golovachev" class="if uuid-3165771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165771.jpg"></div><p>  In 1959, Golovachev graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff.  He spent the last years of his service in his native Belarus.  He often met with young people and carried out military-patriotic work with them.  Everywhere he was treated with respect and met with honor.

He was buried at the Eastern cemetery in the city of Minsk.  In his small homeland - in the village of Koshelevo, a bust was installed in memory of the famous pilot born on this earth.  A monument was erected in Gomel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geleon5.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memory of the hero" class="if uuid-3165736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104824/3165736.jpg"></div><p>  The museum of the Hero of the Soviet Union P.
