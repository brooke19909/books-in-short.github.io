Until recently, domestic companies did not think about the production of their devices.  However, at the end of 2013, our developers from Yota Devices began selling the very first version of the Yotaphone smartphone.  And after 12 months the company presents the next generation device, which took into account the errors and shortcomings found in the previous model.  And in 2017, Yota Devices announces the release of Yotaphone 3, the release date of which was set for the fifth of September this year. </p><h2>  Yotaphone 3 review: specifications </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yotaphone 3 feature review" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2038438.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Due to the fact that the exact date of the sale of the news for a long time was not disclosed, there were no reviews of the characteristics of Yotaphone 3. Many guesses and assumptions about this were built.  However, the <span>Russian smartphone</span> Yotaphone 3 was announced, and now its parameters are not a secret to anyone. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The Yota 3 has a Snapdragon 625 processor manufactured by Qualcomm.  The new processor has a higher frequency and, of course, a large number of cores.  Based on the configuration of the smartphone, the clock frequency will vary from 1700 to 2500 MHz.  Qualcomm campaign processors have always been and remain a quality product that is not satisfactory to users.  It is important to note that such processors are installed on a huge number of devices of this type. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Built-in memory </h2>

    <p>  A sufficiently large amount of memory will be installed in third-generation smartphones Yota, which will also vary from 64 to 128 GB depending on the configuration.  In addition, the buyer will be able to add additional memory by installing an additional flash card such as microSD.  Also, a significant difference from the previous generation smartphone will be an increase in RAM.  In Yotaphone 3 it will be as much as 4Gb. </p><h2>  Smartphone screens </h2><p>  Yota manufacturers remained true to themselves and did not abandon the main feature of their smartphone - two displays.  In addition, developers do not lag behind the trends set by such large companies as Apple and Samsung, and develop their product, imitating models of foreign manufacturers. </p><p>  That is why the Yotaphone 3 smartphone went on sale in several trim levels, differing primarily in the size of the display.  The standard diagonal will be 5.5 inches, the figure is neither too large nor too small.  Also, the equipment will have a significant impact on the price of the Yotaphone 3. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yotaphone 3 price" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2038440.jpg" width="600"></div>

Regarding the screens located on the back of the smartphone, everything will change slightly.  These displays will continue to work on electronic ink technology, but their resolution has increased significantly, compared with the "Yotafona" of past generations. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not live up to the expectations of customers, therefore, the IPS matrix will not be used on the new smartphone, but a cheap version of AMOLED is installed.  The overall design of the displays has also been changed.  The developers abandoned the rounded corners in favor of a flat surface, due to the fact that the curved shape reproduced the image with distortion at the round points </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  On this model, 2 cameras are installed: front and main.  The main one has a resolution of 12 megapixels and is equipped with a dual LED flash.  The selfie camera is also not weak, its resolution is as much as 13 megapixels.  Of course, this can not be compared with the flagship models of foreign manufacturers, but the camera issue is not a priority for domestic developers. </p><h2>  The main innovations </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yotaphone 3 smartphone" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2038947.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  They have been talking about introducing modern technologies into the new generation of smartphones for a long time, due to the fact that the company's management never made this a big secret, therefore they were known about them even before the announcement of the release date of Yotaphone 3. The new Yota 3 boasts the following significant innovations in the field Electronics and Information Technology: </p><ul><li>  virtual camera; </li><li>  special display technology that allows you to feel a keystroke when you touch it; </li><li>  wireless charging technology; </li><li>  Sound will be transmitted through the display glass. </li></ul><p>  As expected, the phone was not equipped with a solar battery, due to the fact that the panel is made in the form of a yellowish sheet, which is installed on the screen, and therefore significantly reduces the picture quality.  Based on the words of the head of Yota Devices, due to the unprocessed nature of this know-how, the user does not agree to lose the clarity of the picture in favor of the doubtful ability to recharge the device up to 20% in sunny weather. </p><h2>  Virtual camera </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian smartphone yotaphone 3" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2038437.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Almost all users of modern smartphone models use video calls and take selfies.  To perform such actions, you need to look at the screen, and not at the gadget‚Äôs camera, so the user has a rather strange look at the photo or video call.  This technology solves this problem by processing the resulting image with special software. </p><p>  When reviewing the characteristics of Yotaphone 3, one cannot fail to mention a number of minuses inherent in the phones of this model.  First of all, this is the lack of an NFC module, which will become a stumbling block for many consumers.  Also, the rather high price for Yotaphone 3 does not make this device more attractive for buyers, especially the Russian market. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As a result of a review of the characteristics of Yotaphone 3, one thing can be said - Yota Devices made an exorbitant contribution to the development of the Russian smartphone market, however, due to insufficient experience and great competition, its device is unlikely to gain much popularity among users, because such giants as the iPhone and Samsung exist relatively long ago and managed to gain confidence from the Russian user. </p>
