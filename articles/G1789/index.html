    <h2>  What tourists attribute to the minuses of the hotel </h2><p>  According to some vacationers, there are not enough discos on the island, the lack of water parks is frustrating, the hotel itself is far from civilization, there are no cafes or restaurants nearby.  Although there is a free shuttle service to several establishments offering Russian cuisine.  The island is considered the edge of the tourist area, and prices are much higher than in the center of China.  Going <span>to Hainan in August</span> , July or June, it should be noted that this is a ‚Äúdead season‚Äù, everything is repaired everywhere, and the noise from work can strain and interfere with sleep.  Many guests complain about the food at the hotel, but still you need to consider the features of Chinese cuisine.  When compared with northern China, where meat cuisine predominates, it is mainly marine and vegetable. </p><p>  And one more drawback, about which Russians often write in their reviews, is the problem with the language, but this applies not only to this hotel, but to China as a whole.  There are very few English-speaking, and even more Russian-speaking residents in this country.  Everywhere you have to explain with gestures, but, unfortunately, this does not always work. </p><h2>  The cost of a tourist permit </h2><p>  When choosing a tour to Hainan Island from Russian cities, you should take into account the flight range (in time the flight takes about eleven hours, if without transfers).  Accordingly, the cost of leisure at <span>Wanbo</span> <span>Club is</span> an order of magnitude higher than at hotels located in countries closer to us.  Also, the cost of airline tickets in different airlines can vary significantly.  In addition, the price depends on the time of the year chosen for the rest. </p><p>  For example, the cost of a vacation in <span>August to Hainan</span> at the Wangbo Hotel starts from 50 thousand rubles for two.  This includes: flight, transfer, accommodation, medical insurance and breakfast.  When choosing food ‚Äúbreakfast, lunch, dinner‚Äù, the price for a ticket increases by 15-20 thousand rubles.  For triple occupancy (2 adults and a child) the cost of a tour with breakfast will cost about 70,000 rubles, with full meals 85 thousand rubles.  The price is quite pleasant due to the fact that August is not a season for China. </p><p>  Starting in September, the cost of tours to the island is gradually growing, and already towards the end of December reaches its peak.  For example, a New Year tour to the Wanbo Hotel will cost about 100 thousand rubles for two adults. </p><p>  In any case, no matter what month you choose for your trip to this delightful country, this hotel will be considered one of the most budgetary and economical options. </p>
