  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The formation of the Old Russian state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The prerequisites for the formation of the Old Russian state arose as a result of the influence of a complex of external and internal, spiritual, political, socio-economic factors.  However, first of all, one should take into account the economic changes of the Eastern Slavs.  An excess of agricultural products in some areas and folk crafts in others led to mutual exchange and contributed to the development of trade.  Along with this, conditions were formed for the separation of the princely retinue group from the community.  Thus, military management was separated from production. </p><p>  Among the political factors that influenced the creation of the Old Russian state, tribal clashes should be noted against the background of the complication of tribal relations.  These factors contributed to the acceleration of the establishment of princely power.  The role of the squads and princes grew - they not only defended the tribe from external attacks, but also acted as judges of various disputes. </p><p>  At the same time, tribal struggle led to the unification of several tribes around the strongest.  Such unions became tribal principalities.  As a result, princely power was strengthened, but the interests of the ruler diverged more strongly with the interests of their fellow tribesmen over time. </p><p>  Paganism and the development of the spiritual ideas of the Slavs had a great influence on the formation of the Old Russian state.  With the growth of the military power of the prince, who brought the loot to the tribe, he defended against external attacks, settled internal disputes, and his prestige grew.  Along with this, the prince alienated from the rest of the community. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The prince, famous for his military achievements, able to solve internal issues, perform complex <span>management functions,</span> increasingly moved away from his fellow tribesmen.  The community members, in turn, endowed him with supernatural power, saw in him a guarantee of the well-being of the tribe in the future. </p><p>  External factors that influenced the formation of the Old Russian state include strong pressure from the Normans and the Khazars.  The desire of these nationalities to control the trade routes between the South, East and West provoked the acceleration of the formation of princely and retinue groups, which began to participate in the trade process.  So, for example, the products of crafts (furs, first of all) were collected from fellow tribesmen and changed to silver and prestigious products from foreign merchants, in addition, foreigners captured by foreigners were also sold to foreigners.  Thus, tribal structures became increasingly subordinate to the local nobility, which was increasingly isolated and enriched. </p><p>  In addition, interaction with other more developed countries made a change in the socio-political structure of the country.  Also, the fact of the existence of the <span>Khazar Khaganate</span> in the lower Volga had an influence on the formation of the Old Russian state.  This education provided protection for the <span>eastern Slavs</span> from the attacks of nomads.  In past eras, raids on Russian territory significantly impeded the development of tribes, interfered with their work, and the emergence of a state system. </p><p>  Thus, at the first stage (from the beginning of the 8th to the middle of the 9th century), the formation of the Old Russian state takes place through the formation of tribal centers and unions.  In the 9th century, a system of polyudy emerged - collecting tribute from the community in favor of the prince.  Presumably, at that time it was voluntary and was perceived by fellow tribesmen as compensation for managerial and military services. </p><p>  At the second stage, the establishment of the <span>political system</span> was greatly influenced by external factors - the intervention of the Khazars and Normans. </p><p>  According to the <span>Tale of Bygone Years, the</span> Finno-Ugrians and Slavs in 862 turned to Rurik with a proposal to reign over them.  Accepting the offer, Rurik sat in Novgorod (according to some evidence, in Staraya Ladoga).  One of his brothers, Sineus, began to reign in Beloozero, and the second, Truvor, in Izborsk. </p>
