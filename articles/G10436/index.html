    <h2>  Krynica Morska </h2><p>  The main wealth of this Polish <span>seaside resort</span> is nature.  It boasts magnificent sandy beaches, picturesque forests with rich flora and fauna.  In addition, in the city of Krynica Morska there are all conditions for an excellent holiday for fans of windsurfing and fishing.  In addition, the resort has several sources of mineral healing water.  Despite the fact that Krynica Morska is one of the most popular resorts in Poland, it is never too crowded here.  The local population is only one and a half thousand people. </p><h2>  Entertainment offered to tourists in the resort of Krynica Morska </h2><p>  Holidays in this place will not disappoint both lovers of beaches and fans of antiquity.  So, the beach infrastructure in this resort is very well developed.  However, if you are planning a seaside vacation in Poland, then keep in mind that the climate here is quite warm and mild in winter and non-hot in summer.  Nevertheless, the weather conditions are comfortable enough for a beach holiday.  In addition, the ecological situation in this place, due to the cleanest air and water, as well as pine and beech forests, is unlikely to leave anyone indifferent.  Also, an interesting fact about the nature of the resort of Krynica-Morska can be considered the presence of unique animals and plants, which are almost impossible to meet in other parts of our planet.  For example, here you can often observe on the beach a whole family of wild boars that are completely not afraid of humans.  However, to come close to them is still not recommended: it is best to take some photos from afar. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Forehead </h2><p>  If you are going to the sea in Poland, then be sure to consider as an option one of the most popular local resort towns called eba.  It is located in the central part of the coast at the mouth of the river of the same name.  This resort is the best suited for outdoor enthusiasts, because all the conditions for cycling, horse riding and windsurfing are created here.  In addition, eba is the starting point for exploring the Slovinsky National Park. </p><h2>  Local beaches </h2><p>  The coastal part of Leba is divided into three zones: beaches A, B and C. They are all wide, sandy and very clean.  Beach A is a protected area and is considered the most popular in the city.  There is a developed infrastructure: cafes, bars, restaurants, shops, jet ski, boat rental, etc. Beach C is a continuation of Beach A. However, its territory is not guarded, and there is not much entertainment here.  In this regard, in this place there are fewer vacationers, which people who prefer a quiet and quiet pastime will definitely appreciate it.  As for beach B, it is located a bit off from the center of eba.  Its territory is protected.  Here you can find a number of entertainments, including a children's and volleyball courts, a trampoline and more. </p>

This town is located in the western part of the Polish Baltic Sea coast.  Numerous tourists are attracted by a well-developed resort infrastructure and the beauty of the national natural park, as well as sources of mineral waters and a healing microclimate.

    <h2>  Poland - sea holidays: prices </h2><p>  It should be noted that our compatriots are frequent guests in this country, not only due to the fact that there are all conditions for a comfortable pastime, but also due to the rather affordable cost of trips.  In addition, if you live in the European part of Russia, the road will cost you also quite inexpensively.  And if you have a desire to spend your holidays with chic in a luxurious five-star hotel, then in this case you should take a closer look at the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea.  After all, here every tourist will be able to find leisure options for himself, depending on both his preferences and financial capabilities.  As for the price-quality ratio, in Poland it is optimal.  In general, it is easy to choose housing on the coast from 1,000 to 30,000 rubles per night. </p><p>  So, today we learned that one of the places for a great vacation is Poland.  The Baltic Sea, a holiday on which is considered one of the most accessible in all of Europe, offers tourists a wide variety of entertainment: from magnificent beaches and healing mineral springs to interesting excursions to historical sights and walks to protected places with unique nature and microclimate. </p>
