    <p>  Like all budget models, the T72x does not stand out.  The body of the device is made of the most ordinary plastic, and not of the best quality.  The assembly is not impressive, because there are creaks and small gaps.  Such problems are found in almost all cheap devices from China. </p><p>  Noteworthy design details are not observed.  The display, front camera, sensors, logo and speaker are located on the front panel.  The back of the device was taken under the main camera, speaker and a sign of the company.  Also on the back is the speaker of the tablet.  The power button along with the volume control are on the side on the right, and the left side is empty. </p><p>  At the top of the device there is a removable panel, under which there is a place for a flash drive and slots for SIM cards.  The upper end was reserved for the headset jack, microphone and USB-jack.  In general, everything is as usual. </p><p>  For ease of use, the back is ribbed.  This allows you to easily hold the T72x with even one hand.  It also affects light weight, only 290 grams.  The tablet turned out much easier than many of its brothers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The manufacturer did not bother and released his brainchild in standard colors: black and, of course, white.  In principle, the solution is not new and is found everywhere, but absolutely does not add zest. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  For show, the manufacturer installed a 2-megapixel matrix in <span>Oysters T72x 3G.</span>  Camera specifications are not the strongest side of the tablet.  Although it is not worth it to show excessive demands on him. </p><p>  Two megapixels and a low resolution allow you to take pictures without detail and with a lot of noise.  The absence of a flash also affects.  You can take pictures only in good light. </p><p>  The camera is capable of recording video, but the quality is poor.  The rollers are grainy.  The user, most likely, will not use this feature of the device. </p><p>  There is also a 0.3 megapixel front camera, which is standard for budget employees.  The front camera is enough for video calls, but the user will be forced to forget about self-portraits. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The device has a seven-inch screen familiar to low-cost devices.  The resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels did not fail, perfectly matching the size of the Oysters T72x 3G display.  Characteristics are also improved by a good choice of IPS-matrix. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Modern technology significantly raises the overall impression of the device.  The matrix increases the Oysters T72x 3G viewing angle and brightness.  The user should not be afraid of distortion and sunlight.  IPS technology significantly reduces brightness loss. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The ‚Äúfilling" of the device turned out to be interesting.  The device received an MTK processor model 8312 with two cores.  Each of them operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  In a <span>cheap tablet,</span> these characteristics look very unusual. </p><p>  Pleasantly surprised and gigabytes of RAM.  Accordingly, in working with multiple applications or browser tabs, the device shows its best side. </p><p>  The tablet received only 4 gigabytes of native memory.  About half is reserved for Android.  The user does not get as much memory as we would like.  The problem is solved by the possibility of expanding the volume due to a flash drive up to 32 gigabytes. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The 2800 maH battery doesn't provide the longest running time for the <span>Oysters T72x 3G.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> also noted this flaw.  The charge is enough for about 4-5 hours, with an average load.  Active work will land the device in just 3 hours. </p><p>  Given the ‚Äúgluttonous‚Äù characteristics of the device, the battery looks mediocre.  For a tablet that supports 3G, capacity is definitely not enough.  Unfortunately, fixing the situation by replacing the battery does not work, because it is not removable. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The device uses "Android" not the latest version, namely 4.4.  Newer firmware for Oysters T72x 3G is also available.  However, its adaptation is still lame.  The best solution is to install a custom version. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost does not go beyond the framework of similar state employees.  The price of the device ranges from 1,400 to 2,400 thousand rubles.  Quite often, actions are held on the T72x, which allow tangible savings.  An interesting feature was that most of the devices were distributed as gifts. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2>

    <p>  Cost is the strength of the Oysters T72x 3G.  Reviews mention markdowns and discounts on this device.  Although even without any promotions, the device is cheaper than many Chinese counterparts. </p><p>  Balanced display specifications are also a plus for the Oysters T72x 3G.  Reviews noted a rare IPS-matrix for budget employees and high resolution. </p><p>  Cheap, yet productive filling also earned the praise of the owners.  Power, unfortunately, is not enough for demanding games, but there will be no problems with the Internet and applications. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Lame autonomy Oysters T72x 3G.  User reviews indicate a strong attachment to the outlet.  The reason is the small amount of built-in battery. </p><p>  The tablet design does not cause enthusiasm.  Particularly embarrassing is the quality of the plastic and the boring colors. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The T72x is great for surfing the web and watching videos.  He will cope with small everyday tasks, the apparatus is not suitable for a larger one.  However, this does not affect the overall impression. </p>
