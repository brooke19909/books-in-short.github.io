Every year the army of his fans is growing, as many consider it prestigious to have a similar model. </p><p>  On September 12, 2018, the next presentation of the new <span>iPhone model</span> took place <span>.</span>  Despite the fact that nothing supernatural was shown to the audience, thousands of Apple fans are preparing to pay 2.5 thousand dollars (170 thousand rubles) for the new product.  As the number of users increases, many questions arise.  For example, how to disable the password on an iPhone. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  If a person is thinking about how to disable the password on an iPhone, you need to understand all the risks.  You need to know what can happen to personal data if it is not protected by a cipher.  Therefore, it is important to set the fingerprint input or Face ID after disabling the password. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable password on iphone 5s" class="if uuid-2829444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829444.jpg"></div><p>  They figure out how to disable the password on the iPhone, most often those who decide to sell their phone.  To do this, you need to clear all data, as well as remove encryption from the screen so that the new owner can safely use the device. </p><p>  Also, disabling the password may be necessary for those who do not use numbers, but simply put a finger on the button.  In this case, you can remove the cipher, but it‚Äôs better not to do this, since the smartphone may malfunction and stop accepting a fingerprint.  In this case, an emergency exit will be needed, and it will become the password. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Password Disabling Methods </h2><p>  In the question of how to disable the password on the iPhone, there is nothing complicated.  The main thing is to follow the instructions and decide on one of the options.  You can disable it by software, without using additional utilities.  You can also get rid of the cipher using iTunes or iCloud.  Each of these options is suitable for disabling the password not only iPhone, but also on the iPad. </p><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  In order not to be smart with all <span>sorts of programs,</span> it is best to just use the settings menu.  How to disable the password code on an iPhone?  For this method, it is important to remember your password that was set earlier. </p><ol><li>  Open the smartphone settings menu. </li><li>  We find the line "Password Code".  You can also search for ‚ÄúTouch ID and Password‚Äù depending on the model. </li><li>  Next you need to choose to disable the password. </li><li>  The smartphone will ask for a password that is already used to lock the device.  Just enter it to disable the cipher. </li><li>  If the process was successful, the system will confirm the necessary action. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the next time the device is locked, the user will not need to enter a code.  But remember that it is important to protect the device in other ways, especially if important personal data is stored on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.technobezz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable password on iphone 6" class="if uuid-2829455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829455.jpg"></div><p>  If the user does not remember his password, but you want to figure out how to disable the password on "iPhone 6", you need to use other methods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Disconnect using iTunes </h2><p>  Using the iPhone, the user needs to connect to accounts that are running Apple.  Most immediately create an account in iTunes and iCloud.  Programs help you recover or disable the password on your smartphone, even if you forget it. </p><p>  ITunes service is an online store where you can purchase entertainment content: audio, video, books, games, etc. Thanks to it, you can try to recover, and then change or disable the password.  But it is important to remember that this method will rob you of all user files. </p><h2>  ITunes Recovery Process </h2><p>  So, first you need to prepare the phone for unlocking.  Next, on the smartphone, select the DFU mode.  To do this, you need to use a special combination, which is also popular in devices based on Android.  Hold down the power key of the phone and the Home button.  This should be done for about 10 seconds, until the screen starts to glow or you feel the device vibrate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imyfone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using iTunes" class="if uuid-2829448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829448.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to continue to hold the Home button, and the power key can be released.  Now you can connect your smartphone to a computer using the cable that comes with the phone.  By the way, it is desirable that the device has a charge of 60%. </p><p>  How to disable the password on iPhone 5 or another model?  You need to open the iTunes application on the computer.  The program will immediately find a smartphone connected to the system.  Next, recovery will be offered.  It is necessary to hold the button again, but this time on the keyboard - Shift.  Simultaneously with this action, you need to click "Restore". </p><p>  The system will start searching for new updates, after installing the update.  Such recovery will delete all personal data from the phone, and after them the password.  After that you can go to the settings and set the necessary encryption on the phone. </p><h2>  Work with iCloud </h2><p>  In the question of how to disable the iPhone 4 password, iCloud service can help.  This is also a proprietary resource from Apple.  It is an online repository.  In addition to your photos, audio files and other personal data, you can store passwords and other important information here.  Accordingly, the service will help to cope with the recovery and disabling of the cipher on the smartphone. </p><p>  To do this, you need to connect the device to Wi-Fi, and also establish an Internet connection on the computer. </p><h2>  ICloud Recovery Process </h2><p>  First, go to the iCloud service website and enter your account information.  Next, go to the ‚ÄúMy devices‚Äù tab and make sure that the iPhone is displayed on the network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using iCloud" class="if uuid-2829451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829451.jpg"></div><p>  The next command you need to select "Erase iPhone."  But to confirm this action, you will need an Apple ID password.  In fact, this is the same operation as in the case of iTunes.  You need to understand that this option is suitable only if you forgot the code and do not know how to disable the password on the iPhone 5S. </p><p>  This method will destroy all user data from the smartphone.  It will start the recovery and delete the password that blocked the phone.  To return the data, you need to make backups in advance, which later will help to return the settings and configuration of the device. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  If you need to change or configure a password, then this can be done in the settings of the smartphone.  To do this, just go to the ‚ÄúTouch ID and password‚Äù section.  Depending on the model, this menu may be called differently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 4 how to disable the password" class="if uuid-2829454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829454.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can configure encryption.  For example, you can turn off the password code or change it.  To do this, you will need to enter the old one and come up with a new one.  In the password settings, you can configure the use of a four-digit code, an arbitrary digital password or alphanumeric encryption. </p><p>  The user can select access to some functions from a locked device.  For example, you can connect to Siri without entering a password, view recent notifications or use the ‚ÄúReply by message‚Äù option. </p><p>  Below you can configure the password lock so that after 10 incorrect attempts to enter encryption, the system will delete all data from the device. </p><h2>  Using other encryption </h2><p>  If for some reason you are not comfortable using the password code, you can take advantage of the new features that are available in the latest versions of the smartphone.  It's about Touch ID or Face ID. </p><p>  Touch ID is <span>a fingerprint scanner</span> that appeared in the iPhone 5S back in 2013, and later began to be actively used in all smartphones from other manufacturers.  By 2018, almost everyone, including budget devices, got this option.  It helps to quickly access user data on the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable password on iphone 5" class="if uuid-2829458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2829458.jpg"></div><p>  Face ID is an option that is currently only available on the iPhone X. It was first presented on September 12, 2017.  This is a scanner that works with the three-dimensional shape of a person‚Äôs face.  The front camera reads the user's face, after which it either gives access to data or refuses. </p>
