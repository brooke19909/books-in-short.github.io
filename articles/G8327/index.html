  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Cyprus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If there is a paradise on earth, then his name is Cyprus.  This is a small island in the Mediterranean Sea with an ancient beautiful history.  The mild climate and virtually endless summers make holidays in Cyprus attractive to many tourists.  There is an amazing combination of beautiful snow-white beaches, the warm sea, welcoming residents and historical monuments, which are more than one millennium old.  On the island, to the shores of which the <span>goddess of love</span> Aphrodite came out, most newlyweds dream of spending their <span>honeymoon.</span>  In many respects, the budget of this republic depends on the tourism sector, therefore guests are treated with special care. </p><p>  One of the most popular places where travelers want to spend their holidays in Cyprus is <span>Paphos.</span>  <span>This is a</span> small charming town with sandy beaches, ancient architecture, beautiful bays.  According to legend, a few kilometers from Paphos, Aphrodite came ashore from the Mediterranean Sea.  Cypriots so believe in this that for several centuries they have carefully kept her bathhouse, which is located in a natural grotto and hidden from prying eyes by leaves of <span>fig tree</span> and ferns.  According to legend, it was here that Aphrodite indulged in love joys with her lover Adonis.  Not far from Paphos is her temple, where a huge number of pilgrims arrived.  It is believed that the famous Roman orgies took place here.  Religions of that time prescribed girls to have sexual intercourse with strangers. </p><p>  No vacation in Cyprus can do without a visit to the Odeon.  This is an ancient theater built by Yeshe in the 2nd century AD.  e.  To date, 12 rows of 25 have survived. The Odeon has lost its scale, but not its greatness.  In the summer, theatrical performances and holidays are held here.  Near the Odeon is the Castle of the Forty Columns, built to repel the attacks of foreigners.  He earned his name by the fact that it consists of many columns.  Until our time, the castle has practically not been preserved; instead, several ruins remained. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the tourists who bought last-minute <span>tours to Cyprus</span> or simply reserved them, will arrive in Larnaca upon arrival because it is here that one of the largest international airports of the republic is located.  The city is not crowded with tourists, but it also has a large number of interesting and beautiful places.  In Larnaca, there is the promenade of Cimona, comparable in beauty to the European promenades.  It is named after the military leader who liberated in 449 BC.  city ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the Persians.  Throughout its length there are numerous cafes and shops, as well as a large number of palm trees.  Cultural rest <strong> </strong>  in Cyprus is impossible without visiting the <span>Church of St. Lazarus.</span>  He is the patron saint of Larnaca.  The construction of the church was completed in the 9th century, and in the 17th century it was restored.  In 1970 there was a strong fire, which destroyed all the interior decoration.  After him, the church was not restored.  Today it has a very modest decor, but, nevertheless, many note the grace of its iconostasis dating back to <span>the Baroque era.</span> </p><p>  Buying last-minute packages to Cyprus at the height of the season from May to October is a great success.  You can go here, both alone and together with children or friends.  Some tourists prefer to rent a car and explore all the sights of the island on their own.  This is not at all difficult, as Cyprus is full of them.  An interesting fact, when ordering dishes in local restaurants, it is better to check with the waiter about the portion sizes, because some treats are brought in such quantities that they can safely feed the whole company.  There is virtually no crime in Cyprus.  It is quiet and calm, and people are kind and smiling.  Holidays in Cyprus will not be forgotten by time for all its guests. </p>
