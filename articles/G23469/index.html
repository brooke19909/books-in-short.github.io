There are many attractions in this village, because once it was a royal residence.  I must say that this city is small only in comparison with European megacities.  The largest among the Slovak settlements, it ranks second.  Kosice sights are described in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doubletree-kosice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kosice fountain" class="if uuid-2538007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538007.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The exact date of the founding of the city of Kosice in Slovakia is unknown.  The first mention is found in documents of the beginning of the XIII century.  In the 15th century, Kosice flourished.  Then Slovakia was part of the Hungarian kingdom. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, that city was often burned and attacked by its diplomatic neighbors.  In the 16th century, it became the center of Hungarian rebels, unhappy with the rule of the Habsburgs.  The city of Kosice has maintained this status for two centuries. </p><p>  In 1919, the Slovak Soviet Republic was founded, which, however, did not last long.  For six years, from 1938 to 1944, the city was called differently - Kashsha.  Then he was in the Hungarian occupation. </p><p>  In June 1941, the city was bombed.  It has been suggested that it was organized by Soviet aircraft.  No one has proven this version, but the Kosice bombing was a formal reason for declaring war on the Soviet Union. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Kosice is a major transport hub.  The city is 20 km from the border.  Public transport is represented by tram, trolleybus and bus lines, which are managed by a single company.  From the local bus station, buses go abroad.  Six kilometers from the historical center is the airport of Kosice-Bartz. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  In Kosice, 250 thousand people live.  Until the middle of the XVI century, this city spoke mainly German.  Until 1918, this settlement was considered Hungarian.  Today, three quarters of the Kosice population are Slovaks.  The situation changed after World War II, when a population exchange was organized with Hungary. </p><p>  In Kosice, Hungarians and gypsies also make up 5% of the total population.  The city covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã240 km <sup>2</sup> . </p><div class="photo" data-original="slovakia.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kosice Slovakia" class="if uuid-2538011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538011.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractions Kosice (Slovakia) </h2><p>  There are about ten historical and architectural monuments.  The sights of Kosice include narrow and quaint streets, and a singing fountain, in which fish swim in the summer. </p><p>  Historic buildings are located on Main Street - Hlavn√° ulica.  The city is concentrated most of the Slovak attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Kosice has the largest church.  This is a cathedral built in the Gothic style.  A photo of the Kosice attraction, which is included in the list of cultural monuments of Slovakia, is presented below.  The most famous historical monuments also include: </p><ul><li>  Gothic cathedral  Elizabeth. </li><li>  Jacob's Palace. </li><li>  Church Ursulinok. </li><li>  <span>Calvinist church.</span> </li><li>  Monastery of the Dominicans. </li><li>  Lutheran Church. </li><li>  Franciscan Monastery. </li><li>  Greek Catholic Church. </li><li>  Church of St. Michael. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="slovakia.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kosice slovakia cathedral of saint elizabeth" class="if uuid-2538015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538015.jpg"></div><h2>  Gothic Cathedral of St. Elizabeth </h2><p>  The photo of the city of Kosice usually depicts a majestic temple.  It can be safely called the symbol of this Slovak settlement.  There are a lot of similar buildings built in gloomy medieval style in Europe.  But most of them are located west of Slovakia.  St. Elizabeth Cathedral is the most eastern Gothic cathedral in Europe.  It is included in the list of national cultural monuments of the country. </p><p>  The construction of the temple began at the end of the XIV century and lasted about forty years.  Previously, another Catholic church stood on the site of this cathedral, apparently destroyed during the next enemy raid.  According to some sources, where this Gothic cathedral rises today, in the XI century a religious building appeared in honor of Elizabeth of Hungary, the representative of the Arpad dynasty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the middle of the XIII century, Elizabeth was recognized as the patroness of Kosice.  At the beginning of the XIX century, the temple received the status of a cathedral.  In the Middle Ages, the building burned more than once.  In the 19th century, serious restoration work was carried out under the direction of the architect Imre Steindl. </p><p>  The height of the temple is 60 meters.  The interior walls are decorated with Gothic frescoes.  Inside there is also a picturesque altar image created in the 15th century.  It consists of 48 paintings, which are divided into three cycles: the Passion of Christ, the life of St. Elizabeth, Christmas events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goruma.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slovakia cathedral of st elizabeth" class="if uuid-2538017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538017.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of St. Michael the Archangel </h2><p>  This temple is also designed in the Gothic style.  Built in the second half of the XIV century.  Initially, the Church of St. Michael the Archangel was a chapel, which belonged to the cathedral described above. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XV century, the church underwent reconstruction.  An additional extension appeared, which was dismantled five hundred years later.  In order to preserve the ancient gravestones discovered here at the beginning of the 20th century, they were walled into the walls of the church. </p><p>  In the XII century, when both the Hungarians and the Germans visited the Cathedral of St. Elizabeth, the chapel of St. Michael was a Slovak national temple.  Above the entrance to the church is the ancient coat of arms of the city.  The altar is decorated with the image of the Archangel Michael, who entered into battle with the dragon, a symbol of dark forces.  The figures of the archangels Gabriel and Raphael are installed on both sides of the altar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="austria-forum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Michael" class="if uuid-2538027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538027.jpg"></div><h2>  Jacob's Palace </h2><p>  In the city center you can see an unusual building erected on the site of an ancient fortification.  Here was once a mill pond.  If you look at the building from a distance, it is impossible to see in it a single architectural detail that would resemble a mill.  Rather, it looks like an eclectic-style palace, not devoid of Gothic elements. </p><p>  This attraction is called the Jacob's palace after the architect, the author of the project, who spent the last days of his life in it.  It is noteworthy that as the building materials for the construction of the building, he used the stones that remained after the reconstruction of St. Elizabeth Cathedral. </p><p>  The palace is located in a cozy, quiet place of Kosice.  In 1968, a highway was laid here.  After the war, the palace became the property of the state.  For some time the residence of the president was located here, then the British Council.  Today the building is used for special occasions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9gag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jacob's palace" class="if uuid-2538065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2538065.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Kosice is a pleasant town in every respect.  Some tourists consider it too boring, but for lovers of a relaxing holiday there is no better place.  In Kosice, the tourism business is quite developed, and therefore there are hotels of different levels. </p><p>  The average cost of renting a double room is 45-50 euros (2950-3700 rubles).  There are more expensive options - from 65 euros (4800 rubles).  Students and unpretentious people use the services of hostels, of which there are many.  You can spend the night in one of them for only 13 euros (960 rubles).  The most famous hostel among tourists is called Mescki Park.  It is located in the park of the same name, not far from the historical center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kosice cities slovakia" class="if uuid-2538013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538013.jpg"></div><h2>  Restaurants and Cafes </h2><p>  The most popular institution in Kosice is ‚Äú12 Apostles‚Äù.  It serves national Slovak cuisine.  The city also has cozy Italian cafes and Irish pubs.  Beer connoisseurs recommend visiting a place called Diesel. </p><p>  According to reviews, the main culinary pride of this Slovak city is pastry shops, where you can taste unusual cakes, strudel.  Lunch at a local restaurant will pleasantly surprise a tourist.  The average bill is 20 euros (1,480 rubles). </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Not only beautiful photos, but also souvenirs should be brought from Kosice.  Here, as in any other tourist city, there are shops specializing in the sale of impractical, but cute gizmos.  One of them is located in the shopping center "Optima".  You can get to it by bus number 10 or tram number 5. </p><p>  If you want to bring something unusual, specific for this Slovak city, you should go shopping, which are located in the old houses of the historical center.  Here you can find works by local artists, old photographs, forged products and much more. </p><p>  During a walk through the calm streets of Kosice, tourists often get the impression that there are no criminals in this amazing Slovak city.  This is an illusion - they are everywhere.  Do not relax and lose vigilance.  Close the car, do not leave bags on the table in the restaurant.  Remember that even among the inhabitants of this hospitable city, though rare, pickpockets are found. </p>
