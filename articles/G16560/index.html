For many Russians, who did not even visit the Black Sea coast, ‚Äúrest on the Black Sea‚Äù necessarily means ‚Äúrest in Sochi‚Äù.  Such an association was developed by the long resort life of the city, well-developed service and infrastructure of the region.  However, relaxing on the Black Sea can be enjoyable anywhere in the coast of this warm <span>southern sea.</span>  These also include Gornoe Loo - a village in the Krasnodar Territory. </p><p>  The article provides some information about this beautiful and cozy place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sochi-russia.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches Loo" class="if uuid-2660944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2660944.jpg"></div><h2>  A brief chronology of events </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the name of the village of Loo and the village of Gorny Loo came from the name of the feudal lords of Abkhaz nationality who lived here during the heyday and rise of the Abkhaz principality. </p><p>  From the end of 1962 to the middle of January 1965, the village of Loo was part of the rural Tuapse district.  In 1904, school number 87 was founded in the village, which operates to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="87.sochi-schools.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="School number 87" class="if uuid-2660850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2660850.jpg"></div><p>  In 1995, on Victory Day, an eternal flame was opened and lit here, which still burns in memory of the villagers (57 people) who died in the Second World War (by A. Amirov).  On the slabs of the monument in the shape of a five-pointed star, the names of all the fallen heroes of the villagers are engraved.  This memorial building of the Upper Loo administration cost 100 million rubles, with 2 million collected by local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the administrative sense, the village belongs to the Lazarevsky district of the municipality, the resort city of Sochi.  Sochi city center is about 20 km from it.  Mountain Loo is a part of the Upper Loo district (Verkhne-Loo village council) and is located two kilometers from the sea and one and a half kilometers from the village of Loo.  Its houses and other buildings are spread out on both banks of the river of the same name and its left tributary Kiet. </p><p>  From the village to the regional center (Krasnodar) the distance is 156 km, to the city of Moscow - 1348 km.  <span>Airports Pashkovsky</span> and Adler are located at 151 and 41 kilometers respectively. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bessochi.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village Mountain Loo" class="if uuid-2660847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2660847.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  3322 people inhabit the village, among which Armenians make up 63%, Russians 31% of the total number of inhabitants. </p><p>  The infrastructure is represented by a secondary school, a kindergarten, a feldsher-midwife station, a cultural center with a cinema located in it, nine retail outlets and four construction organizations.  In total, there are 12 apartment buildings and about 650 private households in the village. </p><p>  There are problems in Gorny Loo, which are typical of many Sochi villages.  These are gasification, water supply, sewerage, telephone systems.  There are also some problems associated with public services, repair of internal power lines and municipal roads. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  This cozy and picturesque resort combines everything at once.  The territory of the entire resort area stretches along the coast of the sea for 6000 meters and is part of Greater Sochi. </p><p>  Like most resorts in the Krasnodar Territory, Loo attracts with its magnificent nature.  Perfectly here the sea and mountain ranges adjoin.  Thanks to this, a beach holiday is quite possible to combine with interesting excursions to waterfalls and gorges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zinros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature Loo" class="if uuid-2660859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2660859.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Mountain Loo, according to many vacationers in these places, is more suitable for lovers of a more relaxing holiday, and not for those who like night parties and entertainment. </p><p>  The impression of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLoo is quite favorable for many, and the rest here is much cheaper than in Lazarevsky and Adler.  Reviews perfectly reflect the pricing policy of the resorts of this area.  Housing here has a very affordable cost: private sector rooms - from 200 rubles.  per person;  rooms of guest houses - from 400 rubles.  per person;  hotel rooms with all amenities - from 1200 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kurorthotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Loo" class="if uuid-2660856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2660856.jpg"></div><p>  Only some of the guests were dissatisfied with certain living conditions in the private sector, and at the same time they noted that they were given more services than they expected for rent.  Reviews are completely different from tourists living in hotels and guest houses.  Some were not happy with the service, and many were 100% satisfied.  All these are subjective opinions.  Much depends on the tourist himself, on his mood. </p>
