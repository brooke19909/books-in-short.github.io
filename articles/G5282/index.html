  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The subject of science in the system of related knowledge</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  History is one of the most important humanitarian scientific disciplines.  Studying it is not only important educational, but also practical.  The subject of historical science is the past of human society and life at the present moment, the laws of development of social life and relations, the specific forms of their embodiment and the changes that they underwent at certain spatio-temporal intervals.  The content of history as a scientific discipline is the study of historical processes revealed through the study of <span>historical monuments</span> and other sources.  The information obtained provides material on economic activity, the foreign and domestic policies of the studied state and its citizens, the events of social and cultural life, and the role of individual historical figures.  Thus, the subject of science, the concept is broad and multidimensional, in relation to history has a specific meaning and embodiment. </p><p>  Studying the life of human society from many different angles, history as a scientific discipline is divided into a number of industries, each of which, being completely independent, is closely connected with all others.  It is customary to distinguish between economic history, political, civil, history of state and law, history of culture, etc.  The subject of the science of ethnography, also related to historical ones, is the life and culture of peoples.  And archeology studies history according to specific ancient sources - tools, household items, jewelry, etc., as well as working with full-fledged historical complexes - burial grounds, settlements, treasures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Depending on the breadth of the studied <span>object, the subject of science</span> can be the whole history of the world, i.e.  world history or universal.  Or the story of a separate continent - America, Africa, Asia.  In a narrower specialization is the history of a single country and a people or group of peoples (history of Russia, history of the USSR). </p><p>  In addition to the main ones, in the scientific world it is customary to distinguish the so-called auxiliary historical disciplines.  The subject of science is more narrow in nature, it is studied in detail, in detail, and this makes it possible to better understand and evaluate the <span>historical process</span> as a whole: </p><ul><li>  the chronology is devoted to the study of various time frames; </li><li>  for paleography, ancient writing, manuscripts and other written monuments of different eras are interesting; </li><li>  diplomacy deals with historical acts; </li><li>  for numismatics, the subject of history is orders and medals, coins and other monetary units; </li><li>  local history is engaged in studying the history of individual localities, territories, regions, etc .; </li><li>  heraldry is interested in the coats of arms of families and entire clans, cities, countries. </li></ul><p>  Of the auxiliary disciplines, source studies are more important than others, for which the subject of science is historical sources, and historiography that studies, analyzes and describes the views, ideas, concepts of authors of historical works, historians, as well as the laws governing the development of history as scientific knowledge. </p><p>  History belongs to the most ancient sciences, intersecting with literary criticism, economic theories, philosophy, psychology, economic theories, linguistics and many others.  At the junction of several disciplines, historical geography, the history of literature, music, etc. arose. </p><p>  Political science or political science is one of the most serious areas in history.  The subject of political science is composed of a variety of processes and phenomena from the sphere of politics, patterns and ways of their development, and the expected results of these processes: </p><ul><li>  political theories, the history of the emergence and <span>development of political</span> thoughts and theories; </li><li>  power, various manifestations and forms of power, <span>political systems</span> with the main mechanism of power - the state; </li><li>  subjects of political ties and relations - civil societies, social classes and other communities, various political organizations; </li><li>  <span>the political consciousness of the</span> masses, their political culture, the main political directions and guidelines; </li><li>  international <span>political processes</span> and international politics as such. </li></ul><p>  Thus, by studying history, society learns to think in historical categories, to see its development, to give a correct assessment of various social processes and phenomena relative to the past and to predict the course of future events. </p>
