    <h2>  Location and features of the resort Arkhyz </h2><p>  There is a tourist village in Karachay-Cherkessia in the Western Caucasus.  Recognized as an all-weather ski resort.  So it‚Äôs good to visit it both in winter and in summer.  The official opening happened not so long ago - in 2012.  The construction of infrastructure and facilities in Arkhyz is still ongoing; they plan to complete the project by 2020. </p><p>  Of course, especially for those who have never been here, the question arises as to whether to go and what to do in general.  Most tourists travel to Arkhyz in the winter.  After all, it is at this time that you can go skiing.  Weather conditions in Arkhyz are special in that the snow falls in October-November and does not melt until March-April.  At the same time, the air temperature is kept at around -5, which is comfortable for vacationers. </p><h2>  How to get to Arkhyz </h2><p>  Just come to your destination on vacation.  Arkhyz is located two hundred kilometers from <span>Mineralnye Vody Airport.</span>  Even closer - 120 kilometers from the resort - Cherkessk railway station, from which you can get by bus or taxi.  You can also use the transfer service from the airport or train station, which is most convenient.  This delivery method must be taken care of in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another convenient way in which you can always stay mobile is to arrive by car.  In this case, it will be most profitable and comfortable to visit all the attractions of the resort.  So, for example, only 130 kilometers from Arkhyz is the highest mountain peak in Europe and the Russian Federation - Elbrus.  You can get there by car in just four hours from the village of Arkhyz.  A map with detailed information, roads, as well as necessary services can be very useful.  An example of such a card is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp Arkhyz" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26186/1034592.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay, having arrived in <span>Arkhyz.</span>  Resort Village <span>Hotels</span> </h2><p>  In a tourist village you can rent a house of different levels of comfort.  So, the hotel "Romantic-1" four stars are assigned.  The rooms are single and double, each of which has a bathroom, refrigerator, TV, other necessary and necessary hotel items with four stars.  For those who wish, the Romantic-1 Hotel offers luxury apartments.  The main feature of housing here is its proximity to the ski lifts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest Arkhyz" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/1033526.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nearby is the hotel, awarded three stars - "Romantic-2".  As in the previous hotel, the rooms are presented for single and double comfortable stay of guests.  If desired, you can rent a studio.  At the same time, about 168 visitors can be accommodated in two hotels.  The cost of a single room here starts with two thousand Russian rubles.  While three thousand three hundred Russian rubles in one day will cost a double room.  Four thousand rubles will cost a studio, where three people can get a good rest. </p><p>  Arkhyz is still not very rich in hotels near the ski lifts.  So to settle in one of the "Romantic" hotels is the most convenient and comfortable. </p><h2>  Budget option near the ski lift </h2><p>  This information will be useful for those who plan to arrange their activities a little more modest: Arkhyz also has separate modest houses near the main sports infrastructure of the village.  You can settle in them for only <span>five hundred rubles,</span> although all the amenities are on the street, which is not so comfortable in the winter season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhyz map" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/1033524.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Locations of tourists more distant from the ski lifts in Arkhyz </h2><p>  At a distance of about ten kilometers from the ski lifts there is the Elam Hotel and Krugozor Guest House.  In the first case, guests will be offered fifteen rooms, and only 35 beds are provided for simultaneous accommodation.  The cost of living is lower than in hotels located near the ski lifts.  Krugozor Guest House offers thirteen comfortable rooms, which can accommodate 35 people at a time.  You can find out the exact prices and book rooms suitable for the comfort level through the tourist portal of the resort village of Arkhyz. </p><h2>  One of the first resort complexes of Arkhyz </h2><p>  The Arkhyz camp site (now called the hotel) is located in the village of the same name, at an altitude of 1400 meters above sea level, on the banks of the B. Zelenchuk River.  The hotel is considered one of the first places built for tourists here.  Until recently, its quality was deteriorating, and major repairs were not carried out.  And only when the village of Arkhyz gained great popularity among spa residents, a recreation center with the same name was finally restored.  Now the complex can accommodate about 250 people in its two-story cottages.  There are smaller houses - for 7, 15 and 25 guests.  As before, all hotel rooms are without amenities (they are located on the floor).  Also for guests of the resort complex ‚ÄúArkhyz‚Äù parking for vehicles, a sauna and a sports ground are provided.  The cost of hotel accommodation starts at 500 rubles per person, without meals.  For an additional fee, you can order food.  So, three meals a day will cost 500 rubles, and a two-time (breakfast and dinner) - 400. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhyz recreation center" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/1033525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The main advantage of relaxation in the resort village of Arkhyz is the incredible, picturesque mountains.  Their peaks seem to pierce the sky, and during a small fog it is difficult to even understand where the mountains end and the sky begins.  And skiing or snowboarding amid such a landscape is a real joy for any athlete.  Have a good rest in Arkhyz! </p>
