    <p>  Since the <span>CTP</span> policy is <span>required</span> for purchase, many insurance companies began to actively offer various related services as a "cherry on a cake."  You can understand them.  After all, the more services a SK manager can sell, the higher will be his own remuneration.  But after all, each insurance costs money, and often considerable.  So is it worth buying an additional service, especially if you do not need it? </p><p>  In this article we will try to answer questions that concern each car owner.  Is it obligatory to insure life with car insurance in Ingosstrakh, RESO, Rosgosstrakh and any other organizations?  Let's think it over. </p><h2>  The imposition of additional services when applying for insurance </h2><p>  Since few people know for sure whether it is obligatory to insure life with car insurance, many insurance companies, even quite large and eminent, began to use this fact in their interests.  It got to the point that insurers began to massively refuse to issue OSAGO without acquiring additional service packages.  Moreover, all of them cannot but understand that such actions are absolutely illegal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The calculation is that few car owners want to spend their nerves and money in an attempt to assert their rights.  Approximately 70% of motorists agree with the requirements of insurers and purchase a service they do not need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it necessary to insure life with car insurance in Ingosstrakh" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1415102.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Is life insurance mandatory for car insurance?  In "Concord", "MSC", "Ingosstrakh" and other <span>insurance companies</span> know for sure that no.  But what happens in practice?  And here is what.  When you come to draw up a policy, there are a thousand and one reasons to refuse you.  But do you need to ride?  Then you have to agree to all the proposed conditions or look for another insurer. </p><h2>  What does the law say? </h2><p>  Is life insurance mandatory for car insurance?  No and no again!  And such a statement is by no means unfounded, but is confirmed by the following laws: </p><ol><li>  "About CTP" - this document does not imply the mandatory presence of any other insurance. </li><li>  "On the protection of consumer rights."  So, Art.  16.2 tells us that it is forbidden to condition the purchase of one product by the purchase of ‚Äúanother load‚Äù of another. </li><li>  Code of Administrative Offenses, Art.  15.34.1.  It provides for the responsibility of the UK for an unmotivated refusal to issue CTP, as well as forcing the purchase of an additional service.  The penalty for such an offense is 50 thousand Russian rubles. </li></ol><h2>  Why is additional insurance something optional? </h2><p>  Of course, every driver, even the most cautious and accurate, while on the road, risks his life and health.  But is it necessary to insure life with car insurance, only he can decide.  Since nowhere, in any legislative act are these types of policies mentioned together, life insurance is absolutely not connected with OSAGO.  As the main law of the state states, a person has the right to dispose of his own health and life.  Therefore, in this case, coercion is a direct violation of applicable law. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Why is this happening?  First of all, unscrupulous insurers do this.  Taking advantage of the fact that many consumers do not always know their rights and are not ready to defend them, they seek to get as much illegal profit as possible.  However, this phenomenon can and even needs to be fought. </p><h2>  How to find a suitable SK </h2><p>  For example, the question "is it obligatory to insure life with car insurance" in Uralsib will be answered only positively.  And for some reason, this <span>insurance company, according to reviews of</span> users of social networks, receives the greatest number of complaints.  However, other SKs are also not far behind. </p><p>  There are at least two of the most common tricks resorted to by unscrupulous insurers.  When you come with the intention to re-arrange insurance, the CMTPL forms suddenly end or a computer program freezes.  All interference miraculously disappears when the client agrees to take out additional insurance. </p><p>  It is very difficult to answer the question of how to find the best insurance organization.  The fact is that one and the same IC can conscientiously work in one region and allow violations in another. </p><p>  So, if you doubt whether it is obligatory to insure life when insuring a car, for example, in VSK, it is better not to go.  At least in the Ryazan region.  According to numerous reviews by car owners, they will not even explain anything to you in most offices of this insurance company.  Do not take life insurance?  Then there are no CTP forms, check back in a week.  However, it is likely that such reviews are erroneous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it necessary to insure life with car insurance in agreement" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1415108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to protect your rights: method one </h2><p>  Having read to this place, you probably already understood whether it is mandatory to insure life with car insurance.  CTP is quite possible to get without paying for additional services.  How to do it?  There are at least 3 completely legal ways.  As practice shows, they are all very active. </p><p>  Knowing about the possible difficulties with obtaining a policy, pre-stock up with a voice recorder or the presence of two witnesses.  Offer an employee of the insurance company to issue OSAGO, while indicating that you do not intend to take out any other insurance.  In this case, you can notify the manager of the UK in advance that your conversation is being recorded on the phone, voice recorder or camcorder.  If you are denied, then regardless of the reason, require written confirmation that it is impossible to issue a CTP. </p><p>  After that, you will only have to put the car in the garage and go to court.  All available evidence must be attached to the application: refusal, recording from the recorder, written testimony of witnesses, and so on. </p><p>  This method has certain advantages: </p><ul><li>  You will receive CTP without additional ‚Äúoptions‚Äù; </li><li>  you can demand from the offender a certain amount for moral damage - you were forced to use public transport and were very worried about it; </li><li>  if the car is used by you for business purposes, you can add the amount of lost profit; </li><li>  you can recover <span>real damage:</span> return money for taxi rides, bus tickets, metro tokens, and so on. </li></ul><p>  There is a drawback to this method - the trial can take about three months. </p>

    <h2>  Second way </h2><p>  For those who do not have time to wait so long and run around the courts, there is another option: </p><ul><li>  come to any insurance company; </li><li>  Declare your desire to get CTP; </li><li>  Listen to the groans of the manager that there are no forms, after which you agree to all the conditions; </li><li>  pay for all additional insurance services and get the coveted OSAGO on hand; </li><li>  the next day (or you can do the same) write a statement addressed to the head of the department of the insurance organization with a request to terminate the life insurance contract; </li><li>  as a reason you can directly indicate that you did not intend to conclude such an agreement, and the manager did not explain to you your right to refuse it; </li><li>  Attach the policy, contact phone number and bank details to the application; </li><li>  send all this to SK by registered letter with an indispensable notification of delivery and patiently wait 14 days. </li></ul>

    <p>  However, there is one underwater pebble that you should definitely pay attention to.  This refers to the penalty that you will have to pay for canceling the policy.  If it is more than 10-15% of the cost, then this makes no sense.  In this case, the method cannot be called sufficiently effective. </p><h2>  Another option: FAS </h2><p>  A visit to the Federal Antimonopoly Service (abbreviated as FAS) can also bear fruit.  True, for this you will have to get an official refusal to issue OSAGO.  As you know, they are not in a hurry to issue it to the UK. </p><p>  If they do not give you a written refusal, but do not draw up a policy without the necessary life insurance or property insurance, agree.  But when signing the document next to your signature in duplicate, write "without compulsory insurance of property (life or anything else), MTPL was refused."  Now, with your copy, feel free to go to Rospotrebnadzor or the nearest FAS branch.  There you will be helped to restore your rights, and SK will be fined. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Since today most car owners are still not ready to assert their rights, many insurance organizations continue to pursue their illegal customer service policies.  To turn the tide, you must be sure to respond to each such case.  Since you now know for sure whether it is mandatory to insure life with car insurance at MSC, Sogaz, Prominstrakh, NASKO or any other company in Russia, you will no longer be able to impose an unnecessary addition on you. </p>
