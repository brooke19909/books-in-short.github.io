One option for such educational entertainment can be called Sudoku.  However, some have not heard about such a game, let alone knowledge of the rules or other interesting points.  Thanks to the article, you will learn all the necessary information, for example, how to solve Sudoku, as well as their rules and types. </p><h2>  General </h2><p>  Sudoku is a puzzle.  Sometimes difficult, difficult to discover, but always interesting and addictive to any person who decides to play this game.  The name comes from Japanese: ‚Äúsu‚Äù means ‚Äúnumber‚Äù, and ‚Äúdock‚Äù means ‚Äústanding apart‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve sudoku" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/398053.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <p>  Not everyone knows how to solve sudoku.  Complex puzzles, for example, can be done either by smart, well-thought-out beginners, or by professionals who practice the game for more than one day.  Just so take and in five minutes to solve the task will be far from everyone is possible. </p><h2>  rules </h2><p>  So how to solve sudoku.  The rules are very simple and straightforward; remembering them is easy.  However, do not think that simple rules promise a ‚Äúpainless‚Äù solution;  you have to think a lot, apply logical and strategic thinking, strive to recreate the picture.  Probably, you need to love the numbers to solve Sudoku. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, a square of 9 x 9 cells is drawn.  Then, in bold lines, it is divided into the so-called ‚Äúregions‚Äù with three squares in each.  The result is 81 cells, which ultimately must be completely filled with numbers.  This is the difficulty: the numbers from 1 to 9 arranged around the entire perimeter should not be repeated either in the ‚Äúregions‚Äù (3 x 3 squares), or in vertical and / or horizontal lines.  In any sudoku, some filled cells are initially present.  Without this, the game is simply impossible, because otherwise it would not be a solution, but an invention.  The complexity of the puzzle depends on the number of numbers.  Sophisticated sudoku contain few numbers, often arranged in such a way that you have to smash your head pretty much before solving them.  In the lungs, about half of the numbers are already in place, making it easier to unravel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve Sudoku difficult" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/398051.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Fully Examined Example </h2><p>  It is difficult to understand how to solve sudoku, if there is no specific sample, step by step showing how, where and what you need to insert.  The provided picture is considered uncomplicated, since many mini-squares are already filled with the necessary numbers.  By the way, it is on them that we will rely for a solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve sudoku. rules" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/397280.jpg" width="500"></div>

For example, the second column on the left fits perfectly; there are only two numbers missing.  If you look at those that already exist, it becomes obvious that there are not enough 5 and 9 in empty cells on the second and eighth lines.  With the five, everything is not clear yet, it can be both there and there, but if you look at the nine, everything becomes clear.  Since the second line already has the number 9 (in the seventh column), it means that there should be no repetitions, the nine should be put down, on the 8th line.  By adding an exception, add 5 to the 2nd row - and now we already have one filled column. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve sudoku" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/397275.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In a similar way, you can solve the entire sudoku puzzle, but in more complex cases, when in a single column, row or square, there are not enough pairs of numbers, but much more, you will have to use a slightly different method.  We will also analyze it now. </p><p>  This time we take as a basis the middle ‚Äúregion‚Äù, in which there are not enough five digits: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. We fill each cell not with large effective numbers, but with small, ‚Äúrough‚Äù ones.  We simply write in each box those numbers that are not enough and which may be there due to their shortage.  In the upper cell it is 5, 6, 7 (3 on this line is already in the ‚Äúregion‚Äù on the right, and 8 on the left);  in the cell on the left there can be 5, 6, 7;  in the very middle - 5, 6, 7;  on the right - 5, 7, 8;  from the bottom - 3, 5, 6. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve Sudoku" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/397276.jpg" width="500"></div>  So, now we look at which mini-numbers contain different numbers from the others.  3: there is only in one place, in the rest it is not.  So, it can be corrected to a large one.  5, 6 and 7 are in at least two cells, which means we leave them alone.  8 is only in one, which means that the remaining digits disappear and you can leave the eight. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve sudoku" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/397277.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Alternating these two methods, we continue to solve sudoku.  In our example, we will use the first method, however, it should be recalled that in complex variations the second is necessary.  Without it, it will be extremely difficult. </p><p>  By the way, when the middle seven was found in the upper ‚Äúregion‚Äù, it can be removed from the mini-numbers of the middle square.  If you do this, you will notice that there is only 7 left in that region, so you can only leave it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to solve sudoku. rules" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/397278.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Sudoku puzzles are different.  In some cases, a prerequisite is the absence of the same numbers, not only in rows, columns and mini-squares, but also on the diagonal.

One way or another, how to solve Sudoku, at least the basic rule that applies to any species, you know.  This will always help to cope with a puzzle of any complexity, the main thing is to try your best to achieve your goal. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
