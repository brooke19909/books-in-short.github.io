    <h2>  What are the reasons for the 2001 Irkutsk tragedy? </h2><p>  According to preliminary data, the cause of the disaster was a panic on the part of crew members who were unable to recognize and neutralize ‚Äústalling the plane during a landing approach in time‚Äù. </p><p>  According to experts, the crew was heavily worn out, since on the day of the accident it flew for approximately 20,953 hours and made over 11,387 flights from the take-off and landing cycle.  Such an extraordinary fate was waiting for this powerful Tu-154 airliner.  Irkutsk (plane crash) interrupted the lives of 145 people, including 9 crew members and 136 ordinary passengers. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plane crash irkutsk 2001" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/1084111.jpg"></div>  This terrible disaster in 2006 </h2><p>  On July 9, 2006, the third Irkutsk accident occurred.  This time the catastrophe happened with the participation of the Airbus A310-324 airliner, flying from Moscow to Irkutsk.  From the data of the commission for the investigation of the accident, it is known that as a result of improper and uncoordinated actions of the crew, one of the engines accidentally deactivated. </p><p>  As a result, when landing at the Irkutsk airport, the plane rolled out of the runway and, without timely braking, collided with a garage complex.  So there was a new plane crash (Irkutsk, 2006), which claimed the lives of 125 people (among them - 8 crew members and 195 passengers), 63 people received injuries and injuries of varying severity. </p><h2>  Investigation and planned investigation </h2><p>  The negligence of the crew, which led to the tragedy, caused a lot of negativity and public indignation.  In search of the causes and perpetrators of the accident, relatives of the victims stormed the Siberia Airlines office and repeatedly turned to private detective agencies for help. </p><p>  The very investigation to investigate the causes of the disaster lasted exactly two years and five months.  The total volume of materials involved in the trial amounted to 55 volumes.  During this time, more than 10 different versions of the incident were put forward, 339 forensic, 205 medical and 128 genetic examinations were performed. </p><p>  According to the results of the investigation, erroneous and uncontrolled actions of crew members carried out during the <span>landing of the aircraft</span> were announced <span>.</span>  The plane crash (Irkutsk) of 2006 led to all this. </p>
