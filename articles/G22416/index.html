    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  What is a Conscience card?  This is bank plastic from Qiwi-Bank.  He appeared in Russia in early 2017. </p><p>  With this card people can buy goods on credit without overpayments.  That is, they are given a kind of installment plan.  It is very comfortable.  "Conscience" is an installment card.  It is in some cases called an interest-free credit card. </p><p>  But is it that simple?  What do customers say about the product being studied?  How can I get this plastic? </p><h2>  Customer requirements </h2><p>  We found out what a Conscience card is.  This is plastic with interest-free installments.  It operates only in Russia. </p><p>  What do you need to get a card?  This will require: </p><ul><li>  to come of age; </li><li>  have an official income; </li><li>  have a good history of loans; </li><li>  not have debts on loans; </li><li>  be a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  It's all.  Foreigners will not be able to use the Conscience card.  It is possible that over time a similar opportunity will be offered to foreign citizens.  After all, the studied plastic appeared recently.  Its services and options are being actively developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="application for a card conscience" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2058180.jpg"></div>

The design of this plastic is made in different ways.  Everyone decides what to do. </p><p>  In general, you can order a card from Qiwi: </p><ul><li>  leaving an application in person at the bank‚Äôs representative office (Svyaznoy or Geobank); </li><li>  by filling out an electronic form on a special site. </li></ul><p>  Most often, citizens use the second method.  At the beginning of 2017, it was possible to use plastic only in Moscow.  Since the spring of that year, the Conscience card began to be issued all over Russia.  Therefore, now everyone will be able to test it.  Making a credit card takes about 10-15 minutes.  Getting it is easier than it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  Steps to use </h2><p>  And how to use the interest-free installment plan "Conscience"?  Making an application for the release of plastic is only half the battle.  There‚Äôs something else to do. </p><p>  The first use of the Sovest card can be represented as follows: </p><ol><li>  Application for the release of plastic.  About how to do this, we will describe below with all the details. </li><li>  Confirmation of operation. </li><li>  Getting a bank card on hand.  For example, courier service. </li><li>  Document activation. </li><li>  Making the first purchase. </li></ol><p>  If you believe the numerous customer reviews, then activation of the plastic can cause problems.  Some say that they have issued a Conscience card, but they cannot use it.  After all, activation was refused.  This is a normal occurrence.  Qiwi may refuse the procedure without giving reasons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conscience interest-free installment card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2058179.jpg"></div>

This is a plastic offering to buy on credit without overpayments.  Very comfortably!  Especially if you pay bills on time and have a good credit history. </p><p>  Consider the procedure for filing an application for making a card via the Internet.  This scenario is quite common. </p><p>  Actions are reduced to the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Go to sovest.com.  To do this, you must use any browser. </li><li>  In the upper right corner or in the center of the page that appears, click on the "Apply for" button. </li><li>  Fill in the free fields.  Mandatory areas are marked with a "*". </li><li>  Click on "Checkout" / "Confirm". </li><li>  Wait for the operator to call. </li><li>  Report card order confirmation.  At this point, you can agree on the delivery of plastic by courier. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now after some time (the waiting time for the card varies from a few days to a couple of weeks), the plastic will be delivered to the applicant.  After that, you can activate the product. </p><h2>  Personal appeal </h2><p>  Reviews for the Kiwi card (Conscience) are left different.  But many citizens are happy that you can get this plastic in different places throughout Russia.  For example, in the network of stores "Svyaznoy". </p><p>  To personally draw up a card, you must: </p><ol><li>  Take along your passport and income statements (preferably). </li><li>  Contact any office "Messenger". </li><li>  Inform employees about the desire to receive a "Conscience" card. </li><li>  Fill out the application and give it to employees. </li><li>  Get bank plastic. </li></ol><p>  Sometimes cards are issued immediately, in some cases you have to wait a few days.  But personal design of plastic is the fastest technique.  And they should not be neglected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi card conscience reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2058182.jpg"></div>

What's next? </p><p>  Now the Conscience card needs to be activated.  A similar process is faced by all credit card holders.  But in our case, activation is non-standard. </p><p>  The client needs to write numbers from the plastic in the SMS message (there will be 16 of them) and send a letter to 5152. After that, the card will be activated.  In response to the request, the holder of plastic "Conscience" will receive a message with a PIN code.  With its help, it remains only to make the first purchase. </p><p>  Reviews about the Kiwi card (Conscience) indicate that very often when sending SMS, customers receive messages with activation denials.  It turns out that there is always a risk that the credit card will be issued, but never used for the entire period of service. </p><h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  Which bank issues a Conscience card?  As we have said, this product is offered by Qiwi-Bank.  This is a fairly large and well-known organization, it can be trusted. </p><p>  What features of the Sovest card are offered to customers.  It is worth paying attention to the following features: </p><ul><li>  free courier delivery; </li><li>  free registration of plastic; </li><li>  SMS informing - 0 rubles; </li><li>  card validity period - 60 months; </li><li>  loan rate - 0%; </li><li>  1st year of service - 290 rubles; </li><li>  reissue, subsequent years of service - 590 rubles; </li><li>  the maximum limit of funds is 300 thousand rubles; </li><li>  minimum funds on the card - 5,000 rubles; </li><li>  loan term - up to 1 year (usually 3-4 months). </li></ul><p>  From the foregoing, it follows that Conscience is a pretty tempting proposition.  This plastic attracts with its features.  Only everything is not as simple as it seems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of conscience moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2058183.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  In arrears </h2><p>  What is the card "Conscience", we found out.  This product allows you to buy things in installments.  What happens if a person does not pay on time? </p><p>  Then the interest-free bonus burns out.  For each month of delay, 290 rubles are levied, and a penalty of 10% per annum appears.  This must be remembered by every Qiwi customer.  Conscientious plastic holders will not face such sanctions.  And if you pay your bills on time, then Conscience will have more advantages than disadvantages.  The card completely copes with its tasks. </p><h2>  Cash </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of the Conscience card is that you cannot withdraw cash from it.  This is indicated by many holders of such plastic. </p><p>  But you can replenish the card account through ATMs or terminals.  For some, the fact that cash cannot be withdrawn from Conscience is a repulsion.  They do not warn about him when making plastic.  This is really a minus.  Perhaps one of the most significant.  But he is not a reason for rejecting the offer. </p>

    <h2>  Features of payment for goods </h2><p>  What is a Conscience card?  With it, people in Russia can make purchases on credit without any overpayments.  It would seem a perfect alignment.  But in reality, everything is not so simple. </p><p>  Why?  You can pay with the Qiwi Conscience card only at the partner stores of the bank.  There are a little more than 45 pieces.  In other stores, plastic does not work. </p><p>  In fact, Conscience is a means of attracting new customers to specific outlets.  And therefore, some may find the map useless.  Qiwi has many partners.  But not everyone makes purchases at these outlets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card conscience which bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2058186.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About partners </h2><p>  In what stores will the Conscience card work?  Typically, this product is "compatible" with major Russian retail outlets.  In small shops, the credit card will not work. </p><p>  The following stores can be distinguished among Qiwi partners: </p><ul><li>  "Shatura". </li><li>  "M Video". </li><li>  The Messenger. </li><li>  AeroFlot. </li><li>  Euroset. </li><li>  Lego. </li><li>  "Ile de Beaute". </li><li>  CityLink. </li><li>  LaModa. </li><li>  Xiaomi </li><li>  "I'll be Mom." </li><li>  "Daughters and sons." </li><li>  "Yves Rocher." </li><li>  "LitRes". </li><li>  "Massage Paradise". </li><li>  "The Snow Queen". </li><li>  "585 / Gold." </li><li>  Delivery Club. </li><li>  Sunlight. </li><li>  Samsung </li><li>  TopShop. </li><li>  TiniDil. </li><li>  4Game. </li><li>  iHerb. </li><li>  "Platypus". </li><li>  "Burger King". </li><li>  "Annex Tour". </li><li>  "Planet Sports". </li><li>  "Tasty Kofi." </li></ul><p>  That is not all.  The full list of partner stores is worth checking out on sovest.com.  There, in the "Where to Buy" section, you will have to set your region of residence.  After that, a complete list of Qiwi partners will appear on the screen.  Every month there are more and more of them.  Local retailers are also beginning to accept Conscience cards. </p>
