    <p>  To the beach, guests will have to overcome at least four hundred meters, as the hotel is located on the third coastline.  The choice of tourists is provided with two beaches - "Pra-Nang" and "Noppharatta".  The hotel complex is located approximately halfway to them, so vacationers can explore the sights of both beach areas during the holidays.  From the main international airport of Krabi to get to Aonang Nagapura Resort Spa 4 * far enough.  Tourists will need to drive a little over forty kilometers.  Usually, a comfortable minibus delivers them to the resting place, the host is responsible for the meeting of our compatriots. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Brief description of beach areas </h2><p>  Since Aonang Nagapura Resort Spa 4 * (Krabi) is located away from the beach, on foot this path will take at least half an hour.  Walking in the heat will be rather inconvenient, therefore guests of the hotel complex prefer to use the services of tuk-tuk.  The trip will cost tourists about twenty baht per person and take no more than five minutes. </p><p>  The beaches mentioned above delight vacationers with white sand and clear water.  However, it is worth considering that they are practically not equipped.  In some places there are sun loungers for rent to tourists.  Along the coast, cafes and massage parlors are randomly located, where for a small fee you will get a wide selection of services.  In general, the beaches are great for families with children, as the ebb is not too noticeable and there is a gentle entrance to the water. </p><h2>  Infrastructure facilities </h2><p>  The hotel has a magnificent swimming pool, it is very popular among vacationers.  The bowl has a separate section for children and an unusual bar.  It is made, like the entire hotel complex, in Thai style and begins its work almost immediately after breakfast.  The pool has two small slides.  In the reviews about Aonang Nagapura Resort Spa 4 * (Krabi), the rest area around the tourists is also very highly rated.  Here is everything that guests may need.  All guests can take beach towels to put on a sunbed.  They are issued without collateral and absolutely free. </p>
