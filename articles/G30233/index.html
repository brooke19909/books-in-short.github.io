  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best beaches of Hainan: review, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A few miles from the tip of Guangdong in southern China is a beautiful island.  It is a land of dense forest mountains and remote alpine villages surrounded by palm trees, long sandy beaches and soft turquoise waters of the South China Sea.  The island itself remained out of sight until the 30s of the last century.  At that time, representatives of his indigenous people, Lee, still lived as hunter-gatherers.  Today, the best beaches in Hainan are a favorite vacation spot not only for discerning Chinese travelers.  It is increasingly gaining popularity among residents of other countries around the world.  According to the reviews of numerous tourists, Hainan in March is the most favorable for recreation.  Among all these places there are also favorites. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  This is the southernmost province of China and the only tropical island in the country.  Average annual temperatures of 22–26 <sup>°</sup> C make the region a suitable place to relax during the winter holidays.  The island is also a popular destination for exploring nature and culture, from scuba diving and discovering tropical plants and animals to rafting and exploring the folk customs of ethnic minorities. </p><p>  Colossal temples and impressive palaces, serene streams and lush rainforests, botanical gardens, mysterious caves and traditional villages - all this can be found in this rapidly developing place. </p><p>  In addition to the beaches, on the island you can see many other attractions. </p><p>  The majestic Nanshan Temple in Sanya was built to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of Buddhism in China.  Luhuitou Park on top of the mountain of the same name offers visitors a stunning panoramic view of Sanya.  Tourists can explore the park in the crater of the volcano in Haikou.  Rainforests, valleys, waterfalls and springs are located in the cultural tourism zone of Yanoda Rainforest.  Old Tsilou Street, the historical part of Haikou, is known for its fusion of European and Asian architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hainan is striving to become not only the largest resort, but also set itself the ambitious goal of becoming the country's southern center for technological innovation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hainan island" class="if uuid-3207375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207375.jpg"></div><h2>  Sanya Bay (Hainan) </h2><p>  This place is perfect for relaxing in winter, the average temperature in January is 23 ° C.  This is one of the most accessible beaches on the island, a long strip of sand washed by the cleanest and quietest waters in the area. </p><p>  In winter, from mid-December to the end of February, it is cool and comfortable, the sea is still warm, and t-shirts can be worn on the beach.  The Hainan East Ring High Speed ​​Railway connects Haikou with Sanya. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, the advantages of this place of rest include: </p><ul><li>  7-kilometer white sandy crescent-shaped beach; </li><li>  world-class golf course; </li><li>  green hills offering coolness and shade for relaxation from sunny beaches; </li><li>  a large number of hotels. </li></ul><p>  One of the hotels, Horizon Resort Spa, is one of Hainan's hotels with its own beach.  It is adjacent to the central Yalong Bay Square and Yalong Bay International Golf Club. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunnyhainan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Bay" class="if uuid-3207373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207373.jpg"></div><h2>  Dadonghai Bay </h2><p>  On the island of Hainan, this picturesque place, it is one of the three most popular tropical coastal tourist regions.  Located between the hills of Tuva and Luhuitou, about 4 km southeast of the center of Sanya.  Particularly favorable natural conditions, combined with convenient transport and excellent amenities make it an ideal place to relax. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Dadonghai Bay is surrounded by hills on three sides.  The location near the southern point of China provides the area with pleasant weather throughout the year.  The water temperature is 20 ° C even in winter.  One of the most popular activities here is diving. </p><p>  Tourists respond positively to the numerous open-air restaurants, bars with live music;  pleasantly surprised by Russian-speaking staff in hotels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="w-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yalung Bay" class="if uuid-3207367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207367.jpg"></div><h2>  Dragon Bay </h2><p>  This is how the name of Yalongwan Bay (Hainan) is translated from Chinese.  It is considered one of the most beautiful places not only on the island, but throughout China.  The water here is so clear that even at a depth of ten meters, you can perfectly see the exotic fish living in coral reefs.  The hills around the bay are covered with tropical forests, on their slopes are mango, banana and coconut plantations. </p><h2>  The narrowest beach in the world </h2><p>  There is an own record holder on the island.  Boao, Hainan's Jade Belt Beach, where the three Wangquan, Jiuqiu and Longgong rivers flow into the South China Sea, is a narrow, long sandy strip.  It itself is very different from all others located in this region.  Its length is 8.5 km and its width is from 10 to 500 meters.  First of all, this place is famous for its seafood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ecns.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jade Beach" class="if uuid-3207368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207368.jpg"></div><h2>  Yalong Bay </h2><p>  This bay is very suitable for snorkeling (snorkelling).  About 15 miles southeast of Sanya, a crescent-shaped sandy beach in Yalong Bay is located next to a coastal park with many wildflowers. </p><p>  Famous resort hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton Sanya and Park Hyatt Sanya Sunny Bay are located here, with an average water temperature of 25 degrees all year round. </p><p>  You can relax on public beaches, but they are usually crowded.  The best option is private beaches owned by hotels, but only guests can access them. </p><p>  The area is especially popular with shopping enthusiasts.  Haitang is a 30-minute drive east of Sanya city center, more than twice as long as Yalong Bay.  Here is the China Duty Free Mall, the world's largest duty-free shopping mall with Chanel, Estee Lauder and many other international brands. </p><p>  According to tourists, this is one of the best beaches in Hainan, it has a very clear sea, excellent and varied cuisine, friendly and polite staff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelmanagement.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of hainan hotel" class="if uuid-3207372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207372.jpg"></div><h2>  Hahai bay </h2><p>  The main attraction here is the local flavor.  The sandy beach of Houhai Bay is a quiet place surrounded by hills and forest.  While his sleepy fishing village is only developing for tourism, this area can be called truly “local”.  Here you can rent a kayak, go snorkelling or go hiking in the hills for a picnic.  It can rightly be called the best beach in Hainan. </p><h2>  West island </h2><p>  Best suited for outdoor activities.  It is located about eight miles west of Sanya and a short boat ride from Xiaoqi Port.  Tropical West Island is suitable for both day trips and overnight stays if fairly simple homestays are suitable for tourists.  Thanks to its good visibility (up to 15 meters), it is an ideal place for snorkelling and diving, as well as walking, fishing, archery and camping. </p><p>  There are also some fantastic seafood restaurants, such as the Sea Story, a 15-minute walk north of the center along the road that was built from the old parts of the boat.  It is not surprising that tourists are enthusiastic about local cuisine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dadonghai Bay" class="if uuid-3207369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207369.jpg"></div><h2>  Ri Yue Bay </h2><p>  There is a reason Hainan is called Hawaii of Asia.  Halfway between Sanya and Boao, this bay is located on the east coast.  Experienced surfers can rent boards and wetsuits at the beachfront restaurant, operated by Surfing Hainan, where beginners can also take classes. </p><p>  The competitions of the International Surfing Association are held there: from the ISA World Surfing Championship in January to the paddleboarding World Championships (swimming on a surfboard with a paddle) in November.  This place is one of the best beaches in Hainan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunnyhainan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wuzhizhou beach" class="if uuid-3207370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3207370.jpg"></div><h2>  Wuizhou </h2><p>  It is well suited for beginner divers.  Located 20 minutes by ferry from the mainland near Haitan Bay, surrounded by sheltered coral waters abounding in marine life, this is a fascinating place for diving - from half-hour trial tasting lessons to swimming all day. </p><p>  This is the very first place in China where diving has been put on a commercial basis.  It is rightly called the Maldives of China.  Beautiful landscapes around the island can be explored during the tour “Plant World” and the colorful “Underwater World”.  However, tourists who want to dive under the water should consider that it is better to arrive early because there are always long lines. </p><p>  The sea here is great for surfing, there is a big reef.  The territories in the north and west of the island are relatively flat, and snow-white sandy beaches are the norm.  The water along these shores is clear, with visibility up to 27 m. This is a real boon for diving. </p><p>  According to tourists, this is one of the most attractive places for outdoor activities, incredibly clear water and attentive staff. </p><p>  One of the most popular hotels here is Wuzhizhou Island Sanya. </p>
