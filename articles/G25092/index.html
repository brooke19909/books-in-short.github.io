    <p>  Experts say that reading with this e-book is fully consistent with the comfort of paper media.  Users confirm this.  The appearance of the pages of the book and the screen of the reader is practically no different.  The display is one of the strengths of the presented model. </p><p>  Also note that the screen has a backlight.  Reading in the dark will also be comfortable.  Previously, a special flashlight was used for e-books in the dark.  He was installed on the body with clothespins.  In the presented model, this will not be required.  The backlight is pleasing to the eye.  She does not tire.  Her color is white.  The display is lit from the side, so the rays do not blind, do not irritate the eye. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  <span>Reviews of PocketBook 615</span> Plus speak of typical work speed for e-books.  At the same time, readers note that this fact does not cause discomfort.  You can quickly scroll through menu items, open applications, play and turn pages. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the reader speed is significantly inferior, for example, to a smartphone.  However, for an e-book this is a typical occurrence.  Such devices cannot be called slow.  The presented model proved to be good on the job. </p><p>  The processor of the presented e-book received a power of 1 GHz.  There is enough internal memory to load about 5 books.  If necessary, you can optionally connect an external drive.  Its maximum capacity can be up to 32 GB.  Of the internal memory of 8 GB during operation, about 7 GB is available. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  According to <span>reviews, the PocketBook 615 Plus e-book</span> can last quite a while without recharging.  This procedure will need to be carried out once a month or even less frequently.  However, this is true when the user reads the reader a couple of hours a day. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="PocketBook 615 Plus Owner Reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/2133616.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This is due to the features of the screen.  The fact is that battery consumption only occurs when the picture on the display changes.  This, for example, can be turning a page, managing menu items, etc. When a stationary picture (a book page) is set on the screen, the device practically does not require battery power. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  <span>Reviews on the PocketBook 615 e-book are</span> provided not only by users, but also by experts.  They claim that the model has sufficient functionality.  One of the main advantages of the e-book of the presented model is the ability to read 18 text formats.  Almost no other reader can boast of such qualities. </p><p>  The e-book provides for the presence of 4 dictionaries.  You can use the menu to open a special application and translate the word.  A similar function can be used when reading text.  It is enough to select a word, and then the program will show its translation. </p><p>  The appearance of the text can be customized to suit your taste preferences.  Additional applications will help you get distracted if you don‚Äôt want to read at the moment.  The most popular simple games can be found on the menu.  You can also use a calculator or calendar. </p><h2>  Expert Reviews </h2><p>  Considering the <span>reviews about the PocketBook 615 Plus</span> that experts leave, we can note a lot of advantages of the presented model over analogues.  The device has become a bestseller in a short time.  Its reasonable cost and high quality screen make many buyers choose this particular e-book among a variety of offers. </p><p>  The model can not boast of a touch screen, but the button control is quite simple.  The presence of backlighting and full compliance of the image with the book sheets also did not go unnoticed by experts.  They argue that when reading does not appear discomfort, the eyes do not get tired for a long time.  This effect persists even when reading in the dark.  Thoughtful lighting does not hit the eye.  This allows you to read for a long time even in the dark. </p><p>  Low power consumption is also, according to experts, an advantage of the presented model.  You can take the reader with you on a trip without worrying that the battery will run out.  The provision of a two-year warranty on the presented device is also its advantage over competitors.  Analog e-books of other brands provide only 1 year of warranty service for their products. </p><h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  <span>The reviews of the owners of PocketBook 615 Plus are</span> mostly positive.  However, there are some negative comments.  So, users note that the presence of a cover in the kit would improve the comfort of operation of the book.  Experts say that you can purchase such an accessory separately.  If it were included in the kit, the price of the reader would be higher. </p><p>  Also, some users note some slowness of the e-book.  However, for almost all devices designed solely for reading, this is the norm.  Smartphones, of course, are much faster.  However, such a speed is quite enough for a reader. </p><p>  Some users note that getting used to button control causes some inconvenience.  However, literally after a few days, no discomfort during management is noticed.  In general, this is a fairly high-quality device.  Minor flaws absolutely do not affect reading comfort. </p><h2>  Positive customer reviews </h2><p>  It should be noted that almost 98% of the users who participated in the survey leave positive <span>reviews about the PocketBook 615 Plus.</span>  This device is known for its functionality, ease of operation, as well as resistance to adverse conditions. </p><p>  It is convenient to read the text on the screen even to a person with low vision, the font size and style can be customized as you wish.  The battery holds a charge for a very long time.  Even with daily reading, it will not need to be charged more often than 1 time per month. </p><p>  E-book supports many formats.  In our country, one of the most popular book types of text is FB2.  American devices, such as the Kindle, do not support it.  The PocketBook e-book is free from such shortcomings.  Whatever format the user downloads, he can read it using this reader.  This is a reliable, stylish device.  With it, it is convenient to read books in almost any light.  Low cost also stimulates increased demand for the presented model. </p><p>  Having examined the features of <span>PocketBook 615 Plus, reviews of</span> experts and customers, we can conclude that the device is highly functional and quality.  At a relatively low cost, the presented reader can compete with many more expensive models of other brands. </p>
