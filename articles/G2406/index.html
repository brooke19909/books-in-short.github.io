    <h2>  From the depths of centuries </h2><p>  The past of Ayia Napa Monastery is shrouded in mystery.  The appearance of the building is explained by romantic local legends.  The first of them plunges us into the world of the distant past, when in the territories now occupied by the monastery, there was such a dense forest that it was possible to hunt here.  It was during the search for prey that one of the hunters noticed a strange light coming from one of the caves.  Moving closer, he discovered the icon of the Virgin, which, most likely, was left here by monks of the 12th-13th centuries to save from iconoclasm.  This amazing find gave the name to the holy place.  So, the word "napa" in Greek means "forest", and "ayah" - holy.  The icon originally found in the forest cave was called the Virgin of Napa, but then it was reduced to Ayia Napa.  Learning about the holy find, crowds of believers poured here and not far from the cave in the 15th century a small church was erected, which gradually grew to a monastery.  Nearby was a source of clean water, which later began to be attributed miraculous power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second legend is more tragic.  A rich girl could not marry for love, because her chosen one was an ordinary commoner, and her parents categorically did not give consent to marriage.  In despair, the beautiful woman, whose name history did not preserve, got a haircut as a nun and began to live in a dark cave in a thicket of forest.  Later, wealthy parents built a church and cells there.  The monastery gradually grew, becoming a monastery that has survived to this day. </p><p>  We cannot know whether the facts included in the legends are reliable, but it is known for certain that the Ayia Napa monastery appeared in the 15th century, when Cyprus was under the rule of Byzantium. </p>

    <h2>  Facts from the story </h2><p>  The amazing cloister has a rather unusual story.  She repeatedly changed her mission from a male monastery to a female monastery, religion from Catholicism to Orthodoxy, but did not undergo serious metamorphoses in architecture.  The conquest of the Ottomans entailed the expulsion of the local clergy, and the monastery became Orthodox.  This monastery was abandoned in the 18th century, the reasons that prompted the monks to leave their usual cells remained unclear.  From this period, Ayia Napa has remained abandoned. </p><p>  The monastery was restored in the 50s of the last century, it was then that the monastery was put in order, and now it is open to numerous visitors.  Previously, it was a temple of the Cypriot Orthodox Church, now it is a museum where you can admire the features of the church decoration of past eras. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
