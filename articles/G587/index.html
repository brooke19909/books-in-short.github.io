    <h2>  Country features </h2><p>  Serbia has always been a connecting bridge between east and west of Europe, due to which many trade routes passed through the territory of this country.  Such a favorable geographical position and natural wealth allowed it to grow and develop very quickly.  That is why, visiting this country, you can see here many ancient fortresses, medieval cities and monasteries.  The history of Serbia is full of amazing events that you can learn about by visiting the country's museums.  Most of all, the country is famous for its healing resorts.  This was accompanied by a temperate climate in which it is located, as well as many sources of minerals that are found throughout the territory.  More than 20 world-class clinics have been created here.  They are engaged in the prevention and treatment of almost all known diseases.  That is why the purpose of the arrival of many people in Europe was Serbia.  A visa to this country is not required for most guests, which makes its popularity in the world of tourism even higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do i need a visa to serbia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/395778.jpg?1400010830090" width="500"></div>

This right applies even if entry into the territory of the state is from Kosovo.  Residents of Belarus can also enjoy such privileges.  But according to the laws, the period of stay in Serbia should not exceed 30 calendar days.  So, if the purpose of the visit is to study or work, then you will need to draw up all the necessary documents.  As for the residents of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, they were less fortunate in this matter - for a trip to <strong> </strong>  Serbia need a visa without fail.  The rules for its design are exactly the same as when traveling to any other country.  It is necessary to provide all the necessary documents, and within 2-3 days the permission will be ready. </p><p>  If the goal of Ukrainian citizens is to travel through the country, you will need to apply for a <span>transit visa.</span>  For this, in addition to the usual documents, you also need permission to enter the state where the trip is made.  After that, stay in the country will be allowed no more than four days, depending on the destination.  Since Serbia entered the <span>Schengen area</span> , residents of this country do not need a visa to travel to most European countries.  They can freely stay on their territory for up to 90 days.  As for the trip to Russia, then the period is not more than 30 days.  And to visit Ukraine it is enough to have a ticket from the hotel in which the room is booked. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  When the purpose of staying in Serbia is work or study, then even a citizen of the Russian Federation will need to issue all permits to extend the period of stay.  The list of documents will be exactly the same as for a number of other countries sealed by the Schengen agreement.  Also, in accordance with migration legislation, you need to have medical insurance that can cover costs of at least 20,000 euros, and funds for a normal stay in Serbia.  But in reality, these details are almost never checked. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="need a visa to serbia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/395780.jpg?1400010775682" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  "Another Serbia".  Visa to Kosovo </h2><p>  On July 1, 2013, Kosovo adopted a decree according to which 89 countries, which included Russia, must have a visa to enter the republic.  In order for the consulate to consider the application, you must have the following documents. </p><p>  - Application form completed in Serbian, English or Albanian; </p><p>  - international passport; </p><p>  - color photo 3.5 * 4.5 cm; </p><p>  - tickets indicating the place of travel, or vouchers for a booked hotel room. </p><p>  Copies of all documents must be submitted at registration, and a consular fee will also have to be paid immediately.  The maximum visa processing period is 90 calendar days, the only way to extend it (by another one) is to contact the Kosovo Citizenship Department directly.  Mandatory is the availability of medical insurance that can cover treatment in the amount of 30,000 euros.  If you have a multiple- <span>entry Schengen visa,</span> stay in Kosovo is allowed for fifteen days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serbia visa for Russians" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/395779.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say with confidence that for those who want to see all the beauty of pristine nature, as well as get the opportunity to improve their health, Serbia will be the best choice.  A visa to this country will not be a problem, since in most cases it is not necessary at all.  But even in situations where its design is mandatory, it will not take much time.  And, more importantly, high financial costs. </p>
