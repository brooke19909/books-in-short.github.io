    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  On the territory of the hotel, all vacationers are provided with round-the-clock access to wireless high-speed Internet.

The polite and friendly hosts will not only tell you where to buy excursions, but also tell you about the most beautiful places in Budva and its environs. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Unfortunately, Villa Nikolaselena 3 * (Montenegro), like most hotels in the city, does not have its own beach.  Judging by the description of tour operators, only 500 meters to the coast, in fact, a calm step to go to the sea in about 15-20 minutes.  You will find yourself on a pebble beach, quite clean.  Here for an additional fee you can rent sports equipment, sun loungers and umbrellas.  We advise you to take care of special bathing shoes in advance - there are a lot of large stones at the bottom of the Adriatic Sea, so the probability of injuring your leg is quite high.  Moreover, sea urchins are quite common on the coast, the ‚Äúbite‚Äù of which is dangerous for vacationers. </p>

    <p>  The distance from the coast, or rather, the long, and sometimes tiring road to the beach for some tourists has become a drawback of the Villa Nikolaselena 3 * hotel (Montenegro, Budva), especially for those who came to the sea with small children.  That is why, even at the planning stage, it is better to abandon this option if you are used to relaxing on the first coastline and do not want to burden yourself with a tedious road. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you, as a tourist, are not confused by the remoteness from the beach, Villa Nikolaselena 3 * in Budva will suit you well.  You will find a cordial attitude, hospitality of the owners who are trying to create amazing conditions for each guest.  Caring and attention bribes many; I want to return to the hotel again and again.  But is this not the main indicator of quality? </p>
