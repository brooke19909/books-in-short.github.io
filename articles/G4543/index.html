    <h2>  Black Sea new building.  How it all started </h2><p>  The sanatorium "Blue Wave" (Gelendzhik), whose photos are presented in the article, began its existence in the distant 1964.  It was then that the board of the Rostov regional union of consumer cooperation made the decision to build a large recreation center in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSolntsedar.  After settling all issues, 5 hectares of land on the bay shore were allotted for the remake.  These few hectares of land were more like a huge swampy wasteland with sparse vegetation.  Nikolai Ivanovich Sheiko became the person who led this grandiose construction project, and part-time as the first director of the camp site.  By the beginning of next year's season, the wasteland began its transformation.  Several dozen wooden houses and a small dining room were built.  June 1, 1965 the tourist town met its first vacationers, almost 500 people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Development dynamics </h2><p>  The development of the complex continued throughout the following years.  In the period 1966-1982.  two residential and one administrative buildings appeared on its territory, a dining room consisting of two halls (with a total capacity of 900 people), its own boiler room, library buildings and a cinema hall.  Since the construction of the indoor pool in 1982, the tourist center has the opportunity to work all year round.  The Blue Wave sanatorium type pension received its status in 1996.  And since 2000, a complete phased reconstruction of the health resort began. </p><h2>  Development in 1999-2001 </h2><p>  Since the late 90s, single rooms of the first building have been converted into two-room junior suites.  This significantly reduced the number of seats, but at the same time allowed to improve living conditions.  Along with this, the dining room was completely converted into a cafe-bar "Meeting".  Sports fields and a children's playground were repaired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Gelendzhik Sanatorium Blue Wave" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/460595.jpg" width="550"></div>  The forces of the health resort administration redesigned the boat station.  A psychological assistance center and a speleological chamber were organized in it.  But at the same time, it continues to fulfill its main functions.  On its territory there is all the necessary special equipment - a boat "trophy", jet skis, inflatable slides and bananas, trampolines and catamarans.  The indoor pool has also changed.  The stained glass windows and the bowl of the tank were replaced.  Installations of the seawater heating system and hydromassage, careful filtering of the water and its cascade supply make it possible to say that this structure is one of the best on the coast.  There are also a bathroom, a phytobar, a gym.  From 2007-2008  in the building of the former administrative building, the medical SPA-center began its work.  There are new residential rooms.  A dance floor and an outdoor pool have been rebuilt.  In those same years, the central alley of the boarding house, whose true decorations are fountains and a chapel, gained its present beautiful appearance.  The Blue Wave sanatorium, popular throughout Gelendzhik, is deservedly considered one of the main leaders in the tourism industry of the Krasnodar Territory.  The staff of the institution in 2010 took pride of place on the Board of Honor of the resort city. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort blue wave gelendzhik photo" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/460596.jpg" width="550"></div>
