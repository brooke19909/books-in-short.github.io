Pearl Hot Springs: how to get, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fact that mineral water is useful has been known for a long time.  The reigning persons and their subjects constantly went "on the water" to rest and be treated.  For example, balneological resorts in the Czech Republic, such as <span>Frantiskovy Lazne</span> and Karlovy Vary, have not been empty since their appearance.  According to scientists, thermal springs with similar properties of water are in the <span>Tunkinsky valley.</span>  These are <span>hot springs in</span> Zhemchug and Arshan - resort villages of Buryatia. </p><h2>  Discovery History </h2><p>  In the Eastern Sayan Mountains, in the most beautiful place of the Tunkinsky valley, the Vyshka resort is located with healing waters that have exits not far from the village of Zhemchug.  Sources were discovered when drilling began for the purpose of exploratory oil production.  That was in 1950 and 1980.  They did not find oil, but they opened the keys of mineral water.  Sources are not far from each other, but the thermal waters of Pearls differ in chemical composition of water and temperature. </p><p>  Water from one source (P-1), has a temperature of + 38 ¬∞ C, in its composition there are: hydrogen sulfide, methane, rhodon, carbon dioxide.  In the second well (G-1), the outlet temperature of the water is + 56 ¬∞ C.  It is saturated with chloride-hydrocarbonate bases with impurities of magnesium and sodium. </p><h2>  Medical indications </h2><p>  People who monitor their health, necessarily use healing mineral water and visit resorts.  What are the healing properties of the sources?  What diseases can be treated with their water? </p><p>  For medical reasons, water from the source P-1 is used in the Pearl spa for skin problems, neuralgia, gynecological diseases and problems with the bone apparatus.  Baths with this water strengthen immunity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Water source G-1 is a priority for gynecological diseases, as well as for people with problems of the musculoskeletal system.  The source water is hot, but its quality allows you to take water in the form of a drink to treat the digestive system. </p><h2>  Infrastructure in Pearls </h2><p>  The springs themselves are in the resort area.  It is near the village of Pearls.  The resort area around the Pearl springs in Buryatia is in the process of formation and is being actively built up.  Already there is a recreation complex, which includes a bath building, it takes baths with mineral water.  Outside the building there are large wooden open-air swimming pools open all year round.  During the summer season, a massage therapist and medical consultant work in the building.  Optionally, you can take a phyto bath. </p><h2>  Open Pools </h2><p>  In the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPearls in the Tunkinsky Valley, wooden pools were built.  Bathing has a relaxing effect.  In the pool with mineral water you can swim without a medical direction.  In winter, swimming in such pools is very comfortable, since the water temperature allows you to use it all year round. </p><p>  Despite the fact that you can swim without a doctor‚Äôs direction, do not be too zealous for the treatment.  A lot - this does not mean good.  Bathing should last up to 15 minutes twice a day, no more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arshan hot springs pearls" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1989850.jpg" width="600"></div>

Patients with gout can just lower their legs into the pool.  Children should be even less in the water and should relax after bathing.  In addition to swimming in the terminal waters, you can relax in the beach area created by <span>the Irkut River,</span> or go to the national park located near the resort area. </p><p>  Prices in hot springs, regardless of the season, in any pool are 300 rubles.  Children under the age of five bathe for free.  Children from five to ten years of age, invalids and retirees receive a 50% discount.  The usual peak when they come to the springs for treatment is the summer months. </p><h2>  Accommodation and meals </h2><p>  A large number of vacationers are those arriving in personal cars from neighboring regions of Buryatia to Pearl "on the water".  Many settle in tents near sources.  Comfortable living conditions can provide the hotel "Krasnaya Polyana", which has become a favorite vacation spot for visitors.  It includes a large guest house with eight rooms and a hotel with sixteen rooms, which has a cafe-bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pearl resort" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1989898.jpg" width="600"></div>

If you do not want to cook, you can go to a cafe with 50 seats.  It prepares dishes of Russian, Buryat and European cuisine. </p><h2>  Mineral water in Arshan </h2><p>  For the first time, they talked about mineral springs in the Tunkinsky valley in 1894, and the first building of the sanatorium for rest in Arshan was built in 1920.  Then, in the next two years, a bathroom building was built, and in 1925 - two bedroom buildings.  The construction of a small power station on the Kyngyrga River was proceeding rapidly. </p><p>  In 1927, the <span>production of mineral water</span> was launched <span>.</span>  Arshan has since been famous for its drinking water.  Arshan mineral water is very similar in composition to the Caucasian mineral waters.  The local population and Siberians consider the healing mineral water.  And the word "arshan" in translation from the Buryat language means - "healing source."  Around the village there are several sources with warm and cold, but tasty water, similar to store mineral water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunka Valley Pearls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1989944.jpg" width="586"></div>

    <h2>  Resort "Arshan" </h2><p>  In 1975, Arshan was attributed to the resort villages.  Over time, the <span>resort of Arshan</span> appeared at the foot of the Sayan Mountains <span>.</span>  The resort area includes two sanatoriums - "Arshan" and "Sayan", and a children's sanatorium and recreation camp (DSOL).
