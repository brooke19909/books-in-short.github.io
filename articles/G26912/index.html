    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Although the hotel administratively belongs to Rethymnon, the village in which it is located is called Sfakaki.  The historical center with its attractions is ten kilometers away.  Near the hotel there is a bus stop.  Bars, restaurants and other tourist attractions are also within easy reach.  Location of the hotel Agelia Beach (Crete); reviews of vacationers are called quite successful.  The hotel is right on the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rethymno, Crete </h2><p>  No wonder this resort is called the best starting point for excursions and trips around the island.  And for a beach holiday, he is great.  Perhaps that‚Äôs why tourists choose hotels located here, such as, for example, Agelia Beach.  Crete, the photo of which has been circulated on social networks and on forums for independent travelers, reveals here its appeal to guests in the most interesting way.  Narrow streets in a medieval style and modern night clubs, wide beaches with fine sand and a gentle entrance and secluded quiet bays lost in the rocks - all this will be offered to you by Rethymnon.  In addition, this region is not so far from Heraklion as, say, Chania.  It will appeal to violent youth, and <span>couples</span> with children, and romantic lovers.  Quiet, calm, safe, interesting places, stunning nature - you can hardly find the best option for a vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agelia beach crete photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/784704.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Not only "seals" pastime, but also a variety of trips are waiting for you if you choose "Agelia Beach" for relaxation.  Experienced tourists are advised to take the city bus to Rethymnon - at least in order to take a walk and ‚Äúbreathe in history‚Äù.  Visit freshwater lakes, for example, Kournas, Argirupoli waterfalls.  Or the monasteries known throughout Greece - Preveli, Arcadia.  If you want to see beautiful mountains, then go to Samaria gorge.  The beaches of Rethymnon itself are a tourist attraction, but for those who want to change the scenery and swim in another picturesque place, tourists who have visited Crete recommend the Balos lagoon.  Do not miss the bright, colorful Heraklion.  Walking, shopping and interesting experiences are guaranteed. </p>
