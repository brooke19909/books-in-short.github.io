    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before I tell you what the BMW Museum in Germany is, I want to <strong> </strong>  remember how the BMW concern itself appeared.  Bavarian motor plants such as Bayerische MotorenWerke (or BMW) have long been world famous.  They have been working since 1913.  The plant began its activities with the production of aircraft engines.  The founder of this company was Karl Friedrich Rapp.  He decided to locate this production in the district of Munich, next to the German company manufacturing aircraft, Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik.  After the First World War ended in 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was signed, according to which the production of aircraft in Germany was banned.  As a result, Otto closed his factory, and BMW was forced to switch to the manufacture of brakes for trains, and subsequently became the largest manufacturer of engines, cars, motorcycles and bicycles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first buildings of the complex </h2><p>  The BMW complex includes headquarters, a museum and BMW World.  The first to open its doors was the BMW Museum in Munich.  This happened in 1972.  At the same time, by the day of the Olympics in 1972, the construction of the headquarters of the company was completed.  The BMW residence itself is a structure designed as a four-cylinder engine.  The building has 22 floors.  The design of these two buildings was designed by an architect from Austria.  The museum building is built in the shape of a kind of bowl, which is covered with the BMW emblem on top and is an externally gas tank lid.  The most complete picture can be seen, rising to the height of a bird's flight.  The locals have their own idea about the appearance of this building, so they call it a "bowl for soup." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BMW Museum in Munich Address" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370055.jpg?1397013898134" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  BMW World </h2><p>  In 2004, the company decided to close the building, which housed the BMW Museum in Munich, for reconstruction.  Due to the increase in production in the museum it was no longer possible to exhibit all the exhibits.  The room required expansion, that is, the acquisition or emergence of a new additional area.  Nearby was already the construction of a new car dealership, which began a year ago according to the design of the Vienna design bureau Coop Himmelb (l) au.  It was decided to use this building for expansion, the opening of which took place in June 2008.  According to the authors, the glass cones of the building symbolize the letter "W", which is the third in the abbreviation BMW.  The four cylinders of the concern‚Äôs main office are the letter ‚ÄúB‚Äù, and the museum‚Äôs cover is ‚ÄúM‚Äù.  The new building presents not only the BMW Museum.  In Munich, various concerts are held in this room, and residents and visitors come here just to have lunch or relax.  Entrance to the building is free, since there is also a car dealership.  Inside, you can not only buy a car, but also ride on an old or new BMW along a virtual race track.  In addition, you can construct a car on a huge projection screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Restoration workshop </h2><p>  Initially, at the opening of the museum, 20 cars and 30 motorcycles were presented to the audience.  As such, there was no workshop that would support the equipment in working condition.  Enthusiasts who worked in the basement of the building were engaged in their repair.  On the centenary of the manufacture of the <span>first car by</span> Carl Bens, BMW took part in a classic rally.  Four cars were put up for the competition, but after the start they all died out as one.  It was after this incident that a restoration workshop was created, which served the BMW Museum in Munich.  It was located at the company's factory, and since then all the cars presented in the museum are in working condition.  Now their number has increased significantly.  They stand so tight that sometimes you have to squeeze between them. </p><h2>  Rolls Royce Exposition </h2>

After the reconstruction of 2008, its area increased to 5000 square meters.  Replacing and updating stands is done every 30 days, so there is always the opportunity to see something new.  Rising on the escalator to the top of the museum, you will see the Rolls-Royce exposition.  A spiral staircase leads from it, descending along which you can clearly see all the models presented.  The real treasure of this section is Rolls-Royce Phantom.  He was the first Rolls-Royce car owned by the royal family.  After the turnstiles, an installation is presented, consisting of hundreds of metal balls that constantly move, creating the outlines of a BMW car. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Munich BMW museum how to get" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370050.jpg?1397014216083" width="600"></div>

The next exhibit that deserves attention is the R32 motorcycle.  It was very popular, despite the fact that its cost was significantly higher than the price of similar vehicles of other manufacturers.  The attention of buyers was attracted by the innovative transverse engine placement.  In addition, the motorcycle had a two-cylinder engine of 0.5 liters.  He allowed to reach speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour.  Next to him is a chic red car <strong> </strong>  BMW 3/15 PS, released in 1929, which is the first production model of the company. </p><h2>  Mototechnics </h2>

In the first ten years of the post-war period, the financial condition of the inhabitants of Europe was not very good and the <span>purchasing power,</span> especially with regard to cars, was very low.  During this period, the company management decided to return to the production of motor vehicles.  In the halls of the museum are represented almost all ever produced models.  In 1955, BMW returned to the production of cars.  This year the country saw Isetta.  This extraordinary model of the company had a motorcycle engine.  The next room presents a motorcycle with an aluminum frame, which significantly reduces its total weight compared to the weight of previous models.  The body of this motorcycle (BMW M6) is made using plastic, lightweight steel and carbon fiber.  In order for each visitor to be convinced of their weight, each exhibit of this hall is on separate scales.  A little further you can see the <span>BMW 328</span> Touring Cope of 1939, and the next room contains a collection of engines for aircraft, boats, racing and ordinary cars. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BMW Museum in Munich" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370044.jpg?1397014483919" width="600"></div><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BMW Museum in Munich" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370047.jpg?1397014374806" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the exposition does not end there.  Guests will be able to see the BMW 3 Series range, where all generations of this model are placed in chronological order.  One cannot fail to note the collection of BMW advertising posters, for which a separate room is allocated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BMW Museum in Germany" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370053.jpg?1397014100446" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The dream of every car collector </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful models of the company is the BMW 700. <strong> </strong>  LS (1964).  The car is installed near the wall of posters.  Under the hood of the car is a 2-cylinder engine of 0.7 liters, the power of which is 40 horsepower.  The maximum speed of this model is 135 kilometers per hour.  No less attractive model is the BMW 3.0 CSi, for which many collectors compete.  For BMW 327/28 a separate room is allocated, which resembles a wind tunnel.  For those who already wanted to visit the BMW Museum in Munich, the address will be left a little lower, but for now you need to pay attention to a couple of exhibition rooms. </p><h2>  Racing cars </h2><p>  The next two stands will attract the attention of speed lovers.  The first has the best racing cars, and the second has the famous BMW M. The most attention is drawn to the BMW M1 (1978).  They were released only 400 copies, so to meet a similar model live is unrealistic.  In the corner, behind the <span>race cars,</span> a BMW X Coupe is installed, and next to it is the GINA Light Visionary Model, whose body is made of fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museums in munich" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370054.jpg?1397013957856" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another hall was occupied by roadsters.  It is here that you can see the most expensive <span>brand BMW</span> 507. The company released a total of 271 copies of this model.  Next, a rather unusual roadster Z1 is installed, the doors of which do not open like in all cars, but fall down.  And the most successful roadster of the company, which has gained popularity among women, is considered the BMW Z3.  Now, having familiarized themselves with the museum‚Äôs expositions, many people will probably want to know where the BMW Museum is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="BMW Museum in Munich" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/370046.jpg?1397014416914" width="600"></div>
