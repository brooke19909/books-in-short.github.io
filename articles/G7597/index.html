  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human brain structure and functions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The human brain, the</span> structure and functions of which are considered in this article, is located in the cranium and consists of five departments, including the midbrain, intermediate, posterior, oblong, and anterior.  On average, the brain mass of adults is about 1.5 kg, and in newborns almost 400 grams. </p><p>  The human brain, the structure and functions of which are determined by the capabilities of the body, is formed by the middle, back, oblong and intermediate sections.  Of great importance are the <span>hemispheres,</span> which distinguish humans from animals.  From various departments come the nerve endings that connect the brain to all organs and receptors of a person.  With the help of nerve endings, the brain analyzes and processes external influences and stimuli, and also produces the necessary reaction to them.  The human brain, structure and functions of its departments act in such a way as to adapt most effectively to environmental conditions.  Thanks to this adaptation, the process of coordinating the activities of all organs and tissues of the body, depending on various factors, occurs. </p><p>  The medulla oblongata is considered an extension of the spinal cord.  Reflex and conductor functions are assigned to it.  Outside, it is covered with a white substance that forms pathways for brain activity.  Its central part consists of gray matter, which is a group of neurons responsible for the parasympathetic nervous system.  The medulla oblongata contains the center of cardiac activity, the respiratory and <span>vasomotor centers.</span>  He is also responsible for unconditioned food reflexes and protective reflexes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hindbrain, the structure and functions of which provide reflex functions, consists of the cerebellum and the Varolian brain bridge.  Above the medulla oblongata there is a cerebral bridge, which contains the centers of the facial and oculomotor nerve endings.  Impulses from the medulla oblongata to the upper <span>parts of the brain</span> also pass through it <span>.</span>  <span>It coordinates the movements</span> of the human body, and also supports its cerebellum balance.  It consists of two hemispheres and a central part and is covered with gray matter.  The most active development of the cerebellum occurs between 5 and 11 months of human life. </p><p>  The structure and functions of the midbrain provide a person with complete processing of auditory and visual information.  This part of the brain consists of two legs that connect it to the intermediate and medulla oblongata, as well as the roof, where the centers for processing visual and auditory stimuli are located. </p><p>  The <span>human</span> diencephalon consists of the thalamus, epithalamus, cranked bodies, and the sub-tubercle region (hypothalamus).  He is responsible for the activity of the central <span>nervous system of a person.</span>  The thalamus coordinates sensitivity, facial expressions, gestures and other human emotions.  The hypothalamus is responsible for the autonomic nervous system and provides metabolism, endocrine functions, and also performs sleep coordination.  Cranked bodies contain visual and auditory centers. </p><p>  <span>The</span> human <span>forebrain</span> , the structure and functions of which are aimed at controlling the entire body, consists of hemispheres that are connected by the corpus callosum.  The cerebral cortex is covered with a special gray matter.  Thanks to it, pathways for signals from nerve endings are provided.  The cortex of the forebrain hemispheres contains 6 different layers of nerve endings and is divided by furrows into 4 functional parts: frontal lobe, parietal, temporal and occipital.  The most developed is the frontal lobe, which is separated by a central furrow from the parietal lobe.  The frontal lobe accounts for about 50 percent of the total brain mass.  The bark is the basis of a person‚Äôs mental state.  The right and left hemispheres are slightly different, as a result of which the left hemisphere is responsible for abstract thinking, and the right - for figurative. </p>
