A guide to this character provides an explanation of his strengths and weaknesses, a variety of tactics and necessary items.  With the proper skill, the champion will help the player climb high in the ranking ladder. </p><h2>  Hero General </h2><p>  The brand is considered the only fire mage in the game.  The guide for this champion begins with an examination of basic statistics.  His skills require a lot of mana, so a lot of spamming them into the enemy will not work without gain from a blue golem.  The hero in itself is rather fragile and it is forbidden to let front line fighters (Jax, Fiora, Zed and others) admit him.  This mage requires the player to have excellent ability to calculate the actions of the enemy.  All his skills are launched in a certain direction, and their miss is equivalent to death if you are fighting a killer or a mobile sorcerer (Ari, Sindra, Akali, Talon and others). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brand guide" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/1686162.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description of skills </h2><p>  With its skills, it has earned Brand attention among a huge number of users.  Guide (description of skills) should start with the passive skill "Flame".  Its essence is that it enhances all the damage from other skills and when activated, an area appears on the enemy that will explode after two seconds.  The first ability is “Burn”: in a chosen direction, a ball of fire is launched and deals damage to the first enemy.  The second skill is the “Pillar of Fire”: upon activation, a flame from the earth appears in a certain area.  The third skill - “Arson” - is applied directly to the hero and for some time he is dealt fire damage.  The ultimate Pyroclasm skill fires a flame that jumps between opponents five times, activates a passive skill, sets fire to and removes a lot of health.  An ideal combination in team battles would be to mark opponents with the third ability, to get in - the second and launch the ultimate.  This is a guaranteed death for weak fighters and huge losses even among armored champions.  It is also worth knowing that Brand can immobilize opponents.  The guide is as follows: it is necessary to mark the enemy with the second or third skill, and while the mark lasts, get the “Burn”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brand lol guide" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/1686161.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Early game </h2><p>  Basically, when playing only on the middle line, the Brand is taken.  The "LoL" guide provides for the possibility of connecting it with the fighters below, but there it does not have the ability to withstand strong tanks and save the life of its gunner.  It is best to take it to the mid and start the collection with the “Doran Ring” and two cans for treatment.  Try to completely clear the waves of minions, but do not forget about the dangers of the arrival of the forester.  The middle of the line is the maximum where the battle is worth moving.  If you drove the enemy under the tower, then put the totems on the overview and be prepared to meet guests from the jungle.  Skills should be pumped in a sequence of 2-1-3 and ultimate at the earliest opportunity.  Take the jump and arson into the skills of the summoner (the second, which is available to any character).  It is at this stage that it is necessary to determine the objects and the direction where the Brand will move.  A guide provides for three cases: lack of mana, difficulty getting ability, and the need for damage.  In the first case, it is worth buying Morellonomicon, in the second - Rylai's Crystal Scepter, and in the third - Rabadon's Deathcap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lol brand guide" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/1686163.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Average period </h2><p>  By the fifteenth minute, the player should already have two or more items in the assembly in the standard situation, when there are not many kills and a lot of money.  In this case, the best example of a guide for testing Brand is the collection of the Rylai Crystal Scepter, but before that it is worth buying the Needlessly Large Rod and Sorcerer's Shoes.  As a result, the player gets a good penetration with magic, and if the runes are also directed to this indicator, then the danger from skills will increase.  Next, you need to accumulate as quickly as possible on the "Rabadon's Deathcap".  This will greatly increase the ability of the character in terms of strength of skills, because during this period the fighters of the enemy team will already begin to defend themselves with the "Banshee's Veil" and similar items.  After that, there is a choice between two Zhonya's Hourglass objects for additional protection with activation or Luden's Echo to increase attack power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brand testing guide example" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/1686164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Late battles </h2><p>  At the end of the game, the LoL Brand must be a real threat to the enemy team in the game.  The guide provides for the further purchase of two more compulsory items for him.  The "Void Staff" will provide even greater magical penetration, which should be directed against the tanks (Maokai, Leon, Braum).  The last item is the player’s choice.  It is worth considering what he lacks in a team battle, and what subject will bring the greatest benefit.  It can be “Liandry's Torment” with passive arson, “Scepter of the Void” with an aura of defense, or even “Rod of Ages”.  Choosing the last one is at the beginning or middle of the match, otherwise he will not have time to gain ten power-ups and will, in the end, be useless.  The brand must release all its skills in the fray, capture as many enemies as possible and inflict maximum damage. </p>
