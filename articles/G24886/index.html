Some prefer developed resorts with a huge selection of entertainment, while others seek to retire to nature and enjoy their holidays in silence.  Each of the guests of the Crimea will find for themselves that very ideal place for a real good rest. </p><h2>  Lazurnoe Village </h2><p>  Just lovers of quiet relaxation and extraordinary nature should pay attention to the modest village of Lazurnoye, which is located just a few kilometers from Alushta. </p><p>  The village of Lazurnoe (Crimea) is located at the foot of the picturesque Mount Kastel.  In Soviet times, it began to build a large hotel complex in it, but until today the construction has not been completed.  The resort infrastructure in Lazurny is poorly developed.  There is no entertainment in this place, the <span>beaches are wild</span> and undeveloped, but there is always room for accommodation. </p>

    <p>  Among the guest houses of Cote d'Azur, a modern manor that also offers rooms is striking.  It is located on the mountain itself and is built on three levels, which are connected by chic stairs.  Silence reigns in the district, only the singing of birds violates and complements this idyll.  Fresh air, mountain springs and extraordinary natural beauties are the village of Lazurnoe (Crimea). </p><h2>  Reviews about the rest in the village </h2><p>  Of course, this kind of vacation is not for everybody, that's why reviews about Lazurny are contradictory.  Those tourists who were not ready for the features of the village expressed their disappointment with the lack of the usual resort infrastructure.  However, all vacationers are happy with nature. </p><p>  Beaches are the sights of the village of Lazurnoe (Crimea).  Then, when there is no place to drop a leaf in Alushta, in this wild place deserted shores, pure water. </p>

    <p>  Many tourists were dissatisfied with the great descent to the sea, however, these are the features of this mountain village.  In general, rest in Lazurne is exclusively for an amateur.  Yes, there is chic air, silence, peace, beautiful nature, but the lack of infrastructure for many tourists is a significant drawback. </p>
