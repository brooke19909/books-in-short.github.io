It is important to consider that the conditions of some banks are simplified, and they are ready to consider each client individually.  If you meet standard requirements, you can count on financing your purchases and plans in acceptable conditions. </p><h2>  Bank Renaissance Credit: customer and employee reviews </h2><p>  This financial institution was created on the initiative of the ONEXIM group of investors.  It has been providing financial services to the population and legal entities since 2003.  Today, the number of customers has exceeded 10 million people.  146 branches are scattered throughout the country.  Owns 89,928 points of sale.  The coverage area covers 63 regions of the Russian Federation.  Indicators have a tendency to increase, as the bank is in the top hundred in terms of reliability rating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alienation.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The conditions are acceptable." class="if uuid-2406270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406270.jpg"></div><h2>  Ratings </h2><p>  The bank completed 2017 with brilliant success.  For example, in terms of return on assets, it ranked third among the hundred largest banks in the Russian Federation.  In terms of profitability, fourth place was awarded. </p><p>  In the reviews of Renaissance Credit, they say that he was one of the main creditors of Russians in 2017.  The proof is 14th in the ranking.  One cannot but evaluate the bank‚Äôs contribution in attracting citizens ‚Äôfunds.  So, according to this criterion, the bank takes 28th place among 50 other institutions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To reach such heights, any bank needs solid capital.  ‚ÄúRenaissance‚Äù succeeded in this field.  At the beginning of this year, it ranks 55th in terms of capital.  Another important indicator for banks is the amount of net assets.  For this part, Renaissance Credit took an honorable 5th place. </p><p>  It cannot be said that the bank is proud of only these achievements.  Awards, titles and prestigious places accompany him from the moment of opening.  If you look at the history, then in 2012 he was recognized as the company of the year.  In the same year, the award for ‚ÄúDynamics and Efficiency‚Äù was received. </p><h2>  Partners </h2><p>  Reviews of Renaissance Credit will be incomplete if you do not take into account the opinions of partners.  First, by providing funds for business development, digging makes a direct contribution to the expansion of domestic companies.  Secondly, it enables trading companies to increase sales figures by implementing a line of credit for the purchase of a number of goods.  Their incomplete list is as follows: </p><ul><li>  "M Video"; </li><li>  "Connected"; </li><li>  "Shatura furniture"; </li><li>  Euroset; </li><li>  "DNS digital"; </li><li>  SMEG </li><li>  HOFF; </li><li>  Delta; </li><li>  RBT; </li><li>  Askona; </li><li>  Wellness center; </li><li>  Citylink; </li><li>  "Build a giant" and many others. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.lowestrates.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="No deposit required" class="if uuid-2406271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406271.jpg"></div><h2>  Loans </h2><p>  Today, the bank provides citizens with funds for any needs up to 700,000 rubles.  The maximum loan term is 60 months.  The current interest rate is 11.3%.  But depending on the amount, loan term and other parameters, the rates may be slightly higher.  Maximum rates are 25.7%. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you decide to become a client of Renaissance Bank, customer feedback on loans will help you choose one of the existing financing programs.  There are four of them: </p><ol><li>  For regular customers. </li><li>  For retirees. </li><li>  For those who prefer low rates. </li><li>  For urgent plans. </li></ol><p>  Regular customers of the bank can count on financing in the amount of 30,000 to 700,000 rubles for a period of up to 5 years.  The amount of return will vary from 11.3 to 25.7% per year.  For pensioners, the same interest rates apply.  Only the maximum amount for them is limited to 200,000 rubles. </p><p>  Despite the convenience of remote payments, receiving cash at the checkout desk still does not lose relevance.  According to reviews of consumer loans in Renaissance Credit, the procedure for issuing a standard is to minimize documents and as quickly as possible. </p><p>  Those who are interested in moderate rates can expect a special tariff - up to 25.1%.  You can request any amount within 700 000 rubles.  If spontaneous plans have appeared, then Renaissance Credit is ready to support borrowed funds of up to 100,000 rubles.  Money can be returned within 5 years, taking into account interest rates ranging from 19.9% ‚Äã‚Äãto 25.7%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.merchantmaverick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Many repayment methods" class="if uuid-2406272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406272.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can get it? </h2><p>  Reviews of Renaissance Credit state that the institution does not approve of the traditional bureaucracy of the banking sector.  Simple requirements and transparent conditions await customers.  Not a single item goes beyond standard identity procedures.  For example, to become a borrower of a bank, a client must meet the following requirements: </p><ul><li>  The presence of a permanent job, where he works for at least 3 months at the time of application. </li><li>  If the place of residence is Moscow, then the amount of income each month should be at least 12,000 rubles. </li><li>  If we are talking about residents of the regions, then their monthly earnings should be at least 8,000 rubles. </li><li>  The need to have a permanent official place of work or residence in one of the regions of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Citizenship of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Age category - from 24 to 70 years. </li></ul><h2>  How can I get it? </h2><p>  If there is a dilemma whether to get a loan or not, then you should read the reviews about Renaissance Credit written by its customers.  These are those people who have already used the services of the company and noticed pleasant features of the service.  For example, for the convenience of customers, there are two application systems: </p><ol><li>  On the company website. </li><li>  Personal visit to the nearest branch. </li></ol><p>  It should be borne in mind that among Russians there are citizens who are skeptical of the first method - filing an application remotely.  The meaning of this system is its mutual profitability: </p><ol><li>  The client saves time and money on visiting, gets the opportunity to evaluate their chances from a distance. </li><li>  The Bank saves money on the labor of specialists, which are also formed from public funds. </li></ol><p>  The content of the online application is no different from the typical one.  The only difference is in mutual convenience. </p><h2>  Redemption </h2><p>  According to the reviews of Renaissance Credit Bank, it is very convenient to work with it, since the circumstances and preferences of each client are taken into account.  For example, there is no need to spend time and travel to a bank branch when paying off.  For these purposes, many methods are provided, including both cash and non-cash methods. </p><ul><li>  Qiwi Terminals.  Crediting occurs within 1-2 days.  The system charges a commission of 1.6%. </li><li>  If you need to deposit funds urgently, then you should select the "Eleksnet" terminals.  If not a day off, then funds arrive within the same day.  For speed, the system takes a commission of 1.98%. </li><li>  Express Payments will credit your funds within 3 days.  Commission - 1% of the total amount, but not less than 50 rubles. </li><li>  Regional Payment System - the term of enrollment is 1-2 days for 1% of the total amount. </li><li>  If you have time to wait 3 days, then you can use the services of Quickpay.  As a commission, 1% of the amount is charged. </li><li>  The same system works "Free cash desk". </li><li>  When repaying a loan due to the Beeline balance, the crediting time will be 2 business days.  Commission - 1%. </li><li>  Other networks in which the commission is 1% and the crediting time is up to 3 days: Svyaznoy, M-Video, Technosila, MTS, Megafon, Eldorado, Atlant Computers, Contact, "Rapida", "Golden Crown". </li><li>  Those who took cash in Renaissance Credit write in their reviews that there are even free repayment methods.  To do this, you should contact the "Russian Post" with a margin of time up to 5 days. </li><li>  There are also bank's own terminals where you can send funds without commission and with instant crediting. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Without guarantors" class="if uuid-2406274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406274.jpg"></div><h2>  Redemption through other banks </h2><p>  According to reviews of Renaissance Credit Bank, the second convenience in repayment is that funds can be sent through a branch of any other bank.  Here is their list and conditions: </p><ul><li>  SDM Bank is ready to send funds within 1-2 business days with a commission of 1.5%. </li><li>  Kurgan Bank offers similar conditions. </li><li>  For 1.2% of the repayment amount, you can send funds through MDM Bank and Promsvyazbank.  The term is similar. </li><li>  Bank Vozrozhdenie will deliver any amount for 1% commission. </li><li>  Interkommertsbank takes 2% of the amount with a maturity of 3-5 days. </li><li>  Chelindbank OJSC will transfer any amounts for 1% of the commission with crediting within 1-2 days. </li><li>  Transfer through Sberbank is in demand due to the quick transfer - the next day and the minimum commission - 1%. </li></ul><p>  But in practice, the most popular way is to transfer from the card balance.  If the card does not belong to Renaissance Bank itself, then the transaction is carried out at the issuer's tariff.  In any case, the commission varies in the region of 2% of the amount. </p><h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  Bank deposits remain a reliable way to save and increase funds.  If there are available funds, then a deposit in a bank deposit will help to receive a stable income from them.  Reviews of deposits in Renaissance Credit and ratings show the high confidence on the part of depositors formed over the years of cooperation.  There are 4 types of deposits: </p><ol><li>  Investment. </li><li>  Cumulative. </li><li>  Profitable. </li><li>  Without Borders. </li></ol><p>  Each type of deposit guarantees a stable income, a convenient management system through the Internet bank and a choice of methods for obtaining interest.  We will consider the details in detail. </p><h2>  Investment deposits </h2><p>  A positive image and high levels of public confidence are due not only to customer reviews of Renaissance Credit loans.  Bank reliability and cost-effectiveness were achieved thanks to a well-thought-out policy regarding customers. </p><p>  <span>Investment deposits</span> are accepted in rubles.  There are two types of interest rates on them: 8.25% and 8.5%.  If the client prefers to open a small deposit, where the amount ranges from 100,000 to 1,400,000 rubles, then his money is charged at 8.25% per annum.  For any amounts in excess of 1,400,000 rubles, an annual rate of 8.5% is charged. </p><p>  Deposits of the customer‚Äôs choice: start from 91 days to 731 days (about 2 years).  Options between them: 181 days - 6 months, 271 days - 9 months and for 1 year, or for 367 days. </p><p>  Interest is paid by the capitalization method at the end of the deposit term.  In addition to a direct application, an investment deposit can be opened upon conclusion of an agreement with the insurance companies Renaissance Life and Vita Invest at the rates of Investor 2.0 and Heritage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneypeach.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quick review" class="if uuid-2406275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406275.jpg"></div><h2>  Cumulative contribution </h2><p>  Deposits in this financial institution are popular not only in Moscow, but also in other major cities of the country.  This is evidenced by reviews of Renaissance Credit in St. Petersburg.  It should be borne in mind that everyone who has free funds has the opportunity to open a funded contribution.  Deposit account - multicurrency.  In addition to rubles, dollars and euros are accepted.  The maximum term for this tariff plan is 1 year. </p><p>  The minimum deposit in dollars should be at least 500. Dividends range from 0.25% to 0.50%.  If the deposit amount starts from $ 25,000, then the rates will be in the range 0.50 - 0.75%. </p><p>  The minimum threshold for deposits in euros is 500. Rates do not depend on the duration period - 0.15%.  Amounts over 25,000 euros are charged at 0.40% for any period. </p><p>  Most benefits will bring rubles.  Dividends in the amount of 6.55 - 7% can be calculated when placing money in the amount of 30,000 rubles or more. </p><h2>  Profitable </h2><p>  The type of profitable deposits is characterized by higher dividends on foreign currency investments.  The account is not replenished, account transactions on it are excluded.  Interest is accrued using the capitalization method.  If the client does not inform in advance about his intentions, then upon the expiration of the term the contract is automatically renewed for a new term. </p><p>  In this area, the maximum dividends are 7.50% in rubles and the minimum - 0.25% in euros. </p><h2>  Without Borders </h2><p>  How to determine the reliability of the bank?  According to customers, first of all, you should pay attention to the experience of other customers.  For those who have not yet used the services of Renaissance Credit, customer feedback on loans and deposits will help make the right decision.  For example, deposits in this direction can be opened for any amount in excess of 1000 rubles.  Dividends of 6.50% per annum will be accrued on it. </p><p>  If dollars are preferred, then you can place any amount in excess of $ 100.  The maximum deposit term in this direction is 181 days, or 6 months.  During this period, the client can replenish the deposit for any amount.  If you need money, you can spend from them to the minimum balance - $ 100. </p><p>  Deposits in euros are subject to similar rules.  Only the interest rate differs.  It is 0.15%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="No hidden fees" class="if uuid-2406276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406276.jpg"></div><h2>  Cards </h2><p>  Reviews of Renaissance Credit cards deserve a detailed review.  They provide unlimited financial opportunities and prestige.  Cards are issued free of charge.  Their names: </p><ul><li>  Renaissance Credit Master Card with free service. </li><li>  Master Card "Chocolate Girl" - allows you to get 10% discount in the network of coffee houses "Chocolate Girl". </li><li>  Master Card "Kinohod" - for moviegoers.  They get a 10% discount when paying for a movie show trip card. </li><li>  Master Card "March" - gives discounts on women's joys. </li></ul><p>  The credit limit in all cases is up to 200,000 rubles.  All citizens of the Russian Federation, whose ages are from 21 to 65 years old, officially employed and having permanent registration in one of the regions of the Russian Federation, can become owners.  An application can be made online or compiled at the department. </p><p>  In reviews of credit cards Renaissance Credit note their attractive conditions and pleasant bonuses.  For example, for all cards there is a free credit period of 55 days, during which interest on the amount is not charged.  There is a bonus program.  Refunds when paying online can reach 100%.  In addition, cardholders receive discounts at many popular institutions that have partnerships with Renaissance Credit Bank.  Card balance can be replenished in the same ways as when repaying a loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Available to everyone" class="if uuid-2406277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/2406277.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet bank </h2><p>  It is not easy for residents of big cities to find a free couple of hours during the working day.  The ability to use online services successfully solves this problem.  The introduction of online services in the banking system has become one of the great achievements of this industry. </p><p>  Services provided through the Internet Bank are no different from real services.  We can say that this is a virtual version of the bank itself.  Using it you can: </p><ul><li>  Manage your accounts. </li><li>  Repay loans. </li><li>  Apply for a loan. </li><li>  Pay for purchases and services. </li><li>  Open deposits. </li><li>  Get answers to your questions. </li></ul><p>  Online banking can be used in two versions: a special mobile application for phones and a typical website.  Between themselves, they differ only in the user interface.  Reliability of information is guaranteed by the international banking security system 3D-Secure.  When working with this system, all operations and actions are confirmed through the client‚Äôs mobile phone. </p><h2>  Debit cards </h2><p>  There are two types of debit cards available to users: </p><ol><li>  Master Card "Renaissance Credit". </li><li>  Master Card "March". </li></ol><p>  The first type of card provides a lot of useful opportunities, among which one can note the accrual of 7.7% on the balance on the balance sheet, discounts when paying by card at retail outlets - partners of the bank and the possibility of free replenishment of the balance. </p><p>  In the reviews of Renaissance Credit cards, they note a pleasant possibility of a refund of 6% when buying jewelry.  This service is available for holders of the Master Card "March".  Also, for every purchase on the card bonuses are automatically credited.  Accumulated bonuses can be used when buying other goods. </p><p>  The reviews on the Renaissance Credit debit card emphasize its convenience and maximum benefit when shopping.  The procedure for obtaining is simple.  Those who wish should provide a standard package of documents, including a passport, a certificate of employment and a completed application.  The service is available for all citizens of the Russian Federation who are in the age category 21-65 and have stable work. </p><h2>  Bank career </h2><p>  Work at the bank is the dream of many beginning specialists.  In addition to prestige and decent wages, working in a bank gives a tremendous experience in the development of professional and personal qualities.  A close-knit team instills a spirit of unity and motivates for further development.  According to the reviews of Renaissance Credit employees, a career in this institution is not limited to these advantages. </p><p>  The organization conducts a stable HR campaign aimed at the comprehensive development of employees within the company.  She is ready to accept ambitious, energetic and sociable people into her team. </p><p>  In the reviews, Renaissance Credit employees say that the bank has its own training center with a unique program.  Employees have the opportunity to develop with the help of face-to-face trainings or distance programs without interruption from work.  If an employee prefers individual work, then he has the opportunity to grow as a specialist with the help of educational videos. </p><p>  Many young specialists believe that you can get a bank only with a lot of work experience or several higher educations.  But the HR department of the bank prefers an individual approach.  If a person is purposeful, hardworking and open to new knowledge, he can start a career in the bank, regardless of other conditions.  The bank employs both experienced professionals and novice professionals.  Each of them has great career opportunities.  Direct evidence of this is feedback from employees on the work at Renaissance Credit. </p><p> The Bank welcomes innovative proposals and initiatives from managers.  The new employee starts work after the conclusion of an employment contract drawn up in clear agreement with the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  The further procedure for its activities is regulated by this agreement and internal banking standards.  He receives a full social package, monthly social and insurance contributions, paid leave and sick leave. </p><h2>  Customer policy </h2><p>  What is the most important thing for clients in banking services?  Someone prefers high dividends from deposits, someone is interested in moderate interest rates on loans.  Some companies not only related to the financial market usually prefer to focus on one product, for example, offering it in more attractive conditions.  And implementation costs are offset by other additional products.  In the banking sector, one can also observe the following picture: rates are lower, conditions are tougher or loans are cheaper, terms are tougher. </p><p>  According to customer reviews of Renaissance Credit on cash loans and non-cash loans, the bank has an honest policy focused on customer interests.  They have access to a wide range of services, ongoing support, bonus programs, promotions and gifts for the holidays.  All actions of the bank are regulated by the relevant laws of the Russian Federation, headed by the Federal Law "On Banking" and other regulatory documents. </p><p>  Customers will be required to update once a year the personal information provided to the bank upon receipt of a loan or opening a deposit.  Such an order is declared by Federal Law No. 115 of 2001.  If during the validity period of the banking agreement the client has changed any personal data (surname, place of residence or registration, TIN, phone number, place of work and e-mail), then he needs to inform his credit adviser about this. </p><h2>  Support service </h2><p>  Reviews of the Renaissance Credit Bank state that the institution has a transparent client policy.  The evidence of this is the availability of all documents, materials and information in the public domain.  Clients can receive information in several ways: </p><ul><li>  on the bank's website; </li><li>  by calling the toll-free line; </li><li>  visiting the nearest bank branch; </li><li>  by sending emails. </li></ul><p>  Customer information support is one of the priority tasks for the bank, the system works without interruptions.  If you contact the bank in one of the listed ways, then not a single question will remain unanswered. </p><p>  If you have special wishes, requests or intentions to help improve the work of the bank, then there is a special form on the corporate website where you can enter important information.  Information on the availability of the nearest bank or terminal can be found on the free support line. </p><p>  The main office of the bank is in Moscow.  From the moment the business began to the present moment, the work system has undergone many changes, but the quality of customer service and transparency of the policy remain at a high level.  This is evidenced by the bank's membership in the SWIFT community.  Despite his young age, he managed to gain the trust of tens of millions of citizens, and the professional team does not intend to turn off this path. </p>
