A more objective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit can be obtained from the reviews of travelers.  In particular, it is worth paying attention to some negative points.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  the hotel needs renovation, as it already has a lot of malfunctions and scuffs; </li><li>  there are no good beaches nearby; </li><li>  the pool is beautiful, but very small, given the number of people who simultaneously live in the hotel; </li><li>  the rooms do not catch wireless internet; </li><li>  a significant part of the pool is in the shade during the day, and therefore swimming is pretty cool; </li><li>  upon arrival, they take a rather impressive deposit (2000 baht), and its return to the card is quite long (at least two weeks); </li><li>  there is no information in Russian on the stands or in the booklets; </li><li>  paid internet is not the level of a five-star hotel; </li><li>  the hotel is very noisy - music from bars and restaurants is spread across all floors until late at night; </li><li>  there is no barbell in the gym; </li><li>  inflated prices for both accommodation and related services; </li><li>  gray washed bedding; </li><li>  in the bathroom there is increased humidity and there is a smell of mustiness; </li><li>  old and in some cases defective plumbing in the bathroom; </li><li>  untimely and not the best quality cleaning; </li><li>  to the rooms located on the upper floors, the elevator has to get with transfers; </li><li>  the hotel is very crowded; </li><li>  During cleaning, the maids do not pay attention to the balcony. </li></ul><p>  In any case, this hotel is worth staying at least once. </p>
