The hotel offers scenic sea views.  It is notable for the fact that it is located not so far from the center of Sochi, but still at a sufficient distance from the hustle and bustle of the city.  In this area there are many interesting places, many cafes and restaurants.  And, of course, the main advantages are a pebble beach, located literally a couple of hundred meters from the hotel, and loyal prices. </p><h2>  Silence and comfort </h2><p><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star Sochi hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/466445.jpg" width="600">  All unanimously declare: ‚ÄúSochi is life, night clubs and beach discos!‚Äù  Some guests do not like the noise and night parties, but at sea, I want to ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are zones for a quiet holiday in the capital of the holiday season.
