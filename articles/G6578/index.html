    <h2>  It‚Äôs harder in society </h2><p>  A dilapidated word from frequent and out of place use is no longer perceived by people.  They move their shoulders and ask again: "What is a radical?".  And then they forget.  After all, tomorrow this word will again fly out of the TV, loaded with a completely different meaning, which is radically (!) Different from what it carries today. </p><h2>  What are radicals?  Definition </h2><p>  A radical is a person who cannot tolerate the slow steps of history and makes some efforts to fit it.  This is an active and restless person, feeling the pain of other people and the love of what is dear and dear to him.  This is a person with his own worldview, he performs only those that he personally considers good.  It is impossible for him to impose an opinion through a zombie, because real life flows through his heart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are radicals definition" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/374193.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Radicality is an opinion different from the average opinion of the crowd.  It‚Äôs just that simple to answer what a radical is, you can‚Äôt, because radicalism can be left and right, lower and upper, hot and cold, but it can never be warm or mediocre.  Radicals are more stupid than a steam locomotive, but you will never meet among them a person with an extensive mind, whose mind Satan himself rejoices.  There are no murderers and villains among them, because they are open, as if in the palm of your hand.  Their words never go wrong.  The radical can not even imagine such a thing as this: to say one thing and do another. </p><h2>  Historical excursion </h2><p>  If you read the historical kutyum, you will find out an interesting fact and a paradoxical answer to the question: "What are radicals in history?"  These are those who write the story itself, remaining on its golden pages imperishable and majestic.  Blood flows from under their names - often their own, but also of other people too.  But this is the blood that fertilizes the earth, so that from it it will multiply threefold, and all, and tenfold. </p><p>  They cannot tolerate stagnation and warm rot.  Therefore, you will not meet in history among the environment of tyrants people who would radically stand against tyranny.  This is impossible to imagine.  Among those who elevated the tyrant to the very top, there are plenty of radicals.  They are gullible, like children.  But their heads first fell on the block and bounced under the axes under the joyful squeals of the crowd.  And it was not without reason that Goethe said that those who go against evil have long necks.  Probably in order to make it convenient for executioners to earn a living. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

What did they not live?  He was a centurion, and he went to an audience to the king.  And Minin with Pozharsky?  Rich merchant.  Yes, he, as a modern oligarch, can afford any power.  Pozharsky is even easier - a major military commander, who managed to curry favor with the five authorities.  But they were radicals.  Swamp and decay is not for them, even comfortable and warm.  And when the clouds were dispelled, they descended imperceptibly and spent 150 years in oblivion.  Their names surfaced, a highly artistic monument was erected, music was written with words.  They are now singing both glory and honor, as if they had founded dynasties, and not the Romanovs.

    <h2>  <span>Political life.</span>  How does a solution mature? </h2><p>  Modern state and society are a combination of interests.  It‚Äôs scary to look at them from the side.  For this, politicians were invented to untangle the intricacies.  When they work well, normal people don‚Äôt talk about politics.  There should not be a policy for the layman.  If an average person talks about politics, it means that his pockets are empty, and the state has reached the average skin.  And it's time to worry - what is it?  Radicals where and why are silent?  But the state is not being dropped from heaven to earth.  It consists of very real people who are required to perform certain functions.  For this purpose, taxes were invented as a fee for the performance of functions, and not as requisitions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are radicals in politics" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/374195.jpg?1397470845652" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the state is run by ordinary people who love the swamp and the warm rotting environment.  And the state would imperceptibly rot together with the people if restless people did not exist.  And suddenly an interested philistine hears screams from the very top: what are radicals in politics?  This is the destruction of stability!  And paradoxically - the top is shouting right.  Indeed, stability is collapsing, and this does not make anyone any easier.  But rotten meat from the state‚Äôs body begins to fall away, exposing nerves.  And only now the process begins, which is called decision-making. </p><p>  And so all over the world.  Only in some countries does rot last a decade, and in others a couple of months. </p>
