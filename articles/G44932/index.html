Today, the history of Crimea has replenished with another page, which makes it even more interesting for guests.  However, politics and international relations had not only a positive, but also a detrimental effect on the infrastructure of the region ... First of all, this affected the transport links with the peninsula.  Today, getting to the sunny Crimean coast is not so easy.  The question of how to get <span>to Crimea by car</span> is especially acute today. </p>

    <h2>  Recent routes to Crimea </h2><p>  A year ago, it was possible to get to the blessed land of the peninsula in several ways: by plane, by train, by road.  Often, tourists entered the Crimea through Chongar or Krasnoperekopsk.  There were no checkpoints in these parts; night trains flew a thin isthmus without stopping.  And only stopping at Dzhankoy, sleepy passengers realized that they had already left the mainland.  To get to the Crimea by car was also possible without any problems.  And only the drivers of heavy trucks passed several control procedures, which were quite ordinary and did not take much time.  <span>Crimea airports</span> took flights from all over the world and flights from Moscow, for example, took only a couple of hours. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Crimea today?  Choose a route </h2><p>  After recent events in the international arena, when Crimea became part of the Russian Federation again, and war broke out in the Donbass, most of the previous routes to the peninsula have lost their relevance.  For example, getting there by a passenger train became dangerous - you have to go through the territory covered by the war.  In addition, most flights are simply canceled.  For the same reasons, passenger vehicles lose their relevance.  It was also impossible to fly to Simferopol airport by plane at one time.  Today flights from Moscow and many other cities of Russia are resumed.  Ukrainian and most international airlines do not fly to Crimea yet.  You can get to the peninsula by plane rather quickly, but the price can not be called budget.  It remains a personal vehicle.  You can get to the Crimea by car from the side of Kerch, using the services of the ferry. </p><h2>  Kerch ferry </h2><p>  The first sources of crossings through the <span>Kerch Strait</span> date back to the period of antiquity.  In the modern history of Crimea, attempts to establish communication between the two banks began after the war.  In the 44th year, a bridge was built from materials left by the German army.  Unfortunately, his fate turned out to be sad - just three months after the grand opening, he was badly damaged by the ice driven from the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a new bridge seemed expensive and irrational to the country's leadership.  Therefore, it was decided to build a ferry.  At first, even railway ferries, capable of transporting not only vehicles and people, but also loaded wagons, ran between Crimea and the Caucasus.  Today, 4 ferries run between the Caucasus and Crimea points: Yeisk, Kerch-2, Nikolay Aleksenenko and the Greek ferry Jonas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Traveling to Crimea by car - 2014 </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists visiting the Kerch ferry crossing are rather unanimous.  The path is not easy and quite long.  Sometimes people stand in lines for almost two days.  Spending 15-20 hours in anticipation is quite a common case, moreover, such a ‚Äúshort" downtime in these parts is considered successful. </p>

    <p>  Before traveling to Crimea by car, people stock up on the press, charge gadgets as much as possible, buy food and drinking water.  The most desperate take tents, sleeping bags, air mattresses with them to the difficult path.  It will take a long time to wait - and everyone is ready for this.  In the opposite direction, a similar situation - leaving Crimea is not as easy as entering it.  The already difficult situation at both points is even more aggravated when the sea is restless.  Since August 28, the situation at checkpoints has become possible to monitor using the Internet. </p>

    <p>  The issue of <span>ferry crossing</span> is very acute today.  The authorities are doing everything possible to reduce the waiting time for passengers, increase safety in a troubled area, and organize maximum comfort.  In the areas of the waiting points there is free internet, doctors and law enforcement officers are on duty.  Unfortunately, a long wait aggravates the relationship, and from time to time they heat up.  So, in August 2014, while waiting for the queue for the ferry, a verbal skirmish arose between passengers, as a result of which a fight broke out.  The female driver received a head injury and was taken to hospital.  Law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation urge all who expect to treat the situation with understanding and show patience.  The search for solutions to the problems continues.  Perhaps in the near future pre-registration will be introduced, which will reduce the waiting time.  It will be enough for everyone to register before driving to Crimea by car in order to know the time of loading by ferry.  Benefits from joining the free online traffic jam tracking program. </p><h2>  Financial side </h2><p>  How to get to Crimea by car using a ferry?  Those who have waited their turn can finally take the ferry.  One ship holds several buses and dozens of cars.  The cost of crossing is quite low.  81 rubles will be paid for a children's ticket, twice as much for an adult.  A system of benefits is provided.  Transportation of a vehicle depends on its modification: </p><ol><li>  Moped, bicycle - 109 p. </li><li>  Motorcycle - 462 p. </li><li>  Passenger car (up to 4.20 m) - 1190 p. </li><li>  Passenger car (4.21 - 5.30 m) - 1688 p. </li><li>  Bus (9 - 17 seats) - 2632 p. </li><li>  Bus (up to 30 seats) - 2919 p. </li><li>  Freight transport - from 2401 p. </li></ol><h2>  New bridge </h2>

    <p>  The land road to the Crimea is needed by tourists, and business, and the authorities.  The bridge can make it possible to significantly reduce material and time costs for the transportation of goods.  During the holiday season, he will relieve stress at the entrances to the Crimea.  The route "Moscow - Crimea" by car will become easy and affordable.  However, no one wants a repeat of the 1944 situation.  Plans for the construction of a bridge in Ukraine and Russia were long ago, relevant agreements and treaties were signed long before Crimea became part of the Russian Federation.  Today, the state government is engaged in the construction of the bridge closely.  All the nuances are taken into account - the bridge must be strong enough to withstand a possible ice attack and a significant traffic flow.  And he should in no way interfere with shipping.  For the implementation of the new project, the past negative experience, the latest technologies, and urgent needs are taken into account.  According to the plans of the authorities of the Russian Federation, the construction of a bridge connecting the Caucasus and Crimea will begin in the near future. </p>

    <p>  There is a special romance in motorcycle travel.  Motor racing in the Crimea has long been a whole movement, gathering under its wing lovers of two-wheeled vehicles from all over the mainland.  For several years now, Crimea has been considered a place of pilgrimage for bikers.  All kinds of festivals and bike shows contribute to this. </p><h2>  Crimean service for motorists </h2><p>  Reviews of avid motorists who have repeatedly conquered Crimean autobahns indicate that everything is in order with the service on the peninsula.  There are enough parking lots, there is enough space for them all.  One parking space costs from 50 rubles per day.  It‚Äôs more difficult to get a car near the sights.  However, what is wrong with walking a kilometer and a half on foot?  Most hotels, inns, inns have their own parking lots.  There are parking lots near many restaurants, coffee houses, bistros. </p><p>  It is safe to praise the Crimean roads.  The vast majority of them have normal coverage.  On the main highways there are many gas stations, tire and diagnostic workshops.  The authorities of the peninsula continue to initiate and implement projects aimed at developing the tourism infrastructure of Crimea. </p>
