It is not surprising that housing construction is proceeding very rapidly here.  So, at the end of the year 2016, two large projects were immediately commissioned in the city, one of which was the Krylov residential complex, or, as it was called in the old fashion, Krylov.  This complex surrendered in two stages, and each became an exclusive.  Its slender tall buildings, made in white and blue tones, and in the evening lit by dozens of backlighting lights, still attract attention from afar.  Residents of the complex can boast not only its design and decoration, but also their own swimming pool, beauty salon, children's club. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the most elite place of the city built LCD "Krylov".  Yekaterinburg is steadily developing and expanding, rising to an international level.  In the general plan of its improvement there is a clause on the demolition of old buildings that are of neither architectural nor historical value, and in their place the construction of modern residential buildings, parks, shopping centers, children's institutions.  The Krylov housing complex, which began to be built opposite the Central Stadium, on the site between Tatishchev, Klyuchevskaya, Pirogov and Melnikov, also fits perfectly with this item.  To get a place for the construction site, the developer had to demolish several old houses.  Now this area has become more relevant to the modern level and more presentable.  Located LCD "Krylov" in the city center.  Here, within a radius of one kilometer, there are kindergartens, schools, a stadium, supermarkets and shops, restaurants, cafes, clinics, bank branches, a university, a medical college, and a research institute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Krylov" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1601100.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also no problems with transport.  The stops near the new complex have not yet been approved, the metro is also far away (the nearest station, Ploshchad 1905 goda, 1700 meters), but within a radius of 400 meters there are bus stops, minibuses, trolleybuses.  In total, about 20 routes run here, so you can easily get to anywhere in Yekaterinburg. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  From these positions LCD ‚ÄúKrylov‚Äù is not very conveniently located.  Yekaterinburg in terms of air pollution is in the leading group among the cities of the Urals.  Its location on the mountain slopes is ‚Äúguilty‚Äù of a special air circulation, during which its movement and stagnation are too quiet.  There are many industrial enterprises in Yekaterinburg, but all of them are located far from the Krylov complex and do not have any noticeable adverse effect on its inhabitants.  Quite a different thing - cars, which in the city center are always too many.  They emit about 120,000 tons of hazardous substances into the atmosphere during the year.  For comparison: the annual emissions of all enterprises in Yekaterinburg are only 20,000 tons.  Here it is up to the tenants to choose - either live where the environment is poor, but in a prestigious complex in the city center, or live close to nature, but in the suburbs. </p><p>  However, the owners of apartments in Krylov have a walk where.  Just 500 meters from the complex is a green square, and next to a large park "XXII Party Congress." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Krylov Yekaterinburg" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1601103.jpg" width="502"></div>

According to the structural organization, it is a divisional holding company, which is part of the Sinara group.  The areas of activity of the holding are full management of construction projects in the region, from the stage of their design to the implementation stage.  The interests of the company apply to both housing and commercial facilities.  Over the years of work in the piggy bank "Sinara Development" 25 completed projects.  Only in 2016, the company passed 524 thousand square meters in Yekaterinburg.  At about the same time, the Krylov, Peremena, and Svoy Krug rounds passed the surrender. </p><p>  In its work, Sinara Development focuses on the introduction of advanced world construction technologies, while maintaining domestic traditions. </p><h2>  Residential complex "Krylov-1" </h2><p>  Sinara Development Company in 2012 launched a large-scale project called LCD Krylov.  It included two lines.  The first included one house in eight sections.  They consisted of buildings in 11, 12, 18 and 25 floors.  The design of all buildings was conceived in a single color scheme of light gray and gray-blue shades, which looked new, bold and unusually spectacular.  Housing here was built only in business class.  On the first two floors of the complex, according to the plan, they had to build a children's club, a beauty salon, several shops and offices.  Nearby planned to build a fitness center.  The company realized all this and successfully passed it in 2015.  At the house of the first stage of the residential complex ‚ÄúKrylov‚Äù the address is: Melnikova street, 27. The complex confirms its status of business-class housing not only with exclusive infrastructure, but also with a beautifully landscaped area, where flowers and trees are planted, architectural forms are established that correspond to the general style of the building, equipped with several playgrounds with soft rubber coating, sports fields, beautiful recreation areas.  Entrance to the complex is only through the reception.  It is located in a spacious hall, furnished with upholstered furniture.  The elevator area, of which there are several, is also spacious, the floors are made "marbled", the walls are lined with ceramic tiles.  The infrastructure includes an underground parking, where you can go down by elevator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Krylov 2nd stage Yekaterinburg" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1601102.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Residential complex "Krylov-2" </h2><p>  Next to the first back in 2015, they began to build the second house of the Krylov <span>residential complex</span> .  It was supposed to consist of five sections, also of different heights, but in this case at 15, 18 and 30 floors.  The style of the buildings is ultramodern; concrete and glass prevail in the exterior design, which successfully distinguishes the Krylov housing complex.  The photo captured facades made exclusively of glass panels with a mirror effect.  They give the complex a somewhat formal and at the same time compositionally finished look.  In general, the buildings of the second stage continue and complement the architectural ensemble of the first stage, but here the designers made some distinctive details.  So, a bright illumination has been arranged along the contours of the structures, which very effectively decorates the buildings at night.  The second highlight is the outdoor <span>panoramic elevators,</span> using which residents can enjoy the surroundings.  They will be placed on each section.  The project provides for special panels so that the movement of elevators does not interfere with the owners of apartments in the immediate vicinity of the walls of which they are mounted.  In addition, internal elevators are left.  Although the buildings of the entire complex are lined up nearby, the second stage of the Krylov new building (residential complex, Yekaterinburg) has the following address: Tatishcheva Street, No. 47A.  Once upon a time there was, and so far, the house number 47 remains in the documents. The letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù was added so that there would be no confusion. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Design </h2><p>  Like already completed houses of the residential complex ‚ÄúKrylov‚Äù, Stage 2 will also have excellent infrastructure.  The complex has a courtyard without access by unauthorized persons.  Entrance to the entrances for the convenience of residents is planned both from the yard and from the street, but with the obligatory crossing of the control zone.  In the courtyard of the complex will be installed playgrounds with a safe cover, nice relaxation areas with benches, sports grounds.  In the territory, which has already been raised above ground level, it is planned to lay flower beds, plant flowering shrubs and trees, and place beautiful architectural forms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Krylov Yekaterinburg reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1601093.jpg" width="506"></div>

    <p>  The first floors of the buildings will be non-residential.  Here boutiques, a restaurant, a cafe, a kindergarten, and other leisure facilities will begin work.  Entrance to them will be separate.  Underground parking, as in the first stage, was built in the Krylov-2 residential complex. </p><p>  All buildings were erected using monolithic technologies.  Since winters are rather cool in Yekaterinburg, the external walls are made in the form of sandwich panels with a layer of insulation "Izover", and all the loggias were glazed.  According to the plan, only 3-4 are located on the floors of the buildings, and 2-3 apartments on the upper floors.  In addition, on the 30th floor, architects designed penthouses with spacious terraces. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  In the second phase of the residential complex "Krylov" there are the following types of apartments: </p><p>  - one-room with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã44 m <sup>2</sup> to 52 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 65 m <sup>2</sup> to 86 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - three-room apartments - from 84 m <sup>2</sup> to 130 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - four-room - 126 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - penthouses - 168 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  Somewhat better in the apartments of the second phase of the residential complex "Krylov" design.  The one-room apartment project includes a spacious entrance hall with or without a pantry (from 6 m <sup>2</sup> to 8 m <sup>2</sup> ), a combined bathroom and bath (5.24 m <sup>2</sup> ), a kitchen (from 12 to 18 m <sup>2</sup> ), a room (from 15 to 18 m <sup>2</sup> ) and a spacious loggia. </p><p>  The ‚Äútwo-piece‚Äù project includes a corridor (from 5 to 14 m <sup>2</sup> ), a separate bath and toilet, a kitchen (from 14.5 to 21.5 m <sup>2</sup> ), two rooms with windows on one or two sides, a loggia. </p><p>  The layout of the "three rubles" is represented by the largest number of options.  Apartments differ in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãkitchens (from 7 to 21 m <sup>2</sup> ), the arrangement of rooms, the number of loggias (two or one).  Bathrooms and bathtubs are separate everywhere, two-section corridors, rooms are bright and spacious. </p><p>  Four-room apartments are presented in three versions - with a large (17 m <sup>2</sup> ) or small (8 m <sup>2</sup> ) kitchen, a two-section corridor with or without a pantry, separate bathroom and bathtub, one loggia or no balcony or a loggia at all. </p><p>  All apartments are for rent with finishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krylov LCD Ekaterinburg address" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1601096.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Krylov", stage 2 (Yekaterinburg): prices </h2><p>  Since housing in the complex has a class of "business", the prices for it are appropriate.  At the moment they are: </p><p>  - one-room - from 4 816 900 to 5 130 400 rubles; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 5,425,560 to 6,882,260 rubles; </p><p>  - three-room apartments - from 9 101 400 to 13 150 000 rubles; </p><p>  - four-room apartments - from 8 965 600 (without a loggia) to 11 182 600 rubles. </p><p>  You can buy an apartment for 100% of the cost or by issuing a mortgage.  For this project, the following people are collaborating with the developer: </p><p>  - Sberbank. </p><p>  - Raiffeisenbank. </p><p>  - Gazprombank. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  The plan stated that in the II quarter of 2016 the second phase of the residential complex ‚ÄúKrylov‚Äù will be commissioned.  Responses of residents note that by this time the builders had not completed the improvement of the territory and some work in the buildings, so the deadlines were postponed to the end of the year.  The house was officially commissioned and the act was signed in November 14, 2016.  Acceptance of their apartments by tenants began in early December, and has been and is still being carried out by mutual preliminary agreement.  In the process, some violations are revealed, mainly consisting in minor imperfections, which the customer agrees to eliminate in accordance with the act.  Before receiving keys on hand, apartment owners must pay a portion of their future utility bills.  To date, most of the apartments are accepted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Krylov photo" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1601094.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Krylov" (Yekaterinburg): reviews </h2><p>  Since housing in this project has the status of a business class and is quite expensive, everything here must be performed as efficiently as possible. </p><p>  The advantages noted by interest holders: </p><p>  - location in a good location (city center), close to bus stops, shops, educational institutions, hospital; </p><p>  - Beautiful design; </p><p>  - rich infrastructure; </p><p>  - underground parking; </p><p>  - availability in the security complex; </p><p>  - excellent layout of apartments; </p><p>  - satisfactory quality of work. </p><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><p>  - relatively high prices; </p><p>  - from the delivery of the object to the issuance of keys more than a month. </p><p>  In the first stage: </p><p>  - almost no declared landscaping of the yard; </p><p>  - the apartments have poor sound insulation; </p><p>  - poor quality water from taps; </p><p>  - a lot of imperfections in the apartments (cracks on the walls, blowing from the windows); </p><p>  - elevators work irregularly. </p><p>  In the second stage: </p><p>  - the territory is not well-maintained; </p><p>  - small playgrounds; </p><p>  - the presence of apartments without loggias, which is unacceptable for housing category business class. </p>
