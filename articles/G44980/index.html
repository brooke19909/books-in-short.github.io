But if you decide to spend a couple of days in Kiev, then you need to go to Feofania.  Especially for visiting the park, spring and summer are favorable. </p><p>  Shady alleys, foliage of arbors, and flower beds create a cozy atmosphere.  You completely forget that there is a millionaire city nearby.  A visit to Feofania is also valuable for pilgrims - after all, several miraculous sources are contained on its territory.  How to visit this beautiful oasis of nature in Kiev - read in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Feofania Kiev how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/684479.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The territory on which the modern Feofania park is located was first mentioned in a chronicle dating back to 1471.  It was then called Lazarivschina - by the name of a pious old man who kept an apiary here.  In the sixteenth century, this site belonged to the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, and then it was acquired by the Kiev <span>Metropolitan Peter</span> Mogila.  His successor Sylvester Kosov (1647-1657) transferred the land to the ownership of St. Sophia Monastery.  Only in 1776 the property was removed from the possession of the church and transferred to the sovereign treasury.  But in 1802, the land was again transferred to the churchmen.  The bishop of Kiev Theophanes built here a summer residence and the Mikhailovsky Church.  Then this territory began to be called by the name of its owner.  Until 1930 there was a monastery.  For a long time there was a boarding school and a cooperative economy, until in 1972 these lands became a monument of landscape gardening art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feofania park" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/684487.jpg" width="600"></div>

When visiting the park, be prepared to walk up and down, as it occupies the Feofanovskaya beam, which is mountainous, rugged by ravines.  Several minibuses run to this part of the city from the center.  Number 548 leaves from Bessarabskaya Square, driving along Gorky Street and Lybidskaya metro station.  You can also use minibus number 172.  She leaves Leningradskaya Square and follows through the metro station "Friendship of Peoples" and "Lybidskaya", and also passes VDNH. </p><p>  If you are planning to visit Feofania Park on a summer weekend, you need to know in advance how to get there.  On weekends, the indicated minibuses run only to VDNH (Pirogovo).  Therefore, you should get off at the metrological street stop and walk to the church of <span>St. Panteleimon.</span>  It is located at: academician Lebedev street, 19. In fact, this is a park.  Inspect the cathedral and the monastery, and then turn right and go down a little. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feofania park in Kiev cost" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/684490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Park "Feofania" in Kiev: cost </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this place has the status of a monument of garden art since 1972, for a long time the entrance to it was free.  But it was difficult for the city authorities to maintain such a huge territory.  Therefore, since 2012, entry fees have been charged.  Be prepared to fork out for an adult for ten hryvnias and another five for a child.  Kievans, for whom Feofania is a favorite place for recreation and picnics, get a monthly subscription.  It costs fifty hryvnias.  For pensioners, people with disabilities, war veterans and ATO, admission remains free.  The park administration provides various services for money.  So, for an excursion in Ukrainian, English or Russian, they will ask you 120 UAH, for a wedding photo shoot - 250, and for organizing a banquet or corporate party - a thousand hryvnias.  The park runs until eleven o'clock in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feofania park photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/684492.jpg" width="600"></div>

And now many tourists from different parts of the country and even abroad visit the Feofania park not to admire the beautiful nature or have a picnic, but to go on a pilgrimage path and take a bath. </p><p>  There are more than ten sources.  Among the pilgrims, the ‚ÄúTears of Our Lady‚Äù are most popular.  The water in this spring is brackish.  After all, it should be tears. </p><p>  A little further is another key, equipped under the bathhouse.  Water in it, even in the summer heat, does not rise above +8 degrees.  But even in winter, the key does not freeze.  There are changing cabins nearby.  Priests recommend plunging into the font three times, crossing themselves the same number of times and reciting a prayer.  Also, do not forget to drink from the keys of St. Nicholas, Michael, Panteleimon and the Blessed Virgin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feofania park how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/684497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural sights </h2><p>  The Feofania Park is an amazing mix of natural and man-made landscapes.  Sometimes it seems that you are in a virgin forest, and sometimes from all sides surrounded by alpine hills, curtains, rose gardens and gazebos among fountains.  The park also has a cascade of lakes inhabited by <span>waterfowl.</span>  On the territory of ancient oaks, which are more than three hundred years old.  Specialists of the botanical garden monitor the safety of design and the filling of species diversity.  Several times a year, flower beds and curtains are planted with seasonal flowers. </p><h2>  Historical sights </h2><p>  Park "Feofania" is interesting for lovers of antiquity.  The Church of St. Panteleimon was returned to the church community in 1990, and now it has become a monastery.  This temple impresses with its appearance and interior decoration.  The estate of academician Palladin, president of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, has been preserved on the territory of the park.  The core of the architectural ensemble of the central part of the park is the Rodovid fountain.  In his work, music and dance of water jets are synchronized. </p>
