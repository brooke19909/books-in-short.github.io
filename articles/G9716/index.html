  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Odessa Children's Camp "Victoria"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vacations are always a joyful event for children.  But often the onset of the holidays does not coincide with the leave of the parents and then the only right decision is to send the child to rest on his own, for example, in a children's camp.  After all, independent rest in the camp allows you not only to have a great rest, to find many friends, but also to significantly improve your health and also become independent.  However, the choice of the camp must be approached with all responsibility in order to avoid possible negative consequences. </p><h2>  Information about the Victoria Camp in Odessa </h2><p>  Health complex "Victoria" is located in the city of Odessa, at the Dacha Kovalevsky-93.  The shift is 21 days.  The camp can take about 420 children for a shift.  The health complex carries out its activities throughout the year, helping children not only significantly improve their health, but also spend time with benefit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="frontnews.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp Victoria" class="if uuid-2680970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2680970.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of the ticket in 2017 was about 2000-2500 UAH.  and this is quite justified, since in addition to five meals a day, visits include circles and excursions. </p><h2>  Camp infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the Victoria camp in Odessa is very developed and includes everything you need to spend your holidays in comfort.  The camp has its own private beach, sports and playgrounds, a sports club, a medical center, a dining room, a laundry room and a summer stage.  Health complex "Victoria" was built from environmentally friendly materials, namely using wood.  The camp has both quadruple rooms and deluxe rooms.  A photo of the Odessa camp "Victoria" is a confirmation of this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bathrooms in the camp are equipped with new showers, toilets and sinks.  The number of bathrooms allows you to avoid queues, which is an important component in organizing recreation for children. </p><h2>  Cultural and entertainment program of the camp </h2><p>  Camp "Victoria" in Odessa has a very rich cultural program.  Here, in addition to the usual games in the fresh air and swimming on the beach, the organizers of summer vacations offer children a large number of contests, concerts and excursions, thanks to which children will not only have fun, but also be rich in culture.  In addition to the extensive cultural and entertainment program, the Victoria Camp in Odessa offers vacationers modern entertainment such as satellite TV and the Internet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="omr.gov.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp room" class="if uuid-2681113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2681113.jpg"></div><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear that the camp ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äù is chosen not only because of the modern decoration of the rooms.  The territory is simply surrounded by greenery.  Experienced staff does everything to make rest for children useful and exciting.  So, the instructors of the camp will teach the child to swim or join in any sport.  Leading groups will teach needlework and other useful skills, and experienced guides will conduct fascinating excursions. </p><p>  But, unfortunately, due to tragic circumstances, all this is in the past, and the once noisy camp filled with children's laughter was empty. </p><h2>  Fire in the children's camp in Odessa "Victoria" </h2><p>  On the night of September 15-16, 2017, a fire occurred in this camp, beloved and familiar to many campers, in one of its buildings.  As a result of which at least 5 people were injured, three of whom died, and two were hospitalized with burns and carbon monoxide poisoning.  As a result of this egregious accident, Odessa's health camp Victoria was closed until all circumstances were clarified. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thetruthspeaker.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire at Victoria Camp" class="if uuid-2680969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2680969.jpg"></div><p>  According to preliminary data, information leaked to the press that the cause of the fire was the improper operation of one of the electrical appliances.  However, investigators note that the tragedy could have been avoided if the fire alarm functioned in the camp, which at that time was in a malfunctioning state. </p><p>  Despite the fire that occurred in the Victoria camp, many vacationers still hope that the camp will be opened, because for many it really was a loved one. </p>
