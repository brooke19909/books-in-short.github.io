Crochet patterns: diagrams and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scarves are not only an element of clothing that helps to warm up in the cold season.  It is also a stylish accessory.  They are made in different techniques using a variety of materials.  For this reason, more than one <span>crochet scarf</span> pattern is created <span>.</span>  Each craftswoman always wants to stand out among the rest with the originality of her product. </p><h2>  A few words about materials and hooks </h2><p>  Each craftswoman knows how unrealistic it is to repeat a product based on its description.  An exact copy will never work, because there are some points that significantly affect the dimensions of the product, especially if the work is done with a hook. </p><p>  Before you begin to disassemble patterns crochet with schemes, you need to say a few words about the hooks.  Each manufacturer in fact has their different sizes.  For example, No. 5, one will have 5 mm, and the other only 4 mm.  And this is already reflected in the future product. </p><p>  The thickness of the threads of different brands is also different.  At first glance, this is an insignificant factor, but it is noticeably reflected in the finished scarf or cardigan.  Yes, and needlewomen differently use a hook, tightening the threads stronger and weaker.  From this, the density of the canvas and its size change. </p>

    <p>  So it turns out in the end that the crochet patterns for the scarf, the schemes of which we will consider, have conditional dimensions.  To get a really beautiful and unique product, you need to connect all your imagination and your own vision of the finished scarf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple and without troubles </h2><p>  Let's start with the simplest product, for which a crocheted scarf pattern is described in just two or three words: a double crochet.  Indeed, the easiest way to make a scarf is this basic element.  Work begins with a chain of air loops, the length of which is equal to the width of the scarf.  Next, each row is knitted <span>with crochets</span> until the desired length is reached. </p><p>  There are several variations of this pattern.  Firstly, you can do not one, but two or three yarn.  In this case, knitting will go faster, and the fabric will turn out not so dense.  Secondly, the edges of the product may not seem quite neat.  To do this, it is better to tie a scarf with a crochet. </p><p>  Thirdly, such a little boring model can be revived with the help of melange thread, interesting applique or openwork edges connected at the ends of the product.  It turns out that any crochet patterns for beginners well turn into a simple, but rather original scarf. </p><h2>  Variation on the subject of double crochet </h2><p>  In search of ideas for any product, we look through a wide variety of crochet patterns, patterns and descriptions.  It often happens that it is quite difficult to complete the options found.  Therefore, the next version is suitable for every craftswoman who knows how to make at least double crochets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns for scarf patterns" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/951421.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern consists of alternating two types of column groups.  In one row, we knit them in 2 with a chain of air loops between them, and in the next we carry out 4 and do not knit completely a chain of w / n. </p><p>  Such crochet patterns for beginners are knitted quite simply.  At the same time, they look original and create a canvas with a small openwork.  To make the product look like a scarf as much as possible, it is necessary to tie its edges in a circle with columns without a crochet, and at the ends make long tassels or hang air pompons created from the remains of yarn spent on a scarf. </p><h2>  Beautiful crochet scarf pattern </h2><p>  Scarves are used not only as insulation in cold weather, but also as a stylish accessory.  For these purposes, it is best to choose thin yarn and <span>delicate crochet patterns</span> for a scarf.  Under such conditions, the accessory will not seem heavy and too noticeable in any outfit. </p><p>  This pattern uses air loops, double crochet and without crochet.  In the first row we knit 5 SC and a chain of 2 air loops between them.  In the second row, the number of single crochet columns is reduced to 3, and under the high-arch arches, we knit 2 double crochet stitches with 1 double crochet on both sides of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns with patterns" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/951422.jpg" width="236"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In the third row, the single crochet is reduced to 1, but the double crochet is done by 5. This will be the vertical report of the pattern. </p><p>  Next, we knit according to the same pattern, but the pattern will be obtained in a checkerboard pattern.  We continue the work until the product becomes the length we need.  We pay special attention to the places of transition from row to row, so that the edges are neat. </p><h2>  Wide fans </h2><p>  There are different crochet patterns for the scarf.  Schemes of several simple options we have discussed above.  Now let's look at another exceptional option. </p><p>  It is built on all the same columns with a crochet, which together form large fans, and not as in the previous versions.  The pattern report is designed for 3 rows.  In each of them a certain number of single crochet columns is added, due to which the fans in the pattern are ‚Äúopened‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns and description" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/951423.jpg" width="244"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  To prevent the product from being pulled together and the canvas to keep the same width, air loops are used in the pattern, the number of which in each row varies, depending on how large the number of double crochets in this row. </p><p>  The pattern is obtained in a <span>checkerboard pattern,</span> due to which there are no large gaps and unnecessary holes that are not at all appropriate in this particular product.  <span>Knitting a scarf with</span> this pattern is better from thin, but warm yarn, such as mohair or tiftik, but do not forget to add a thin synthetic thread to keep the product in shape. </p><h2>  Loin scarf </h2><p>  The crochet patterns proposed above with schemes had a checkerboard pattern, but the next one has a clear geometry.  It is based on fillet knitting, but with a little complication, due to which a beautiful openwork rhombus is obtained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="m" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/951424.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  For one report, we need 9 loin knitting cells.  Already in the second row in the fifth of them we knit a fan of 3 double crochets.  In the third row on both sides of the fan we knit 2 more of the same elements.  We rise so 4 rows in a row.  Between the fans we make chains of air loops: first 3, then 7, and then 9. </p><p>  Starting the narrowing of the rhombus, with a single crochet, we connect all the free chains from the iv, in the next row we also knit another single crochet and close the rhombus. </p><p>  These are the simplest crochet patterns.  Schemes and a description of them are known to many, even novice craftswomen. </p><h2>  Cross knitting </h2><p>  Prior to this, each crochet scarf pattern was made in length.  But you can knit products in width.  This is especially true for openwork products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork crochet patterns for a scarf" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/951425.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The pattern for such a scarf is selected as airy as possible.  The first chain of air loops is dialed in accordance with the desired length of the future product.  The result is not very many rows, but they all have a fairly large length. </p><p>  The pattern shown in the photo is built on the basis of all the same double crochet columns.  Alternatively, wide fans can be used.  They are a bit like this pattern.  It is also proposed here to alternate from dense and openwork fans formed from double crochets and air loops. </p>
