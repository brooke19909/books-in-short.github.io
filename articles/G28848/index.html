    <p>  It is difficult to find a person who does not want to live in abundance.  And if some have to work daily in sweat to earn a penny, then others gave fortunes in the form of an inheritance. </p><h2>  1. Wealth without happiness - empty ringing of coins </h2><p>  Unfortunately, most of us are not spoiled of fate, and there is no end in sight to our daily troubles.  But many rich people created their first capital thanks to their inventiveness, the proper use of their talents, on which their entire biography was built.  And the thoughts of <span>the richest people in the world,</span> as time shows, are united in one thing - to work as much as possible with the mind and not be lazy. </p><p>  The famous French writer and philosopher Stendhal believed that man does not live on earth in order to become rich, but in order to become happy.  To achieve high prosperity does not mean to find peace and the joy of life.  Direct proof of this is the biographies of the world's richest people.  Many billionaires, drowning in luxury, still remained lonely and miserable. </p>

    <h2>  2. Biography and thoughts of the richest people in the world, besides good </h2><p>  Successful of this world are known to all.  Bill Gates, for example, has for several years been one of <span>the richest people.</span>  And where did you start?  He just loved technology, was fond of computers and created the Microsoft program.  He simply took a risk, but he took a deliberate risk, realizing that the product is necessary for users of personal computers.  His main motto is not to stop there.  It was he who expressed the idea that intellectual property has a shelf life of bananas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Let's look at another successful lady.  Oprah Winfrey, a black American, lived in a poor family, studied in a simple school.  Only work on herself, curiosity and a diligent attitude to everything that she does, brought her to the bench of the Faculty of History.  Perhaps it was the biography and thoughts of the richest people in the world that she learned about from historical books that taught her a lot.  ‚ÄúDo not give up on your dreams.  Do not be disappointed in yourself.  Your perseverance will pay off anyway! ‚Äù  - these are her words.  They are a direct confirmation of her determination.  A keen mind, a desire to delve deeper into the fate of people, speech purity made her OWN program the most popular and in demand among the audience.  So not all biographies of the richest people in the world are full of gifts of fate. </p><h2>  3. Acquired or assigned? </h2><p>  I don‚Äôt really want to find out how the wealthy Russian tycoons got rich, the whole point is that here, except for intelligence and resourcefulness, the ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù effect worked.  Many Russian rich people became owners of the property left over from the Soviet period: factories, factories, combines, etc. The biography and thoughts of the richest people in the world regarding Russian billionaires lose their instructiveness and meaning.  Everything was earned fraudulently in the dashing 90s through the appropriation of someone else's or state capital. </p><p>  Another thing is the American billionaire Donald Trump.  He was brought up in an ordinary family, where there were four children.  Donald was a difficult child, and in order to curb the little temper of the boy a little, he was placed at the Military Academy at the age of 13.  And there he learned discipline and rigidity.  He perfectly characterized his temper with the words: ‚ÄúIn business, it is better to be impudent, even impudent, than tough and intractable.‚Äù  Studying contributed to a moral start, and Donald decided to be more aggressive in order to get the desired result.  The owner of numerous casinos and hotels scattered around the world, began with the fact that with the support of the state, together with his father, he reconstructed the Commodor Hotel.  The biography of the richest people in the world - Donald and Fred Trump - tells that there are no easy ways to wealth.  Life rewards those who are not afraid of difficulties. </p><p>  The biography of the richest people in the world often begins with tremors of a moral and psychological nature.  The main thing is to be able to <span>hold the blow</span> and not depart from the intended target. </p>
