  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ethnic culture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ethnic and national culture - different concepts.  The first is part of the structure of the second.  In other words, the culture of a developed nation always includes an ethnic component - the culture of one or more nationalities that formed it (the nation).  This component reflects the centuries-old experience of life and the rational structure and management of the economy in accordance with these climatic conditions. </p><p>  Ethnic culture is manifested in the characteristics of folklore, food, <span>clothing, traditional</span> medicine and crafts, and other areas of life.  To a greater extent, its features were preserved in villages than in cities.  Ethnic culture is the oldest <span>cultural layer.</span>  It is she who carries all the traditions of her ancestors. </p><p>  Ethnic culture is focused on maintaining attachment to the past, endowed with continuity and conservatism.  Its individual elements indicate the identity of the people.  For example, such symbols include a sarafan and a samovar among the Russians, spaghetti from the Italians, a plaid skirt from the Scots, ghost legends and oatmeal from the British.  Similar features are present among the peoples of all countries. </p><p>  It should be noted that <span>national culture is</span> not reduced to <span>national culture</span> .  The latter is formed on the basis of education, writing and philosophy, science and art, literature, technological and <span>socio-political development of the</span> people.  Moreover, the comprehension of national culture is carried out through self-education, education.  Cognition requires special intellectual efforts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ethnic culture, in turn, is the basis for development.  A folk language is formed in it, it becomes a source of literary plots and images, <span>architectural styles,</span> musical rhythms.  The traditions developing in it over the centuries have an impact on the uniqueness and originality of the whole nation as a whole. </p><p>  At the same time, tending to isolation, adherence to the remnants of the past, ethnic culture often does not meet modern living standards.  She does not know changes, does not accept anything alien and unfamiliar, preserving her originality.  In this national culture is characterized by constant changes, innovations.  It absorbs the achievements of other nations. </p><p>  Such discrepancies in history gave rise to periods when there was practically a gap between the culturally developed educated layer of the population and the ‚Äúlower classes‚Äù - adherents of the ethnic group.  So, for example, in Russia in the 18-19 centuries between the common people (peasants) and the noble nobility a real cultural abyss formed.  Often, a Russian nobleman could easily understand a foreigner than his serf.  Moreover, in the "high" society, almost all aristocrats, fluent in the French language, spoke Russian with great difficulty. </p><p>  The geniuses of Russian literature (Pushkin, who managed to combine aristocratic education and simple folk principles, other poets and writers in his poetry), Slavophiles passionately advocating for the protection of the Russian ethnic group - the national spirit, intellectuals who belonged to the people had a great influence on the elimination of this "abyss" . </p><p>  Today, many talk about the need to revive the "native Russian culture."  However, understanding the role and place of an ethnic group, it becomes clear that this can lead to a decline in the cultural development of the nation as a whole.  From the life of the people, signs of antiquity, increasingly, new technologies enter rural life.  Ethnic culture is increasingly being moved to museums. </p><p>  Of course, it is necessary to know and study the national features inherent in their nation.  However, you need to live in a modern culture. </p><p>  National progress is not always regarded as continuous acquisitions and victories.  Together with achievements, there are both contradictions and losses. </p>
