Reliability rating of banks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What reliable banks today exist within the framework of the financial structure of the Russian Federation?  Constant changes in the political and financial sphere of our country have become the reason that residents do not risk investing in deposits.  The same situation is with respect to credit programs of these financial institutions.  But if a citizen wants to use the services of such structures, he is advised to study the reliability and stability rating of banks and the conditions they offer.  This moment is especially necessary for those who plan long-term cooperation with a financial institution.  The list of reliable banks is based on the expert opinion of financial experts and data from the Central Bank, as well as taking into account the feedback from customers of these credit organizations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vov1.vov.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reliability rating of banks" class="if uuid-2943904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2943904.jpg"></div><p>  The main problem of banking institutions is in the service sector.  This, unfortunately, also applies to the activities of employees of a financial institution.  Rudeness and lack of professionalism are found everywhere.  If a future client of such an institution wants to acquire reliable information about the bank‚Äôs proposals, he should get advice from not one, but several of his employees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So which banks are reliable? </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  This financial association is the largest in Russia, it has the largest share in total assets - it reaches almost 30%.  The volume of the loan portfolio is 14 billion rubles, which is three times more than that of the closest competitor.  The main advantage of the institution is that it is a state structure: investors should not be afraid of the possible loss of funds due to revocation of the license.  In addition, Sberbank has the most extensive infrastructure throughout the country, and ATMs can be found even in the most remote cities. </p><p>  This is the most reliable bank for deposits. </p><p>  The main advantages of the institution include: </p><ol><li>  Minimum mortgage rate. </li><li>  Extensive infrastructure. </li><li>  A good and thoughtful bonus program for loans and deposits. </li></ol><p>  Among the shortcomings of Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  Low level of service. </li><li>  Periodically arising difficulties in the operation of computer software. </li><li>  Long wait due to long lines. </li></ol><p>  What financial institutions can still be called reliable?  Which banks are among them? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.likeni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-2951746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72162/2951746.jpg"></div><h2>  "UniCredit Bank" </h2><p>  Currently, a financial institution offers its customers a wide range of services.

The main number of customer complaints is associated with poor service in regional offices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the main advantages of the Unicredit organization are: </p><ol><li>  Good bonus deposit program. </li><li>  The presence of a large number of offices in large cities. </li><li>  Convenient online version of bank account management. </li></ol><p>  Among the disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  Low service. </li><li>  A small number of offices in small cities. </li></ol><p>  Many are interested in reliable banks with high interest rates on deposits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vecernji.ba" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UniCredit Bank" class="if uuid-2951757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72162/2951757.jpg"></div><h2>  Rosbank </h2><p>  It is a subsidiary of a group of financial institutions from France Societe Generale.

The organization offers private entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses, and individuals an extensive range of loan and deposit programs.  Many citizens use car loans and mortgages in this bank.  The state is the owner of part of the capital of a financial institution, so the likelihood of losing money is minimal.

The main advantage is its focus on serving individuals and small businesses.  Because of this, the organization has a well-developed infrastructure, many ATMs and branches.  Deposits made to the bank are in maximum safety, since the institution has public money. </p><p>  The disadvantages and advantages of the bank are identical to those of VTB Bank of Moscow, the only difference is the presence of more interesting private lending programs. </p><h2>  The best financial institutions for making deposits </h2><p>  It is better to make a contribution to the bank that does not have state money, or their amount is minimal.  Such organizations, unfortunately, offer minimum interest rates, but they ensure maximum safety of capital investments.  The highest interest rates are offered by institutions with state support, but in this case, the client runs the risk of losing his funds.  In view of this, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the rating of banks for reliability before entering into financial relations with a banking institution. </p>
