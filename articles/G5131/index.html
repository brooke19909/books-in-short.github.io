However, some scholars believe that the name of this mountain has even more ancient roots.  Bashkirs came to this land only a thousand years ago, and the peoples who lived in this region before, just could not leave this majestic mountain without a name.  However, one way or another, the Bashkirs consider the Iremel mountains sacred. </p><h2>  Mountain Legends </h2><p>  This region has long been considered a mysterious place.  There are a lot of legends and traditions about Iremel.  For example, it is believed that the massif was especially revered by the Aryans.  According to the stories of old-timers, it was here that Zarathustra left a message to his descendants.  Meanwhile, many skeptics consider this statement a figment of someone's great imagination. </p><p>  There are also opinions that on Mount Iremel there are rejuvenating apples (although the local climate is not at all suitable for apples) and energy poles.  There are more fantastic versions about the fact that Olympus was not in Greece, but on Mount Iremel.  Such statements, of course, are completely meaningless. </p><p>  At the same time, we can confidently say that Mount Iremel (its photo is clearly demonstrated below) is sacred to the Bashkirs.  In antiquity, only the most respected people were allowed to climb to its peak.  Various pagan rituals and prayers were held there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Iremel photo" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/472566.jpg" width="306"></div>

According to one legend, noble and wealthy Bashkirs were buried right under the mountain near the shores of Tygyn Lake.  Rumor has it that bodies were brought here even from the most remote areas.  Dmitriev claims that he personally came across small, even mounds near the lake.  Despite the fact that burials were carried out in these places as far back as the Middle Ages, these graves have still not been razed to the ground. </p><p>  According to the stories of father Pyotr Nazarov (local father from Tyulyuk), Russian settlers also revered Mount Iremel.  If, for example, drought occurred, then people carried out a procession and asked Iremel for rain.  It is likely that the Russians adopted this tradition from local peoples. </p><h2>  Harassment protection </h2><p>  Mount Iremel (Bashkiria), according to one legend, also served as a place for the indigenous population to hide from the oppression of Russian breeders.  The locals took horses there, made bonfires on the top.  Some even believe that the ever-burning fire at the top led to the melting of permafrost in these places.  According to another interpretation, the Bashkirs hid on the top of the mountain not from the Russians, but from the invasion of the Mongols. </p><p>  According to unconfirmed reports, Alexander I climbed this mountain during a trip to the Southern Urals. A road was cut specially for him, which is called Alexandrovskaya.  However, whether the king was here, in fact, is not exactly known. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iremel mountain rest" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/472567.jpg" width="306"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The mountains of Iremel are still fraught with many unsolved mysteries.  One of the most popular is the story of the golden bears, who walked along mountain trails in the area and hid here their myriad reserves of gold and other precious stones.  In addition, there are many other legends about this region that will be difficult to tell in the framework of one article; it is difficult even to put them in one book. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  How beautiful Mount Iremel is!  We found out where this picturesque mountain range is located, now let's look at interesting places in this region.  Near the village of Tyulyuk in a small canyon are the remains of the mill.  This place is called the Larkin Gorge.  According to old-timers, several mills used to be along the banks of the river.  Near the gorge there is a mountain called Mill. </p><p>  To the north of the mountain are Tyuluk lakes-swamps.  On the east side there is the Tygyn Basin, where there are also many swamps.  Under the top of the Bolshoi Iremel mountain, there is a mountain plateau where <span>alpine meadows</span> abruptly turn into the tundra.  Here you can find many rare plants. </p><p>  At the very top of the mountain is a mountain tundra.  However, many note that not only Mount Iremel (whose photo can be seen below), but its surroundings is of great interest.  Around it you can see the endless taiga and enchanting rocks with its beauty.  This mountain range has recently become increasingly popular.  In this regard, Iremel Nature Park was organized here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount iremel how to get" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/472568.jpg" width="306"></div>

    <h2>  Mount Iremel: how to get there </h2><p>  To enjoy the beauty of this mysterious and enchanting mountain, you should go through the city of Yuryuzan and the village of Tyulyuk from <span>the M5 highway.</span>  Alternatively, you can get from Beloretsk, and then through the village of Nikolaevka.  For several decades, travelers are very attracted to Iremel (mountain).  Rest in these picturesque places can not be compared with anything.  From Ufa, only a few regular buses go on weekends; you can also order a taxi to the village.  However, the easiest way to get to these hard-to-reach spots is by private car or transport, which is provided by travel agencies.  You will have to get 250 km from Chelyabinsk here. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and entertainment </h2><p>  Tourists can stay here in small private hotels.  If you wish, you can order a horse or walking tour.  In winter, you are invited to take an exciting snowmobile ride.  However, the main goal of tourists, of course, is Mount Iremel itself.  Reviews about these places are extremely positive.  Getting to Big Iremel is very convenient; a very convenient mountain trail leads there.  It‚Äôs really worth it to climb to the top of the mountain, because it offers stunning views of the entire countryside.  In addition, you can also visit other parts of the massif, for example, the Small Iremel conservation zone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount iremel reviews" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/472569.jpg" width="306"></div>

    <h2>  Iremel is the best place for outdoor activities! </h2><p>  If you want a break from the bustle of the city, the Iremel Mountains are the perfect place.  In Tyulyuk (located 15 km from the mountain) there is no cellular communication and regular transport.  At the edge of the village there are several guest houses and shelters.  Accommodation is offered both by local residents and travel agencies. </p><p>  At the same time, we advise you to book accommodation in advance, since this place is very popular at any time: in winter, summer or even in the slushy off-season there are not always places.  In shelters, as a rule, rent rooms for 2, 3 or 4 people.  Although there are available and large rooms, which easily accommodate up to 10 guests.  It is also possible to rent a separate house or cottage.  If you really want extreme sports, then you can come here with a tent or rent it.  In addition to fascinating walks, you can take a good steam bath in a Russian bath with a fragrant fir broom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Iremel Bashkiria" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/472570.jpg" width="306"></div>
