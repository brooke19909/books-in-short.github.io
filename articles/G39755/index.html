There are many modern buildings and a dynamic pace of life.  Although there are cozy old streets where you can hide from the hustle and bustle.  And just such a combination is one of the highlights of the city. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  To trace the period when the city appeared is quite simple.  Already in the annals of the XIII century there are references to settlements in these places.  Then it was a small village, where there were no more than 150 houses. </p><p>  The development of the village is connected with its location, it was on the way from Li√®ge (France) to Holland. </p><p>  Centuries later, in the 19th century, the tobacco and textile industries flourished in the city.  And since Philips began here, an unprecedented take-off has followed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="footage.framepool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips company" class="if uuid-2545075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2545075.jpg"></div><h2>  Industry </h2><p>  According to local residents, Eindhoven in the Netherlands did not stop at Philips and decided to bypass all the cities of the country in the industrial revolution.  Today it is associated with three letters - DAF.  Indeed, it was here that after the Second World War they began to produce these cars, the most ultramodern and super-ergonomic today.  These are cars that regularly participated in <span>the Paris-Dakar rally</span> and repeatedly won. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Other world-famous companies work in the city: ASML, Atos Origin, NXP and others.  Naturally, such world giants attracted a huge number of specialists in various fields of science and technology to the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.euro-t-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DAF cars" class="if uuid-2545080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2545080.jpg"></div><h2>  Education </h2><p>  Now in the city of Eindhoven in the Netherlands is one of the best technical universities.  More than 7.5 thousand students, 250 professors and 600 graduate students study here. </p><p>  The university has many faculties: </p><ul><li>  applied Physics; </li><li>  civil Engineering; </li><li>  biomedicine; </li><li>  electrical engineering; </li><li>  industrial design and others. </li></ul><p>  On the basis of the educational institution there are continuing education courses in a number of specialties, where you can get a doctorate. </p><p>  The university was founded in 1956, and in 2003 took third place in the ranking of the best European higher education institutions. </p><p>  There is also a research center at the institution, with which most famous industrial companies collaborate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.neverpaintagain.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Technical University" class="if uuid-2545098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2545098.jpg"></div><h2>  Sport </h2><p>  Eindhoven in the Netherlands became famous due to the PSV football club.  Initially, it was an ordinary sports society under the Philips company, whose members were outdoor enthusiasts.  Over time, professional athletes began to appear in the team, up to Ronaldo and Romario.  Now it is a world famous football team. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.theherald.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Football team" class="if uuid-2545090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2545090.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Eindhoven in the Netherlands was badly damaged in the Second World War by bombing, some old buildings are still preserved here. </p><p>  The city boasts only one truly ancient church - Oude Thoren or the Stara Tower.  However, only the tower remained from the building.  It was erected approximately in the XIV-XV century. </p><p>  There are also three churches in the city dating back to the end of the 19th century: Sint-Katerinakerk, Paterskerk and Sint-Yoriskerk. </p><p>  Here is the most famous Van Abbe Museum in Europe, founded in 1936.  This is a collection of drawings, paintings and sculptures, videos and photographs, installations, different directions.  In 2003, the collection moved to a new ultramodern building, crowned by a 27 meter high tower. </p><p>  The city has an interesting building and a kind of symbol - Evolution.  This structure is in the form of a plate, with a diameter of 77 meters, on 12 legs.  Once this building was built by the Philips company (1966) and organized a museum in it, but because of great competition it was closed and now a conference room is organized here. </p><p>  Another noteworthy place is the Light Tower or Lichttoren.  On the top floors of the building, Philips checked his light bulbs.  In those days, the light was on there around the clock, for this reason the building has such a name.  The tower was built in 1931, today it houses the library and the Academy of Design. </p><p>  It is in the city of Eindhoven in the Netherlands that you can see the world's first ring road for cyclists.  The track was opened in 2011, and the local population calls it the Hoven Ring. </p><p>  Vestedatoron is a 90-meter-high tower on the corner of two Smalle Haven and Westjik streets.  It is interesting not only because it is very tall, but also because of its shape - it very much resembles the Iron in New York. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Westedatoron - Tower" class="if uuid-2545072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2545072.jpg"></div><h2>  What should a tourist do when arriving in a city? </h2><p>  First of all, you should visit the nanosupermarket located in the bus.  Here you can see the latest developments of young designers. </p><p>  Arriving in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, be sure to go for a ride on an ultra-fast bus.  It is made of plastic and aluminum and looks very similar to a train car.
