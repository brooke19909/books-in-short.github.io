How to take a screenshot on Android?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since each of us uses a tablet or smartphone every day, there may be situations when we need to share the image on the screen with our friends or other people.  For example, you saw an interesting moment in the film, found a cool quote in the book, and for this reason you wanted to share them with a friend.  Of course, you have a question: "How to take a screenshot on the phone?" </p><p>  For those who do not know the terminology at a sufficient level, we make an explanation: a screenshot (from the English screen shot) is a screenshot, or rather, what is happening on it.  A screenshot is a great tool to demonstrate what your phone or tablet is currently displaying.  In addition, the resulting photo can not only be sent to anyone you need, but also edited in accordance with your expectations. </p>

    <h2>  <span>How to take a screenshot on Android</span> ? </h2><p>  In fact, most devices running under a particular operating system (even though this part of the article is devoted specifically to Android) have a similar mechanism for taking screenshots.  It consists in the fact that at the same time you need to hold two buttons.  Since the capture of the screen cannot be carried out directly using the commands on the device display, it is obvious that the physical keys need to be clamped.  It's about ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúPower.‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúPower‚Äù? </h2><p>  Of course, when you see information in the instructions that you need to hold down two keys to carry out the operation, you will ask yourself: "What are these buttons?" </p>

    <p>  The answer to them is very simple.  The first one - ‚ÄúHome‚Äù - is located in the center of the bottom of the display.  In the event that you are wondering: "How to take a screenshot on the phone?", You must know this.  The ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button is used to return to the main screen of the device (whether it is a phone or tablet);  with it, you can, in the event of a gadget freezing, quickly go to the start screen.  It must be clamped to create a picture. </p><p>  Of course, simply pressing this key alone will not do anything.  Most likely, you will run some kind of background application or go to the phone <span>task manager</span> .  If you ask: ‚ÄúHow to take a screenshot on the phone?‚Äù, We need to find the second button.  This is Power. </p><p>  Find the specified key is very simple - this is the button with which you unlock the screen of your device and, accordingly, lock it if necessary.  With the Power button, you can also turn off the tablet by simply holding it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In the same case, if you simultaneously press both keys, a screenshot will be taken.  This scheme is classic for Android, however, it does not work on all devices.  On some, other buttons should be clamped, about which later in the article. </p><h2>  How do I know that a screenshot was taken? </h2><p>  In fact, each device has its own effects, by which it will be possible to determine that a picture was taken.  For example, this is the appearance of a frame at the edges of the display, which will then decrease and ‚Äúslip‚Äù into the gallery of your device.  Also, such effects can be a glow that appears and gradually fades away, heading, again, to the gallery icon area, and so on. </p><p>  The main thing is that before you take a screenshot on the phone, you will see that your device will give a corresponding sign, which you will understand in any case. </p><h2>  Where is the screenshot saved? </h2>

    <p>  After the picture is taken, it is saved, of course, in the device‚Äôs gallery.  However, it should be noted that it is not sent to a regular folder, but to a special folder called ScreenCaptures.  It is there in the future that you can search for your screenshots in order to send and edit them as you need. </p><h2>  Screenshot on HTC, Fly and other models </h2><p>  In addition to the scheme with the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúPower‚Äù clamps (like on an HTC phone), you can also take a screenshot of the screen using other key combinations. </p><p>  For example, this is the ‚ÄúSound Down‚Äù and ‚ÄúPower‚Äù buttons.  It works on the <span>Nexus 7</span> device <span>,</span> where there is no physical ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button located in the center of the bottom of the screen.  Simply put, to take a picture on this tablet, you need to hold down the volume control button ("Down") and the display lock key. </p><p>  In general, the following trend should be noted: if you don‚Äôt know how to take a screenshot of the screen on your Fly phone (or on any other model), carefully consider the functionality of your device.  As a rule, the combination of buttons is such as not to involve virtual (or programmatically created) buttons in this process, but to use exclusively physical keys.  And any smartphone or tablet doesn't have that many. </p><h2>  Screenshot Software </h2><p>  You can learn to take a picture at any time.  It will not take much time: the main thing is to catch how the button is pressed, in what order the keys are pressed.  The thing is that if you choose the order of pressing incorrectly, the device will recognize this command differently and go to the start page or lock the screen.  Here it is important to grasp which combination leads to the creation of the picture. </p>

    <p>  As for situations when you cannot get a screen for certain reasons (for example, one of the keys involved in the process doesn‚Äôt work for you), you will need an additional application.  There are a lot of them on Google Play: they all act as screenshot creators programmatically.  True, some of these applications may request root-rights on your phone or tablet, which, as a rule, are not on the device. </p><h2>  How to send a screenshot? </h2><p>  In the end, you know how to take a screenshot on your phone.  The only thing left is to do with it what we created it for.  This, as noted above, can be a simple sending of a picture to friends, editing it in a <span>graphics program</span> and other manipulations.  In principle, there are no restrictions on how to apply the image. </p><p>  In order to find the picture that turned out as a result, we know that we need to go to the ScreenCaptures folder.  Further, the same procedure applies to the image, which is applicable in all other cases with all your photos: you can, using the VKontakte application or mail, select this picture and attach it in the message;  and you can cut it and move it into your photos, if you like.  You can do whatever you want with a screenshot! </p><p>  Let's hope in this article to such a simple question: "How to take a screenshot on the phone?"  We have given a comprehensive answer that will help you in the future.  We hope you find this article helpful.  Good luck to you! </p>
