Reviews of motorists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, all without exception, car owners were faced with a situation when, when buying a car, an old radio tape recorder was installed in it (only CDs are read), not knowing about mp3 and other formats.  It would seem like a good radio and sounds good, but for full operation you need to constantly record and carry discs in the car, which quickly get bored after a while.  Naturally, this is far from a critical situation, but it requires certain investments.  For those who do not like music so much, enough radio, but for real music lovers, this is not at all an option.  Modern technologies make it possible to solve the problem of music in a car simply and inexpensively.  It is enough to purchase a car FM transmitter.  Which is better and how to choose them, consider. </p><h2>  What is an FM transmitter? </h2><p>  The device has another name - FM modulator.  This is an additional device necessary for reproducing <span>digital sound</span> , which are located on a flash drive using a receiver installed in the car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fm car transmitter which is better" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1954113.jpg" width="450"></div>  Car FM transmitters were widespread even 20 years ago, when the head unit was not yet equipped with modern diskless systems.  After installing this device, the receiver received an indispensable option - it became possible to reproduce digital sound.  This is much more convenient than using CDs.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modern transmitters have a smartphone connection function.  Thus, a car with a regular old radio that can not read digital files, without much cost, will significantly expand its capabilities in terms of sound reproduction. </p><h2>  Device and principle of operation </h2><p>  Usually car FM transmitters are made as a separate electronic device.  It has a connector that allows you to plug the device into the cigarette lighter socket.  So that the driver can more conveniently adjust the controls of the device, the unit is often fixed on movable hinges.  Most models are equipped with remote control. </p><p>  These devices use traditional USB drives or SD cards, depending on the model, as a storage medium.  Modern new transmitters are equipped with a function of communication with a smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car fm transmitter" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1954112.jpg" width="600"></div>  The digital transmitter reads files on a USB flash drive or phone - the device easily ‚Äúdigests‚Äù modern and outdated audio file formats.  Then the digital signal is converted into analog sound, which is fed to the FM frequency modulator.  This frequency does not coincide with the signals of radio stations - this is done specifically so that there is no overlap of waves.  The receiver, which is in any car, is tuned to the desired frequency, as a result of which music from the transmitter will be played.

Which is better?  It depends on the needs and cost.  There are budget options, products from the average price category and devices of the "above average" level.  Let's look at the main types of these devices. </p><h2>  Simple devices </h2><p>  Often, these devices have a low cost, a minimum number of controls, as well as a minimum set of functions.  They are needed to work in tandem with the same budget audio systems.  As for the sound quality, it is either average or below average. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fm car transmitter reviews" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1954116.jpg" width="600"></div>  These devices are capable of supporting small flash drives.  The disadvantage of such transmitters is the inability to read playlists completely.  To facilitate the operation of the device, it is advisable to copy the files to the root directory of the drive.  Such solutions do not have their own memory.

    <h2>  Average price category </h2><p>  Here, the transmitter already has a color display capable of displaying photos and other graphics, which will be recorded on a flash drive.  There is an expanded set of functions, the ability to read data that has a complex hierarchy, there is support for large storage media. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fm car transmitter which is better reviews" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1954111.jpg" width="500"></div>  There is a built-in memory, due to which the speed of the transmitter is higher.  The device reads all modern digital audio formats.

It is better to choose those devices where there is a remote control.  So the driver will not be distracted from the traffic situation on the go.  To help a potential buyer to purchase a suitable device, we consider various transmitters from different price categories.
