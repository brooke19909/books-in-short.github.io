Ronda and its attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the richest and most interesting countries in the world, of course, is Spain.  Ronda in its territory is one of the <span>most ancient cities,</span> which was erected in an incredibly picturesque place.  It is located on two mountain plateaus in Andalusia, which are interconnected by a bridge leading through a stormy river.  Most often, tourists and locals admire the view that opens from the bridge.  Here you can see the most picturesque valleys, and green mountain landscapes, and the waters of a clean river, which flows at the very bottom of the abyss, between two mountain hills.  In this region, a completely different, calm and mysterious Spain is opened for everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain ronda" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ronda is not a noisy city with a large number of bars, restaurants and discos.  Most often, lovers of peace and quiet come here, as well as travelers who pursue adventures and conquer various natural peaks.  Often near the city, tent camps are broken up, in which the campers stop, admiring the natural charms.  It is worth noting that this region has a hot climate, which is characterized by almost all of Spain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãronda spain" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275913.jpg" width="455"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ronda is considered one of the oldest cities in the country.  It was founded by the Celts who lived here in the 4th century BC.  After that, he fell into the possession of both <span>Roman emperors</span> and Arabs.  In the center of the city a castle was built, which became the symbol of this place.  The Arabs, who came here again, called him Izna-Rand-Onda, which became the name of this village.  Later, the village won back and Spain arranged in its own way.  Ronda today is divided into two parts - New and Old Town.  These two areas are located on the right and left banks of the mountain river Guadalevin and are interconnected by the Puente Nuevo bridge, which was built in the XVIII century.  It is worth noting that the Old Town was completely built in the XIII century, and the New one was born along with the bridge. </p>

    <p>  You can literally see all the attractions of Ronda in just one day, but in order to understand all their significance, it is important to properly prepare for the tour.  In the old part of the city there are a large number of historical monuments, among which there are a lot of Arab buildings.  For example, Alcabar fortress was preserved on these lands, as well as Arab baths, decorated exclusively in oriental style.  Of great value to the city is the church of Santa Maria de la Encarnaciene, which was built in the 15th century.  Then the influence of the Arabs here was far from the last political factor, so the cathedral absorbed all the traditions of the Arab architectural style, as well as Gothic and Romanism.  It is worth noting that the whole city of Ronda is full of such diversity and contrasts. </p><p>  Spain, as you know, is the birthplace of the famous bullfighting, and it was in this region that the first fights in the world took place.  Many arenas have been preserved here, among which the largest is Plazo De Toros.  Fights are still taking place on its square, and at a time when it is quiet here, you can get into the arena by sightseeing ticket. </p><p>  As you can see, Ronda is an amazing and, one might say, international place.  Spain, a map of which says that this city is only a hundred kilometers from Malaga, opens the veil of some of its secrets here.  Well, if you want to look at other attractions of this region, then rent a car and go on a trip to Andalusia.  There will be many surprises along the way! </p>
