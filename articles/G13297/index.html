There is pure white sand, a wide coastal strip, a gentle slope into the sea, and for those who like to snorkel, they have their own <span>coral reef.</span>  The beach is so popular among tourists that many come here daily from Patong (the main resort of the island).  And the price of 400 Thai baht per tuk-tuk one way does not scare anyone away.  The only drawback of the beach is that all hotels are across the highway.  But do not be upset: the safety of tourists is monitored by special hotel traffic controllers.  Hotels in Karon Beach cannot be called cheap.  It is believed that for such a beach near you need to pay.  But there are also <span>hotels</span> suitable for budget tourists who come to Thailand <span>.</span>  <span>Phuket</span> Orchid Resort is one of them.  Three stars adorn his signboard, but many tourists define it as a ‚Äúfour,‚Äù even a very decent one.  Let's look at this hotel in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Location  Karon Beach </h2><p>  The island of Phuket is visited by a diverse audience.  Young people and outdoor enthusiasts settle in the main resort - Patong.  This city is famous for its vibrant nightlife and cheap hostels.  But Patong beach is, unfortunately, no different.  Therefore, many tourists are selected on a rented scooter from the city.  Without exaggeration, Karon Beach is considered the best beach in Phuket.  Only Kata can compete with him.  The audience here is resting solid - families with children, wealthy pensioners from Western Europe.  Backpackers from the depraved Patong arrive at noon and depart with the sunset.  Karon Beach is located twenty-five kilometers south of the island‚Äôs main resort.  Karon Noi adjoins this beach, and further - Kata-Yai.  Phuket Orchid Resort on the map of Phuket is very well located - in the very center of the bay.  Tourists, if desired, can visit Patong with its Bangla Road bar street or exchange Karon's excellent beach infrastructure with the pristine nature and wildness of Kata Noi.  The hotel, like all other local hotels, is located on the "conditionally first line", that is, across the road from the sea. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand Hotels Phuket Orchid Resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1093139.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  <span>Phuket Orchid Resort 4 * (Phuket,</span> Karon) carried out the last reconstruction in 2013.  Now he can carry four stars with honor and add the word ‚ÄúSPA‚Äù to his name, since the hotel's range of services includes the use of water wellness treatments.  The territory of the hotel complex is large.  This is a real tropical garden where bougainvilleas bloom at every step.  The design of the territory is sustained in the aesthetics of Ayutthaya - the ancient <span>capital of Thailand.</span>  Bridges are thrown across three pools, and one of them is decorated with a large stone head of a Hindu deity.  The hotel complex consists of six four-story buildings.  The rooms overlook the mountains or the greenery of the garden.  Reviews of tourists recommend booking rooms in the fourth or sixth building.  As for the number of storeys, opinions were divided.  Many people like living on the first level, as these rooms have terraces rather than balconies.  But other reviews claim that the upper floors offer amazing views and less noise. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Like most hotels in Thailand and Phuket in particular, Orchids Resort Phuket only provides breakfast for its guests.  This does not mean that in order to have lunch and dinner, you need to leave the hotel.  It offers guests the restaurant "Le Bayonne" (which is served in the menu or in the format of the "buffet") and the pizzeria "Il Ponte".  Near one of the pools there is a bar with drinks and snacks.  At lunchtime, they serve plain hot dishes such as french fries and burgers.  As for breakfast, the hotel guests were satisfied.  In addition to the usual set (scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages, yoghurts, juice, sweet pastries, fruits), there are always meat and fish dishes and, which surprised many tourists from Europe, soup.  There is no shortage of cafes on Karon Beach.  Many tourists bought food from the macaques.  Reviews recommend this cheap and tasty type of fast food.  The dish is prepared with fresh products. </p>

    <h2>  Pools and beach </h2><p>  Phuket Orchid Resort in Karon is central.  All infrastructure on the beach is paid.  So reviews are advised to stock up on a rug and an umbrella.  But, however, finding the shadow on Karon is not difficult.  Exotic tamarind trees grow right on the beach.  They cast an openwork shadow in which it is good to relax from the burning Thai sun.  The sea, like the beach, is very clean.  But lovers of wildlife should walk about twenty minutes to the south - there a coral reef approaches close to the shore.  Pools at the hotel tourists praise.  There are always enough sunbeds and umbrellas.  The inhabitants of "Deluxe" did not feel the need to go to the sea at all - the pool splashed near their terrace. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  If you rent a scooter or car, you can put your iron horse in the free and secure parking lot at Orchids Resort Phuket.  ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù pulls well from the lounge, near the reception.  The name "SPA" on the hotel signboard fully justifies itself.  You need to visit a beauty salon to feel it.  Thai massage is done both in the spa and on the beach.  There is also a gift shop on site.  You can always exercise for free in the gym.  At the reception, English-speaking staff will be able to order a taxi for you or pick up an interesting tour.  Towels are changed in the rooms every day, and bed linen is changed several times a week.  There is no animation at the hotel, but it is not required - there are so many interesting things around. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Orchids Resort Phuket is positioning itself as a family vacation destination.  Therefore, much attention is paid to young guests.  They have a children's pool with several water slides and a playground.  Upon request, a baby cot will be provided in your room.  And if parents want to devote time to shopping, a long excursion or go to a restaurant in the evening, you can hire a nanny at the hotel.  For breakfast, the hotel serves dishes that are quite suitable for a children's tender stomach.  There are always salads, fruits, pastries, yogurts, sausages, fresh milk.  One of the satellite channels on TV shows Russian-language cartoons, which the children really like. </p><h2>  Phuket Orchid Resort 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists praise the hotel.  Many liked the spacious rooms.  Some reviews describe designer cosmetics that are replenished every day.  In addition to the usual shampoo, soap and shower gel, they also give body lotion.  They clean the rooms very carefully, so no unwanted animals were found in the rooms.  There are also no mosquitoes - you can not take special tools with you.  Tourists praise the location of the hotel.  Nearby are many cafes and a grocery store "Seven-Elevan."  The staff at the reception is very friendly and tries to fulfill every request.  The audience at the hotel is decent, mostly citizens from Western Europe. </p>
