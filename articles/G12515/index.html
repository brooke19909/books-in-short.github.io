  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Volumetric LED shapes: manufacturing instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the stages of preparation for the New Year is home decoration inside and out.  This helps create a special, festive atmosphere.  The implementation of ideas and the creation of LED figures will provide an opportunity to spend more time with the family together, chat and enjoy the results of their work.  Thanks to this, people of different ages are immersed in a fairy tale, and adults begin to dream like children. </p><h2>  Volumetric street decorations </h2><p>  Now LED street figures are installed not only in the streets and squares, many families decorate the house territory with them.  Installations can take the form of animals, fairy-tale characters or geometric shapes.  In fantasy, you should not limit yourself.  However, such products have a unifying feature - all of them must necessarily be voluminous. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.christmaslightsetc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED deer" class="if uuid-3038094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43246/3038094.jpg"></div><p>  Previously, LED decorations for the <span>New Year</span> could be purchased in specialized stores.  But the availability of the necessary materials makes it possible to make them yourself, without unnecessary costs, and the saved money can be spent on gifts to relatives, friends and relatives. </p><p>  The limitlessness of ideas allows you to recreate the most incredible installations.  If the yard is large and there is a lot of free time, then you can make Santa Claus on a sleigh, arrange a few bears and a snowman.  Although such jewelry came to us from the West, now they are very in demand, so you should understand the process of their creation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Use and range of volumetric figures </h2><p>  It should be noted that LED figures are used to a greater extent for decorating trading floors or entertainment centers.  The explanation is very simple: you can create a festive atmosphere in such an original way, attract more visitors with the bright and bewitching sparkle of garlands, advertise the products offered for purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wyzworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Used LED strip" class="if uuid-3038095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43246/3038095.jpg"></div><p>  And here a logical question arises: "If you can buy LED figures, then why waste time on their implementation?".  The answer is quite commonplace - stores do not always offer jewelry suitable in size and quality.  Often the price tag is overpriced, and the choice of color glow options is scarce.  All this limits the consumer and does not allow to fully enjoy the festive atmosphere. </p><h2>  Volumetric LED Deer </h2><p>  He, like any other figure, consists of two main elements.  First of all, it‚Äôs a frame.  Often it is made of metal.  It should be easy to bend, but at the same time be resistant to mechanical stress and keep its shape perfectly.  The second element is an LED (luminous) tape. </p><p>  Correctly will call her "duralight."  In appearance it resembles a cord, inside of which, light bulbs (diodes) are equally spaced.  In order for the backlight to be uniform, the element must be placed throughout the frame.  As a result, you can create a not just beautiful, but also high-quality, as well as safe product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Essential Accessories </h2><p>  Regardless of how the product is planned to be made (animal, fairy-tale character), you need to have at hand the basic accessories so that the work is a joy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wwwlxbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Horse Carriage" class="if uuid-3040148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43246/3040148.jpg"></div><p>  For any LED figure you will need: </p><ul><li>  plywood; </li><li>  copper wire; </li><li>  plastic pipes; </li><li>  fasteners (to fix the tape, you can use plastic ties in the form of a clamp); </li><li>  acrylic (additional decoration of the figure, creating an imitation of ice); </li><li>  LED strip (duralight white or blue). </li></ul><p>  You can use the lighting element in any color scheme.  It is necessary to build on what decoration is planned to be made.  When everything you need is prepared, you can start making LED figures for the New Year. </p><h2>  Step-by-step manufacturing instructions </h2><p>  The figure begins to be created by completing the preliminary sketch.  If there is no ability to draw, then you can use a ready-made template.  It is important to evaluate the complexity of the design: in the absence of experience in such work, it is better to give preference to simple forms. </p><p>  The next step will be the manufacture of patterns.  Here you already need pre-prepared plywood.  In the place where the bend is planned according to the sketch, a small nail is driven in.  This will be part of the three-dimensional figure.  First, the work is done on a copper wire, and then an LED strip will be attached to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mygatlinburg.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED deer" class="if uuid-3040145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43246/3040145.jpg"></div><p>  For the pattern, metal or acrylic transparent pipes can be used.  When the frame is ready, duralight is applied to it.  To keep the form, screed clamps are used.  It is very important to carefully fix the tape along the entire length of the product.  After completing work on the structure, you can connect it to a power source and enjoy the result: the LED deer is ready. </p><p>  Another nuance: duralight is connected through a special converter (power supply), since it is itself low-voltage.  If it is powered directly to the 220 V network, then all the lamps will burn out due to the high load. </p><p>  Making a voluminous street figure yourself is very simple.  This will help to have fun with the family, as well as save on the purchase of jewelry for the local area. </p>
