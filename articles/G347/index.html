World-famous historical monuments keep many secrets, and scientists around the world unsuccessfully fight over the mysteries of erecting giant pyramids.  Ancient Egypt is in no hurry to share secrets, but we can tell you about the exact facts of the rule of the kings. </p><h2>  A few facts about the pharaohs </h2><p>  For several millennia, the state was ruled by the pharaohs - the viceroys of God on earth, who, according to popular beliefs, had magical powers.  They regulated all spheres of Egyptian life, and the high priests considered themselves their servants, although some kings became puppets in their hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the kings of egypt" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1298658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Residents believed that the sunrise and the ripening of the crop depend on the ruler.  And if terrible epidemics occurred among animals and people, wars began, then this meant the discontent of the gods with their governor. </p><p>  The kings of Egypt did not have the right to mix their blood with human blood, so they first married their sisters, and only then entered into marriage with ordinary women.  But the throne was inherited only by a child born from a relative. </p><p>  Women in whom divine blood flowed had great power and even ruled Egypt until their sons reached maturity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who was the founder of the first dynasty of the pharaohs? </h2><p>  Scientists do not know exactly when the Egyptian state was born, but after research it was found that about three thousand years ago it already existed. </p><p>  The founder of the first dynasty is King Ming.  He built a fortress, which later became the capital and the royal residence.  From Memphis, the pharaoh ruled a united Egypt, and his personality causes a lot of controversy among scientists.  Many experts believe that Ming is the designation of the first three pharaohs of the pre-dynastic period, and all disputes are associated with the lack of written sources. </p><h2>  Early kingdom </h2><p>  The next era, about which not much is known, is the Early <span>Kingdom.</span>  <span>The kings of</span> Egypt of the first and second dynasties (Khor Aha, Haseham), rigidly suppressing all the uprisings, united the country into a <span>centralized state.</span> </p><p>  During this period, the production of papyrus begins, and the widespread use of writing has an impact on the culture of other eras.  Egypt is becoming a country with highly developed agriculture. </p><h2>  Ancient kingdom </h2><p>  <span>The ancient kingdom is</span> characterized by constant wars.  The kings of Egypt of the third and eighth dynasties (Snofru, Joser) conquer the lands of northern Nubia and seize the copper mines on the <span>Sinai Peninsula.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pharaohs of ancient egypt table" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1298674.jpg" width="257"></div>

    <p>  At the beginning of the XI century <span>BC</span> , two kingdoms were formed: Lower Egypt, which falls into separate regions, and Upper, with the capital in Thebes.  The Nubian rulers are waging bloody wars, dreaming of taking over the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The state was liberated from invaders by the founder of the Sais dynasty, Psammetich I. </p><h2>  Liberation from the Persians and the end of the reign of the Egyptian kings </h2><p>  Persian rule stands out in a separate period.  The alien king Cambyses is proclaimed pharaoh of the XXVII dynasty. </p><p>  And in 332 BC, the conquest of Egypt by A. the Great, who liberated the country from the Persians, took place.  The era of Hellenism is approaching, and the reign of the pharaohs is forever leaving. </p><h2>  Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt: table </h2><p>  The exact dating of the rule of kings still causes debate among scholars.

    <p>  It was believed that the kings of Egypt and after his death rule in the afterlife, so ritual rites were very important.  The pharaohs during their life thought of an eternal dwelling, and pyramids were erected on the Giza plateau, becoming the burial place of the governors of the gods. </p><h2>  Sacred place </h2><p>  The famous Valley of the Kings in Egypt, located opposite the city of Thebes (Luxor), is a unique place where the pharaohs rest.  Until now, it has attracted researchers involved in the history of ancient civilization.  Thirty-seven years ago, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kings of egypt" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1298652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The sacred valley was carefully guarded to prevent the looting of graves, however, with the weakening of the power of the pharaohs, robbers and travelers appeared who caused irreparable harm to the sarcophagi. </p><p>  Napoleon‚Äôs expedition, which arrived to conquer Egypt, was the first group to map the tombs.  After the publication of works devoted to Thebes burials, scientific journeys of famous archaeologists begin, which have made many important discoveries. </p><h2>  The confusion with the tombs </h2><p>  The first buried in the Valley of the Kings was Thutmose I, and the main problem is that no one knows in which particular tomb he was laid to rest.  Such confusion exists with other tombs, although Egyptologists are sure that all Egyptian kings had personal burial chambers built specifically for them. </p><p>  In 1827, the famous scientist D. G. Wilkinson introduced into the scientific circulation the mandatory numbering of tombs, beginning with the prefix KV.  Service mines were assigned only Latin letters.  For example, the famous tomb of Tutankhamun is assigned the number KV 62. </p><p>  Researchers know 64 tombs, and the latter is still poorly understood. </p><h2>  Fear of looting graves </h2><p>  Until the 15th century BC, the pharaohs were buried according to special rites in the pyramids built during their lifetime.  The rulers controlled the work and took care not only of the burial place, but also of household items that would be with them in the funeral world, because even in the kingdom of Osiris, the governors of God should lead a familiar lifestyle.  That is what ancient history says. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valley of the Kings in Egypt" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1298659.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  The kings of Egypt rested in sarcophagi, studded with jewelry.  The tombs in the pyramids on the Giza plateau were looted, and the mummies were desecrated or reburied by religious fanatics.  Fearing abuse, Thutmose I made changes to established traditions.  He commanded to bury himself in a secluded and secret place, which became a deep well in the valley. </p><h2>  Robber disguise </h2><p>  All subsequent tombs were cut down in the rocks, the entrances were masked by stones, and various traps for robbers were arranged along the way.  Such a well rested against the burial chamber, where the pharaoh, king of Egypt, rested. </p><p>  Scientists have found that the City of the Dead in Thebes did not escape a sad fate, and the tombs in the valley began to plunder during the reign of the XX-XXI dynasty of the pharaohs.  Egypt's top officials sold gold jewelry from tombs, which were given to them by the builders of tombs who did not receive money for the work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pharaoh king of egypt" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1298653.jpg" width="600"></div>
