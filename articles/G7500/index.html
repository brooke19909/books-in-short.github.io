    <p>  Abu Dhabi International Airport is approximately 40 km from the hotel.  Direct flights regularly fly here from Moscow.  An average flight takes about 5 hours, but tickets for transfers with transfers are much cheaper.  There are no direct flights from St. Petersburg.  From the airport, the hotel can be reached by taxi or public transport.  In addition, a free shuttle bus runs for tourists, which stops at the bus station and many large hotels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Travelers also prefer to get to Dubai first, and only then to the capital.  The fact is that Abu Dhabi airport accepts significantly fewer flights, which means that the flight directly will be much more expensive.  From Dubai, the city can also be reached by bus, taxi or pre-ordered paid transfer. </p><h2>  General information, registration and check-in rules </h2><p>  The resort complex Le Meridien Abu Dhabi Hotel 4 * was built in 1978, but do not be afraid that the rooms here look dilapidated.
