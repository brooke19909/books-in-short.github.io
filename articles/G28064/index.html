    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Thinking about what Georgia is good or bad in November, it is worth remembering its location on the world map.  The country is located in the very center and in the west of Transcaucasia.  The state stretched from the Black Sea to the peaks of the Caucasus Mountains.  <span>The area of ​​Georgia</span> is slightly less than 70 thousand square meters.  km, the coastline is 308 km.  Geographical location leads to a wide variety of terrain.  From the plateau and low-lying shores of the Black Sea, the territory passes into a hilly area, and then gives way to a mid-mountain and high-mountainous terrain.  This affects a wide variety of flora and fauna in the country, where, despite the relatively small size, you can see representatives of various natural zones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in georgia in november" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1474278.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to its characteristics, it is close to subtropical and Mediterranean.  In the upper reaches of the mountains there is a sharp alpine climate.  All the same mountain ranges are the reason that in Georgia there is less rainfall per year than in other countries of the region - an average of about 2000 mm.  But in the west there is less rain, and on the Batumi coast - more.  <span>The climate of Georgia is</span> characterized by long, warm summers and short mild winters.  Winter begins in December and lasts until February, only in mountainous areas does the season last until the end of March, when snow is falling.  The average temperature in the Tbilisi region is +7 degrees, in the mountains - about zero.  In the highlands in winter, some passes are often closed due to snow.  Spring in Georgia is stormy and warm; in March, gardens begin to bloom.  The average temperature at this time is +15 degrees.  This summer already begins in May, the most heat falls on July-August, when the thermometer on the coast stably holds above the +25 mark.  Autumn comes at the end of October and lasts 2 months.  Georgia in November is similar to Moscow in early October.  Of course, this applies to coastal and central areas.  In the mountains, autumn begins at the end of September, and already in November, snow begins to fall here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Georgia in November" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1474296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Organized tours to Georgia in November allow you to see the most important places in the country.  But this region is very convenient for independent trips.  In this case, you need to <span>make a route</span> to the main attractions, which include: </p><p>  1. Old Tbilisi.  Usually all trips start from the capital, and here you need to find time for a leisurely walk along the old streets and quarters, where the spirit of antiquity has been preserved, here you must definitely see the Abanotubani complex. </p><p>  2. New Tbilisi.  The uniqueness of the Georgian capital lies in the combination of the past and the future.  Modern architecture in the area of ​​the Ministry of Justice is striking in its futurism. </p><p>  3. <span>Jvari Monastery.</span>  This ancient building recalls the poem by M. Lermontov “Mtsyri”.  The building stands on top of a mountain and fits very effectively into a unique landscape. </p><p>  4. Cave monastery Vardzia.  The amazing place in which the monks used to live impresses with its grandeur and scope. </p><p>  Georgia has many ancient castles and cathedrals worthy of attention, including the ancient city of Mtskheta, which is almost 2000 years old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to georgia in november" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/1474281.jpg" width="600"></div>
