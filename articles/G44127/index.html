  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find out control information on a Sberbank card: instructions, alternative methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank customers who use bank cards at least once in their life called support.  In addition to information about the account holder, payment users are required to provide code information for identification.  If the client has forgotten what he indicated in the application when opening the credit card account, he should clarify how to find out the control information on the Sberbank card. </p><h2>  What is a codeword? </h2><p>  In addition to customer data, the application contains the control information when opening a debit or credit card.  It can be one or several words, as well as a combination of numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://realnoevremya.com/articles/1677-sberbanks-atm-failure-ddos-attack-or-problems-in-processing-centre"><img itemprop="image" alt="in the terminal" class="if uuid-2921028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921028.jpg"></div><p>  The control information is indicated during the processing of each client‚Äôs card and is the same for all accounts.  If the client does not remember what he previously wrote in the document, he must find a copy of the application.  This is the easiest way to find out the control information on the Sberbank card. </p><h2>  Is it possible to change the code word? </h2><p>  Since the code word is indicated when registering a new bank card, the client can change it by issuing another product for himself.  The previously indicated word in this case will be invalid, and the new control information will act on all accounts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the client can always change the code word in any branch of Sberbank.  To perform the operation, he must take a passport with him. </p><p>  If the office is equipped with an electronic queue, you must select the "Help" coupon and wait for the invitation to the specified window.  After calling the coupon, the card user must explain to the operator the purpose of the visit and provide documents for identification.  The presence of a plastic card to replace the control information is optional. </p><p>  Replacing a word in a bank office is one of the ways to find out the digital control information of a Sberbank card.  After completing the service, the client receives a copy of the document with a new combination.  The binding of a new word occurs within 24 hours from the moment of creating the request. </p><p>  The cardholder can change data an unlimited number of times.  The operation is free.  It is available at the territorial bank at the place of registration of the plastic card. </p><h2>  Data Search through Support </h2><p>  Many bank card users are sure that one of the ways to find out the control information on the Sberbank card is to call the Bank‚Äôs Contact Center.  But the specialists of the Support Service do not have access to the customer data specified in the application.  This is considered confidential information along with the PIN code of the card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.rt.com/business/russia-mail-sberbank-cooperation/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2921018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921018.jpg"></div><p>  If the client contacts 900 to find out his code word, the operators will offer him to change data in any Sberbank branch or use a one-time code from the terminal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Replacing a code word when calling the Contact Center </h2><p>  An alternative to the method of finding control information on a Sberbank card is to obtain a customer code in a bank terminal.  The customer code is a one-time password required to call the Sberbank Support Service.  It is required if the cardholder has forgotten or lost control information on the card. </p><p>  To receive the customer code, the customer must have any bank card with him.  The code is issued in any terminal of the bank in the form of a check.  This is a safe and fast way to authenticate the client, as reuse of the code (even by the same client) is not possible. </p><h2>  Can scammers recognize the client‚Äôs code word? </h2><p>  When issuing a bank card, Sberbank customers must understand that the security of their means of payment depends on the complexity of the control information.  Fraudsters know several ways how to find control information on a Sberbank card from scattered users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out control information on a sberbank card" class="if uuid-2921012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921012.jpg"></div><p>  The most reliable protection option is a well-thought-out combination that does not reveal publicly available information about the card holder.  It can be a pet‚Äôs nickname with a character set or the name of a favorite musical group along with the relative‚Äôs birth date.  It is almost impossible to pick up or guess such a combination, which significantly increases the security of using a bank card. </p>
