It was he who was named after the company that specializes in the manufacture of navigators, tablets and many other types of digital technology.  Now the place of honor is the legendary Tesla tablet, which immediately attracted the attention of hundreds of people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tesla tablet Impulse 7.0" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39453/1118153.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Usually, before using the device itself, the buyer pays attention to the packaging.  The manufacturer did not fail with an interesting design, according to which at first you might think that the usual board game is hidden inside.  The box itself has a rectangular shape and durable manufacturing material. </p><p>  Perfectly matched dark blue color and <span>ball lightning</span> with a logo make a considerable impression on the buyer.  Also on the box there is a lot of detailed information that the user will definitely need. </p><p>  The inside is exceptionally white; this is where the device with the <span>power adapter</span> and USB cables is located.  Inside there is a separation into two parts: in one is the Tesla tablet itself, and next to it there is another small box with a standard delivery set. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tesla tablet 8.0" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39453/1118152.jpg" width="600"></div>

The basis, of course, was taken by the Apple iPad, but this is only a general concept. </p><p>  The first feature is the location of the camera, which all customers notice immediately.  Based on the logo on the back cover, we can confidently say that the <span>front camera</span> is located below.  This is not at all a marriage of any single tablet, they all stand out with such a peculiar ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù. </p><p>  Each tablet has a frame of a certain width, as well as connectors and a single button.  On the side is a plastic insert.  One cannot fail to notice, of course, the large logo on the cover.  In the corner on the back there is an additional camera, as well as a microphone and a main speaker. </p><h2>  Firmware and software </h2><p>  The Tesla tablet operates on the basis of Android, and the firmware does not contain any revisions or innovative amendments.  The language, of course, is present in Russian, as most users may actually have problems translating to set additional settings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tesla tablet Impulse" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39453/1118154.jpg" width="475"></div>
