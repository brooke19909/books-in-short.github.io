The graphic key is one of the ways to lock the device on the Android operating system.  This type of password is liked by most tablet users.  However, all the differences, pros and cons of these types of passwords can be completely unimportant if you forget this combination.  It turns out that you have a <span>locked screen</span> with nine dots or a password string that prevents you from using the tablet if it is not unlocked.  A quite natural question arises: "How to unlock a password on a tablet?" </p>

    <h2>  The first way.  Google account </h2><p>  We will start with the fact that there are several different ways to unlock and remove a forgotten key from a tablet.  The very first and, as usual, the most useless is to try to remember what symbols, numbers or letters you set as your key.  It is useless for one simple reason: if you forget, then you don‚Äôt remember, most likely.  In addition, by and large, it‚Äôs almost impossible to remember him, since he is very rarely associated with any of your associations.  How to unlock the Android tablet, if you can‚Äôt remember the password?  To prevent this from happening, use significant dates, last names or first names of close people or phone numbers as a symbolic password.  With a graphic key, everything is much more complicated - you drew something and immediately forgot what it was.  In general, it is better to write down all passwords.  More reliable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock explay tablet" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/386329.jpg?1398948119306" width="225"></div>

Indeed, there is another way that will help to unlock a graphic or symbolic password that you forgot.  The number of attempts to remember the key is limited and ranges from 5 to 10 entries (the number depends on the OS of the device).  What happens when input attempts end?  It's okay, your device will just ask you to log in to your Google account.  You just need to log in to your account and your tablet will be unlocked.  If you actively use this e-mail or at least ‚Äúattach it to your mobile phone‚Äù, then there will be no problems with the code recovery (the password from the system will be sent in the form of an SMS message).  Thus, your password on the tablet will be canceled, i.e. reset. </p><p>  However, there are times when you learn about the existence of this type of mail only when this situation occurs.  For such a force majeure, a ready-made mail address was invented, but they did not provide such an important thing as specifying a username and password at least in the instructions.  All this is fraught with the fact that you have to use other methods.  There are several other options <span>for password recovery,</span> they are divided into 2 types: with loss of information and without loss.  You must clearly decide for yourself whether the files, games, documents, programs stored on the tablet are important to you, or whether it can all be easily restored, or if there are backups.  Consider them carefully. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock samsung tablet" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/386330.jpg?1398948166139" width="565"></div>

It will be much easier if the information you have saved on some other device, and its loss will not upset you.  And most importantly, this method will not do any harm to the "machine" itself.  You simply transfer all user (personalized by you) settings to the factory settings (i.e. those that were before the tablet was purchased).  This procedure is called hardreset.  To use this method, it is enough to simultaneously press a special key combination.  They are different for each device - it is better to look in the instructions that came with your tablet computer.  The general action may be as follows: hold down the volume up / down keys and the on / back button, or the so-called ‚Äúhouse‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock a password on a tablet" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/386332.jpg?1398948188227" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  If information is crucial and losing it will be a disaster </h2><p>  This method may not be safe for your device.  This type of password reset will invalidate your tablet.  Why?  Because it will be necessary to install ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù software on your device (it is also called custom software, that is, it does not belong to this device or the manufacturer‚Äôs company), and you do not always know what is being done and how.  Unlocking the tablet will help the firmware.  You can reflash your tablet both at home, so to speak, on your own, and by contacting a specialist.  If you perform this operation incorrectly, then you risk staying with a completely inactive tablet. </p><h2>  But what about the guarantee? </h2><p>  For example, you are interested in the question of how to unlock the <span>Samsung tablet?</span>  He has not yet expired the warranty period.  Unfortunately, it is possible that resetting the password is not part of the terms of the warranty agreement.  In this case, the owner, who is the buyer of the tablet computer, is guilty of such a ‚Äúmalfunction‚Äù of the device, and the service center will be happy to offer you paid key unlocking services.  However, do not despair, because there are official programs (utilities) that will help you <span>flush the tablet</span> without compromising the warranty <span>.</span>  Information will be lost, but when using such software, your device is less prone to "death".  You can learn more about how to do this work yourself on the official website of the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock android tablet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/386331.jpg?1398948207803" width="417"></div>
