In fact, in addition to the west of the far north-east, all its borders pass through the water areas.  This is the Bay of Biscay of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.  To understand their many coasts, the Spaniards came up with names for them.  Along the Bay of Biscay stretches Verde - a green beach.  But tourists who want to warm their bones to swim in calm and warm water are attracted more by the beaches of the Mediterranean.  There are a lot of coasts from the Pyrenees to the Strait of Gibraltar.  In southern Spain, Blanca and Azahar (White and Sugar shores) are famous.  But Catalan resorts are considered more budgetary.  They are called Maresme, Costa Brava and Costa Dorada.  We will try to compare them with each other in this article.  Many tourists do not know which of the three Catalan coasts to choose.  And others think that it does not matter - after all, in Spain everything is good.  Meanwhile, these coasts are very different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava and Costa Dorada compare" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2059289.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Spain: <span>Costa Brava, Costa Dorada</span> on the map </h2><p>  In the south of the Pyrenees, near the Mediterranean Sea, there is a large autonomous province - Catalonia.  Perhaps it will soon become an independent republic, who knows?  But now we are interested in the coast of Catalonia.  There are only three of them.  In the middle, around the capital of the region, the beautiful city of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãlies the Sea Coast (Maresme).  North of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãit stretches to the resort of Blanes.  By the way, a railroad along the coast was laid before this city.  Further north, the cliffs begin - the spurs of the Pyrenees.  Therefore, along the Coast of the Brave, or, as they call it otherwise, the Brave Rocks, namely between resorts, only buses run.  Maresme extends to the south of Barcelona.  The coast ends in the village of Kunit.  South of it, to the very border of Catalonia with Valencia, Dorada stretches.  This name translates as the Golden Coast.  In Costa Brava, the main city is Girona, and the most popular resort is Blanes.  The capital of the Gold Coast is Tarragona.  And the main resort is Salou. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava or Costa Dorada which is better" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2059291.jpg"></div>

Indeed, many people interpret rest differently.  Give spacious sandy beaches to one, cliffs and secluded coves to the other.  Someone loves peace and quiet, while others love the fun and drive of youth resorts.  Do not drop the scales in the dilemma ‚ÄúCosta Brava or Costa Dorada: which is better?‚Äù  and climatic indicators.  This is especially true if you are going to Catalonia at the beginning or at the end of the tourist season.  A good vacation is unthinkable without a rich excursion program.  Where are more attractions - on the Brave Coast or Dorada?  If you are going on vacation with children, you are interested in the safety of their bathing.  And finally, the question of the price of all pleasure also remains important.  Therefore, we will compare both coasts for different parameters.  And you decide where to go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gdk is better than costa brava or costa dorada" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2059293.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  For lovers of beauty, the question of which is better - Costa Brava or Costa Dorada is not worth it.  Of course, the wild and rocky Coast of the Brave, in its magnificent scenery, completely overshadows its southern rival.  The relief of the Costa Brava is predominantly hilly.  Rocks and cliffs break into the sea.  They are covered with beautiful pine forests.  The relief of the Costa Dorada is flat.  It is drier and less green.  On the other hand, lovers of wandering around the edge of the sea for kilometers will be more suitable for the Golden Coast.  In Costa Brava, you have to climb up, then to descend into the "Cala" - the bay.  But the landscapes on this coast and ask for the canvas of the artist.  At the top of the coastal cliffs towers (or their ruins) rise.  And this adds to the beauties of nature an additional charm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  If you want to get to the resort, where it is guaranteed to be hot and the whole vacation will pass without precipitation, look at the map of Catalonia.  So much better - in Costa Brava or Costa Dorada?  The very geographical location of the first coast suggests that the climate there is cooler.  It will appeal to those who do not tolerate heat.  Even in the summer months, a fresh breeze blows there.  The deep sea warms up only by June.  And the season ends at the end of September.  Costa Daurada in the matter of climate puts into the belt of its northern competitor.  This is the warmest coast of Catalonia.  Mountains barely visible in the distance, but reliably protect the resorts of the Costa Dorada from the cold winds.  You can sunbathe and swim fully from late March to early November.  But in the summer months it is very hot there.  The feeling of heat intensifies the complete absence of wind.  Young children and people suffering from cardiovascular diseases will be uncomfortable in the summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Much better than Costa Brava or Costa Dorada" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2059295.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Costa Dorada is therefore called the Golden Coast, because mica is found in its sand.  You kick your foot along the bottom, and sparkles rise in the water.  Just like golden scales!  On the issue of beach holidays, it‚Äôs also difficult to please everyone, and it‚Äôs impossible to say for sure which is better - Costa Brava or Costa Dorada.  You can‚Äôt definitely jump into the water from the rocks on the Golden Coast.  Diving there is not too interesting.  In the sea without waves, surfing becomes meaningless.  For all this you need to go to the Costa Brava.  But on the Golden Coast a smooth entry into the sea.  No stones, cliffs and other troubles.  The sand is small, golden, as if created by nature specifically for casting castles.  Costa Dorada is an ideal place to relax with children.  Yes, and bad swimmers will also like it there.  Costa Brava requires courage.  The sea there is often worried.  On the other hand, you can always find the bay, rotated so that it will be completely calm when there is a storm on other beaches.  The sand on the Costa Brava is large, actually ground pebbles.  Something will not work out of him.  But this sand does not stick to the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava or Costa Dorada" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2059339.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  Whether you go to Costa Brava or Costa Dorada, your vacation will be very eventful.  There are enough interesting places on both coasts.  But a trip to Catalonia and not visit Barcelona is an unforgivable mistake.  Only here it is best to get to the capital from the Costa Brava.  Especially if you live near Blanes, in resorts such as Lloret del Mar or Tossa.  Buses run to Blanes very often, and from there an electric train will take you to Barcelona in less than an hour (and 6.15 euros).  From the Costa Daurada to get to the capital will be, if not more difficult, then definitely longer and more expensive.  A one-way trip takes two hours.  But on the side of holidaymakers on the Costa Dorda there is a beautiful and ancient city of Tarragona.  And from the entertainment - the famous Aventur Amusement Park near Salou. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Costa Brava Costa Dorada" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2059298.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  There is an opinion that the main thing that distinguishes the Costa Brava from the Costa Daurada is its budget vacation.  But it is not so.  Just on the Costa Brava a very large selection of hotels.  This coast is perceived by tourists from Western Europe as a continuation of the <span>French Riviera.</span>  Therefore, there are many five-star hotels and luxury villas that are rented out.  At the same time, quite budget hotels and even hostels are also enough here.  You can rent cheap housing in the private sector or stay at a campsite.  Prices for other services depend on the "untwisted" resort.  But to an even greater extent - whether it is high season or low.  If you choose to visit Catalonia the end of September or the beginning of October, then you will pay less for the same services on the Costa Brava than on the Golden Coast.  Vacationers in the very <span>north of Spain</span> have another advantage: they can travel cheaply to Andorra, where duty-free shopping provides an opportunity for a successful shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the difference between Costa Brava and Costa Dorada" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2059299.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Of course, you decide for yourself where it is better - on the Costa Brava or Costa Dorada.  We can only summarize all of the above.  Costa Brava is more suitable for youth.  There is a mountainous terrain, often a turbulent sea, a cooler climate.  But there is a lot of entertainment, and the city of Lloret del Mar is called a youth resort.  Costa Dorada is more suitable for older people or vacationing with children.  The gentle sea has a smoothly descending bottom, and from sand you can sculpt cakes and castles.  The relief here is flat and does not have the chance to go down the stairs to the beach.  But the youth here may seem a little boring.  In addition to Aventur Park, there are no special entertainments in Salou. </p>
