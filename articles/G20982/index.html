New buildings of Yekaterinburg</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yekaterinburg is one of the largest and densely populated cities in the country.  That is why the housing issue here is particularly acute.  The desire to acquire a spacious and comfortable living space in an excellent area, surrounded by all infrastructure, including social, is quite understandable and justified.  Modern construction companies offer excellent complexes, some of them are located in the very center of the city, others in the suburbs, due to which they can provide amazing ecology, clean and fresh air to all their residents.  As part of this material, we will consider the Baltym-Park residential complex.  This is a new <span>district of Yekaterinburg,</span> according to the assurances of the developer, equipped with all objects of social infrastructure.  Feedback from real estate investors will help to produce the most objective review. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  YIT Uralstroy proposed an excellent complex, or rather, a whole residential microdistrict, on the territory of which there will appear not only residential, but also public areas and all necessary infrastructure.  ‚ÄúQuarter of the Future‚Äù - this is the name ‚ÄúBaltym-Park‚Äù received, representing a unique technologically and conceptually project created for modern residents of the metropolis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  76 hectares of land have been allocated for the project.  It is on them that comfortable houses will appear on 3-5 floors.  Low-rise buildings were not chosen by chance.  Based on the study, the developer revealed that only small houses with a minimum number of neighbors, remote from each other, will be able to provide each resident of a new district with comfort, spaciousness and isolation, so much needed in a big noisy city.  Over 5,000 apartments will appear here.  The introduction of unique construction technologies can reduce energy costs and make affordable accommodation in the complex.  At present, some houses have already been commissioned, construction continues.  And we can only turn to the reviews of those who have already settled. </p>

    <h2>  Location of Baltym-Park </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> will become part of the Verkhnyaya Pyshma district, bordering the territory of Yekaterinburg.  In other words, a new district will appear in the northern suburbs of Yekaterinburg, not far from the clean and picturesque <span>Lake Baltym.</span>  It is very popular among residents of Yekaterinburg, many spend here all the weekend.  Not far from the site runs the ECAD - a ring road connecting various districts of the city.  That is why residents of the complex will not have to experience isolation from the city.  By the way, it is only 18 km away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Speaking about the advantages of the Baltym-Park residential complex, ecology should be noted.  The air here is really great: clean and fresh.  The complex is located on a hill, so it is always dry and fresh.  Sometimes, of course, the noise comes from a busy highway, in the summer there are a lot of vacationers around the complex, but the place is amazing and picturesque. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Real estate investors and potential buyers are really concerned about the infrastructure.  Agree, no one wants to take their children to kindergarten or school in the city every day: this is completely inconvenient and unsafe.  But the developer "YIT Uralstroy" provided for everything to the smallest detail.  Several kindergartens, a comprehensive school will appear on the territory of the Baltym-Park complex (Verkhnyaya Pyshma), construction of commercial facilities is planned: a shopping and entertainment complex, a fitness center, a car service, and parking.  Residents of the area will not experience a shortage of shops, restaurants and cafes. </p>

    <p>  School is average in all respects.  If you want your child to study certain disciplines in depth, you will have to take him to a school in <span>Yekaterinburg.</span>  <span>Kindergarten,</span> according to residents, is not bad, educators really take care of children.  Among the shortcomings, I would like to note the insufficient number of stores; today there is no pharmacy here.  But this is rather a temporary phenomenon. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The territory of the district is fenced, is under round-the-clock protection and is equipped with a video surveillance system.  Moreover, the developer plans to introduce a throughput system, which will only increase the level of security. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Baltym-Park is a conceptually unique project that takes into account all the needs of a modern resident of a metropolis.  All infrastructure facilities are within walking distance of the house.  Each group of residents (children, motorists and cyclists) has its own territory.  Excellent playgrounds and sports grounds were built for children, bicycle paths for cyclists, spacious parking lots, car service and a car wash for car owners.  Moreover, recreation areas with conversations, benches, walking areas will appear on the territory. </p>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The residential area "Baltym-Park" is located within easy reach of the city.  Near the object is a public transport stop "Ryabinovaya".  By buses you can reach the center of Verkhnyaya Pyshma and the Ordzhonikidzevsky district of Yekaterinburg.  In the near future, additional routes will be launched in the direction of the new district. </p><p>  Those who have already settled in the houses of Baltym-Park, note that transport accessibility is "lame."  Yes, there are buses to the city, but not every 10-15 minutes, as the developer assured.  Buying real estate here, at least for now, is only for those who have a private car in their family.  Only in this case, remoteness from the city will not affect the comfort of living.  Residents of the district also hope for a reorganization of the road, since with the onset of heat traffic along it is more than dense: no one wants to stand in traffic jams on the way to work and home. </p><p>  The utility fee is an important selection criterion.  So, all residents emphasize that under the condition of operating a gas boiler, the utility fee is small: 2000-3000 rubles in winter. </p>

    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Apartments in "Baltym-Park" - just a sight for sore eyes.  Many equity holders noted that when they got acquainted with the project, they fell in love with it and its entire concept at first sight.  The main emphasis is on European layouts, which attract many.  The kitchen and dining areas are combined into a single space, which creates the necessary space.  Combined sanitary facilities with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5-6 square meters allow you to place everything you need.  Finnish balconies up to 1.5 meters wide turn into excellent verandas where you can spend time in the afternoon and evening.  Small corridors allow maximum use of each meter of living space.  Ceilings with a height of at least 2.7 meters - this is it, the guarantee of spaciousness.  A wardrobe is also provided for projects. </p><p>  A variety of planning solutions allows you to find a dream apartment for yourself. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Baltym-Park is a truly unique project, which simply has no equal in Yekaterinburg and throughout the Urals.  That is why it attracts the attention of potential buyers.  In general, the idea is successful, the developer was able to take into account the wishes of all residents.  Of course, there were some shortcomings and shortcomings.  But we recall that the project is not completed, work on the construction of new houses and landscaping continues.  That is why we strongly recommend that you take a closer look.  Moreover, at the construction stage, an apartment here can be purchased on favorable terms.  If you want to live in an ecologically clean area without restricting access to all the infrastructure of the megalopolis, Baltym-Park will be an excellent and win-win option for you. </p>
