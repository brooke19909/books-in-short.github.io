Cleaning and cooking take a lot of energy, so most vacationers prefer not to think about them on vacation.  Choosing a hotel and type of food is not an easy task.  <span>How to save money</span> and get high quality service?  Hotels in Turkey and Egypt often operate on an All Inclusive system, and the tourist has no choice but to go and pay for something that, perhaps, he does not need.  And many, having ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù such a service, prefer a different vacation.  In Europe, most hotels offer <span>food HB,</span> FB, but there are many such where you can be content only BB.  So what do these magical letters mean? </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fb food" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10434/155566.jpg" width="500"></div>  <span>Types of food</span> in hotels </h4><p>  These designations are abbreviations, and of course, they came from English.  BB means bed &amp; breakfast.  Well, in the case of HB (half board) and FB (full board) we are talking about half and <span>full board.</span>  The first is breakfast and dinner included in the price, which sometimes, by agreement with the administration, can be replaced by lunch, but the second is nothing more than the usual three meals a day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In all cases, complimentary drinks are served for breakfast, but to drink juice, tea, coffee or something stronger for lunch or dinner, you will have to pay from your own pocket.  But there are exceptions.  You can identify them by additional characters.  So, if FB food has the additional designation ‚Äú+‚Äù, hotel guests are offered free drinks (often certain) during all meals. </p>

In this case, it is better to get reliable information first hand, namely from the hotel staff.

    <h4>  FB nutrition - a way to save and not save a figure </h4><p>  Often, many tourists complain that they gained a few extra pounds while staying in a hotel where meals are organized on the principle of "take as much as you want and when you want."  Indeed, it is difficult to deny yourself anything on vacation, because between breakfast, lunch and dinner, ice cream, sweets, potatoes and other goodies are offered.  A lot of tourists spend their vacations on the principle of "break away in full."  Hence the abuse of not only food but also alcohol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another thing is that FB is a type of food that will allow you not to get fat, as in this case there will not be temptations to intercept something on the way from the sea to the room.  And the second important point is the saving on the cost of the permit.  Well, there‚Äôs always something to spend on saved money. </p><h4>  HB and FB nutrition - important to know </h4><p>  Another subtlety that not all tourists know about.  Most often, FB food involves the so-called "buffet", that is, an unlimited number of approaches and a wide range of dishes on offer. </p><p>  However, some hotels depart from this principle, offering vacationers a la carte food.  In this case, the day before or during breakfast, you need to decide what will be served on the table for lunch or dinner, choosing from the menu.  But even in these hotels cold snacks and salads are often offered on the basis of the "buffet". </p>

This opinion, of course, is erroneous.  Yes, probably there will not be such a huge daily choice, but, on the other hand, in this case you can get food of much higher quality, and this is also important.  Indeed, in this case, the likelihood that you have to eat pasta for breakfast, in the salad for lunch and in the form of casseroles for dinner, is almost zero.
