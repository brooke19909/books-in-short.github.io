However, urbanization has long come to these parts.  One of the most distinctive cities in the region is considered the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Region.  Sightseeing in Birobidzhan, photos with descriptions of which are presented in the article, will be interesting to any tourist. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.78035740000001" data-lng="132.91307440000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/9/3/4593.png"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Today, few people remember that the formation of national autonomy in the Far Eastern lands of the USSR was the first realized attempt to create a Jewish state in modern times.  The resettlement of Jews to the lands of the Amur region began in the first third of the 20th century.  In 1937, the EAO received the capital.  For this, a small station village with a name formed from the name of the Bijan and Bira rivers was given the status of a city. </p><p>  The policy began to grow rapidly due to migrants arriving from areas of Russia, Palestine, Argentina, and the USA.  The increase in population contributed to the emergence of enterprises in the light and food industries.  Birobidzhan progressively developed until the end of the 90s of the last century, marked by a massive outflow of ethnic Jews to their historical homeland.  However, even after this, the city continues to be a major cultural and educational center of the Russian Far East. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main attractions of the city of Birobidzhan </h2><p>  An example of a Far Eastern policy shows that the absence of a long history is not a reason for reducing tourist attractiveness.  There is something to see and where to go.  Photos of Birobidzhan sights will become valuable trophies for the most demanding traveler. </p><p>  One of the city‚Äôs calling cards is the architectural and hydraulic engineering composition on the forecourt, inaugurated in 2003. Here, in the center of the oval basin, a granite column is installed.  The pillar is crowned with a gilded statue of menorah - a sacred lamp for the performance of Jewish rites.  On the sides there are two openwork stone bowls spewing out water.  Additional geysers hit from the vents around the perimeter of the pool.  In the evening, when the backlight turns on, the composition looks enchanting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alibabai.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station Square Fountain" class="if uuid-2555931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2555931.jpg"></div><p>  The main architectural pearl of Birobidzhan is the Annunciation Cathedral, consecrated in 2005. The exterior of the one-domed church is eclectic.  The building embodied the features of Novgorod and Moscow cult architecture.  The facade of the church is decorated with mosaics, high stained glass windows. </p><p>  The symbols of the policy include the television tower crowning the hill depicted on the city coat of arms.  The height of the openwork metal structure is 234 meters.  According to this indicator, it is included in the top 10 similar structures erected in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monuments and Monuments </h2><p>  The monumental sights of Birobidzhan are colorful and diverse.  A reminder to the descendants of the feat of heroes who did not return from the fronts of the Second World War is a 14-meter stella erected in Victory Square.  The pillar, lined with marble, is crowned with an order and a laurel wreath cast from metal.  In front of the monument, the Eternal Flame burns. </p><p>  Not far from the railway station, a monument dedicated to Jewish immigrants was laid, who laid the basis for the development of autonomy with selfless labor.  The sculptural composition depicting a family of migrants on a horse-drawn cart looks very expressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novelrussia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to immigrants in Birobidzhan" class="if uuid-2555939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2555939.jpg"></div><p>  The classic of national literature Sholom Aleichem is not forgotten in Birobidzhan.  A bronze monument to the cult Jewish writer was inaugurated here in the summer of 2004. </p><h2>  City temples </h2><p>  The list of cult attractions of Birobidzhan is not limited to the Annunciation Cathedral.  There are temples belonging to various faiths. </p><p>  In the middle of the last century, a fire destroyed the main Birobidzhan synagogue.  After that, the place of worship for the Jewish community was a small house of worship.  The situation has changed only recently.  Thanks to the active work of Rabbi M. Scheiner, by the middle of 2004 it was possible to complete the construction of a new synagogue.  The building is not impressive in size, but it looks very elegant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itreba.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Altar of St. Nicholas Church in Birobidzhan" class="if uuid-2555968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2555968.jpg"></div><p>  The log church, consecrated in 1999 in the name of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, is considered a local architectural highlight.  Modern builders managed to erect a building, guided by the traditions of ancient Russian architects.  The church, covered with a tented dome, inspires thoughts of ancient rural temples in central Russia. </p><h2>  Birobidzhan museums </h2><p>  Tourists will be able to combine sightseeing in Birobidzhan with a rich cognitive program.  The doors of local cultural and educational institutions are always open for curious travelers. </p><p>  The exhibits of the museum of local history, which has funds of 29 thousand storage units, tell about the unique nature of the Amur region, the history of the development of these lands by the Cossacks, and the participation of the Birobidzhanians in the Second World War.  During the tour, visitors will learn many interesting facts regarding the education and development of the EAO. </p><div class="photo" data-original="birobidjan.bezformata.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exhibition at the Museum of Local Lore" class="if uuid-2556009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2556009.jpg"></div><p>  Birobidzhan boasts a museum that has no analogues in Russia.  The expositions of the institution are dedicated to everything related to pensions.  The story begins with Peter's decrees on the appointment of regular maintenance to retired officers.  Further, visitors will become acquainted in retrospect with the evolution of pension business in tsarist, Soviet and modern Russia. </p><h2>  Natural attractions of Birobidzhan </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the polis there are several places that are especially attractive for connoisseurs of natural beauty.  A walk along the tourist trail of the Bastak dendrological park will be remembered by travelers for their vivid impressions.  Cedars, firs, spruces, deciduous trees and shrubs grow here, the air is full of aromas, springs exude crystal clear water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eaomedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Swan Lake" class="if uuid-2556016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2556016.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the village of Golovino, Birobidzhan district, there is an amazing Swan Lake.  In summer, Komarov‚Äôs lotus buds open on its surface.  Look at the carpet, woven by nature from delicate pink inflorescences and white petals of water lilies, nature lovers come from all over the region.  The lake is rich in fish.  Benthic silty sediments of the reservoir were chosen by the same age as dinosaurs - relict water chestnut. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Tourists who are going to witness the sights and interesting places of Birobidzhan with their own eyes will find the following information useful: </p><ul><li>  Contrary to popular belief, there are very few ethnic Jews in the city.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to meet a colorful Orthodox here. </li><li>  The traveler sometimes gets the impression that he was in Israel, because most of the signs are duplicated in Hebrew. </li><li>  The policy is very well maintained.  The absence of large enterprises has a beneficial effect on the environment.  Only the smell of burning from forest fires, which are considered commonplace in the summer, pollutes the air. </li><li>  Local mosquitoes will surprise tourists with their size and activity, debunking the myth of the exclusivity of Siberian counterparts. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="nabat.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Signs at the institutions of Birobidzhan" class="if uuid-2556044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2556044.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews of tourists about Birobidzhan </h2><p>  For most travelers, the city leaves a good impression.
