It is connected to the mainland by three bridges.  If earlier Phuket, which has a bright and rich history, existed through the extraction of rubber and tin, today its main source of income is tourism.  This island is an attractive resort with a highly developed infrastructure. </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Coming to this island get an amazing palette of impressions.  Swimming in the blue lagoons, pink sunsets, the contemplation of monks dressed in orange robes, three-wheeled cycle rickshaws and long-tailed boats that take travelers to numerous local attractions, and much more will be unforgettable.  On the south coast are the most popular beaches of Phuket - Kata, Karon, etc. From May to October, they are literally crowded with surfers.  The fact is that this season a very strong wind blows here, causing high waves.  Phuket, Kata in particular, is famous for the cleanest sea and snow-white beaches. </p><p>  In the northern part, the coast is much calmer.  The island of Phi Phi, as well as Phang Nga Bay and, of course, Patong Beach are preferred by tourists who go diving, like boat trips.  No less popular is the interior of the island with its wooded hills, mountains and cliffs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The weather in Phuket is characterized by two distinct seasons: rainy and dry.  The first starts in May and lasts until October.  During this period, passing tropical cyclones are likely, accompanied by showers and wind.  There are not many sunny days on the island in summer.  The average temperature ranges from twenty to thirty-three degrees.  It is during this season that prices for <span>Phuket hotels</span> are reduced <span>.</span>  "Kata", "Patong" and other beaches attract mainly athletes who relax in the economy class.  They are not interested in comfort.  The main thing is the presence of waves at sea so that you can ride on the board. </p><p>  Another thing is the warm "high" season.  It starts in November and ends in March.  At this time, the average temperature rises to thirty-six degrees, few tropical showers and, conversely, many sunny days.  The beaches of Phuket - Kata, Karon and Patong - are literally crowded with tourists who come to this exotic country to swim and sunbathe. </p>

    <h2>  Kata </h2><p>  On the map, it is located between Naiharn and Karon.  This is the third most popular beach area in Phuket.  The golden sandy coating, the amazingly blue sea, with an azure hue, bordered by green hills - all this resembles the famous <span>Bounty chocolate</span> commercial <span>.</span>  But the main thing that comes to mind for those who first see this beach is the complete serenity that prevails on the coast, even despite the presence of tourists.  Here, unlike the Karon or Patong, there is no vibrant nightlife, which is probably why the beach is so popular among families vacationing with young children.  True, from April to November, few people come here because of sufficiently strong waves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Kata" by many tour operators is positioned as a good place for a beach holiday and as a developed tourist resort.  It has excellent infrastructure - cafes and restaurants, shops and massage parlors.  It‚Äôs also calm.  And the prices do not really bite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Kata hotels" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1061728.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Located on the first line, near the sea, tourist complexes differ in their target clientele.  In the northern part of the beach area, on Kata-Yai, predominantly large hotels were built, perfectly suitable for youth recreation and active entertainment.  The southern lane is considered more quiet.  Therefore, it was here that numerous family hotels were concentrated, where you can safely and comfortably relax with young children. </p><p>  Local hotel complexes, as a rule, comply with four- or five-star standards.  Almost all of them have private beaches, swimming pools, sports fields, spa centers.  Another advantage of this accommodation is that in such hotels there is always the opportunity to get a room with a gorgeous view of the sea. </p><p>  Near the tourist area is a magnificent coral reef.  That is why the most popular entertainment in the resort is considered diving. </p><p>  The best hotels on Kata Beach are considered to be the chic five-star Impiana Private Villas, Avista Phuket Resort &amp; Spa, Metadee Resort.  Among the "four" tourists note Kata Beach Resort, Sugar Palm Grand Hillside, Sawasdee Village Resort.  I must say that these hotels are quite expensive.  Therefore, those who are counting on a budget <span>holiday in Thailand,</span> in particular in Phuket, it is better to opt for three-star options, for example, Ibis Phuket Kata Hotel or Orchidacea Resort.  We will talk about the latter later. </p>

    <p>  Fans of noisy entertainment will have to go to the center of the island, where there are many clubs, restaurants and cabarets.  Here you can buy a ticket for any of the fights of famous Thai boxers, which take place in the sports center. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots who have visited the Orchidacea Resort believe that this hotel is very good.  Although it does not claim to a higher level, it is quite consistent with its three stars.  It has an excellent location: there are two beaches nearby - a five and ten minute walk.  The hotel consists of several four-story buildings, the latest, new, according to some guests, is not very conveniently located - right by the road. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the staff at Orchidacea Resort are polite and professional.  Both managers who speak only English (not counting their mother tongue) and Russian speakers work here.  According to tourists, in terms of price and quality, this complex is considered the best in the region.  The rooms are recently renovated, new furniture, quality plumbing, blackout curtains. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the Russians call the cleaning time.  Maids clean the rooms at two in the afternoon when the children are sleeping.  Another minus, according to our compatriots, is monotonous breakfasts.  Although they are very satisfying.  Holidaymakers who like to eat tight and tasty even in the mornings, sometimes there is not enough choice at the buffet. </p>

    <p>  Some buildings are elevated.  And although many people do not have special difficulties with lifting, nevertheless, this gives older tourists some discomfort. </p><p>  In general, summarizing all the information presented in the comments, we can come to the conclusion: for those who want to relax on the Kata beach and not spend too much money, the hotel we are considering is perfect. </p>
