    <p>  Among all this natural and man-made beauty, buildings, pools, sports fields, a parking zone, bars and restaurants are harmoniously located. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Premium Grand Horizon Resort has a rich infrastructure to ensure its guests a pleasant and memorable stay.  The hotel reception is located in one of the buildings, but not on the first, but on the second floor in a cozy lobby.

Guest reviews about the rooms are mostly positive.  The spaciousness and very large beds are especially noted (the phrase from the review: ‚Äúthe bed is so big that you can get lost in it‚Äù).  The design of the rooms is minimalist, but all the furnishings are selected with taste.  The furniture is white and brown.  The windows are large, panoramic, with a view of either the sea or the hotel.  Balconies are not available in every room, so this issue should be clarified at the time of receipt of the keys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Premium Grand Horizon Resort 4 Egypt Hurghada" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1074480.jpg" width="564"></div>

Some guests note that there was absolutely nothing to eat during their rest, and what they managed to intercept was issued at the very minimum.  Others say that there was too much food, it was not even possible to try, and the food was so delicious that it was a pity to leave it on a plate, so they took the best to eat in the room.  Tours sold at the Premium Grand Horizon Resort have an all-inclusive concept, which at this hotel involves free food and drinks around the clock.  For breakfast, there are always several types of cereals, cereals, milk, tea, coffee, egg dishes, sausages, sausages, cheeses, olives, vegetables, sweets.  For lunch and dinner, meat and fish dishes, several types of side dishes (potatoes, vegetables, pasta, rice), salads, soups, fruits, desserts are offered. </p>
