    <p>  Today we will focus on comparing devices from leading companies.  We are talking about smartphones that are part of the Samsung Galaxy and Sony Xperia series.  If you know about the main strengths and weaknesses of these models, then choosing one of them will be easier, based on your own needs. </p><h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  To understand the question: “Samsung” or “Sony” - which is better? ”, You should first evaluate their physical characteristics.  The width of smartphones is almost the same.  A slight difference can be felt if you take the device with one hand.  If the width of Sony is still slightly ahead, then Samsung got a little more favorable weight indicators, but the difference is not significant. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

The phone is largely determined by the capabilities of its battery.  Samsung’s battery is slightly inferior to Sony.  However, Samsung Galaxy devices have one important advantage in this area.  They suggest the possibility of <span>replacing the battery</span> with a new one.

Now, to solve it, take a closer look at the design of devices.  The Xperia smartphone is protected by a metal case.  It is complemented by corner inserts that are made of polycarbonate.  Such a solution does not spoil the appearance of the device at all.  Samsung's surface is made of plastic.  At the same time, the device does not seem cheap and preserves the style.  Galaxy is equipped with a five-inch display, made using Super AMOLED technology.  In the case of Sony, the Truliminous screen is used with a similar diagonal and technology called the X-Reality Engine.  Balances device quality.  They have Full HD-screens with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels.  Thus, none of the models has an undeniable advantage by this criterion.

    <h2>  Camera and other items </h2><p>  You can compare Samsung and Sony by the quality of the pictures they create.  Great landscapes are easy to get with your Sony smartphone.  It is equipped with an excellent camera with a resolution of 20.7 megapixels, which is complemented by an LED flash.  Additional advantages of this device include Geo Tagging.  In this parameter, slightly inferior to Samsung.  The smartphone of this company uses two cameras, the main and front, with indicators of 13 megapixels and 2 megapixels.  Galaxy also has voice control features.  When you hover over a specific area of ​​the screen, prompts are displayed.  Also, the smartphone monitors the movement of the user's eyes.  An important advantage of Samsung is the support in the USB Host device.  There is no FM receiver.  Sony has 3 GB of RAM; Samsung has only 2 GB of RAM.  Such characteristics allow owners of a Japanese smartphone to simultaneously open many applications, while they do not freeze.  The cost of the device can also affect the choice.  Sony's smartphone is more expensive when compared to Samsung’s solution.  We can say that both smartphones have proven themselves well. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  additional information </h2>

    <p>  The solution from Samsung is distributed in several colors.  The smartphone from the Korean manufacturer supports gesture control.  You can use such a phone even while wearing gloves.  The possibility of double recording is implemented.  User can take video and take photos at the same time.  A complete set of interfaces is supported.  The device can be used as a remote control.  Sony company uses materials of higher quality.  The front and rear panels have <span>reinforced glass,</span> which is particularly durable.  The devices are complemented by an aluminum frame, their corners are polycarbonate.  There are no buttons on the front panel.  The smartphone can effectively resist water and dust.  The device supports wireless charging. </p><p>  It is difficult to compare solutions from major manufacturers such as Samsung and Sony.  Companies were created at different times.  Their formation took place in various conditions.  The principles of their creators are also very different.  Sony is a world famous company from Japan.  It once became the market leader for VCRs.  Active development of this enterprise began in the post-war period.  The company sought to make life easier for the citizens of the country, therefore, among the first to introduce innovative technologies in production.  A responsible and thorough approach is maintained when creating smartphones. </p>
