In its scope, this park is not inferior even to the French Versailles, in terms of the magnificence of the fountains it surpasses it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peterhof Upper Park" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41290/1298789.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The park is divided into two parts: Lower and Upper Peterhof.  The Upper Park is much smaller than the Lower, however, it is not inferior to it in beauty and originality.  We can say that each of them is unique and interesting in its own way.  In our article, we will focus mainly on the Upper Park.  Help at least a little imagine the luxury that distinguishes Peterhof, photographs posted in the article. </p><h2>  History of the park </h2><p>  Today, the royal ensemble of the park includes 4 luxurious cascades and 176 fountains unsurpassed in beauty.  And 300 years ago there were only swamps and located around the village.  However, in the 1710s, Peter I issued a decree on the beginning of active architectural and landscape works.  Thanks to many preserved documents, drawings and drawings, we even got the information that the projects of individual fountains, as well as the concept of the layout of the ensemble as a whole and the development of a water supply system belong to the emperor himself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By 1723, the main palace residence was completely completed and named "Peterhof".  The opening of the park along with the launch of the main fountain building - the Grand Cascade - also happened this year.  The name “Peterhof” is translated from German as “Petrova Manor”.  Since 1762, the city, which grew around the royal residence, and the entire palace and park ensemble, spread around it, began to be called Peterhof.  The Grand Cascade and a number of other fountains were dedicated to the Russian victory in the Northern War, after which the Russian Empire appeared.  Buildings that initially served as the residence of the emperor were turned into a museum after the October Revolution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peterhof discovery" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41290/1298784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Heavy period </h2><p>  During the Second World War, a dark period began for the park, as enemy artillery almost completely destroyed it.  However, thanks to the almost inhuman efforts of the museum workers, nearly 50 statues and about 8,000 palace interiors were removed from here even before the German occupation.  This was, of course, an important victory of art, but, unfortunately, the objects that were saved were only a very modest part of all the Peterhof treasures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Peterhof began to revive only at the end of the war, and periodic restoration work continues to this day.  In 1945, the Lower Park of Peterhof was opened.  And two years later, the famous Samson fountain was re-installed and completely recreated in it, the jet of which rises 20 meters higher and which, thanks to its incredible beauty, was not destroyed by the Nazis, but was only transported to Germany.  The restoration of the <span>Peterhof Palace</span> began in 1952, and 12 years later its first halls were already opened.  The recreated Peterhof rose almost from the ashes.  The opening was very solemn. </p><h2>  Peterhof Palace </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptune Fountain" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41290/1298786.jpg"></div>  The Grand Imperial Palace is the most outstanding building in the magnificent Peterhof Park.  It proudly rises above the Grand Cascade, leading to the park area.  The palace was built in a special style of <span>Peter's Baroque,</span> but over time it continued to be completed in the style of mature Baroque.  Under the palace is a decorative grotto.

    <p>  As already mentioned, the park area is divided into Lower and Upper parks.  The lower park is located on an area of ​​102.5 hectares, and it is fed by a 22-kilometer water conduit.  The Upper Park occupies a smaller area, but it is not inferior to the Lower Park in the luxury and uniqueness of its fountains and statues. </p><h2>  Attractions of the Upper Park </h2><p>  The main attraction, which Peterhof, Upper Park is famous for, is its absolutely perfect symmetry.  The fountains here are also located symmetrically: in the center is Neptune, Oak and Mezheumny, both other fountains flaunt opposite the side of the palace outbuildings.  "Neptune" (fountain) is the dominant of the park, decorated with many unique medieval sculptures. </p><p>  Another attraction of the Upper Park is four <span>marble sculptures</span> created by the Italian Giovanni Bonazza and installed here in 1757.  These are Pomona, Zephyr, Flora, and Vertumn.  The Upper Garden is also decorated with a blooming green alley, which in the fall season acquires a bright red color. </p><h2>  Fountain "Neptune" </h2>
      <br>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peterhof photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41290/1298783.jpg"></div>  Being the main building of the Upper Park, this fountain really looks luxurious and more saturated than the rest.  "Neptune" is a fountain decorated with a three-tiered group of sculptures and towering above it by the sea lord himself, holding his invariable trident in his hand.  On four sides of this composition are pedestals with masks of sea monsters, from which water jets beat.

    <p>  On both sides of the base with Neptune, river nymphs are sitting with oars in their hands.  The pedestal itself is decorated with many corals, bas-reliefs and other lead parts, as well as bronze figures of a girl and a boy.  Even around Neptune there are riders on hippocampi (sea winged horses), who seem to protect the mythical god and at the same time chase dolphins.  There are dolphins in the fountain pool - eight symmetrically arranged figures. </p><p>  On the south side of the Neptune Fountain, there is a small cascade with water running down three feet and above which is a statue of <span>Apollo Belvedere</span> made of bronze (there used to be a Winter statue of lead in its place).  Both Apollo and Neptune did not appear here immediately, but only in 1736.  Initially, in the heart of the pool was the “Cart of Neptune”, made of lead, however, after decaying, it was replaced by the sculptural composition “Neptune” (created in the 17th century in Nuremberg).  So the initial period of the existence of sculpture took place in Germany. </p><h2>  The story of Neptune </h2><p>  The creation of a unique fountain group took place during the heyday of the German Empire, when hundreds of beautiful monuments were erected in the country.  Nuremberg also creates something unique to decorate the city market.  The fountain was decided to coincide with the <span>Westphalian world,</span> which put an end to the Thirteen Years' War - the most important event in German history.  In this regard, the best craftsmen in the empire worked on the creation of the sculpture.  Nymphs near Neptune at that time represented not nameless rivers, but concrete ones - Pegnitz and Regnitz.  On the pedestal to this day there are coats of arms of Nuremberg, city hall and chancellor.  In total, 27 figures were included in the sculptural composition. </p><p>  However, upon completion of the work, it turned out that in the Nuremberg rivers Pegnitz and Regnitz there is not enough water for the functioning of such a monumental fountain composition.  Then I had to disassemble it and put it off until the so-called better times.  As a result, only after 130 years the sculpture came in handy - the city authorities decided to replenish their budget at the expense of it and at that time offered the heir to the Russian throne, Pavel, who had come to Nuremberg during a trip to Western Europe, to purchase Neptune.  Pavel, wanting to demonstrate the wealth of the Russian Empire, without hesitation, agreed to this step, having bought a sculptural group for 30 000 rubles - at that time a lot of money. </p><h2>  Mezheumny fountain </h2>

A water stream is rapidly escaping from the mouth of the dragon, dolphins also spray water.  The lead Andromeda was originally in this pool, then more than one sculpture visited its place for several years, and as a result the figure of a bronze winged dragon was established.  In this regard, the composition was called "Mezheumny fountain" (or "Indefinite").

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But on this the story of inconstancy of this composition continued.  The dragon was exchanged for a dolphin-like sculpture "Sterlet", and eventually - on a cast-iron vase.  The dragon returned to its place in 1958, but it was already completely new.  Both the dragon and the dolphins were cast anew according to the surviving few drawings. </p><h2>  Oak Fountain </h2>

It is a hexagonal star with dolphins at its ends, and in the center is a gilded marble sculpture “The Boy with the Mask”.  Initially, he also looked different.  In 1734 there was a lead “Oak”, surrounded by six dolphins and three dragons, but after 12 years it was removed.  In 1802, this composition was installed in the Lower Park.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, the name “Oak” was originally assigned to the fountain, although there was no longer any “Oak” in the composition.  For some time in the center of the fountain there was a carved wooden "Cornucopia", but it was dilapidated and was eventually replaced by a "Boy with a mask." </p><h2>  Other sculptures </h2><p>  Peterhof (Upper Park) is also famous for its oldest reservoirs - Square Ponds, dug in 1719 in order to provide water to the Lower Park.  In 1773, sculptural groups surrounded by lead dolphins were installed in the center of these reservoirs.  But after many years they were dilapidated and were replaced by ordinary unpretentious vertical jets.  Only in 1956 did Square Ponds regain their former appearance. </p><p>  In the Upper Park, you can also see such sculptures of Peterhof as the fountain of Venus Italian, which is a sculpture surrounded by six dolphins.  In the background of the fountain is visible the church of St. Peter and Paul, which is part of the Peterhof Palace. </p><h2>  Famous park </h2>
