    <h2>  Company benefits </h2><p>  What stands out from the rest of the construction company "Fodd" (Moscow)?  The objects are delivered on time, the quality is impeccable, although the cost of services is not the lowest. </p><p>  But the most important thing is reliability.  The company has been on the market for more than 10 years, while it actively cooperates with leading developers in Moscow, with the best architects.  This gives invaluable experience, which is then used in the implementation of customer projects. </p><p>  But that is not all; the company has its own production resources.  This is a design bureau and logistics department, construction and engineering divisions.  All this allows you to maintain the dynamics of production processes. </p><p>  Long-term relationships with partners play a decisive role because they give predictable results.  These include leading manufacturers of equipment and materials, delivery and storage services. </p><p>  Among the advantages are financial discipline and a professional team. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "Bulgakov": reviews </h2><p>  This Fodd facility was erected near Patriarch Ponds; the construction of an elite house was completed in 2014.  The project involved the construction of an eight-story building and underground parking.  The apartments have a free layout, but the most important thing is located on the top floor.  This is a luxurious penthouse with panoramic views.  On-site video surveillance is carried out around the clock, which is very pleasant for incoming residents.  Permanent security organized, access control system installed. </p><p>  Before buying a property you need to think carefully about the future.  The lower apartments are equipped with terraces, which really help out when guests arrive or want to sit in the fresh air.  The apartments on the upper floors can easily be interconnected, so if there is an expansion in the plans, then this is ideal for investing money. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, an ideal place to stay, although the apartments are expensive here.  The infrastructure and transport accessibility of the area are very well developed.  But the main thing is the unique decisions of designers that make life in the complex beautiful and comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fodd objects Moscow" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1956606.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "House on Nikitskaya" ("Fodd") </h2><p>  The object (the photo clearly demonstrates greatness and beauty) is worthy of the attention of buyers.  It was commissioned in 2010.  It is located on Malaya Nikitskaya street, 15. It offers 12 species penthouses with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 500 m <sup>2</sup> .  The apartments are located from the fourth to the seventh floor, and surrender is possible with or without decoration. </p><p>  The house was built by the famous architect, it is brick-solid, reliable, with exquisite exterior decoration.  It has panoramic French windows that provide a unique view.  Ceiling height 3.5 meters, a gallery is provided.  The most demanding residents will enjoy the exclusive decoration in the halls.  In general - a beautiful, elite housing, which will become a cozy corner for your family. </p><p>  In addition, I want to emphasize the attention paid to the safety of residents.  The building has ventilated facades with marble brickwork, and the glazing is made of bulletproof and fireproof windows. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  The Fodd company is today one of the largest and most reliable developers in <span>the Moscow market.</span>  The largest objects trust him, each of which becomes a real masterpiece.  Customer reviews emphasize that no problems were discovered over the years of operation.  The walls do not freeze, the windows do not sweat, the ventilation works, the tiles on the floor do not crack.  That is, the building is really high quality and reliable, and in addition, it is also very aesthetic, beautifully designed.  It's nice to go into the finished buildings, and even more so live here.  Of course, the price of apartments in such houses is quite high, but this is understandable based on the fact that they belong to the business class.  Otherwise, there are no complaints against the developer. </p>
