Its shores are washed by the Mediterranean Sea, there are many resorts with wonderful sandy beaches.  In the small cities of the region, the historical heritage has been carefully preserved: castles, cathedrals, palaces and mansions of the French aristocracy.  This is one of the largest wine-growing regions in the world.  Wine production here began in the III century BC.  Vineyards cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 400 thousand hectares. </p><p>  By the double name it is easy to guess that earlier these were two different regions: Languedoc and Roussillon.  And although politics and commerce weaved them together, they remained different in terms of geography and culture. </p><p>  The region is only three hours from Paris by TGV train. </p>

Numerous defensive towers and battlements of ancient defensive walls amaze with their grandeur.  This medieval city fortification is incredibly well preserved and worth a look.  The castle was built on a wide hill 148 meters high, for the Middle Ages it was a profitable strategic place.  Carcassonne is elliptical in shape, surrounded by a double chain of thick defensive walls with 54 towers.  The fortifications, partially related to the period of French Gothic, were erected during the reign of Louis IX, in 1250, and under Philippe Bold, in 1280.  Every year in July, Carcassonne invites tourists to an unforgettable <span>fireworks festival.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Languedoc Roussillon Winemaking" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59513/2099949.jpg"></div>
