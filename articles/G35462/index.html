  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D home theater: review, models, specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Due to the fact that 3D films have recently become popular, I want to have a personal 3D cinema at home.  Before buying, you need to decide which devices should be purchased.  To do this, you need to ask yourself important questions.  Such, for example, may be the following: what to look at and listen to, what to lose, and what auxiliary devices are needed. </p><p>  The most expensive equipment in the cinema should be the one that is directly needed to display a three-dimensional picture.  The speaker system is less important.  However, special attention must also be paid to it.  Third place in importance is the source of the view. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgo.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3D Cinema from Samsung" class="if uuid-2244292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2244292.jpg"></div><h2>  Which company to choose? </h2><p>  Initially, 3D-type home theaters were manufactured with a 5.1 configuration.  That is, we are talking about the presence of 5 speakers that create a sense of surround sound.  At the moment, such devices remain relevant, and they cope with all functions as much as possible.  Speaking about these systems, the most popular are models from the following manufacturers: Sony, Pioneer, BBK. </p><p>  However, now there are devices on sale that are capable of transmitting sound according to either 7.1 or 9.1.  The number of columns does not change.  Additional speakers are installed, which are directed upwards.  Because of this, the sound picture comes to life, and the listener is completely immersed in the film.  It must also be said that at the moment there are already transmitters that are capable of processing video in high-quality 4K format.  The best among these devices are considered to be released under the name LG, Samsung and Onkyo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Home Blu-ray Cinema </h2><p>  At the moment, 3D cinemas at home are quite popular. </p><p>  The most famous should be called a model from Samsung, which is called the F9750.  This cinema will allow you to watch movies and any programs in Ultra HD format.  It should be noted that it is not necessary to search for a video of just such a resolution.  This device is capable of changing the HD picture to the desired format itself.  In order for a person to understand what quality this is, it should be said that it is 4 times better than Full HD.  The consumer will be able to see the smallest details. </p><p>  Also popular is the 3D home theater from Philips.  This player is capable of reproducing up to 5 image profiles.  The described model can work with many formats.  It is possible to easily watch any content, using Smart TV or Wi-Fi-module.  If we talk about the model in the BDP9700, then with its help you can even talk on Skype. </p><p>  LG's mid-range device, called the BP630, is capable of reproducing both 2D and 3D video formats.  This device starts up pretty quickly.  Included is a special Magic Remote.  The model is able to save energy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home 3D Cinema" class="if uuid-2244285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2244285.jpg"></div><h2>  LG BH9540TW </h2><p>  This device supports the work of blu-ray discs, and also allows you to fully immerse yourself in 3D-image.  The speakers received a power of 1460 watts.  They have a four-channel speaker system.  4 additional speakers are built in.  If we talk about interesting functions, then there is a large number of terminals, ports, internal memory is 1 GB.  You can create a local network, as well as use a wireless connection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of the pluses, it should be noted that the device starts in just 10 seconds.  In terms of formats, everything that is possible is reproduced, the signal in Full HD is displayed with a resolution of 2160 rubles. </p><p>  Of the minuses, buyers notice that the bass is slightly blurry, the color scheme is oversaturated, and in the Smart TV mode, the speakers may crack.  In general, this model of a home 3D cinema has some flaws, but they can be reduced to zero by using some settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home cinema" class="if uuid-2244283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2244283.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung HT-F9750W </h2><p>  This cinema belongs to the premium class.  It has 7-channel speakers.  For the speakers, the total power reaches 1.33 kW.  It supports work with blu-ray, there is a fine tuning of sound, and also, when interacting with 5.1 tracks, the system is able to line up itself.  This cinema is equipped with a cascade amplifier. </p><p>  Of the pluses, it is necessary to highlight the fact that you can play any content online.  The described 3D home theater works with a large number of video formats.  The rear speakers do not have wires; they operate over a network.  There are interesting options, including Smart TV and Smart Hub.  Accordingly, the functionality of this device is greatly increased.  You can reconfigure the format to Ultra HD resolution.  In addition, this 3D home theater from Samsung works with a powerful subwoofer, respectively, there are excellent bass and shock effects, if you watch action films and action games. </p><p>  Of the minuses: when MKV starts up, the system takes a long time to load, the equalizer has small capabilities, and external devices have to be used blindly, since the dialog box is not displayed.  This cinema is also suitable for listening to classical music and banal video viewing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nextpowerup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cinema from Samsung" class="if uuid-2244289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2244289.jpg"></div><h2>  Onkyo HT-S7705 </h2><p>  This Japanese device can be attributed to type 5.1 acoustics, because this is the configuration of this device.  However, the manufacturer provided for a free choice of the number of speakers, so you can supplement the system with two speakers.  This home theater has the function of using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the Internet.  On the speakers, the total power is 925 watts. </p><p>  Speaking of which home 3D cinema to choose, it is imperative to pay attention to this device. </p><p>  Of the advantages, one can note high-quality assembly, neat appearance, logic and ease of operation, the presence of 7 HDMI outputs, as well as a good decoder that allows you to receive excellent quality video and audio. </p><p>  Of the minuses, it should be noted that the device received weak rear speakers, also the connecting cable leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  It is worth highlighting the acoustics that work in the new Dolby Atmos sound format.  The cinema itself brings tracks together, so the system can be called unique.  The surround sound of this model is pretty good. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eu.onkyo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cinema from Onkyo" class="if uuid-2244290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2244290.jpg"></div><h2>  Which home theater to buy? </h2><p>  If you want to use a really great home 3D cinema - Samsung will come to the rescue.  Especially the model described above is necessary with televisions that can play 4K.  Such a cinema can improve the video signal and give the desired resolution. </p><p>  If you want to buy an inexpensive device that is reliable and undemanding in functionality, then the BBK DK1114Si option will be quite simple and good.  He will be able to serve for several years. </p><p>  In fact, a projector for a home 3D cinema is really difficult to choose, but real.  The main thing is to understand what you want and make the right choice. </p>
