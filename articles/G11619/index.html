    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  In accordance with the internal rules of the hotel, registration of newly arrived guests here is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, in fact, as our compatriots note in their reviews, in most cases those who arrived at the hotel earlier were placed in the rooms almost immediately.  It depends on whether the previous tenants vacated their apartments, and on whether they had already managed to clean them and prepare them for moving in.  Also keep in mind that you will be asked to make a deposit of $ 100 upon arrival.  On the day of your departure, a hotel employee will inspect your room, and if everything is in order, then the deposit amount will be fully refunded.  If you used the minibar, you can also pay when you hand over the keys.  In general, on the day of departure, the room should be vacated before noon.  If your departure for the airport is planned later, then for an additional fee you can extend your stay at the hotel.  But many tourists preferred to leave the room, leave things for storage in the luggage room and continue to relax until the time of departure from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eurostar jomtien beach hotel spa 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1140862.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When booking accommodation at EuroStar Jomtien Beach, you can choose the option without meals or with breakfast included in the price.  Tourists who settled on the second option, according to them, did not regret their decision at all.  Breakfast is served in the buffet restaurant on the ground floor.  According to most tourists, they are quite diverse and are designed mainly for Europeans.  So, in the morning you can eat omelet or scrambled eggs, ham, sausages, noodles, stewed vegetables, rice, pancakes, toasts with jam or honey, waffles, fresh vegetables and fruits, juice, tea and coffee.  If you did not pay for breakfast, you can still visit the restaurant in the morning.  A meal will cost you about 200 baht per person.  Travelers can also have lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant for a fee.  But most travelers preferred to eat in the many cafes in the neighborhood and in the center of Pattaya. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  A big plus of EuroStar Jomtien Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 3 * is its proximity to the beach.  You can reach it in just a couple of minutes.  The beach is municipal.  You will have to pay about 50 baht for renting a sunbed and umbrella per day.  The beach is sandy.  According to compatriots, it is regularly cleaned, but the sea still often brings garbage to the shore.  The water here is opaque.  This is due to the fact that the bottom near the coast is muddy.  Our compatriots, according to them, combined rest on the beach near the hotel with trips to other beaches. </p>
