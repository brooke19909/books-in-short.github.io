This is because it is the only one that has a double-sided flag.  The state seal is depicted on one side, and the beaver on the inside.  This is one of the largest Pacific states in the country.  Located in the northwest, it borders with Nevada, California, Idaho and the <span>state of Washington.</span> </p><p>  Oregon in the USA is one of the most beloved among famous people.  The largest of its cities - Portland - was chosen by such celebrities as Chuck Palahniuk (the most famous of the postmodern satire masters), Ursula Le Guin (a legend of the fantasy genre), <span>Matt Groening</span> (creator of the animated series "The Simpsons") ... All and not to list . </p><p>  But Portland, the greenest city in the country, is not the capital of Oregon (USA).  The capital here is Salem.  Previously, this city was a settlement of the Indians.  Despite the fact that the difference between Moscow and Portland, where Russian tourists most often arrive, is as many as fourteen hours, in Oregon (USA), airplanes fly overcrowded through the Pacific Ocean.  It‚Äôs funny with this time, it doesn‚Äôt immediately reach many people how this can be: the travel time is fifteen and a half hours, they left at eight in the morning, for example, and arrived at nine in the morning on the same day.  More than half a day is saved. </p>

    <h2>  Diversity </h2><p>  By the abundance of diverse natural regions, this largest territory (225,000 square kilometers) resembles California, it also has everything: the ocean with a magnificent coast, and the Cascade Mountains, and the most picturesque river valleys, and solonchak desert.  In short, in the state of Oregon (USA), you can also shoot any kind of movie without spending too much on moving.  Even the vineyards of this state argue with the California Napa Valley and, according to wine gourmets, win. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Products from the Villament Valley are considered by connoisseurs to be more refined.  Tourists are very fond of the US state of Oregon.  And I must say, tourism is well developed here - for more than eighty years this industry has been among the leading ones.  It is the level of service and the variety of entertainment that he is attractive.  And of course, the uniqueness of the landscape. </p>

    <h2>  The mountains </h2><p>  The cities of Oregon (USA) are really good and can satisfy any civilized person with a discerning taste.  But lovers of extreme sports are attracted by rocky and forest trips, for which they will certainly go to the Cascade Mountains.  The concentration of volcanoes is concentrated here, each of which is potentially dangerous.  For three and a half thousand meters, the peak rises with Mount Hood crater, and Deshats National Forest adorns the Newberry volcano almost two and a half kilometers high. </p><p>  There are a lot of nature reserves.  One of the most popular routes in the USA runs in the south of Oregon - in Crater Lake National Park.  This is an unforgettable sight of the ancient, wild, dangerous beauties of nature.  The crater is not very high, but in the past the destructive active volcano Mazama is an amazing lake, unique.  None of the lakes on Earth has such an unusually blue color.  Scientists say that nature created this very specific way of feeding snow and rain water the only time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  High desert and other attractions </h2><p>  In the United States, Oregon, as already mentioned, is surprisingly cinematic.  Slightly stepped on the map east of the <span>Cascade Mountains</span> - and ended up in the desert, Oregon High Mountain Desert.  These lands are one of the driest in the world, and they are located high above sea level - 1200 meters.  If you step along the map towards the ocean, such pictures will open to the eye that no movie can replace.  These are sandy beaches, and picturesque shallows, and bays, and bays, hidden in the rocks. </p><p>  A hundred kilometers southwest of Portland, the largest city, but not the capital of Oregon (USA), begins a real bucolic paradise with the most fertile lands.  This is the Valley of the Willamette River, where tourist wine tours are regular, where lovers of a good bouquet come from all over the world.  Local winemakers are not chasing profits, like their California rival.  They make wines exclusive.  And they get it: Oregon Pinot Willamette wine is no worse than the famous Burgundy namesake. </p>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  Children will certainly be interested in Portland with its zoo and Museum of Science.  The Museum of Science and Industry in Oregon is considered the most interesting place to spend time in an exciting and profitable way.  The state of Oregon (USA) considers it its main attraction.  The space of the museum is divided into separate laboratories dedicated to the study of the Earth, various types of life on Earth.  There is a game engineering hall, science exhibitions and much, much more.  All children do not want to leave the planet of Kendall.  And the boys especially like such a unique object as a military submarine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But all the children to the one who came from any end of the earth would like the same knowledge: where is Gravity Falls here, in the USA, in Oregon?  This mysterious town, which everyone knows from the eponymous cartoon, and the area where it is located, excite everyone without exception.  Where are they, all these Miracle Huts, where are the paranormal, where are these fabulous adventures? </p><p>  Oh, not to find the children of this town.  Not on the map, nor on any lands of the USA, Oregon.  The city of Gravity is from the country of Fantasy.  Although the authors probably spotted a lot in these places, and you can pay attention to the Oregon Vortex (Oregon Whirlwind), such a town is on the map.  And another prototype of the fabulous city of Oregon (USA) is Boring, where some residents also observed paranormal phenomena. </p>

    <h2>  Portland Zoo </h2><p>  The main Oregon zoo is located far on the outskirts, even rather outside the city, but there are always so many people there that big problems arise with parking.  Therefore, the most intelligent go there by public transport.  The zoo is huge, the animals there are collected from almost all geographical areas.  And elephants, and monkeys, and tigers, and bears, and giraffes, and hippos - who are not there.  Tourists note that the zoo has done everything for the convenience of visitors.  The territories are huge, that's why the Zoomer free transport is there. </p><p>  The Oregon Zoo is considered one of the oldest.  Here are combined territories for different purposes, but all related to the Washington Park.  There is an amazing arboretum, and Japanese gardens, and rose gardens, even the railway.  The first permanent resident of the zoo back in 1888 was a grizzly bear.  The beginning was a happy one, and now visitors get into the savannah, then into the rainforest, then into Asia, then into South America.  Almost two and a half thousand species of animals, two hundred and sixty species of birds, many of which are on the verge of extinction.  For all animals, conditions are created that are close to natural: everything is thought out, down to the smallest plants planted in aviaries. </p>

    <h2>  Portland </h2><p>  Where the waters of <span>the Columbia</span> and Willamette <span>rivers</span> merge, the largest city of the state and the most famous, sung in songs, films, paintings, are spread.  This is the "city of roses", the most picturesque of the country's settlements, which was surrounded by dense forests and ancient volcanic mountains.  In the state of Oregon (USA) Portland has fountains and gardens, plenty of sun and lots of architectural attractions.  The city is historical, with a very characteristic development of its central part, but at the same time extremely fast growing. </p><p>  Forty kilometers down the Columbia River is the famous gorge where a canyon almost a kilometer deep and seventy waterfalls drop their streams from two hundred meters high.  Everything has been done there to ensure that tourists to the last degree enjoy the views: a huge number of viaducts have been built, places for recreation, numerous hiking trails have been laid.  And east of Portland is Mount Hound Peak, the highest mountain in the state.  On this sleeping volcano, the longest ski season in the USA is 345 days.  And where is the most beautiful fountain in the USA?  The state of Oregon and, of course, Portland are justly proud of this fact. </p>

    <h2>  Huntington </h2><p>  A city in the United States (Oregon) with five hundred and fifteen inhabitants has a namesake in almost every state.  Among them is Huntington, West Virginia, the second largest city in the state.  Why are there so many identical names?  Because in the good old England there is the very first city with that name, and the people who moved to new lands were very bored about it. </p><p>  And then there is a famous man in Oregon with that name.  Foster Huntington in the vicinity of Portland built two wonderful houses, not on land, but on trees.  So in childhood, almost all children build huts from branches or booths from cardboard boxes.  And everyone probably dreamed about a house hanging high in the branches of a tree.  Foster Huntington embodied this dream.  And he lives with his friends in the trees, and looks at such a close starry sky at night. </p>

    <h2>  Thor well </h2><p>  This natural attraction on the Pacific coast is known not only to the entire state of Oregon.  Few people in the world have heard of Cape Perpetua, where ancient volcanic activity created such a heap of granite blocks that a well - this huge natural funnel, a hollow among sharp rocks - is completely invisible.  For local Indians, this place was called, which in meaning corresponds to our expression "the gates of the underworld." </p><p>  Only at low tide you can get close to the well, but there is not enough time to consider it well, because the tide begins, and hell itself opens at this place.  After a few minutes, everything around is transformed.  Ocean waves roll with a monstrous roar on the rocks surrounding the well, and form an enchanting waterfall.  Water covers the well in huge thickness.  But the well never overflows, it is bottomless!  Or connects to the ocean underground.  But the waves beat everything, measured and tireless.  And finally, the well answers.  A powerful water column erupts from its depths, scattering by a kilometer, and everyone who saw it takes away with them a feeling of primitive horror. </p>

    <h2>  Cannon Beach </h2><p>  This amazing beach in Oregon is the most popular and most famous, moreover, there are few like it on the Pacific coast.  For a whole kilometer stretched a narrow strip of the finest, soft as fluff, snow-white sand, surrounded by exclusively picturesque exotic plants.  Not only the coast is unique here.  The underwater world is very rich, even diving enthusiasts in the Red Sea, coming here, are surprised.  In these places snorkeling is more popular - diving with a snorkel and a mask, but diving is also widely represented. </p><p>  It is almost always crowded here, but, despite this, it is cozy and clean.  The sunsets are just extraordinary, people are going to admire the crowds as the sun goes into the Pacific Ocean, coloring and illuminating its waters as if from the inside.  And next to this beach is a huge Cape Haystack Rock with long and branched caves.  Cavers love to be here.  Climbing enthusiasts climb to the very top of the cape to view a stunning panorama: the beach, exotic forest and the infinity of the ocean. </p>

    <h2>  Maar </h2><p>  <em>Maar</em> is a crater, and Hole-in-Ground is one of the most notable Maars on our planet.  It is like a hole in the surface of the earth remaining after the destruction of the aerial part of the ridge, which happens after a strong earthquake or as a result of volcanic activity.  Hole-in-Ground is simply amazing in size and with spectacular views.  Oregon is generally seismically riotous, no wonder that nature has left such amazing traces here.  The shape of the crater is round, very wide - more than one and a half kilometers, and a depth of one hundred and fifty meters, and with its appearance, the inner platform resembles alien scorched terrain. </p><p>  Scientists say that a crater formed about eighteen thousand years ago.  Since then there have been traces of a large lake stretching around this volcano, which disappeared during the Hole-in-Ground eruption.  Magma swam so close to the surface that from its heat the lake began to boil and went into the atmosphere in the form of steam.  And the crater itself filled the soil from the rising earth's crust, as if plugging it with a giant cork.  Magma accumulated, but there was not a single gap for its exit.  And then the volcano exploded.  Huge fragments of the mountain and now are scattered throughout the district. </p>

    <h2>  Multnomah Falls </h2><p>  The second largest waterfall in the country is Multnomah Falls, it is two-cascade and is almost constantly covered by a curtain of thick fog.  In rare moments when the fog disperses, it becomes clear how picturesque it is.  But even if such luck does not happen, it is still very interesting to walk along the pedestrian bridge, immerse yourself in this powerful rumble of a huge amount of water falling from a great height.  Fans of scenic views climb the nearest cliff and view the waterfall from a bird's flight. </p><p>  <span>Oregon State</span> is a place rich in museums, architecture, and a rich heritage of historical monuments of different years.  But the most interesting thing here is nature.  There are very few corners on Earth where such a large number of climatic zones converge and where there are so many amazing signs of distant geological eras. </p>
