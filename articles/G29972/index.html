This also applies to LCD monitors.  Often they break due to failure of the backlight.  But there is a way out of this situation, so do not throw out such a technique.  To resume its work, alteration of the monitor backlight to an LED is enough. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  When searching for the right parts, you may come across the fact that there will be no fluorescent lamps on sale.  And replacing the backlight of the monitor with an LED alone will not be difficult.  Often use LED strip. </p><h2>  Damage rating </h2><p>  Before you start mounting the tape in the display, you need to evaluate the degree of breakdown.  To identify this, you need to know some subtleties.  The failure of light bulbs in the backlight may be due to the following reasons. </p><p>  Firstly, an initial production defect is possible. </p><p>  Secondly, the lamps could be damaged when the device falls or from hitting it with something. </p><p>  Thirdly, sometimes short circuits occur in the metal part of the lamp. </p><p>  Fourth, the lamps could simply fail, having worked out the time they set.  Simply put, they could burn out. </p><p>  When spinning up the display, it is easy to determine the presence of malfunctions and establish the causes that led to the breakdown. </p><p>  To qualitatively replace the lighting of the display, you need to understand the principles by which the liquid crystal matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãintegrated in all types of modern devices with screens. </p><h2>  LCD Matrix Principles </h2><p>  In every modern monitor, LCD matrices work in accordance with the principle of clearance.  That is, the device operates lighting, the bulbs of which shine through the entire matrix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But keep in mind that the quality of the display is directly dependent on the type of lighting. </p><p>  In televisions and stationary monitors at this point in time, direct-lighting is often used.  That is, the <span>LED lamp</span> is located on the entire surface of the panel. </p><p>  To illuminate the matrix, 2 blocks are used.  Each unit includes two lamps.  They are located at the top and bottom of the display.  As a result, placing them in this way creates uniform illumination of the entire matrix. </p><p>  This arrangement leads to the fact that the lighting works even when any lamp breaks.  Inverters are responsible for the power of these bulbs. </p><p>  As soon as any of the bulbs breaks and stops working, the inverter notes that the lighting has become uneven.  Therefore, he stops working.  This function is built into it to avoid further problems in the backlight.  So often the inverter provokes a situation when, after the breakdown of one of the 4 bulbs, the backlight lasts for some more time. </p><p>  After mastering this information, you can proceed directly to the process of installing a new backlight. </p><h2>  Process </h2><p>  For the proper installation of <span>LED backlight</span> for the monitor, you will need to follow a number of rules.  It is important to do everything in a clearly established order.  So, first of all, you need to establish whether the backlight actually broke, since it is not alone that is responsible for supplying light.  This can be easily understood by disassembling the display. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dwmallisk.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="replacing monitor backlight with LED" class="if uuid-2813913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2813913.jpg"></div><p>  Often a breakdown of this nature is found in TV monitors, computers.  The screen may turn on and then turn off again after a short time.  Before remaking the monitor on the LED backlight, it is necessary to disassemble it first.  This is <span>not</span> at <span>all difficult to do.</span>  The process is the same for a variety of display models, and when installing the LED backlight in the LD 22 monitor and other similar displays, you can use the same instructions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Disassembly </h2><p>  It is not particularly difficult to describe this procedure in detail, however, each type of equipment has a number of features, monitors and sizes differ, and manufacturers assemble them differently.  But in the procedure the same steps are always present, there is only variability at some points.  Therefore, the general points can be simply described. </p><p>  First of all, they remove the stand by unscrewing the screws holding it, together with the other fasteners of the case. </p><p>  Any device has a special groove designed to open the latches by prying the lid with flat objects.  It is located at the end.  When disassembling the monitor for the first time, it should be borne in mind that the latches will be pressed tightly, but subsequently it will be easier and easier to deal with them. </p><p>  After that, the metal frame is removed.  For this purpose, the latches are pushed back or screws are removed from the housing.  For people who have already replaced the monitor's backlight with an LED strip or replaced parts on such devices, the procedure will seem very simple.  After this process, disconnect the wires from the circuit board. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdn.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="conversion of monitor backlight to LED" class="if uuid-2810190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2810190.jpg"></div><p>  Then go to the matrix, access to which is currently open.  It has a lot of connecting cables, which are very fragile.  Therefore, you should exercise extreme caution when working with it.  The best solution would be to lay the matrix to the side and cover it with a cloth so as not to accidentally hurt, damage and prevent dust from accumulating on it.  If the work was done correctly, access to the inverter, electronic circuit board and lamp will open.  Working with them is now easy.  If a person decided to tackle the conversion of lamp backlight to LED in the monitor, he needs to keep in mind how all the removable parts were located in it.  They are difficult to confuse, but beginners should consider the possible risks of confusing their location. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="cdn.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED backlight monitor screen" class="if uuid-2810192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2810192.jpg"></div><p>  The next step in altering the monitor backlight to LED is to disconnect each lamp from the matrix.  After removing the grooves from it, you can pull out the sources of the current backlight and get rid of them.  Those who have not yet installed the LED backlight on the monitor screen need to remember that mercury is contained in CCFL lamps.  For this reason, you should be vigilant and always exercise caution when working with them. </p><p>  At the next stage, the alteration of the lamp backlight to LED in the monitor directly replaces the light source. </p><h2>  Own backlight </h2><p>  It is important to remember that the LED strip is chosen for this procedure.  It is best for these purposes to take a set of LED backlight for a monitor with the already taken size of the lamps or choose the one whose length will be slightly larger.  So, in 1 meter it should be at least 120 light bulbs.  In order for the conversion of the monitor backlight to LED to be effective, you need to choose colors that will not put pressure on your eyes.  Otherwise, there is a risk that a person will redo everything in the second round. </p><p>  Best of all, installing the LED backlight of the monitor with your own hands, give preference to white bulbs.  Perfectly fit tapes with crystals 3528 and 4115. Their dimensions should fit the seats in which the tapes will be installed.  Most often, the size is 7 mm.  The LED strip in the backlight monitor may contain a different number of lamps, its advantage is that in any case it will last longer than its predecessors.  After that, the tape is fixed using double-sided tape.  Place the LED strip instead of the monitor backlight in the same place where the previous lamps were. </p><p>  Usually these are small grooves.  Sometimes old wires from removed light sources are used to further connect them to power sources.  Before that, it is imperative to check whether the LED backlight has been correctly collected.  For this purpose, it is connected using wires to external power sources - batteries. </p><p>  In the next stage, the LED backlight of the monitor screen is connected to power.  The power board is always available on the displays of both computers and televisions.  In order for the replacement of the monitor backlight with LED to be effective, this moment should be paid more attention.  Those who have experience connecting low-voltage devices to a network with a voltage that exceeded the indicative standards, remember that in this case the equipment burns out.  This will happen because the resistance of the device is not designed for such a value.  You will need to find the 12 V conclusions on the board and solder the wires from the new lamps with them.  When connecting the LED backlight of the monitor, it is important to remember that polarity is observed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Backlight setting" class="if uuid-2813916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2813916.jpg"></div><p>  Having done this, you can proceed to the assembly of the TV or computer. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The LED strip installed instead of the monitor backlight lamps has one significant minus.  Since everything is connected directly, it is not possible to regulate and disconnect it.  Therefore, it is always on when the display turns on.  The LED backlight of the monitor matrix, connected with your own hands, will be too bright, eyes will get tired of it.  However, this problem is solved. </p><h2>  Create adjustment </h2><p>  After replacing the monitor backlight with LED, proceed to adjust the backlight.  To do this, they work with wires that were connected to the tapes to add them the ability to turn on and off when certain buttons are pressed.  There are two ways to create them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED backlight from video tutorial" class="if uuid-2810213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2810213.jpg"></div><p>  In accordance with the first, a circuit is assembled, by means of which the power and intensity of the lamps are adjusted.  To this end, do the following. </p><ol><li>  Take the plastic connector, which is located on the display power board.  It is not difficult to find it: it is from it that wires are drawn, each socket for which is signed. </li><li>  To enable on and off, use DIM sockets.  Adjust the brightness by changing the PWM controllers. </li><li>  After that, a field-effect transistor with channel N is taken. Then the negative wires from the LED strip are soldered to the Drain terminal of the field pole.  Connect the common wire from the LEDs to the input element Source.  The circuit provides for the use of a resistor with a nominal value of 100 to 2000 ohms.  It is through it that a Gate transistor is connected to any DIM socket. </li><li>  Then solder the wires with a "plus" from the LED backlight.  For this purpose, they are output to a 12 V power supply chip, then soldered. </li><li>  After performing all of the above steps, the backlight is installed in the fastening places, and then the display assembly is started in the reverse order.  Be sure to remember the gentle actions with the matrix, filters.  After this item, the display can be used. </li></ol><p>  The second method is the following procedure for using tapes with LED backlight inverters in monitors mounted in them.  Do it this way. </p><ol><li>  To connect the circuit of this method, again you need to find the plastic connector with a DIM socket and an on / of output.  This is most easily determined using pinouts. </li><li>  Using a multimeter, the sockets are called up from the control unit responsible for the display backlight.  From them comes the required DIM signal, as well as on / of. </li><li>  At the next stage, the wires from the LED inverters are soldered to the detected sockets.  To adjust the backlight using inverters, remove the wires that fed the previous lamps. </li><li>  Fix them where there is free space, using double-sided tape. </li><li>  To complete the alteration of the monitor backlight on the LED finally, check the new lighting in the case. </li></ol><p>  Using this method leads to good performance of new lamps.  Converting the LCD monitor to LED backlighting will please anyone with the fact that the equipment will work much longer. </p><h2>  Replacement Reasons </h2><p>  At the moment, <span>liquid crystal displays,</span> in which the backlight is mounted <span>,</span> have become very popular.  This technology has replaced the obsolete models, which were of worse quality.  However, even with high quality, such devices are sometimes equipped with backlight with obsolete format lamps.  They never differed in long service life, often failed.  It is because of this that lighting often breaks down in modern technology.  This is not a very serious trouble, and not in all cases you need to contact a specialist.  Reducing the backlight of the monitor to the LED helps. </p><h2>  Why LEDs? </h2><p>  Although at the moment there are a great many manufacturers of displays, all the equipment has approximately the same principle of operation.  Therefore, it is very convenient to produce and replace the monitor lamps with LED backlight.  It doesn't matter which manufacturer the device is.  If even when following the instructions the desired part was not found at the indicated place, then it is in any case hidden nearby.  Having looked closely, it will be easy to find. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buyledstrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED strip" class="if uuid-2810216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2810216.jpg"></div><p>  LEDs are a modern and advanced light source.  Most often use LED strip.  When it is necessary to repair the monitor, the LED backlight is selected for the following reasons. </p><p>  Firstly, she serves for a long time.  If you connect it correctly, then it is able to work without compromising quality for as long as 10 years.  No other bulbs used for the same purpose can boast of such a characteristic.  They fail significantly earlier than this period. </p><p>  Secondly, it is very convenient that the tapes are made on a self-adhesive basis.  Therefore, mounting is carried out without any difficulty on any surface, including the rear wall of the display. </p><p>  Thirdly, LED bulbs have a bright luminous flux.  They illuminate the screen quite intensely.  If you take into account a number of recommendations, then after altering the LCD monitor to the LED backlight, your eyes will almost never get tired with prolonged contact with the display. </p><p>  Fourth, you can choose any lighting to your taste. </p><p>  It is necessary to pay attention to one moment.  Although the choice of tapes by type of lighting is always very large - a wide range of them is presented on the shelves, it is best to give preference to calm, pastel shades.  For example, a yellow or white ribbon would be the best choice.  Having chosen such colors, a person in the future will say to himself thanks for this.  It will be easier for the eyes to perceive information from the screen precisely with such light bulbs. </p><h2>  About tapes </h2><p>  Tapes with LEDs are sold in coils of 5 m each. This length is always enough to create an effective and high-quality display backlight. </p><p>  The product is very simple to connect to the device board.  It is enough to follow simple instructions. </p><p>  Also, tapes are characterized by low energy consumption, despite the fact that the power of the light source is quite large.  Most often, LEDs require a voltage of only 12-24 V. </p><p>  Diodes never get too hot during operation.  This is extremely important, since the overheating of the bulbs is the cause of the breakdown of the lamps of the structures built into the display. </p><p>  Old-style bulbs may break due to the fact that the device is often turned on or off.  But diodes are not afraid. </p><p>  LED strips are very resistant to all kinds of external influences.  It also contributes to their longevity.  Using them, you can be sure that the risks of damage to them are minimized. </p><p>  Thus, replacing an outdated or defective display illumination leads to many positive consequences.  However, before you make the backlight of the monitor on an LED strip, you should carefully read the instructions, and when performing the task, it is worth carefully following all the recommendations.  Then the new backlight will last a long time and will delight the owner. </p><h2>  Myths about LEDs </h2><p>  If you ask each user of equipment with monitors a question, would he replace the LCD with the same, but with LED backlight, in 90% of cases the answer would be yes.  However, most will not be able to explain why this will be better than traditional CCFL technologies.  In the best case, it will be retold by one of the myths widespread today, with which LED illumination has grown. </p><p>  However, there is no particular difficulty in understanding LED technology.  A little knowledge is enough, and myths about it will be debunked. </p><p>  Myth number 1: LED monitor is better than LCD. </p><p>  LED displays are a separate type of technology that is not related to conventional computer monitors.  So, they are informational, advertising monitors, which are mounted on the streets in cities.  On these monitors, visualization occurs with the use of LED lamps - both one and many, for this reason they are called so.  They are bright enough, but their resolution is low. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quest.media" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED monitor" class="if uuid-2810221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2810221.jpg"></div><p>  But LCD monitors of computers with LED backlighting are considered a completely separate phenomenon.  Pixels are formed in them still with the assistance of the matrix.        ,         .     . </p><p>     ,    .       .      CCFL-.   .        ,    .         . </p><p>  LED-     ,       . </p><p> Myth number 2: LED backlighting is the same everywhere as CCFL. </p><p>  There are a huge number of varieties of CCFL lamps.  They can affect critical device features.  So, if the phosphor is improved in them, the monitor has a wider color range. </p><p>  If we are talking about LEDs, the situation becomes more complicated.  The thing is that there are several main types of them.  Their characteristics are very different. </p><p>  The most important difference between the two is color.  So, there are two main ways to implement LED backlighting.  Firstly, a cheap and easy way is to get white lamps.  But for this you need to carefully select the brightness and shade of the glow. </p><p>  Secondly, there is a much more promising path.  There are tapes with color LEDs, and it is their particular combination that gives the result a white light.  Usually use RGB triads, but there are other options.  To form the colors of the pixels, all available matrix depths are used.  The display covers a wide range of colors, and color reproduction becomes more accurate.  Typically, these characteristics are very important in professional technology, where this knowledge is applied especially actively. </p><p>  However, the implementation of the second path leads to a lot of difficulties.  So, you need to carefully select the triad of diodes.  In addition, you need to learn to control the lighting so that when the brightness of the monitor changes, the white point remains in place. </p><p>  There is a difference in the design of the backlight units: they can be end and rear. </p><p>  Most LCD monitors use end-lighting.  The lamps are located at the ends of the panels.  Their radiation is redirected to the optical fibers.  The rays of light are refracted and sent to the LCD matrix, polarizer and diffusers.  The main advantage of such a device is that the display is thin.  But to ensure that the backlight is uniform in it is more difficult.  They use end LED-backlight with white LEDs. </p><p>  In the rear design, the use of groups of LED lamps is supposed.  When choosing this type of design, it becomes possible to control the brightness of the backlight by zone.  This is great for TVs.  But this way is applicable only in monitors with significant thickness. </p><p>  Myth number 3: LED backlighting has the best color gamut. </p><p>  From the very beginning, LED backlighting was used only in professional technology due to the special qualities of RGB.  It has a wide color gamut that exceeds standards.  But to use these properties in everyday life, such a backlight will be unreasonably expensive. </p><p>  White LEDs do not have the same color rendering.  They quite compete with ordinary CCFL.  The final characteristics of the color gamut depend on the characteristics of the matrix itself. </p><p>  Myth number 4: LED backlighting gives more uniformity. </p><p>  The unevenness in the panel can be triggered by the uneven emission of light sources, the features of the fiber, polarizer, matrix, violations in light transmission, and light filters.  Therefore, highlighting is not the only aspect of this issue. </p><p>  But a solution exists.  Monitor irregularities can be compensated for.  However, this is expensive.  The uniformity of displays with LED-backlight is not too different from the same characteristics for monitors with CCFL. </p><p>  Myth 5: LED backlight does not flicker, unlike CCFL. </p><p>  Any LCD monitor flickers despite the common misconception that this is not so.  The process just happens with such a frequency that it is not noticed. </p><p>  This trouble can not be solved.  Working with modern displays with a maximum level of brightness in daylight in the room is ruining your eyes. </p><p>  Although the range of variation of the brightness indicator for LEDs is wide, in theory it would be possible to control the brightness without using PWM.  It is he who causes the flicker. </p><p>  But in fact, this pleasure is not cheap, and it adds a number of technological difficulties, the solution of which will not be easy. </p><p>  Therefore, any display, even with LEDs, will flicker. </p><p>  Myth 6: LED backlighting is more economical than CCFL. </p><p>  It really is.  The statement is completely fair, such a glory of LEDs is well deserved by them.  When using a white backlight from LEDs, energy is consumed almost half as much as when using standard CCFLs.  So this myth is confirmed in practice. </p><p>  Myth 7: LED-backlit displays are greener than CCFL. </p><p>  It is known that ecology always suffers greatly during the production of equipment of the IT industry.  This has led to environmental standards everywhere.  They are carefully observed. </p><p>  But the situation is different with the recycling process.  So, everyone knows that ordinary light bulbs contain poisonous mercury.  But all were witnesses of how people threw them, often in a broken form, along with other garbage.  Subsequently, the garbage was burned, and the entire population of the country breathed in mercury vapor. </p><p>  CCF lamps also incorporate mercury.  But the LEDs of such a dangerous element are deprived.  Therefore, their use really affects the environment in a positive way.  The myth is also confirmed in practice. </p><p>  Myth 9: LED backlighting is more expensive than CCFL. </p><p>  Not so long ago, this statement was true.  RGB LED system was expensive.  The price tag on it is still high. </p><p>  But the situation is different with white LEDs.  The advent of these new types of light bulbs triggered a real marketing war between manufacturers of LEDs and traditional CCFLs.  Often the price of displays with LEDs is higher.  The thing is that these technologies are still very young, and consumers did not have time to get to know them so closely.  The excitement around them is quite large. </p><p>  Myth 10: LED backlighting has more contrast. </p><p>  This refers to dynamic contrast, since its static variety does not depend on light sources: it can be both CCFL and LED, the indicator will not change in any way. </p><p>  Dynamic contrast is a variable value.  It depends on the operation algorithms of the corresponding backlight settings, on the content that is displayed on the monitor.  But when using LED backlighting, the final result is also affected by the backlight with zone control - local dimming. </p><p>  When the image has both light and dark areas at the same moment, the contrast will correspond to static indicators.  But local dimming technologies dampen the backlight in the dark area, and in the light increase.  This leads to increased contrast. </p><p>  For local dimming to work correctly, you need separate blocks that will allow the management of individual groups of LEDs.  But this design is expensive. </p><p>  Regular white LEDs turn off and on very quickly, and this distinguishes them from CCFL. </p><p>  Therefore, in practice, the myth is confirmed.  But if we are talking about a computer monitor, then this indicator is not important to him.  More important is the static contrast. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  With the proper installation of LEDs in the monitor, you can achieve savings, improve the performance of your existing device.  Replacement is a fairly simple process.  The main thing is to follow the instructions carefully. </p>
