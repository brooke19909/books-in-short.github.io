    <p>  It is quite possible to make such balls of thread yourself at home.  This is a very interesting and fascinating activity, in which your children will take part with great pleasure.  In this article, you are invited to a master class "How to make a ball of thread."  To work on the manufacture of a spider ball, we need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  a balloon of the size you need; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  glue in a plastic bottle (clerical, PVA, starch-based paste); </li><li>  petroleum jelly or any oily cream; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  long needle or awl. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ball of thread and glue" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/169244.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ul><h3>  Manufacturing instruction </h3><p>  In order to make a ball of thread and glue, perform the following steps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Inflate the balloon to the desired size and tie it tightly.  It is advisable to glue the tail with tape to the ball so that it does not interfere with winding the thread. </li><li>  Spread the ball with petroleum jelly or glue.  The meaning of this procedure is that in the future, after drying, the rubber ball is easily separated from the ball of thread. </li><li>  Make a through hole in the bottle with glue with a needle or awl.  It is important that it is slightly wider in diameter than the thickness of the thread that the ball will wrap around.  If the hole is made narrow, the thread will pass with difficulty, the glue from it will self-clean and remain in the bottle.  The thread will remain almost dry and will not stick to the ball. </li><li>  Insert the tip of the thread into the needle and insert it through the holes in the glue bottle.  Remove the needle, and begin to wind the thread moistened with glue around the ball.  It is necessary to ensure that the thread is well lubricated with glue.  Balls are made of threads according to the principle of winding the ball - evenly over the entire surface of the balloon.  Do not spare the glue and thread.  If you wrap a little, then the ball-cobweb may no longer hold its shape and break.  After a sufficient amount of thread is wound, it should be cut off and the tip glued to the base of the ball. </li><li>  Hang the ball to dry.  Do not rush to blow out the balloon.  The product should dry well.  This may take several days. </li><li>  After the ball of thread has dried well and has become hard, carefully blow the balloon out.  To do this, gently pierce it with a needle.  If the rubber in some places stuck to the threads, then you can peel it off using a pencil with an eraser on the tip.  This procedure should be done with careful movements so as not to damage the product.  When the balloon is lowered and completely peeled off, you need to pull it out.  During these manipulations, the threads can move in the place where the ball is pulled.  Then they should simply be moved to their place. </li><li>  Decorate the ball to your liking. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a ball of thread" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/169246.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  After reading this article, you yourself were convinced that making <span>balls from threads with your own hands is</span> easy and simple, and most importantly - very interesting.
