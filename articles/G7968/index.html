    <h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  The main components on which the performance of any smartphone depends are the central processor and graphics adapter.  It is their characteristics that determine the capabilities of the device.  As a CPU, this smartphone uses the time-tested MT6582.  It consists of four cores of the Cortex-A7 architecture, each of which can operate with a clock frequency from 0.3 GHz to 1.3 GHz (depending on the level of complexity of the task being solved).  This processor belongs to the middle segment of devices.  For most everyday tasks, its resources will be enough.  Starting from browsing the web and ending with complex 3D toys, he will pull them without any problems.  A similar situation with the graphics adapter in <span>Lenovo S860.</span>  <span>Testimonials</span> indicate that he has a normal, average level of performance.  This gadget has 400 MP2 from Mali.  The result is an excellent combination of a processor and a mid-range graphics adapter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance, housing and usability </h2>

Not quite the right decision of the developers, since on a device with a diagonal of 5.3 inches it is better to use tempered glass "Gorilla Eye."  It is more resistant to scratches.  Therefore, the owners of the S860 simply can not do without a special protective film, which can be purchased at an additional cost.  But the case is not satisfactory.  It is made of aluminum, and it is almost impossible to spoil it.

    <p>  The control system of the <span>Lenovo S860 is</span> well organized <span>.</span>  The photo in our article confirms this.  The volume swings are located in the upper right corner, and on the upper edge in the center there is a shutdown button.  At the bottom of the screen are three ‚Äústandard‚Äù control buttons: ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúGo to previous page‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  Such a constructive solution allows you to control the device with one hand with a minimum number of movements. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the S860 belongs to the class of phablets, that is, to devices with a diagonal of 5 or more inches.  In this case, we are talking about 5.3 inches.  The display is based on a high-quality IPS matrix with a resolution of 1280 pixels in length and 720 pixels in width.  The image is high-quality, rich color reproduction.  It is almost impossible to distinguish a single pixel.  Supports processing of up to five touches to the surface of the sensor at the same time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras: what are they capable of </h2><p>  Like most similar devices, two cameras are installed in the Lenovo S860.  The reviews of the owners of the device indicate that the one located on the back allows you to receive photos and videos.  It is based on an 8 megapixel matrix.  It is also equipped with LED backlight for shooting at night, there is an automatic image stabilization system.  The maximum resolution of the photo received from it is 3248 x 2448 pixels, and the video, in turn, can be recorded in the format of 1280 x 720 pixels.  More modest parameters in the second camera.  Her matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã1.6 megapixels, and her main purpose is to make video calls. </p><h2>  Memory size </h2><p>  Different amounts of RAM can be installed on the Lenovo S860.  A review of existing offers on the Internet indicates two modifications of this device: 1 GB is present on one of them, and 2 GB is on the second.  So it is necessary to check with the seller before buying how much RAM is in this model.  By the way, the acquisition of the second modification is preferable. </p><p>  The situation with the built-in flash drive is simpler: 16 GB are installed in the S860, 1.2 GB of which are reserved by the operating system itself.  The rest of the internal memory is allocated to the user's needs.  If for some reason this is not enough, then you can always install an external drive with a maximum capacity of 32 GB. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What is in the box? </h2><p>  This smartphone model has standard equipment.  This is an entry-level device in which there is nothing superfluous.  <span>A warranty card</span> and an instruction manual are the complete list of documents that come with it.  In addition to them, the box also contains: </p><ul><li>  The device itself with a built-in battery. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  USB / micro-USB adapter cord.  Using it, the battery is charged or connected to a personal computer. </li><li>  OTG cable.  It allows you to connect various USB devices (for example, a flash drive) to your smartphone. </li><li>  Acoustic system entry level. </li></ul><p>  As noted earlier, the case and screen protector are not included in the package, so they will have to be purchased separately. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  A serious plus compared to competitors is the Lenovo S860 TITANIUM battery.  The feedback from the satisfied owners of this mobile device is another confirmation of this.  In this case, we are talking about a battery capacity of 4000 milliamps / hours.  Its resource is enough for 2 hours of active use (making calls, listening to music, watching movies and surfing the Internet).  For a device with a diagonal of 5.3 inches, this is an excellent result.  But here one nuance should be noted.  Not the last role in all this is played by the work of Chinese programmers.  Most likely, they optimized the code so that the battery life is used to a minimum.  Hence the figure of 48 hours of battery life. </p>

    <h2>  Software part </h2><p>  The version of Android with the serial number 4.2.2 for Lenovo S860 was originally installed.  The firmware is updated after the first Internet connection to one of the latest versions 4.4.2.  This happens automatically, and the user should not be involved.  Also preinstalled quite a rich set of applications.  To protect against viruses, the SECUREit program is used.  Two serious and demanding toys were immediately installed: one of them was the seventh revision of Asphalt, a first-class <span>racing simulator,</span> and the second - Real Football of 2014.  By name, it‚Äôs clear that this is a football simulator.  Toys allow you to immediately verify the computing capabilities of the device in the store. </p><p>  Another important utility that is initially in the software part of the gadget is Evernot.  Using it, you can exchange messages via SMS.  Among social applications, Twitter and Facebook are installed.  But their domestic counterparts will have to be installed from the market. </p><p>  There is also a ‚ÄúKingsoft office‚Äù package that allows you to work with office documents on this smartphone. </p><p>  Another important application is Skype, which allows you to make video calls when connected to the global web. </p><h2>  Connectivity options </h2><p>  A fairly rich set of communications in the Lenovo S860.  Specifications <strong> </strong>  in this regard, he has the following: </p><ul><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo s860 photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/555688.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main way to connect to the Internet is Wi-Fi.  It allows you to transfer data at speeds up to 150 Mbps.  You can easily and easily download files of any size.  Its only drawback is its small range. </li><li>  An additional way to connect to the Internet is through a GSM network.  The device is capable of working both in 2G and 3G.  The maximum speed in the presence of appropriate coverage can be 21 Mbit / s.  If the device will work in second-generation networks, then the maximum that can be obtained in them is several hundred kilobytes. </li><li>  To exchange information with similar smartphones, it is best to use Bluetooth.  This device has a transmitter version 3.0 installed.  Of course, not the latest version 4.0, but still with most devices it can easily and simply work. </li><li>  A GPS transmitter is installed for navigation.  To fully reveal its functionality, the smartphone has a special application ‚ÄúNavi‚Äù with a set of maps. </li><li>  The easiest way to connect to a PC is to use a micro-USB cable.  The required cable is standard.  In this case, three operating modes are possible at once.  The first one is like a regular flash drive.  The second is in webcam mode.  And the last, third - setup mode. </li></ul><p>  Among the shortcomings can be highlighted the lack of infrared port and the inability to work in the domestic analogue of the GLONASS GPS navigation system.  But that's okay with that.  The absence of the first one is compensated by Bluetooth.  And without GLONASS, you can do just one GPS. </p><h2>  Results and reviews </h2>

The reviews of the happy owners of this gadget are another confirmation of this.  It has virtually no weaknesses and weaknesses.  Everything necessary for work and entertainment on it is and works perfectly.  At the same time, the diagonal of 5.3 inches provides a comfortable environment for solving any problem Lenovo S860.
