    <p>  And today, there are countless money transfer services.  They differ in the size of the commission for conducting a transaction, in the speed of transfer, in reliability, in geographical coverage and in many other ways. </p><p>  Each has its own positive and negative sides.  And they exist and are popular in different ways: one can find one-day services, or real centenarians.  One of them is the Hummingbird money transfer.  Sberbank provides it.  Judging by the reviews, he undoubtedly deserves attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia hummingbird transfer" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/1601737.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is instant and fairly inexpensive.  I came to the bank branch, filled out a simple form - and you're done.  You can transfer the smallest amount, but you can also larger.  The commission is very low, it can‚Äôt afford. </li><li>  You can send funds to neighboring countries, it is possible in Russia.  The recipient only needs to inform the transfer number or security question. </li><li>  Compared to the risk of transfer using bank cards, Sberbank's Hummingbird money transfer is reliable and fast. </li></ul><p>  This is only a small fraction of customer reviews, but this is enough to see all the positive aspects of this method of transferring money. </p><p>  Of course, there are also responses with a negative connotation, but all of them relate to the absence of a branch of PJSC Sberbank in certain territories, the operating hours of some branches and other organizational issues.  These reviews have no relation to the translation of Hummingbirds.  And this is a completely different story. </p><h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2>

    <p>  The availability of such a service as the transfer of Hummingbirds through Sberbank to the majority of the population of our country is due to the geographical distribution of the network of branch offices.  They are in almost every corner of the country.  Therefore, without any problems allows you to make a transfer of "Hummingbird" Sberbank.  How to receive the money?  Easy!  Within 10 minutes after departure, the <span>funds</span> are available to the recipient at any office of Sberbank, to receive you need to have only a passport with you.  And in an hour, money can be received abroad.  Employees of Sberbank offices in Belarus and Kazakhstan will be happy to help you process or pay for the transfer. </p><p>  Previously, the service was available to residents of Ukraine.  But, unfortunately, due to the current political situation in the country, according to the Decree of the President of Ukraine, Sberbank has not yet made a transfer of Hummingbirds. </p><h2>  Registration fees </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the fee for the transfer of Hummingbirds from Sberbank is quite loyal, it makes up only 1.5% of the amount sent.  The minimum and maximum thresholds of the commission fee are also envisaged - 150 and 1000 rubles, respectively. </p><p>  An additional part of the commission is paid by the recipient in the case of an international transfer. </p><p>  And even if the sender decided to return the already sent transfer back, he will receive it minus the commission that he paid during the transfer, and he will also have to pay a penalty to the bank in the amount of 150 rubles. </p><h2>  What documents are needed for registration </h2><p>  The minimum set of documents is another undoubted advantage of such a service as a hummingbird transfer. Sberbank does not oblige you to open accounts, e-wallets, cards, etc.  No need to store a lot of information in your head.  All that should be with you is your passport! </p><h2>  How to make and receive a transfer? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money transfer hummingbird sberbank" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/1601734.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In order to make the treasured translation, you need to know only the surname, name and patronymic of the recipient.  Here you need to be careful, the data must fully correspond to what is written in the passport.  Danger lurks, for example, in the pairs "II", "E-E", "b-b" and so on.  Remember that Sberbank may not translate Hummingbirds if a spelling error is detected. </p><p>  In exchange for this data, the sender is issued a receipt in which the transfer code is indicated.  The recipient is left to come to the Sberbank branch with a passport, name the code received from the sender, and you're done! </p><p>  Thus, a minimum of time and effort is required if Sberbank makes an internal Russian or international transfer of Hummingbird.  How to get the transfer amount?  Upon presentation of a passport at any office of the bank, money will be easily issued to the recipient 10 minutes after departure in Russia and an hour after departure from abroad. </p><h2>  Additional money transfer protection </h2>

    <p>  At the discretion of the sender, the transfer may be endowed with additional protection.  Suppose you can add a code question and answer to the translation.  Data that only translation participants know.  You can also connect informing participants about the status of the transfer by sending SMS messages.  All of these services are free.  They will only add confidence, because be that as it may, money should still be taken seriously. </p><p>  It‚Äôs so easy, with only one passport, you can send money to the other end of the country without worrying about security (service checked) and delivery time.  All this is possible due to the fact that Sberbank of Russia works for us.  Hummingbird translation is a modern, high-quality service that allows you to send money to people who urgently need them.  Yes, our ancestors clearly could not even imagine such a thing.  The 21st century, the century of high technology does not cease to amaze us! </p>
