The reason is simple - a pleasant climate, amazing reefs, excursions to the desert and ancient sights, nice people and a high level of relaxation at low cost.  The quality of rest to a large extent depends on the number of services and entertainment in the chosen place. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  For many tourists, especially those with children who have chosen Egypt as their vacation destination, one of the criteria where to stay is the distance from the beach.  Just 200 meters from the Red Sea coast, travelers are greeted by a cozy three-story building - the Baron Resort Hotel.  Sharm el-Sheikh is surrounded by greenery, which makes his hotels look like oases in the desert. </p><p>  Its opening took place in 1998, in 2007 he received gold for quality service, and in 2010 a complete reconstruction was made, which allows him to continue to be in the "Top 100 best hotels in the world." </p>

    <p>  Located just 8 km from the airport of a city such as Sharm El Sheikh, the Baron Resort 5 * Hotel is located on the Ras Nazran Bay, where guests will find Egypt's most beautiful coral reefs.  It is near him - a real living coral world, which tourists from other resort areas of the country are taken to see for money, and his guests see it every day for free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a desert behind the hotel, so you can take a taxi outside to the Old City, which is 20 km away, or to the Naama Bay night entertainment zone (15 km). </p><h2>  Ras Nazran Bay </h2><p>  All divers in the world know about the <span>coral reef</span> in this bay.  Almost 50% of the profits for hotels located on its territory are brought precisely by scuba diving enthusiasts.  The Baron, a hotel in Sharm El Sheikh, is their favorite vacation spot. </p><p>  There are no special attractions in Ras Nazran Bay, but it has a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other bays in Egypt.  The wind is constantly blowing here: in summer it is refreshing and light, and in winter it causes a storm.  This feature attracts couples with children here.  Due to the milder climate without the sweltering heat, most of the tourists in autumn and spring come to the Baron Resort Hotel. </p><p>  Sharm el Sheikh is proud of its living corals in the immediate vicinity of the institution.  They will appeal not only to divers, but also to fans of snorkeling.  Special skills for swimming in a mask with flippers will not be required, and the pleasure of multi-colored corals and their inhabitants will be amazing. </p><p>  In addition to reefs, the bay is known for beaches, on which even in winter the air temperature is +20 degrees. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The length of the beach will delight the most avid lovers of relaxation on the sea.  As much as 600 meters of pure white sand and a pontoon with a length of only 120 m, leading to a depth.  They use the Baron Resort and the Baron Palm Resort boutique hotel (Sharm el Sheikh), which are located side by side with each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Without leaving the beach, you can drink refreshments and a snack so as not to waste time returning to the hotel for lunch. </p><p>  Those who do not want to use the pier should purchase special shoes in the nearest store so as not to injure their legs on the coral.

    <p>  The Baron Resort Hotel (Sharm El Sheikh), rated by hotel experts and tourists in 2015 to be 4.8 out of 5, is a great place for those who wish to spend as much time as possible while immersed to the bottom of the sea, and not spend it on the road to coral reefs. </p><h2>  Cute little things </h2><p>  On each trip, tourists are best remembered for minor minor services that are not included in the price of the trip.  According to reviews upon arrival at the Baron (a 5-star hotel in Sharm el-Sheikh), all visitors are given a refreshing cold hibiscus, and women are given a necklace of flowers on their necks.  The whole ritual of the meeting is accompanied by musicians with tambourines and drums. </p><p>  The same cute sign of attention, uplifting, are beautiful or funny figures on the bed.  Reviews mark the daily care of hotel staff creating these little things.  Thanks to this, customers come back here again and again. </p>
