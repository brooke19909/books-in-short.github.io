Someone sews an accessory for household needs, someone - a handbag for every day or an exclusive evening option.  If such an idea has visited you, then let's figure out together which bag you can sew with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.happyokapi.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY bags" class="if uuid-2448867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448867.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself handbags, the photos of which are presented above, are so versatile, thanks to their coloring and simple models, that any woman would not refuse such an addition to her image. </p><h2>  Patchwork art </h2><p>  There is a universal solution - to sew a bag with your own hands, which will suit different looks and outfits.  Therefore, we will start with the patchwork (translated from English - work from shreds, patches, patchwork).  This is perhaps the most interesting and unsurpassed option for creativity.  If you touch on the professional side of the patchwork technique, then everything is important: the choice of fabrics, the color scheme (picking it is a special talent), cutting parts, combining them into blocks, a set of special tools and devices for precise, high-quality cutting.  It is impossible to imagine a patchwork without quilting - curly lines that are akin to professionals like painting for artists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork bag" class="if uuid-2448997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448997.jpg"></div><p>  Beginners in this direction can be advised to pay special attention to the choice of fabric, it is better to combine materials of the same composition.  Another important detail: very precise cutting of parts and allowances.  It is advisable to use decorative stitches, albeit the simplest, but from this the result will look many times more attractive and professional.  Of course, the first bag made in this sophisticated technique will not be perfect, but the originality and originality are ensured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork and quilt" class="if uuid-2453256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2453256.jpg"></div><p>  The patchwork is surprisingly diverse, combined with quilting and different types of applications - this is real art.  Not without reason in Europe there are patchwork museums where real masterpieces are stored, priceless in the literal and figurative sense of the word. </p><h2>  Man Made Miracles </h2><p>  To sew a primitive bag for going to the grocery store, a basic level in the ability to use a sewing machine is enough.  But such a simple thing can be made special.  Sewing the bags with your own hands will not be difficult: an elementary pattern like a bag, similar to the lining, both parts are connected from the wrong side, turned out, and after smoothing the seams, the handles are sewn.  And now the most important part is the decor of the bag. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric bag with volumetric application" class="if uuid-2448916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448916.jpg"></div><p>  The application was mentioned above, this is the most fascinating stage, because you can make a bag truly your own, special, having shown imagination and even humor.  Bag for grandmother with a picture of her beloved cat?  You are welcome! </p><h2>  Denim bags are always relevant. </h2><p>  There are many options for making jeans bags with your own hands.  Someone suggests simply trimming the top of the jeans, tightly stitching the bottom of the bag and attach handles made of leather, belt or the rest of the leg.  The photo below shows a wonderful bag made exclusively from jeans belts, in combination with labels, buttons and buttons specific to jeans, it looks amazing.  To make a solid <span>bag of jeans with your own hands, a pattern</span> is not necessary at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jeans bag" class="if uuid-2448966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448966.jpg"></div><p>  A variety of bags, backpacks, clutches of jeans is simply surprising.  By the way, if you want to get a similar denim accessory, then buying it in a store or on the market will be quite problematic: the choice is limited or completely absent.  Therefore, sewing bags with your own hands is the most correct option in this case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jeans bag" class="if uuid-2448893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448893.jpg"></div><p>  As for, for example, a denim clutch, such a thing can only be found on sites where craftsmen post their work.  The cost of handmade items is quite high, so we suggest trying to create your own designer exclusive on your own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jeans clutch" class="if uuid-2448894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448894.jpg"></div><p>  A denim clutch can be sewn using a patchwork technique without even processing the edges of the product.  Or carve out an even rectangle from the legs, strengthen the "structure" with a dense filler and focus on the finish.  Denim flowers are simple to manufacture and go well with lace, metal details, and wooden elements. </p><h2>  You can also sew from leather </h2><p>  Sewing bags with your own hands is not the most difficult task, but this statement is true only if it is not about the skin.  This material is very difficult to work, its big plus is that there is no need to process the edges of the products.  A fairly simple pattern and a basic set of tools.  Depending on the type of leather, the accessory is sewn manually or on a sewing machine.  Manual sewing is more complicated, but there is an opinion that the result will be better.  Surely everyone has a leather jacket or jacket that they can no longer wear, but you can give them a ‚Äúsecond life‚Äù by embodying their design ideas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather bag" class="if uuid-2448923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448923.jpg"></div><p>  Having cut out all the elements of a leather bag, it is "assembled" in parts, connecting them in a certain sequence.  When sewing leather bags with your own hands, it is also worth considering that the lining is not always used in such products.  For a long time, the art of working with leather was mainly a male occupation, because the sewing process itself (especially if the leather is rough manufacture) may require physical effort. </p><h2>  Japanese knot </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsystudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knot bag" class="if uuid-2465302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2465302.jpg"></div><p>  Get to know a very interesting bag model.  This bag is called a "Japanese knot".  Why is it worth paying attention to such an accessory?  The wise inhabitants of the East know a lot about everything.  Due to the features of the pattern of this bag excluded the option of theft of its contents.  Probably, in the eastern bazaars, this characteristic for the bag was one of the most relevant.  Times are changing, and the convenience of such a thing is invariable.  A bag-knot will very help out those who, going to a restaurant or similar institution, do not plan to take anything with them except a mobile phone and wallet.  A miniature comfortable handbag with a handle around the wrist will help out any fashionista and come to the rescue when another model is inappropriate due to its bulkiness.  A truly universal thing!  Although a good option would be to sew such a large bag for carrying on your shoulder - it‚Äôs beautiful and comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thechillydog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bag" class="if uuid-2465325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2465325.jpg"></div><p>  To sew it, you will need a pattern that you can draw yourself, taking into account the wishes in width, depth, shape.  A slightly different option is possible than in the photo above: if you sew a bag with a round bottom, then the bottom of such a pattern will not be rounded, but rectangular.  In this case, it is worth considering the circumference of the bottom.  Front parts are sewn with the lining details, turned out and connected to each other or to the bottom, depending on the model chosen.  It is worth paying attention to the decor of the handle, because it is this part of the product that will be constantly on the wrist, and therefore in full view. </p><h2>  Nowhere is less </h2><p>  For lovers of minimalism and super original things, there is another idea: a purse bag that is worn on the wrist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.littlegatepublishing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet bag" class="if uuid-2465524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2465524.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing such an accessory is quite simple, it is done on the basis of a rectangle using the sizes of the girth of the wrist.  But there is a simpler way - to make such a handbag on the basis of a denim or any other cuff, which is separated from the sleeve, sewn in with a zipper and, if desired, add decorative elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wrist bag" class="if uuid-2465600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2465600.jpg"></div><p>  A plastic card, keys, money, headphones - all this can be taken with you, thanks to this wonderful invention.  There are many models of such handbags - they are surprisingly stylish, striking with ingenuity and simplicity. </p><h2>  Felt bags </h2><p>  Felt bags are a whole world.  This also includes felt products and bags created by felting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globalfashionreport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt bag" class="if uuid-2448983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2448983.jpg"></div><p>  A variety of colors, shapes, patterns - this is what distinguishes such things.  It is easier to work with felt than to sew from fabric or leather.  An applique or felt decor is a special pleasure for a craftsman.  If you do not know where to start your creative ‚Äúcareer‚Äù in making bags with your own hands, start with felt or felt!  This is a very fertile ground for creativity in terms of tailoring and product design. </p>
