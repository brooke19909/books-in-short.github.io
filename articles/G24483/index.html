You should not think about buying a new 6 model when you have the previous one in your hands, since the predecessor in some moments surpasses the follower.  The only significant difference is the smaller screen.  The heir display is quite voluminous.  For fans of the iPhone 5s and 6, comparison is an important task that most users do, being confused about <span>choosing a phone.</span>  Many people hate this device for its enlarged screen, as well as the design of the case.  I want to say that in the "iPhone 5s" the case is presented in beautiful color.  The same can be said about design.  The camera in both communicators is excellent, the quality of the photos is excellent. </p><h2>  Significant differences </h2>

If we consider two options, that is, 5s and 6, it is worth noting that each of the devices has a number of positive functions.  Even the packaging of the two devices has some differences.  Box for "iPhone 6" has become a little enlarged.  The new packaging design did not appeal to many.  The white box looks rather unusual, on the one hand, on the other, as some users have noted, all this is too simple.  Headphones are in a plastic case.  The battery capacity can be called slightly increased.

The case materials in both the communicator remained the same.  For example, a new model in life looks much better than in photographs.  If we talk about the dimensions of the device, the "beginner" weighs a little more than its predecessor.  In principle, fans of the iPhone 5s and 6 communicators make comparisons always and everywhere, since many users are faced with the <span>problem of choosing a</span> device.  The buyer wants to get the best quality device at the best price.  Men prefer to buy "iPhone 6", as it fits comfortably in the hand, and is also understandable in the interface.

It is very important to consult with a specialist.  Considering the design of a novice phone, it is worth highlighting the presence of an additional microphone, as well as the camera‚Äôs eye.  The lens sticks out a little, so this moment is considered to be in some way a flaw in the design of the phone.  In general, iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s are identical devices that every second mobile user in our country prefers to buy today.

Contrast was added in the sixth model, <span>quality indicators</span> also increased markedly.  The perception of the picture has noticeably improved.  The behavior of the device in the sun has become ideal.  The thing is that this phone is equipped with a new backlight adjustment function.  The amount of RAM here is 1 GB.  If we talk about one of the most powerful iOS devices, it is worth noting that it was model 6 that should be attributed to this category.

    <h2>  IPhone 5s and 6 Communicators: Feature Comparison </h2><p>  I would like to add a few words regarding the technical characteristics of both devices.  If we talk about the slot for a SIM card, in this phone of the brand "iPhone 6" it is one.  The height of the new device is 138 mm, although the same indicator for the predecessor is 128 mm.  The width of the devices is also noticeably different, since the size of the iPhone 6 is 67 mm, compared to 58 for the previous generation. The weight of these phones also varies.  "IPhone 6" is estimated at 129 g, and his colleague - at 112. The new device has a battery with a capacity of 1810 mAh.  The kit for this equipment includes charging, as well as <span>a power adapter.</span>  This is not to say that the gadget uses a fairly high output current power.  It takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes to charge a new phone.  If we talk about charging up to one hundred percent, this indicator can almost double.  The camera in one and the other device is built on an 8-megapixel sensor.  If we talk about the composition of the new lens, it includes five lenses of better quality.  The facial recognition system in iPhone 6 has become more efficient.  If we talk about the main characteristics of these devices, it is worth noting that both of them are the best mobile devices of their kind.  Thus, we examined iPhone 5s and 6 in detail, comparing them may be useful for you.  And in conclusion, a couple of important words about the new product.  The iPhone 6 communicator received the iOS 8 operating system. Speaking of software, separate built-in applications were also updated, for example, Mail now uses two columns in the case of horizontal display orientation. </p>
