Everyone can cope with it without any problems and without involving outside help.  It is the solution to this issue that the article will be devoted to.  General recommendations will also be given when choosing such a device.  In addition to this, the software of such multimedia systems will be briefly reviewed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Channel setup on your Philips TV" class="if uuid-2971065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2971065.jpg"></div><h2>  Selection recommendations </h2><p>  Modern TVs are quite complex devices.  They are able to receive not only broadcasts, but also cable along with satellite.  That is, the presence of a universal tuner is a prerequisite for the purchase of such a device.  Also, its communication kit should include ports such as HDMI, SCART, VGA, RCA, USB and 3.5 mm audio jacks.  This will allow you to connect any additional device to it. </p><p>  Separately, it should also be noted that moment that the picture quality should not be lower than FullHD.  Of course, on the shelves you can find devices with an HD matrix, but they are currently outdated. </p><p>  In addition, modern requirements for such systems indicate that they must operate under the control of a special operating system.  This allows you to significantly expand their capabilities.  It is based on the previously stated recommendations that you need to choose a new TV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hdtelevizija.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Setting up digital channels on your Philips TV" class="if uuid-2971067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2971067.jpg"></div><h2>  Operating system.  Her nuances </h2><p>  The Philips TV set of any current modification must be carried out taking into account the system software installed on it.  Conventionally, all such devices can be divided into two large groups. </p><p>  One of them does not support the Smart TV function.  In this case, the device allows you to view only the channels.  The second group of televisions has a special operating system and due to this, support for such an option as Smart TV is fully realized.  Due to this, such household appliances turn into full-fledged multimedia entertainment systems.  Such system software allows you to install additional programs with which you can play various multimedia content.  Also, the software of such a system has a built-in browser.  Therefore, you can view various sites on the Internet. </p><p>  To date, there are three types of major operating systems for such devices - these are Tizen, WEB OS and Android.  Philips in its multimedia centers uses the latter.  Again, it is important to understand that smartphones use an extended version of this operating system, and on televisions - a "stripped down" one.  That is, some options in it at the software level are forcibly disabled.  For example, support for integrated cameras or instant messengers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hdtelevizija.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips TV. Reset" class="if uuid-2971066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2971066.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment.  Mounting.  Connection </h2><p>  The delivery list for this group of devices typically includes the following: </p><ol><li>  TV. </li><li>  A stand for him. </li><li>  Control panel with a set of batteries. </li><li>  User's manual. </li><li>  Set of various advertising booklets. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ol><p>  Setting up your Philips TV starts with assembling it.  At this point, the device is removed from the shipping box.  Next, you need to install a support on it for mounting on a horizontal surface or hanging hardware on a vertical wall.  After that, we install it in the place of future use. </p><p>  Then you need to summarize the communications and connect them.  At this point, the power cord connects to the system‚Äôs power socket at one end and the other at a power outlet.  A cable with a television signal is also connected to the ANT IN input.  If necessary, a twisted pair is supplied, and already with its help the multimedia center is connected to the Internet. </p><h2>  Software initialization </h2><p>  In the next step, adjusting the image of the Philips TV is reduced to setting the parameters of the operating system.  After turning on the device, a request window will be displayed in which its location, time and date are set.  If any of these parameters is incorrectly set, then some options may be disabled at the software level.  Also at this stage it is necessary to choose the most convenient interface language. </p><h2>  Channel search </h2><p>  Next, setting up digital channels on your Philips TV comes down to finding the available broadcasts.  To do this, go to the device settings menu.  Then select the sub-item ‚ÄúChannels‚Äù.  In the list that opens, select "Auto Search".  Next, the device will start the automatic search for television programs. </p><p>  Before that, you just need to set the type of input signal (analog, digital or analog-digital) and the type of equipment you are connecting (local antenna, satellite or cable equipment).  After that, the TV will scan the entire frequency range.  In the end, you will need to save the previously received gear list. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.philips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips TV picture setup" class="if uuid-2971069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2971069.jpg"></div><h2>  Network connection </h2><p>  This completes the channel setup on your Philips TV.  Now you need to set the network connection parameters.  To do this, go back to the setup menu and select the ‚ÄúNetwork Connection‚Äù section.  Next, select the method of switching to the global web.  It can be twisted pair or a Wi-Fi transmitter.  You must also specify the characteristics of the network connection (address, mask, login, password).  Then you need to save the changes made to the software of the multimedia center. </p><h2>  The choice of applications.  Their installation </h2><p>  After setting up a network connection, you can install additional programs.  To do this, in the main menu, which opens with the Home button from the remote control, select the Play Market item.  Next, you can use your existing Google account or create a new one.  After that, a menu with a set of available applications will open.  Then the user installs the application at his discretion. </p><p>  It is recommended to choose ivi, YouTube and Tvigle.  These resources have a specific set of free content. </p><p>  If unforeseen problems occurred during the device setup process, you can return the software shell of the multimedia center to the initial state of the software.  How to reset the settings on your Philips TV will be discussed later.  But it makes sense to resort to this measure only in the most extreme case.  After its completion, the software configuration of such a device will need to be repeated.  But usually there are no problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.channelnews.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to reset my Philips TV?" class="if uuid-2971070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2971070.jpg"></div><h2>  Reset.  Its features </h2><p>  Now let's figure out how to reset your Philips TV.  First you need to find out the special password in the instruction manual and remember it.  Then go to the device settings menu and select the "General" item.  Next, moving through its items, you need to find "Reset Settings" and go into it.  After that, the multimedia system will prompt you for a password.  We enter the set of numbers from the user manual and confirm the action. </p><p>  Then, within 10-15 minutes, the device will reset the software.  At the next stage, you need to repeat the software setup, network connection and search for channels that were previously described in detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitalreviews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips TV settings" class="if uuid-2971071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2971071.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, the algorithm for setting up a Philips TV was considered.  And both without the support of Smart TV technology, and with such an option.  This is a very simple operation.  Therefore, any owner of such a device can handle it.  Usually, the new owners of such new multimedia systems try to resort to the help of specialists, but all of the above indicates that you can cope without them. </p>
