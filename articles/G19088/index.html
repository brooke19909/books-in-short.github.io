The average temperature in February is -8 degrees. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  We can bet that a trip to Valaam Island from St. Petersburg will not leave anyone indifferent.  The reviews of those who were fortunate enough to visit this paradise clearly indicate this.  It should be noted that the positive feedback from travelers is associated not only with the inspection of the oldest Russian monastery, but also with the bright, expressive and original nature of these places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the territory of the archipelago, there are more than four hundred and eighty species of plants, most of them planted by monks.

    <h2>  Secrets of the island </h2><p>  The history of this place is covered in riddles and secrets.  And, of course, the locals are the best to tell about them.  There is a Lake of Fear, where, according to old-timers, one can hear ‚ÄúLadoga Thunders‚Äù - barantids, as well as observe mirages ‚Äî unusual islands or ships soaring into the sky, etc. Stone roads and masonry, it is not known when and by whom they were built, too add mystery to the island. </p><h2>  Valaam today </h2><p>  Nowadays, this island can hardly be called secluded, especially in the summer.  Increasingly, one can hear opinions that the endless flow of tourists to the island of Valaam from St. Petersburg and other Russian cities must be stopped or at least limited.  But today there are plenty of people here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Excursions around the island begin from the Voskresensky monastery, a shuttle bus runs to the monastery.

    <p>  Guests arrive on the island of Valaam in two ways - as pilgrims and as part of tourist groups.  However, I would like to give you advice: if you want to feel the truly legendary atmosphere of the island - break away from traditional excursions, explore it yourself. </p><h2>  Sights of Valaam </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, this is one of the most famous Russian monuments in the open.  Its main attraction is the Transfiguration Monastery, which was founded in the XI-XIII centuries.  A more accurate date of its appearance has not been established.  In those days, in addition to religious and cultural functions, he also performed defensive functions.  The Transfiguration Monastery has a difficult history - it was repeatedly destroyed and ruined by the Swedes.  In 1611, it was almost completely destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramparts from st petersburg reviews" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464112.jpg" width="580"></div>

However, the magnificent work of art by architects was again destroyed - this time the fire played a fatal role. </p><p>  It was then, in 1837, the decision was made to build a monastery of stone.  Its main structure, the Transfiguration Monastery, is almost seventy-three meters high.  To this day, the relics of the Rev. Herman and Sergius of Valaam are stored in it.  Equally valuable for Orthodox Christians is the <span>icon of the Valaam Mother of God.</span>  The bright blue domes of the monastery rushed up and flaunted in the sun. </p>

    <h2>  Transfiguration Monastery </h2><p>  By the beginning of the sixteenth century, more than six hundred monks lived in this monastery with a long history.  In the eighteenth century, when he was led by the Sarov elder Nazarii, the construction of a monastery of stone began.  By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was a small state, having its autocrat - the abbot, the spiritual police, subsistence farming and a strict charter-law. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The central manor is located on a high hill and is a very slender and strict ensemble, in the center of which is the monastery.  It can be seen from various points on the island.  The monastery is surrounded by buildings of fraternal cells, and the hillsides amaze and delight with the splendor of the gardens. </p><p>  The Cathedral is cross-domed.  Eight pillars divide it into three naves.  Winter, the lower church is consecrated in the name of George and Sergius, the upper - in the name of the Transfiguration.  Thirteen bells were previously strengthened at the multi-tiered bell tower, of which only the largest has survived to date.  The bell tower is crowned with a tent roof on an octagonal drum.  The Holy Gates and the Church of Paul and Peter, made in the style of Russian classicism of the eighteenth century, are facing the main staircase leading from the pier. </p><p>  An old cemetery adjoins the northern line of the monastery estate, where burials were carried out until the mid-nineteenth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramparts from st petersburg reviews" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464113.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nikolsky island </h2><p>  Located at the exit of the Monastery Bay.  His monks mastered in the eighteenth century.  In those days, there was a fishing village and a wooden <span>bow cross.</span>  In its place, the monks built the chapel of the Wonderworker Nicholas, the patron saint of all sailors.  In one thousand eight hundred and fifty-third, a church was erected here.  Twelve monks lived in the monastery, who were engaged in fishing and inspecting newly arrived pilgrims (it was strictly forbidden to bring tobacco and alcohol to Valaam). </p><p>  Especially striking to all who come to Valaam from St. Petersburg and other cities of the country is the monastery of All Saints, which is located on the island of Skitsky.  It was the most severe construction on the territory of the monastery - pilgrims were allowed here only once a year.  The monastery appeared in one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, in the middle of the eighteenth century a church was built here in the name of Alexander Svirsky.  In three years (from 1842 to 1845) eight buildings were built, which were then joined by a blank fence in the shape of a rectangle.  Towers with hipped roofs were installed at the corners. </p>
