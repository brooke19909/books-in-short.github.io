With their help, you can not only make various purchases, pay for services, but also perform quick transfers from one card to another.  And of course, this process always goes smoothly, especially when both banking plastics were issued by one financial institution.  But what to do when they belong to completely different banks, for example, VTB and Sberbank?  Then you should expect a commission.  But <em> </em>  How <span>to transfer money</span> from VTB to Sberbank, avoiding additional costs?  And is it realistic to do this? </p>

    <h2>  What do you need to know and do to translate? </h2><p>  One of the options for such a transfer is the use of remote banking.  In order for this procedure to be completed, you must first connect the service.  It can be Sberbank Online or VTB 24.  But since we will consider an example of sending funds from a VTB card to Sberbank plastic, the second option of remote control is most suitable. </p>

    <p>  If you have activated VTB banking, do not forget to find out the account number and details of your opponent‚Äôs bank.  You can get this information by calling the Sberbank hotline or personally visiting one of its nearest branches.  For example, if you have a VTB card and you need its details, you can call the multi-channel telephone of the information bank: 8 (800) 200-77-99.  If you need the details of a Sberbank card, then you can actually find out similar information by phone: 8 (800) 555-55-50.  In particular, you should find out: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  BIC. </li><li>  Full name (card holder). </li><li>  INN </li><li>  <span>Correspondent account</span> ( <span>correspondent account</span> number <span>).</span> </li><li>  Card number. </li></ul><p>  Without knowledge of these details (for example, if you possess information about only one indicator), the operation cannot be performed.

    <p>  It is noteworthy that it will be possible to pay for the bank services and the transfer itself in cash or by card.  Answering the question: ‚ÄúHow to transfer money from VTB to Sberbank without commission <em>,</em> using a bank branch?‚Äù  - let's say that in this case this method is not suitable.  Applying to the bank by itself implies the presence of additional fees and commissions within 1-2% of the amount.  However, everything will depend on the <span>purpose of the payment</span> and the authority to which the payment is being addressed.  Among examples of free payment, the following payment options should be highlighted: </p><ul><li>  duties in favor of the Federal Migration Service; </li><li>  tax fees and charges, penalties, fines; </li><li>  to the account of Moscow Pedagogical State University; </li><li>  payment for goods and services on which a loan was previously issued at this bank; </li><li>  as a payment for a share in favor of certain investment organizations (for example, VTB Capital Asset Management CJSC). </li></ul><h2>  How to transfer money from VTB to Sberbank via phone? </h2><p>  Another simple option is to use mobile banking.  In order to transfer from one card to another, you must first download and install the special VTB Bank application on your portable device.  According to user reviews, the system is compatible with Apple and Android.  To connect the system you should have: </p><ul><li>  bank account or credit card; </li><li>  contact phone number; </li><li>  agreement for comprehensive service of the bank. </li></ul><p>  After authorization and entering the login and password, as well as the code number from the SMS message, you can proceed with the payment transaction.  When performing this operation in favor of other banks (for example, when paying a loan), the client usually charges a fee within 0.6% of the amount.  The transfer from your card to the opponent‚Äôs plastic opened in another financial institution is 1.6% of the amount.  It is noteworthy that during the operation you will be sent a verification SMS, which you, in fact, confirm this action.  Now you know how to transfer money from VTB to Sberbank via SMS. </p><h2>  What determines the size of the bank commission? </h2><p>  The presence or absence of a commission, as well as its size directly depends on the destination of your payment.  For example, the commission for the payment of utilities, fines, penalties, legal costs, charitable donations and taxes is absent completely or is minimal.  Moreover, the size of the commission does not in any way depend on the transfer method chosen by the client.  This is due to the fact that VTB Bank has a practically uniform tariff rate. </p><h2>  Is it possible to do without a commission? </h2><p>  You can completely dispense with the commission, but only on condition that your opponent complies with the established VTB Bank standard.  For example, he is the owner of a charity fund with which a financial organization cooperates, taxes must be paid, etc.  Or he works in a government department, for example, in the tax service.  In most cases, the execution of an operation on VTB cards with the subsequent transfer of funds to Sberbank plastic is subject to a fee. </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that, by transferring from one card to another, with the exception of individual cases, commissions cannot be avoided.  But its size will directly depend on the purpose of the payment and its amount. </p>
