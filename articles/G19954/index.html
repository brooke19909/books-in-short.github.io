The device is a logical continuation of the line from the Finnish company Nokia.  Modifications such as the Lumia 925 and <span>Lumia 1520</span> became its predecessors. If the novelty inherited the compact metal case from the first of them, then from the second it got excellent technical characteristics with an impressive twenty-megapixel camera.  A more detailed review of the Nokia Lumia 930 is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 review" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/637247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  At first glance, it might seem that the phone has a very ordinary rectangular case with rounded corners and a standard key layout.  On the other hand, it has its own characteristics.  First of all, this concerns the display, which is slightly convex here, because the plane of the <span>protective glass</span> falls at the edges.  In addition, it is impossible not to note the wide metal frame that runs throughout the new case.  To produce the model, metal, glass and plastic are used.  It should be noted that quite a wide range of color solutions is available for the device.  Along with this, color options do not look very expensive and strict.  Proceeding from this, most users call the Nokia Lumia 930 Black the perfect smartphone in a black case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Lumia 930 Black" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/637248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The front part of the device is covered with third-generation Corning Gorilla protective glass, under which there is a five-inch screen, a microphone, touch keys, light and proximity sensors, a speaker, an additional camera, as well as the company logo of the manufacturer.  On the back you can see the peephole of the main camera, LED dual flash and the main speaker.  The right side is used to place all the physical buttons of the smartphone, which are used to turn on / off, control the camera and volume.  The left end has no functional purpose.  The developers installed the connectors for installing a SIM card and connecting headphones on top, and the microUSB slot on the bottom.  In general, this unit can be called quite convenient.  The only thing that can cause a slight gripe in this regard is the weight and dimensions of the Nokia 930. Reviews by numerous experts and model owners indicate that the mass is 167 grams and the dimensions 137 x 71 x 9.8 millimeters - it's a bit much like a device with a five-inch display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 930 review" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/637251.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The smartphone operates on the operating system Windows Phone 8.1.  The user can independently divide all available applications into two large groups.  The first of them includes navigation programs, including maps, a car navigator, as well as laying routes on public transport and on foot.  It should be noted the possibility of using offline maps of different regions on a free basis.  As for the second group of applications, they are used to take pictures and create videos, and also allow you to edit them.  In addition to standard programs from the manufacturer and Microsoft, the standard set of Nokia 930 includes some domestic developments.  In this case, we are talking about the Yandex search engine, an application for buying and reading electronic books, as well as a client of the VK social network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 930 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/637250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The novelty uses a touch screen with a diagonal of five inches.  Its main advantages are wide viewing angles, high contrast and brightness.  In addition, one cannot fail to note the use of modern technologies designed to increase the readability of the picture in bright light.  The Nokia 930 sensor can recognize up to ten touches at the same time.  Moreover, the device briskly responds to all commands even when working in thin gloves.  As for the image density, it is 441 dpi. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The twenty-megapixel main camera with a six- <span>lens Zeiss lens, a</span> photosensitive sensor and a dual LED flash is considered one of the main advantages of the Nokia 930. A smartphone market overview shows that only a few models can boast of such characteristics.  You can start the camera directly with a special button on the right side, even when the device is in a locked state.  As for the quality of the received images, the user can independently choose standard or high resolution.  The auxiliary camera, which is located on the front side, is equipped with a 1.2 megapixel sensor.  It allows you to receive <span>photos that</span> are 1280 x 960 megapixels in <span>size</span> , as well as make video calls. </p><h2>  Basic technical data </h2><p>  The novelty is built on the basis of the quad-core SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor. Its maximum frequency is 2.2 GHz.  A RAM of 2 GB is enough for the high performance of the Nokia 930. Reviews of many users of the device indicate that it works without any slowdowns and sudden reboots.  Heavy applications, including games, run instantly.  The amount of stationary memory is 32 GB.  At the same time, the developers did not provide for the possibility of installing an additional card.  This, perhaps, is the main drawback of the novelty.  This is especially felt against the background of high-quality, capacitive photographs that are created by the camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 930" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/637249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The main advantages of Nokia 930, experts call an excellent camera, high performance, as well as good build quality and materials used with it.  However, even all this does not allow the model to become mass.  This is due not so much to the inconvenient Windows Phone operating system as to the high cost of the device, which in the domestic market is about 25 thousand rubles. </p>
