Now the phones of the popular Lumia line began to be produced under the American brand.  The first model that Microsoft has brought to market is the Microsoft Lumia 535 smartphone.  What are its features?  What do the owners of the device write about their experience using the new product? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Microsoft lumia 535 reviews" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/746718.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Phone Overview </h2><p>  The Microsoft Lumia 535 phone, as we noted above, is the first that is released by the American brand itself after a well-known transaction involving the acquisition of assets with Nokia.  Now the line of devices that were previously associated with a Finnish corporation, such as Lumia, belong to Microsoft. </p><p>  It is assumed that many of the technologies involved in the production of telephones will also be transferred to the Americans from Nokia.  ‚ÄúMicrosoft Lumia 535‚Äù has quite a lot of similarities with Lumia, released before this Finnish brand, and above all it is, of course, design.  According to some market analysts, the phone can be considered a continuation of the Lumia 530. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What does Microsoft Lumia 535 look like?

    <p>  We see that it is very similar in terms of design with many other models of the Lumia line.  But how close is the device to its predecessors in terms of performance?  We will study them in more detail. </p><h2>  Phone Features </h2><p>  The Microsoft Lumia 525 phone is available in two versions - with support for 1 or 2 SIM cards.

Performance reviews will be the first.  Opinions of the corresponding thematic focus can be divided into 2 categories.  Firstly, these are comments left by the owners of the Microsoft Lumia 535 smartphone.  Reviews in this category suggest that a person evaluates the performance of the phone in fact, comparing its public characteristics with real performance indicators.  Secondly, these are the opinions of people who have not yet purchased or are not going to buy a phone, but consider it necessary to speak out about its potential speed. </p><p>  So, the Microsoft Lumia 535 phone.  Users evaluate its characteristics as quite consistent with current market trends.  One of these is the enthusiasm of mobile gadget enthusiasts for games and applications that require high-performance devices.  The phone‚Äôs hardware capabilities fully satisfy this need of the device owners, judging by the reviews. </p>

    <p>  Users - both those who already have a phone, and those who are limited to theoretical ideas about the device - generally evaluate the level of manufacturability and the phone‚Äôs productivity potential in positive tones.  Many are impressed by the fact that the smartphone is equipped with 1 GB of RAM - this is twice as much as in some previous phones of the Lumia series.  Also, users are pleased that the device is equipped with a processor with 4 cores.  Critical assessments of some phone owners relate to the relatively low clock frequency of the chip.  However, as many users who have a device at their disposal note, the processor as a whole copes with the task. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In reviews of both categories there is a positive degree of opinions regarding the screen of the device.  It is made using modern technology - IPS, although today, of course, you will not surprise anyone with it.  The screen, however, has a relatively low resolution, which is still enough for comfortable work with the device.  People praise the camera - it has a good resolution.  Those who used the phone in practice appreciate the quality of the pictures. </p><h2>  Appearance and management </h2><p>  Consider in more detail the features of the smartphone.  Let's start with aspects of the appearance and control of the device.  As we noted above, the design of the device as a whole is similar to the concepts implemented by the Finnish brand Nokia before the deal with Microsoft.  This is likely to appeal to fans of the Lumia series. </p><p>  The controls of the device and their location also generally correspond to those that were present on previous models.  On the right side of the case there are buttons with which the user can adjust the <span>sound volume</span> and lock the screen.  True, the camera is controlled by a software button, not a hardware button, as in the previous devices of the line. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and Management Reviews </h2><p>  What do users write about the <span>look</span> and feel of the Microsoft Lumia 535 phone?  Reviews can also be classified into two types - those that are provided by the owners of the device, and those that are left by enthusiasts of the mobile device market, familiar with the smartphone in theory. </p><p>  Users evaluate the design of the phone as solid, corresponding to the level of previous models of the line.  Lumia smartphones traditionally combine laconicism and control comfort.  These attributes, users believe, fully characterize the device in question as well.  Some owners of the gadget lack a hardware button for the camera, but others believe that this element is superfluous, because the corresponding function may well be implemented in a software version. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  What clearly distinguishes the Microsoft Lumia 535 smartphone from its predecessors is the <span>processor characteristics.</span>  In this model, a chip with 4 cores is installed, while in some early models of the line - with 2. The processor is slightly inferior in speed to such a chip as the Snapdragon 400, which is equipped with the <span>Lumia 735</span> phone <span>,</span> but with the speed of the system, the user is used to smartphones with a more powerful processor, should not feel any problems, since the Windows Phone OS is less demanding on resources than Android. </p><p>  Smartphone ‚ÄúMicrosoft Lumiya 535‚Äù (reviews of many experts in the field of the mobile market confirm this) has a sufficient amount of RAM, despite the fact that we are talking about a budget model.  For example, in the Lumia 630/635 series, only 512 MB of RAM was installed.  The RAM in this model - 1 GB - is enough to run applications under Windows Phone in version 8.1. </p>

    <h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  Let's consider how users evaluate the performance of the Microsoft Lumia 535 phone.  Feedback from us, obviously, will be of interest only to those that are left by the owners of the device with actual experience in its operation.  Users believe that the device as a whole is able to work well with applications and games that are available in the official store of mobile solutions for phones from Microsoft.  The owners of the device praise the product for its stability, the absence of prolonged freezes and significant failures when performing certain functions. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Microsoft Lumia 535 phone (several analysts confirm this) is equipped with a relatively small battery.  However, this drawback is largely compensated by the relatively low resolution of the display and, as a result, a small load on the processor.  The user, as experts in the field of mobile gadgets believe, has the right to expect 1-2 days of phone operation without recharging.  If you turn on video playback and start watching videos without a pause, then the charge will last about 4 hours at the maximum brightness level of the display. </p><h2>  Battery Resource Reviews </h2><p>  We will examine how users characterize the Microsoft Lumia 535 phone in terms of battery performance.  Reviews, as in the case of evaluating the speed of the device, we will be interested in those that leave the owners of the device, who used it in practice. </p><p>  Battery life is a criterion that is largely determined by subjective principles.  The fact is that the intensity of use of certain functions by different users may be different.  Someone prefers to regularly view media content through the phone, start games - in this mode, the device, of course, will work for a very short time without recharging.  Other users, perhaps, will use the device most often to view Internet pages - and in this mode of operation, the gadget will be able to hold a charge longer.  But in the first case, the owner of the smartphone will probably write that the device did not show high performance in this aspect, while the other user will praise the phone. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone ‚ÄúMicrosoft Lumia 535‚Äù - reviews of many users confirm this - it looks quite competitive against the background of analogues in terms of battery resources.  According to experts, given above, a smartphone should work on average 1-2 days without recharging.  In reviews, a similar indicator appears regularly.  Therefore, it is quite possible to focus on him. </p>

    <h2>  Reset </h2><p>  Having studied the main reviews about the phone ‚ÄúMicrosoft Lumia 535‚Äù, its characteristics, key aspects of performance, we consider one important nuance regarding the practical operation of the gadget.  We also examine some user comments regarding the experience of using the corresponding functions of the smartphone. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that Microsoft does not completely hide the fact that some of the phones it produces may freeze during operation, stop responding to user commands that use the device‚Äôs controls.  In such cases, the manufacturer recommends either resetting or resetting the phone.  How should a similar operation be performed with the Microsoft Lumia 535 smartphone?  The instructions will look very simple. </p><p>  First you need to go to the start menu of the gadget, on the "Desktop".  Then, swipe down from the top of the display.  Then select the item ‚ÄúAll settings‚Äù.  Then - ‚ÄúDevice Information‚Äù, after - ‚ÄúReset Settings‚Äù.  After that, the key software options of the phone will be restored to the form that was installed at the factory.  True, all the contents of the phone will also be deleted - the user needs to keep this in mind.  Correct reset of the ‚ÄúLumia 535‚Äù settings ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù programmatically, however, for some reason may not work.  Then you can use the hardware mechanism.  How? </p><p>  First, you need to turn it off.  After that, it is advisable to connect the phone to the charger.  As soon as the device is completely turned off, you need to press the Power button, but at the same time hold down the volume key.  You need to wait until the phone starts to vibrate, and then release the power button (you need to keep the sound control key pressed).  After that, an <span>exclamation mark</span> should be displayed on the screen <span>.</span>  Further, it is important to observe the sequence of activating the necessary buttons - alternately press the volume up key, then the volume down button, then Power, and then the second button again.  After that, the device settings should be reset. </p><p>  What do users say about activating the option in question?  Many owners of the gadget note that, in principle, they did not have to reset the settings in the established way - the Microsoft Lumia 535 telephone works so correctly.  The instruction that we described above, in practice, they did not need.  But if you had to use the corresponding option, then it was implemented extremely correctly.  Moreover, as the owners of the gadget note, there was no special need for a reset, in principle, they carried it out just in case, taking advantage of the fact that valuable files were not placed on the phone. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  It can be concluded that Microsoft decided to firmly declare itself as a powerful player in the highly competitive market for mobile gadgets.  The feature set of the Lumia 535 is impressive.  Users, as well as experts on the mobile device market, assess the competitiveness of the product from Microsoft as sufficiently high. </p>
