    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Almost all tourists who left Lavender Nha Trang Hotel 3 * reviews, in their comments claim that the hotel boasts an excellent location.  So, only the road separates it from the beach.  True, according to our compatriots, crossing it can be problematic, since here practically none of the drivers passes pedestrians, even if they are moving along the zebra.  Therefore, cross the road should be very careful.  Also near the hotel there is a large park with several pools of different depths, shapes and sizes, sun terraces, bars, etc. So if you do not want to go to the beach, you can have a great time here. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel in question is located near the main tourist attractions of Nha Trang.  So, the city center can be reached in 10-15 minutes by leisurely step.  In addition, in the vicinity of the hotel there are many cafes, shops, supermarkets, a market, shops, spas and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the proximity to the airport, the distance to Camran Air Harbor is only 35 kilometers.  So upon arrival in Vietnam you do not need to spend a lot of time on the road to the hotel.  If necessary, you can always order an airport shuttle directly at the hotel for an additional fee.  Also, if you want to be met upon arrival in Nha Trang, please notify the property. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the great advantage of Lavender Nha Trang Hotel 3 * is its proximity to the beach.  You can reach it in just a couple of minutes.  The beach here is municipal and, according to tourists, very clean and well maintained.  For an additional fee, you can rent a sunbed and sun umbrella.  Or you can sit right on the sand, laying a mat or towel.  A characteristic feature here is that waves are very frequent at sea.  Therefore, in most cases, tourists manage to swim only in the morning.  However, you can always compensate for this by going to a nearby park with lots of pools and water slides.  So, our compatriots staying at this hotel did not have any complaints about beach vacations. </p>
