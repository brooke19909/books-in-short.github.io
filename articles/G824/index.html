  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pension Neva 2 *, Sochi: photos, reviews, how to get?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sochi is not only the largest resort city in Russia, but also the longest.  Located in the most beautiful corner of the Black Sea coast, it combines a series of health resorts built during the Soviet period, modern hotels, private villas and pensions, as well as historical attractions. </p><p>  Pension Neva 2 * is visible from a great distance, as it is the tallest building in Sochi.  Its 24 floors (which have 550 rooms, a restaurant and a medical center) provide quality relaxation just a few kilometers from the presidential residence. </p><h2>  Pension Location </h2><p>  Many resorts in Sochi "sin" inconvenient location relative to the sea, airport or entertainment centers.  According to vacationers of the city, a walk to the sea through numerous stairs and tunnels is so exhausting that rest becomes a burden. </p><p>  Everything is different with the Neva 2 * boarding house in Sochi.  The central district where it is located is a concentration of the cultural and economic life of the city.  In addition, it takes only 10 minutes to get to the Riviera Entertainment Center by shuttle bus, and 1400 meters from the beach to which the cable car leads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geocam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi city" class="if uuid-2242840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242840.jpg"></div><p>  Important: boarding house "Neva" 2 * is the only health resort complex in Sochi with its own cableway.  As his guests note in their reviews, this fact is often decisive when choosing a vacation spot on the Black Sea coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the Neva 2 * boarding house in Sochi is located just 3 km from the city's railway station and 35 km from Adler Airport. </p><p>  CJSC "Neva International", as the name of the institution sounds completely, has a territory of 5.5 hectares, on which is located not only its building, but also a magnificent park zone. </p><h2>  Boarding house address </h2><p>  This resort place is located not far from <span>Bocharov Stream,</span> famous not only for its archaeological finds of the site of primitive people and later settlements, but also for the residence of the President of Russia located near it. </p><p>  The address of the Neva 2 * boarding house in Sochi is Vinogradnaya Street 101. Convenient location allows you to get to the main attractions and entertainment complexes of the city in just a few minutes.  In addition, the building is expanded so that the windows of the rooms have a panoramic view of the sea, which makes the pension even more attractive in the eyes of vacationers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.61410799999999" data-lng="39.71875490000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/6/456.png"></div><p>  Visitors are always interested in how to get to the Neva 2 * guesthouse in Sochi from the airport or railway station.  Of course, you can pre-order a transfer or rent a car in Adler, but if for some reason this did not work, you will have to rely on public transport, which runs here without interruption. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you get from Adler, you should take the buses No. 4, 124, 125, get to Sochi railway station, and from there, to get directly to the Neva 2 * boarding house, you will have to transfer to minibuses No. 6, 38, 80, 81 , 85, 99. </p><p>  The only inconvenience is that you have to get with transfers, which is not very convenient when people come with small children and large luggage for holidays.  Well, as the guests of the boarding house say, you should think about the transfer in advance, although even by public transport the journey will take no more than half an hour. </p><h2>  Description of the boarding house "Neva" 2 * </h2><p>  Many of his guests write about how this resort looks in its reviews.  First, a few words about the boarding house itself.  It is difficult to demand from the building built in 1978 (and at that time, and still the highest in Sochi), great "miracles."  Yes, it is quite old, but it is updated as needed.  For example, several years ago in all rooms old windows and balcony doors were replaced with modern double-glazed windows and new air conditioners were installed. </p><p>  Many vacationers note that for a beautiful view from such a window you can close your eyes to some shortcomings or inconveniences.  The latter include 4 elevators, of which, for some reason, only 2 can work, which creates a queue of those eager to get into their high-rise rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of boarding house Neva" class="if uuid-2242845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242845.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the territory of the Neva 2 * boarding house (Sochi).  The photo cannot convey all the exoticism of the subtropical park with which it is surrounded.  There are landscaped walkways and comfortable benches for relaxing in the fresh air, in which the aroma of roses is mixed with the smell of eucalyptus leaves and magnolia flowers.  The beautiful pond attracts the guests of the boarding house by the black swans living there, who are so used to people that they fearlessly swim to the shore in the hope of asking for something tasty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, the park itself can hardly be called modernly groomed, but this is its charm.  This is not another masterpiece of nature ‚Äúsleeked‚Äù to world standards, but a forest belt where trees grow in their natural environment. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Although the opening of the Neva 2 * boarding house happened 40 years ago, its rooms are still well-maintained, even if they are lagging behind in comfort by the standards of foreign resorts.  In some of them, plumbing is outdated, in others, the Internet is ‚Äúpulling‚Äù poorly, but in general it is quite comfortable for a building of such a respectable age.  Pension guests expect: </p><ul><li>  Standard category rooms ranging from 18 m <sup>2</sup> to 21 m <sup>2</sup> .  Each of them has a bath / WC, air conditioning, refrigerator, necessary furniture, a balcony and a TV. </li><li>  Superior rooms (PC) with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 m2 are equipped with upholstered furniture, the rest of the amenities are as in a standard apartment. </li><li>  Two-room suites with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 40 m2 are equipped with a bathtub (jacuzzi) and a toilet with a bidet.  The living room has upholstered furniture, a balcony, a TV and air conditioning.  The bedroom has a double bed, a balcony and a split system.  The windows of the rooms overlook the mountains and the sea. </li><li>  Duplex suite with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 70 m2 on both floors is equipped with a toilet / bath, split systems.  Ground floor - living room with a set of leather upholstered furniture, dressing room, dressing table, TV, fridge, stereo system and stained glass mirror.  Second floor - two bedrooms, each of which has its own TV. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="restsochi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house" class="if uuid-2242847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242847.jpg"></div><p>  Considering that the number of rooms was created at the end of the 70s of the last century, the Neva boarding house is very well equipped. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of how they feed in a boarding house, it is very difficult, since how many people there are so many food preferences.  Many vacationers mention that food more reminds them of pioneer camps in the Soviet era with cereals, pasta and meatballs than the dishes more familiar to modern travelers. </p><p>  In fact, the boarding house offers only breakfast options or full three meals a day.  Those who do not trust the local restaurant or like to eat something new every day, choose the first option, preferring to have lunches and dinners in nearby cafes, since there are many of them near the hotel. </p><p>  The <span>restaurant</span> itself <span>in the</span> boarding house has 2 rooms, but even they do not save when all the rooms are full.  In this case, the serving of dishes in two shifts is established.  This, as the guests of the boarding house write in the reviews, exactly resembles a pioneer camp of the late 70s. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sanatorii-sochi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="food in a boarding house Neva" class="if uuid-2242855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242855.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the dishes on the menu, they, although monotonous, quite satisfying, and if you choose something else every day, they will not have time to get bored. </p><h2>  Boarding house beach </h2><p>  Neva rents a beach from a nearby hotel, so a special pass is required to enter it.  You can get there by going down the cable car, along which 2 cabins, accommodating up to 20 people, ride with a fifteen-minute break.  To go on a trip along it, you must present at the entrance a sanatorium book certifying that a person really lives in a boarding house. </p><p>  The pebble and sandy beach is equipped with changing cabins, toilets, sunbeds and umbrellas.  Cafes and bars along the coast help quench hunger and thirst.  If you are not lucky with the weather, then you can have a great time in the heated pool directly on the seashore. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiakurort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cable car to the beach" class="if uuid-2242875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242875.jpg"></div><p>  The only dissatisfaction with the beach expressed by the guests of the boarding house is the lack of the opportunity to walk along the coast at sunset or swim at night, since the cable car is limited in time.  But the significant plus that they mention is the absence of pestering photographers and traders. </p><h2>  Medical services </h2><p>  In addition to the sea, air and sun, boarding house "Neva" provides its guests with the opportunity to improve their health.  A diagnostic and treatment center operates under him, the main areas of work of which are diseases: </p><ul><li>  Musculoskeletal system. </li><li>  Gastrointestinal organs. </li><li>  Nervous system. </li><li>  Metabolic disorders. </li><li>  Gynecology. </li></ul><p>  In addition, vacationers note in reviews that they make excellent and inexpensive massages, exercise therapy and phytotherapy are carried out.  Those who feel great are invited to undergo a diagnosis that will help to detect possible hidden ailments or confirm the presence of excellent health. </p><h2>  Boarding house sports complex </h2><p>  Active people remain so even on vacation.  It is for them that a sports complex has been opened in the Neva boarding house, where along with gym equipment are table tennis tables, a Swedish wall, fitness training, volleyball and basketball competitions are held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tour-center-msk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sports Complex" class="if uuid-2242878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242878.jpg"></div><p>  Also, for the conduct of sports on the territory of the boarding house, special platforms are equipped.  For those who prefer a combination of a healthy lifestyle with moderate physical activity in the fresh air, pedestrian paths are laid in the park. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  In addition to free services, the guesthouse offers a number of paid entertainment.  At the disposal of guests: </p><ul><li>  Meeting room for business people. </li><li>  Concert Hall and Cinema. </li><li>  Night club. </li><li>  Karaoke bar. </li><li>  Sauna. </li><li>  Beauty saloon. </li><li>  Billiards. </li><li>  Gift Shops. </li><li>  Laundry. </li></ul><p>  Among the free services, it is worth noting the presence of two pools: one open with sunbeds and umbrellas, the second - indoor, smaller. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Conventionally, everything that is written about the rest in this place can be divided into several categories: </p><ul><li>  Good vacation.  Such reviews about the Neva 2 * boarding house (Sochi) are left by the guests of the resort who are pleased with the rather low cost of living in such an expensive city.  This is true, although, as they say, there could have been more elevators for such a number of rooms and the height of the building, working elevators. </li><li>  Not bad, but expensive.  So noted by those for whom the cost of rooms in a boarding house located in the country's most expensive resort, still seems overpriced.  On the other hand, it is possible that category 2 * could cost less than 2800 rubles / day for a double standard. </li><li>  Poorly.  Such reviews are left by travelers accustomed to a different level of service.  Perhaps they are right that for the same money that they leave in Sochi, you can spend your holidays in European resorts with great comfort and pleasure. </li></ul><p>  On the other hand, the Neva boarding house is located in an unusually beautiful place, where the air itself is healing, and the sea energizes the whole year. </p><h2>  Neva in Alushta </h2><p>  Not only in Sochi there is a boarding house with that name.  Sometimes they are even confused. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva in Alushta" class="if uuid-2242880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2242880.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, 2 * Neva boarding house located in Alushta is a type of recreation that is included in the all-inclusive category: </p><ul><li>  Three meals a day according to the "buffet" system. </li><li>  Comfortable rooms. </li><li>  Animation for young guests of a boarding house. </li><li>  Own beach, the path to which lies through a beautiful park area and partially through a tunnel where street musicians give performances. </li><li>  Discounts for clients of the boarding house in the shopping and entertainment centers of the city. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of the advantages of the ‚Äúnamesake‚Äù of the Sochi boarding house.  Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, so you have to choose only between two cities. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Holidays on the Black Sea coast for many Russians still remains a priority.  The tradition of traveling to the sea every summer, laid down in Soviet times, continues to operate, and the Neva 2 * boarding house is happy to welcome all its guests. </p>
