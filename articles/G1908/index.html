The strategy can be represented as the main direction of the bank to achieve its goals.  The capital management strategy should not contradict the general development strategy of the bank itself, since it is its component.  The definition of capital management strategy must be carried out taking into account the peculiarities of its formation and use, environmental conditions, as well as the goals and directions of the bank.  Consequently, the strategy of capital management should be focused on improving the basic indicators characterizing the effectiveness of the formation and functioning of capital, to help strengthen financial stability. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Management tactics involve the use of specific methods and techniques to achieve the goal in a specific situation, at a certain point in time. </p><p>  Money management involves the use of two groups of tools: </p><p>  1. External tools are a set of certain levers at the macro level that affect the formation and use of capital at the micro level (state regulation of banks, the asset market, foreign exchange regulation; availability of credit resources). </p><p>  2. Internal management tools aimed at improving the efficiency of use by optimizing the internal factors of the bank‚Äôs development, identifying hidden opportunities and reserves (capital formation strategy and targeted financial policy, methodology for choosing the optimal <span>financing source,</span> system of internal standards for certain aspects of capital formation, etc. .). </p><p>  Thus, capital management involves the search and adoption of decisions that guarantee a given efficiency of its use, by influencing the size, profitability of equity, structure and sources of capital formation.  At the same time, the capital management mechanism provides for: determining goals and objectives of management, control over their implementation;  development of strategies and tactics of money management;  the use of modern methods and models in the management process;  timely analysis of capital efficiency and management optimization. </p>
