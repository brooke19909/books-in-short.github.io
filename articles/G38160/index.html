At the same time, it is far from urban areas and highways.  The complex is located in a forested area, where there is always fresh air and you can enjoy wonderful birdsong for days on end.  It is cool in the heat, while you can improve your health with the help of air nourished with pine needles.  In season, the forest has a lot of different berries and mushrooms.  But if a person does not understand the grades, then it is better not to collect anything.  Nearby is a pond with a comfortably equipped beach, where there are sun loungers and umbrellas.  The complex itself provides its guests with clean and comfortable rooms, as well as the services of professionally trained staff. </p><h2>  general information </h2>
