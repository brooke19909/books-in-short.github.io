To make it, you will need 4 rectangles of green paper and 8 of white, yellow or pink. </p><p>  First you need to make flower petals.  We make white blanks.  We put the rectangle with the long side towards us and bend two corners on one side, as well as two corners on the other side to the center.  Now you should bend the side parts.  They are also attracted to the center.  A detailed manufacturing scheme can be seen in the figure attached above.  Now it remains to bend the workpiece in half.  This operation should be done with all 8 white rectangles.  We tie them in a pile of 4 pieces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now you should straighten the parts of the blanks to get a flower.  Open the petals one by one.  First you need to open those that are inside, and then those that are outside.  Insert the second white blank and continue to make flower 3 and 4 layer.  The water lily is ready, now you need to make the leaves.  Green blanks are made similarly to white, with the only difference being that at the last stage the figure is not folded inward but outward.  We connect future leaves to each other.  We install a water lily on them so that the structure is stronger, you can even glue a flower.  Open the leaves one by one and turn them up.  The flower is ready. </p><h2>  Corrugated Paper Water Lilies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a water lily out of paper" class="if uuid-2234150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2234150.jpg"></div><p>  To create such a craft is not difficult even for a child.  How to make a water lily out of paper?  For its manufacture you will need: corrugated paper, scissors and cardboard.  Cut out a circle from thick paper.  This will be the base of the flower.  Now you should cut the blanks for the petals.  We make rectangles from corrugated paper, and then give them the shape of ovals.  Now you should stretch the petals to the sides, as if giving them volume.  When the workpieces are done, you can begin to create water lilies.  First of all, glue the first row of petals to the round base.  But <span>how to make a water lily out of paper</span> so that it is voluminous?  It is necessary to stick at least another 5 rows of petals and be sure to create a center.  It is done this way: a long rectangular strip is cut out and cut to the middle along one edge.  Now this blank should be rolled up and placed in the center of the flower.  The water lily is ready.  She can decorate a card or any other craft. </p><h2>  Making a water lily with children </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/341358846732114218/"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself volumetric toy &quot;Water Lily&quot; made of paper" class="if uuid-2234157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2234157.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to create a flower with your child is to cut it out of paper.  But to make the work more interesting, the sheet should first be tinted on its own.  And in two colors.  We paint one leaf in burgundy, and the other in green.  And how to make a water lily out of paper?  From the green leaf, cut out the leaves, and from the burgundy - petals.  Now glue them so that all the parts converge in one center.  Close the attachment point of all parts with the core.  We cut out a circle from yellow paper, and on top of it we glue another same geometric figure, which is cut along the edges.  The center can also be decorated with beads or buttons. </p>
