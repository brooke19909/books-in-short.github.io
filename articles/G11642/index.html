However, despite all its outward simplicity, baubles have a long history, starting from ancient Native American times and ending with the hippie era.  Now this small handmade jewelry adds <span>positive emotions to</span> people, regardless of their gender, age and social affiliation.  Baubles do not buy, it is customary to give them to friends and acquaintances.  Therefore, many are now interested in the question: how to weave baubles? </p><p>  For such a simple decoration, there are many weaving techniques, as well as a large number of materials from which they can be woven.  The most popular are beautiful and bright <span>baubles made of thread.</span>  The traditional and modern purpose of baubles as a memorable gift encourages many to learn how to make baubles.  According to established tradition, this gift is believed to bring happiness and good fortune to its new owner.  In addition, he always recalls the person who presented him.  Of course, such a gift will be the most symbolic and valuable if it is made by hand. </p><p>  It is not at all difficult to learn how to weave baubles and do it yourself.  Weaving baubles does not require much effort and time, you just need a little imagination, multi-colored threads and scissors.  The best thing is to learn how to make baubles of eight threads.  To calculate the length of the threads, you need to consider that their length should be four times the finished bracelet.  The approximate length of the thread is needed about a meter or a little longer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Begin the bracelet so that it does not twist, be sure to fasten it with a pin, the pin itself can be attached to the sofa or directly to your clothes.  The threads are pre-tied to a pin, leaving such a length of the ends so that they can then be tied.  Then the threads need to be laid out in the order in which the colors in the finished product will alternate.  This is the whole simple preparation procedure before making a bauble.  Next, we begin the manufacturing process itself. </p><p>  It is necessary to tie two knots on the adjacent thread on the left with the rightmost thread, while the threads change their places.  Then, with the same thread, a knot is tied on the next thread on the left, this continues to the very last thread.  Thus, the first row is formed in the form of a diagonal strip of nodes of the same color.  Continue weaving again with the right thread of a different color and do the same procedure with tying knots.  Weaving should be continued until the desired length of the bracelet is obtained.  On the edges of the bracelet, neat <span>pigtails are</span> tied on both sides <span>, the bauble</span> is ready and can be removed from the pin. </p><p>  This option in order to learn how to weave baubles, is the easiest.  But it provides many opportunities to diversify patterns.  One has only to start weaving in the opposite direction and the pattern will turn out completely different.  You can make weaving from the middle to the middle from right to left, and after weaving is already from left to right, the pattern will be even more beautiful.  With this weaving, the threads in the very center of the bauble can be knotted and you get a pattern that resembles arrows.  A large number of people are well aware of how to weave baubles and patterns obtained by weaving these wonderful bracelets, there are a lot.  It all depends on the imagination and, of course, patience and perseverance.  Now the Internet comes to the aid of weaving lovers.  In its vast expanses it is not difficult to find a large number of schemes and ideas.  You can bring your skill to perfection.  It is much more pleasant to receive such a gift made by yourself than purchased in a store.  When a person makes a gift with his own hands, he puts a part of his soul into it. </p>
