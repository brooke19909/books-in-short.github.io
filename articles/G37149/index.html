More than 200 collections and exhibitions are constantly operating here, so navigating this variety is quite difficult.  The magnificent museums of Tel Aviv are eager to be visited by all tourists, but having time to get into each of them is completely impossible.  Going on a trip, it is necessary to outline the route in advance and decide which exposure should be visited first. </p><h2>  Tel Aviv Museum of Art </h2><p>  The Tel Aviv Museum of Fine Arts was opened in 1932. At first it was located in the Dizengoff House building, in which the independence of the state was proclaimed, but then it was transferred to Shaul Ha-Meleh Boulevard.  Currently, the museum occupies three buildings: the main, educational center and the Elena Rubinstein Pavilion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photoeditor61.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Art Museum" class="if uuid-2547525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2547525.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, it is difficult to surprise a tourist from Moscow to Tel Aviv with an art gallery, but the museum has one of the largest art collections in Israel, so there is something to see here.  The halls showcase objects of traditional and modern fine art, photographs, design, graphics, architecture.  The collection contains exhibits in each of the main styles of the first half of the 20th century: impressionism and post-impressionism, futurism, surrealism, Fauvism, cubism, expressionism.  Also on the territory of the museum is a sculpture garden and a special youth section, where young authors present their works. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews about the museum are ambiguous, but this is primarily due to the fact that everyone understands art in their own way and fans of the classics are unlikely to like fashionable trends.  However, the museum is worth a visit to see art in all its diversity. </p><h2>  Museum of the Jewish Diaspora </h2><p>  This museum is interactive.  By visiting it, you can learn a lot of interesting things about the Jewish diaspora of the world and its history, which spans a huge period, from the expulsion of the people to modern times.  The exposition was opened in 1978 by the president of the World Jewish Congress, Naum Goldman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.museumsinisrael.gov.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the Jewish Diaspora" class="if uuid-2547556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2547556.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the Jewish community from its inception to the present day is more than two and a half thousand years of wandering, persecution, stability and, finally, prosperity.  Six halls of the museum show visitors exhibits in the following areas: family, community, religion, culture, return to Israel, the place of the Jewish diaspora in the world. </p><h2>  Eretz Israel Museum </h2><p>  Arriving in Tel Aviv from Moscow or any other city in the world, be sure to visit the historical and archaeological museum of Eretz Yisrael - the largest museum dedicated to the history and culture of Israel.  Visitors are shown permanent and temporary exhibitions of archaeological artifacts, exhibits on traditional crafts, crafts, folklore, and religion.  On the territory there are production workshops, restored and operating, so that you can lively see the traditional processes of production, wine, oil, flour. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.israel-in-photos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eretz Israel Museum" class="if uuid-2547562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2547562.jpg"></div><p>  The museum buildings are located in the park, and between them rise the ruins of an ancient settlement of the Biblical period, where archaeological research is still being carried out.  In addition to exhibitions, there is a planetarium and a salon shop where you can buy not only souvenirs and trinkets, but also jewelry created by skilled Israeli craftsmen. </p><h2>  Museum of Ilana Gur </h2><p>  The next museum in Tel Aviv to be visited is the house-exhibition of Ilana Gur, a famous artist who worked in the style of surrealism.  Her paintings resemble the work of Dali and are exhibited in many galleries in the world.  The author‚Äôs hand belongs not only to paintings, but also sculptures, furniture, decor, jewelry, clothes, which can be purchased at the museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.israelincentives.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Ilana Gur" class="if uuid-2547593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2547593.jpg"></div><p>  The building itself was built almost three hundred years ago.  The artist made many changes to his appearance, but some details remained unchanged.  In addition to products created by Ilan Gur, there are also delightful lamps, unusual furniture, dishes and sculptures. </p><h2>  Harry Oppenheimer Diamond Museum </h2><p>  Museum of Diamonds  Harry Oppenheimer is another Tel Aviv museum to look into.  It was opened about thirty years ago, and recently the building and exhibits were restored and modernized.  The latest technology opens up an extraordinary world of diamonds to visitors, replacing outdated traditional exhibitions. </p><p>  The Diamond Museum is a museum in Tel Aviv that you will definitely want to return to.  Here are the achievements of the diamond industry, which plays an important role in the Israeli economy.  A permanent exhibition demonstrates an interesting process of diamond mining, cutting and polishing methods, secrets and features of the manufacture of magnificent jewelry.  In addition to permanent exhibits, the museum constantly hosts temporary exhibitions that demonstrate all kinds of finds, unusual stones, and luxurious jewelry created by Israeli jewelers. </p><h2>  Palm Museum </h2><p>  Palm trees are special military units that were part of the Israel Defense Forces, which existed from 05/15/1941 to 11/07/1948.  The detachments included units of several types of troops: air, sea, and reconnaissance.  Later, the unit commanders became one of the commanders of the Israel Defense Forces.  For a long time, Palm trees played an important role in the politics, literature and art of Israel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="israelwithstyle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm Museum" class="if uuid-2547457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2547457.jpg"></div><p>  The Palm Museum is radically different from other military history museums.  Instead of traditional photographs and artifacts hidden behind glass, the exhibits are displayed in a modern, innovative form.  The museum is experimental-interactive and consists of 12 different rooms.  Passing through each hall, the visitor literally becomes part of a military detachment: voluminous films, projections and unusually realistic special effects transfer viewers to the events of the 40s.  Together with Jewish heroes, viewers walk a difficult path to the independence of Israel. </p><p>  A standard tour lasts 1.5 hours.  Children not younger than school age are allowed in the museum.  The emotional and admired reviews about visiting this amazing place leave no doubt: the museum should be visited by everyone who is interested in the history of the amazing state of Israel. </p>
