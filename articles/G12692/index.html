Perhaps, there are no owners of the operating system who have not encountered temporary crashes, errors, and freezes of Android. </p><p>  Many do not know how to cope with such a problem, sometimes they do not even try to do it.  But if the error is caused by accident, then the solution is quite simple - reboot your mobile device.  Therefore, you need to know the algorithm of how to restart Android. </p><h2>  For what purpose is a reboot necessary </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetsloud.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restart android" class="if uuid-2954287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2954287.jpg"></div><p>  There are a number of objective reasons why you need to restart your smartphone: </p><ul><li>  It happens that after a certain time the phone starts to freeze, the operating system slows down.  This is considered normal and occurs due to the accumulation of temporary files, so you need to perform a scheduled reboot of your device. </li><li>  Slowing down applications and systems can also be due to system crashes.  In such situations, it is advisable to use proven methods and restart Android with the ability to restore data. </li><li>  Rebooting can open access to new smartphone features, such as Recovery (a menu on the phone that allows you to reset all settings to factory defaults). </li></ul><p>  The reboot process can help in case of other problems.  If this does not help, it may be possible to correct the situation by switching to safe mode.  Do not panic without understanding the problem to the end and reset the phone to factory settings.  It is possible that the problem is solved by rebooting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The device freezes: how to safely restart the "Android"? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="androidp1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restart android if it freezes" class="if uuid-2954289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2954289.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes the smartphone freezes so much that the usual way to restart the phone does not work (pressing the lock button), because the shutdown menu is not displayed.  With a similar problem, you need to hold the lock button for a little more than 10 seconds until the device starts to reboot.  In the end, the device will reboot even with a very strong hang of Android. </p><p>  If the phone has a removable battery, then there is another algorithm.  You just need to remove the cover, pull out the battery, wait a few seconds, insert it back and restart the phone.  In the same way, you can restart the laptop, which hangs badly and does not respond to clicks.  Just hold down the power button and wait for the laptop to reboot. </p><h2>  Quick and easy reboot without resetting to factory settings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.beritandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to reboot android system" class="if uuid-2954293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2954293.jpg"></div><p>  So, how to restart Android, if it freezes, but the problem is not fatal, that is, the phone hangs slightly, but performs its main functions, then the following reset method is suitable: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Hold the power button on the phone and hold for a few seconds. </li><li>  We wait until the shutdown menu appears, where several items will be registered. </li><li>  We find the item "Restart the device", click and wait for the reboot. </li></ol><p>  The speed of the appearance of the menu on different devices is different, on average it is 5-10 seconds.  This restart method works on all modern popular smartphones, if there are no problems with the screen and phone display, and the shutdown buttons respond to pressing.  If the phone does not respond to keystrokes, then to save data on the device you will have to resort to the battery method. </p><h2>  A radical way to reboot your phone with deleting data </h2><p>  <span>It</span> is worth <span>completely</span> rebooting Android with deleting data in the event that the errors are serious and cannot be eliminated by a normal reboot.  A similar problem is caused by caught viruses, third-party applications, errors during any actions and certain functions.  This method of troubleshooting involves deleting all data on the device without restoring it, but it is recommended that you save the data by backing up information from the phone‚Äôs memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androproblem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to completely restart android" class="if uuid-2954295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2954295.jpg"></div><p>  The algorithm of this method is convenient in that it remains unchanged no matter what device you have.  It is simple and involves a sequential chain of simple actions: </p><ol><li>  Go to the device settings. </li><li>  Select the item with the name "Archiving and resetting data." </li><li>  Click and wait for the device to reboot. </li></ol><p>  This method of restarting Android will return the device to its original state.  All data, including passwords and logins, will be deleted.  Previously installed applications will also not be available.  The smartphone will not be inhibited, and applications will stop hanging.  If you can‚Äôt enter the settings, you can reset the data using the previously mentioned Recovery function. </p><h2>  Reboot with Recovery </h2><p>  If there is no way to go into the device‚Äôs settings or ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù hangs a lot, there is a way that allows you to complete a full reboot - Recovery Mode function that works with a certain key combination.  The combination may vary on different devices, you can familiarize yourself with it on official sites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to safely restart android" class="if uuid-2954298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2954298.jpg"></div><p>  The standard sequence of how to restart the Android system is as follows: you must simultaneously press the volume up and power button.  For a full reboot, you need to perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  after pressing a certain combination, a special menu appears; </li><li>  To select a specific item, control the movement using the volume buttons; </li><li>  select WipeData by holding the power button; </li><li>  Wait for a full reboot to the initial state of the smartphone. </li></ul><p>  Tablets based on MTK processors have a special utility called Mobileuncle Tools, which allows you to enter Recovery through the Boot into Recovery item.  The program allows you to configure the most important parameters of the device. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If the performance of the mobile device has decreased, and it often freezes, then it is advisable to use the power button to quickly reboot or reset to factory settings.  Before restarting Android, if it freezes during a reset and working with system files, it is important to remember the need to back up to save all important information to a laptop or flash drive. </p>
