Due to its hot climate and authentic architecture, it attracts travelers.  The country has long been oppressed by authoritarian politicians, but now it is recovering.  Infrastructure is developing, the standard of living is growing, therefore, and the rest becomes more comfortable. </p><p>  Skanes Serail 4 * in Tunisia is one of the 9 most popular four-star hotels.  It is located in the city of Monastir in the south-eastern part of the country on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The city has an airport, which adds attractiveness to the hotel among tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aviontourism.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Monastir" class="if uuid-3210668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210668.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Habib Bourguiba Airport is two kilometers from the hotel.  You can get to there on direct flights from Russia, Germany, Finland, France and other European countries.  The second nearest airport is Enfida-Hammamet, located 45 kilometers from the destination.  This airport is the largest in Tunisia, so there is always a large number of flights. </p><p>  After landing, Skanes Serail can be reached by bus or taxi.  Traffic in Monastir is established.  Other parts of Tunisia can be reached by intercity buses, as well as by train.  Blue-striped minibuses in the city are called piles and can serve as an alternative for taxis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The hotel complex in appearance resembles the palace of an Arab sheikh thanks to unusual windows, bends and columns.  This place is located near the beach.  Skanes Serail 4 * in Tunisia was built 200 meters from the sea shore.  The Mediterranean Sea with blue water can be seen directly from the balconies of the guests.  Skanes Serail itself, like other hotels, is located in the resort area near the city.  This area is called Monastira Skanes.  The hotel has a small green area with palm trees and native vegetation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allbooking.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel view" class="if uuid-3210617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210617.jpg"></div><p>  At different distances from the resort area, you can find cafes and restaurants for every taste.  Of the attractions there are both historical buildings, for example, a fortress, and modern ones - a hamam and a shopping center.  Since Tunisia is a Muslim country, you can also look at the mosque.  The main places for walking are the Medina with narrow streets and the harbor with pleasure boats. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Skanes Serail 4 * in Tunisia is positioned as a place for families.  The repair in the rooms is neat, but without frills: the guests noted that the furniture is no longer new.  The largest rooms are designed for people with children.  A maximum of 2 adults and 3 babies can be accommodated, for whom bunk beds are installed.  The windows overlook several locations: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Sea. </li><li>  Garden. </li><li>  Highway to the city. </li><li>  Pool. </li><li>  Disco area. </li></ul><p>  The rooms from which the sea can be seen are called Superior.  Guests settled in the wing close to the disco complain of poor sleep due to noise.  The administration solves this problem by relocation subject to availability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelstunisie.tn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea view room" class="if uuid-3210619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210619.jpg"></div><p>  Each room has a TV, but only 1 channel is Russian-speaking.  Guests have a private bathroom with a hairdryer.  Towels and a key to the safe are provided on deposit, which is returned at the end of the stay.  The rooms have air conditioning, but it will only be needed in the summer season. </p><p>  Skanes Serail has Wi-Fi.  In the morning it works well, and in the evening due to the load on the network there may be connection problems. </p><p>  For all guests, the rooms have a balcony or terrace where you can smoke.  Smoking is prohibited only at the reception, in other places on the territory is allowed. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The All inclusive package includes three meals a day in the dining room, drinks, except for strong alcohol, a snack during the day in the form of snacks or ice cream.  Since the Muslim religion is the main one in Tunisia, in Skanes Serail 4 * in Monastir, guests are not offered pork.  But they love turkey, chicken, liver and beef.  Seafood at the hotel, despite being close to the sea, is rarely served.  Some guests noted a lack of fruit.  Drinking water is issued on coupons for the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.promohotel.tn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dining at the hotel" class="if uuid-3210620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210620.jpg"></div><p>  There are no restaurants in the resort area, but they can be reached by any transport.  The journey takes about 10 minutes.  The closest is La Voile Restaurant with a varied cuisine.  It serves seafood, pizza, pasta and other dishes.  Nearby there is a market where you can buy anything.  The assortment of fruits is about the same as in Russia, but they are more juicy and saturated. </p><h2>  Bathing places </h2><p>  In the resort area there is a white sand beach.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are free to use.  Guests noted their sufficient number.  The sea is shallow, which is a positive point when vacationing with children.  The coastal area is clean, cleaning usually takes place every two days.  There is a bar on the beach where you can make a drink. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelstunisie.tn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel pool" class="if uuid-3210618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210618.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory there are two outdoor pools and one indoor heated, in case you do not want to swim in the sea.  Separate pool for children and their comfortable swimming.  A relatively new infrastructure for Tunisia and Smartline Skanes Serail 4 * is a water park.  It is also free for hotel guests. </p><p>  Separately, you can purchase wellness treatments.  If desired, guests can visit: </p><ul><li>  Turkish bath </li><li>  whirlpool bath; </li><li>  a sauna; </li><li>  spa and wellness center. </li></ul><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The Tunisian dialect consists of a mixture of Arabic and French.  At school, the local population learns 4 languages: French, Arabic, English and one more to choose from.  There may be people in the hotel who understand Russian, but you need to know at least some English.  Moreover, English is useful to you not only for visiting Skanes Serail 4 * in Monastir and Tunisia, but also in other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="s-ec.bstatic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hall" class="if uuid-3210657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210657.jpg"></div><p>  Some Russian guests wrote that the hotel staff was biased towards them because of their nationality.  They believed that they were specially accommodated in noisy rooms.  However, others did not mark such a moment.  Perhaps it is the behavior of the guests themselves.  Don't be too arrogant. </p><p>  As for the maids and cleaning, opinions also diverged.  Someone was pleased with the cleanliness of the room, others claimed that a good cleaning is possible only with an additional requirement.  In the dining room, some also noted insufficiently clean appliances.  However, the situation could be solved with wet wipes. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The owners of Skanes Serail 4 * in Tunisia took care of the fun of their guests.  For this, a staff of animators works there.  Young people and girls conduct classes in fitness, water aerobics, volleyball and dance.  It should not be boring. </p><p>  At night, you can go to the dance floor.  However, it is available not only for guests, but also for other comers.  In bad weather, the disco moves to the hotel bar, so the rain will not spoil your plans. </p><p>  In a country like Tunisia, Skanes Serail Aquapark 4 * became one of the first water parks in the hotel complex.  It represents several water slides.  This building can take children for a long time.  Of course, in other countries there are usually more water parks, but in Tunisia and Monastir Skanes Serail Aquapark 4 * is included in the price. </p><p>  For a fee, guests can also enjoy golf, horse riding, diving and windsurfing. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  As already indicated, the hotel is considered convenient for families.  Especially for children there is an outdoor playground and a games room inside the hotel.  Family rooms are suitable for 5 people.  Separately, you can purchase babysitting services and childcare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park at the hotel" class="if uuid-3210645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210645.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the sea is quite shallow, there is also a special pool in which the child feels comfortable.  Aquapark in Skanes Serail 4 * Monastir in Tunisia was built specifically for children.  It was planned to commission the design in the summer of 2018. </p><p>  For teens, entertainment of animators is quite suitable, as well as table tennis, darts, mini-golf and a tennis court.  To learn more about the culture of the country, they can go on excursions. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In Monastir, you can get acquainted with the history of Tunisia.  There are some of the most ancient attractions of the state: </p><ul><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  The fortress of Ribat Hartem. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Mausoleum of Habib Bourguiba. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  Museum of Islamic Art. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  Old Town - Medina. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1">  Mosques. </li></ul><p>  Ribat Hartem Fortress was founded in the 8th century by General Hartem ibn Aayun and first served for military and religious purposes.  At the northern wall of the fortress was also founded the cemetery of Sidi El Meseri for honorary warriors. </p><p>  Habib Bourguiba Mausoleum - a building that impresses with its architecture.  It bears the name of the first president of Tunisia.  His body was buried there for his contribution to the development of modern Tunisia.  The visit is absolutely free. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  According to reviews of Skanes Serail 4 * in Tunisia, one of the most vivid impressions was a tour of the Sahara.  She is a two-day check-in at another hotel.  Travelers are told about the people of Tunisia, their religion and customs, while they travel to their destination by bus.  On the way, they visit Kairouan, the holy city where pilgrimages take place.  Amazing oases and salt lakes come across to tourists on their way.  They can also see with their own eyes the production of salt and mirages.  Journey through the desert takes place in jeeps, on the second day, tourists go to meet the dawn and ride camels or ATVs of their choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="get.pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sahara Desert" class="if uuid-3210662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/142197/3210662.jpg"></div><p>  Another favorite excursion by everyone is a trip to Carthage.  Now there are houses of the richest people in Tunisia, including the president.  The ancient city itself consists of ruins, since it was wiped off the face of the earth twice.  Guides tell the story of the capture of the city and its significance for empires.  Tourists visit the museum, where the remains of busts, statues and utensils are stored.  This trip will allow you to learn more about the history of all mankind. </p><p>  Both tours can be purchased at the hotel from representatives. </p><h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  There are conflicting reviews about the Tunisia Hotel Skanes Serail 4 * in Monastir.  Someone really liked the rest, some were disappointed.  This largely depends on the initial mood of the person.  Going to another country without knowing English is always risky.  You need to carefully choose the season for travel, because they differ in climate and, accordingly, in entertainment.  In general, the objective disadvantages of Tunisia are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Garbage in the streets.  Having got rid of authoritarian rule, the population allows itself not to comply with the elementary rules of decency.  Locals believe that they need a firm hand to become disciplined again. </li><li>  Service level.  Tunisia is a developing state, no matter how hard the staff tries, this business is relatively new for them.  Every year the quality of service is improving, but it is inappropriate to compare with other countries. </li><li>  Overpricing.  Any dealer or taxi driver always calls the first amount in excess of the real one.  It is necessary to bargain with them. </li></ul><p>  Like any other country, Tunisia has its own specifics.  Of course, there is something to see.  Skanes Serail is a developing hotel that takes care of its guests and builds new facilities for their comfort. </p>
