    <h2>  With minus </h2><p>  The first option, when you need to think about how to unlock <span>a Beeline number,</span> is a negative account balance.  After all, when you reach a certain minus, you can no longer make or receive calls.  If the debt is not very large, then, of course, they can write / call you. </p><p>  Fortunately, the problem of unlocking a number in this situation will not bring much trouble.  Yes, and you won‚Äôt have to think long about resolving the situation - just replenish your account with positive numbers.  After that, you should receive a message about unlocking the functions of the card.  That's all the problems are solved.  Now you know how to unlock the Beeline SIM card by the first method.  But that is not all. </p><h2>  Did not use for a long time </h2><p>  Here is the second scenario.  Very often, the owners of several SIM cards think how to unlock the Beeline number.  Moreover, this problem can occur without any minus, in the absence of the use of numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is it about?  If you have not used the number of 6 months, then, of course, it is blocked.  These are the conditions for the provision of services.  But you can always carry out the process of unlocking and restoring access.  In cases where you are faced with the fact that your number is blocked due to long non-use, you will have to contact the operator‚Äôs office and fill out a special application.  In it, inform that you want to restore access to the number.  As a rule, problems should not arise.  Of course, if the number is framed for you.  Otherwise, you will have to ask to write a statement from the one in whose name the card was issued.  That's all the problems.  Now you know one more option, how to unlock "SIM" "Beeline".  So far, everything is extremely simple.  Only in our reserve there is still a huge number of diverse approaches to solving today's problem.  Which ones?  Let's get to know them soon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock beeline number" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/854482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Enter PUK </h2><p>  For example, a situation may arise in which you entered the PIN code incorrectly several times.  Then the number is blocked automatically.  But each owner has the ability to quickly unlock.  Unfortunately, many people forget about this scenario. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that if you think about how to unlock the Beeline phone number after entering the PIN code incorrectly, you will have to resort to the use of the so-called Pak code.  It, as a rule, is issued along with a SIM card and a pin.  It is written next to the first code.  And it is used specifically for those cases when you forgot your pin code.  The case is not very common, but, nevertheless, it sometimes occurs. </p><p>  Of course, you will need to introduce a special combination.  Dial ** 05 * PUK1 code * then, after the space, a new pin code * repeat "pin" and dial #.  You can confirm the action.  After that, the so-called PIN1 will be restored.  Try to access the card.  This is usually enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock sim card beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/854481.jpg"></div>

    <p>  However, sometimes you will have to think about how to unlock the Beeline SIM card if you lose the so-called PIN2.  If it is entered incorrectly, then it is necessary to use a similar combination, as in the previous version.  Dial ** 052 * PUK2-code * new PIN-code2 * repeat PIN-code2 # and click on "dialer".  That's all.  You can use it to access the number.  It seems that so far everything is not very difficult to understand. </p><h2>  When PUK is lost </h2><p>  Sometimes users lose all the additional codes, after which they have to rack their brains for a very long time on how to unlock the Beeline card.  Now we will meet you with a trick that is relevant when you lose the PUK code. </p><p>  Independent forces in this case will not be possible to eliminate the problem.  You will need to contact any Beeline mobile phone office with a request to restore access to the card.  Problems will not arise if the "SIM" is framed for you.  If you use the service number, you will have to include all company data in the application.  Including TIN and address (legal). </p><p>  As a rule, after drawing up the application, access to the number is returned.  Usually after writing it should take about 2 hours.  After that, you won‚Äôt have to think about how to unlock the Beeline SIM card.  True, here everything is not going as well as we would like.  After all, there are a number of rather interesting cases in which it is necessary to carry out the process of unlocking a number.  And now we will get to know them a little closer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock a beeline phone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/854480.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Invalid PUK </h2><p>  Here is another rather rare, but very unpleasant moment.  It implies the incorrect introduction of the PUK code more than 10 times in a row.  In this case, the number is blocked completely.  And then you‚Äôll have to try hard to figure out how to unlock the Beeline SIM card. </p><p>  Fortunately, everything here is not as bad as it might seem.  You just have to replace the card.  And earlier I had to take a new number.  But now it‚Äôs enough just to write an application for restoration of access at any Beeline office, so that you are replaced with the same number.  As a rule, if you need to transfer contacts, then this service should be provided free of charge.  The only thing that can bring inconvenience here is a long wait.  Sometimes customers have to sit in the office for an hour waiting for the completion of the number change process. </p><h2>  Office call </h2><p>  Sometimes, for some reason, users block their numbers on their own.  But in this case, they may need to restore access.  If you‚Äôre thinking how to unlock a Beeline SIM card, you can try to call the office and communicate your intentions. </p><p>  Dial the number 8 800 700 0611, and then click "dial."  Now you have to name your passport data specified in the contract when issuing a SIM card.  Notify the operator of your intentions.  He will ask you for contact details and make sure that the owner of the SIM card speaks directly to him.  After that, you will regain access to the number.  True, you have to wait a while.  Typically, the waiting time is a couple of hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock beeline sim card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/854484.jpg"></div>

The thing is that every user who has lost access to the SIM card can restore it without any visit to mobile communication offices.  How?  Let's get it right. </p><p>  Of course, the Internet will help.
