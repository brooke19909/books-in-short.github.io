  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The city of Shemakha, Azerbaijan: history, description, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Shemakha in Azerbaijan is one of the oldest settlements in the country, with more than 2000 years of history.  It is the administrative and cultural center of the Shirvan region.  In recent years, the population has increased significantly, exceeding 30,000 people.  The main activities are agriculture and carpet weaving.  Recently, the assembly workshop of the Azsamand Iranian passenger cars began. </p><h2>  Geographical Information </h2><p>  Shemakha (Shamakhi) is located at an altitude of 749 meters above sea level in the southeastern foothills of the Caucasus, in the Pirsagat river valley.  The settlement is reliably sheltered by a mountain range protecting from northern winds.  In the past, the surrounding peaks served as defensive points when attacked by enemies.  The area abounds with clean mountain springs. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.63187310000001" data-lng="48.6363801" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/5/1/4851.png"></div><p>  The city of Shemakha (Azerbaijan) is located 122 kilometers west of Baku, on the Baku-Gazakh highway.  The nearest Desert Skys train station is about 25 km to the south. </p><p>  The climate is characterized by large temperature differences between seasons.  If in summer the average daily temperature reaches +30 ° C, then in winter frosts are not uncommon.  The amount of precipitation is moderate (595 mm per year), the maximum of which occurs in the spring months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="portal.azertag.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City in Azerbaijan" class="if uuid-2575706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2575706.jpg"></div><h2>  Seismic hazard </h2><p>  Shemakha is one of the most seismically dangerous cities in Azerbaijan.  Preserved data on 11 major earthquakes, after which the settlement had to be rebuilt.  The most destructive were the tremors in 1667, as a result of which a third of the houses lay in ruins, and the number of victims, according to Persian historians, exceeded 80,000. </p><h2>  Ancient history </h2><p>  Among all the cities in Azerbaijan, Shemakha is presumably the oldest.  The settlement was first mentioned under the name Kamachia by the Greek-Egyptian geographer Claudius Ptolemy in the I-II centuries.  He was part of Albania, a once-strong state in the Caucasus.  However, archaeological excavations revealed the remains of a large settlement dated to the middle of the first millennium BC. </p><p>  The city received its current name in honor of the Ijmakh tribe (shamake), who ruled in local lands in the IV century.  His rebirth began in the VI century, when the ruler of the Sassanid Empire, Khosrov I Anushirvan erected powerful fortifications.  Interestingly, despite the good security, Shamakha was often subjected to looting of neighboring khans and surrounding tribes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="history.echo.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunni Muslims" class="if uuid-2575656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2575656.jpg"></div><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  In the Middle Ages, the city was actually the capital of Azerbaijan.  From the 8th to the 15th centuries, Shemakha was the administrative center of the Shirvan state.  It was a large and rich settlement, trading with Persia, the Caucasian principalities, the khanates of Central Asia, India and even distant China. </p><p>  The recollections of the Venetian merchants and diplomats who visited Shemakha in 1476 are preserved: “This is a good city, it has from four to five thousand houses.  It produces silk, cotton, and other traditional products.  Most of the residents are Armenians. ”  By the way, the latter were forced to wear special tags on clothes that distinguished them from Muslims. </p><div class="photo" data-original="portal.azertag.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Juma mosque" class="if uuid-2575698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2575698.jpg"></div><h2>  Further development </h2><p>  In 1501, the region was conquered by the Persians.  Caravans passed through the city to the northern Caucasus, and then to the Golden Horde and Russia.  Significant funds were allocated for the development of Shemakha.  For example, in 1647 there were 70 mosques, 40 caravanserais, 40 schools for boys, and the number of residential buildings reached 7,000. </p><p>  In 1721, the Lezghins, with the support of Sunni Muslims, dissatisfied with the influence of foreigners and Armenians (who were the majority in the 60,000th city), looted Shemakha, causing him significant damage.  Many Russian merchants died, which led to the Russian-Persian war of 1722-1723.  Subsequently, troubled times of feuds and punitive operations of the Persians came, which forced the rulers of Shirvan to turn to the Russian Empire for help.  In 1805, losing another war, Iran was forced to cede Russian territory. </p><p>  The city was the capital of the governorate of Shamakhi (the future of Azerbaijan).  In 1859, Shemakha suffered a terrible earthquake, as a result of which the administration was moved to Baku.  This led to a decline, the number of inhabitants decreased to 20,000. </p><p>  After Azerbaijan gained independence, the city received a new incentive for development.  Here, not only traditional activities (carpet weaving, viticulture, animal husbandry) are preserved, but also new industrial enterprises are opened.  Factories for the production of consumer electronics and cars are operating, a medical diagnostic center has been built, and a modern telephone exchange has been installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sakitgol.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sightseeing Tours in Azerbaijan" class="if uuid-2575682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2575682.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Sightseeing tours to Azerbaijan are increasingly popular among residents of Russia and Europe.  The country's leadership invests heavily in the development of the tourism industry.  Thanks to the preserved historical monuments, Shemakha is a must-see place for visiting organized tourist groups.  After the opening of modern ski resorts in the region, individual travelers increasingly visit the city. </p><p>  What to see in Shamakhi?  First of all, it is: </p><ul><li>  The ruins of the Gulistan fortress, which for centuries protected the city, but now mostly destroyed. </li><li>  Juma mosque.  A wonderful example of the architecture of Caucasian masters.  One of the oldest mosques in Transcaucasia, built in 743 and subsequently rebuilt. </li><li>  Mausoleum of Eddie Gumbez. </li><li>  Imamzade Mosque. </li><li>  Alley of Martyrs. </li><li>  Shahandan cemetery. </li><li>  Heydar Aliyev Museum. </li></ul><p>  After visiting the architectural sights, you can explore the picturesque surroundings from the top of Pirdireki Mountain or refresh yourself in the waters of the Zogalavachan reservoir. </p>
