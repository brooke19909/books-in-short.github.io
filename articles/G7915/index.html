    <h2>  Credit Restructuring </h2><p>  In the bank in question, among other things, a <span>loan restructuring</span> service is available <span>.</span>  Why is this so common among customers?  Restructuring can be a reliable protection for both the borrower and his family.  It can be useful in case of unforeseen circumstances or a serious illness. </p><p>  What reasons are good enough to qualify for restructuring: </p><ul><li>  a sharp significant change in the exchange rate; </li><li><em></em>  stay on maternity leave; </li><li>  job loss or a significant reduction in wages; </li><li>  absolute or partial disability; </li><li>  any other circumstances that do not allow further payments on the loan according to the old scheme. </li></ul><p>  Loan restructuring can take many forms. </p><ul><li>  So, for example, for loans for the purchase of a car and consumer loans, it can be issued for no more than seven years.  In this case, a prerequisite - payments must end before the borrower is 65 years old. </li><li>  With mortgage loans the situation is somewhat more democratic.  Restructuring can be completed absolutely for any period up to the moment when the transaction participant is 65 years old. </li><li>  There may be a significant reduction in the payment that must be made every month, over a period that lasts from six months to a year. </li><li>  The bank may provide the client with a <span>grace period</span> for compensation of the main loan.  This means that at a certain time, which lasts from six months to a year, the borrower can pay the institution only interest that accrues on the balance of the mortgage debt, while the loan body may not be paid. </li></ul><p>  All of the above forms can be freely combined in order to make it more comfortable for the client to cooperate with the bank. </p><h2>  How to take advantage of the restructuring </h2><p>  How to become a member of this program?  To do this, you need to perform the following algorithm of actions: </p><p>  Provide the bank with a set of documents consisting of an application for participation in the debt restructuring program and those documents that are able to confirm the current state of affairs of the client financially.  This can be done personally in any department of the institution or by sending scanned documents to the bank‚Äôs email. </p><p>  Patiently expect a decision that the bank will make separately for your case.  As a rule, the financial institution under consideration needs no more than five working days in order to qualitatively consider all the information provided.  However, in some cases, the period for studying documents may be extended to some extent.  You should also be prepared for this. </p><p>  After your application has been reviewed by the bank, an authorized employee of this institution will contact you and inform you of the decision made in your case.  If it is positive, then the date and time of the conclusion of the debt restructuring transaction will be assigned. </p><p>  On the specified day and time, you will need to personally appear at the bank, provide a number of documents, including: </p><ul><li>  Life and health insurance risk insurance contract. </li><li>  Insurance contract for the risk of loss and damage to real estate. </li></ul><p>  Documents must be valid and meet all the requirements of the bank. </p><p>  If the previous loan was issued in foreign currency, then the loan currency can be changed.  To do this, you will need to submit the following documents to the institution in question, namely: </p><ul><li>  loan restructuring application; </li><li>  a declaration of will signed by the borrowers themselves, as well as by all members of his family, which confirms consent to the use of their personal information; </li><li>  documents, according to the list compiled by the bank itself (their list is also available on the official website of this institution); </li><li>  application of a client who wants to become a pledgor, which legally confirms the absence of bankruptcy proceedings against this client. </li></ul><p>  During the restructuring period, some documents must be signed.  So, for example, we are talking about an additional agreement to the current loan agreement, the current mortgage and the agreement to cancel the previous one.  The borrower and the representative of the bank in question must submit all these documents for registration to the Office of the Federal Registration Service within the first calendar month after the transaction has been completed. </p><p>  There are also some other features that can significantly reduce the debt load of the borrower.  For example, if this client had already successfully repaid loan debt ahead of schedule, the bank may decide to recalculate and reduce the amount of the monthly payment.  This is based on earlier payments made earlier.  Thus, a decision can be made to extend the actual deadline for repaying the loan to the original.  However, the expiration date of the loan agreement must still be taken into account.
