    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This issue often causes a lot of controversy among vacationers.  And this concerns hotels not only in Egypt, but also in other countries of the world.  In relation to Otium Golden (Sharm-El-Sheikh), the photo of which can be seen in this article, most of the guests were still satisfied with the level of catering.  According to them, the choice of dishes here was quite diverse for a four-star hotel category.  True, there was not as much meat as some would like, but this did not become any serious problem, since you could always try poultry, fish and seafood dishes.  In addition, the buffet always had several types of soups, appetizers, salads, fresh fruits, variously prepared vegetables (steamed, grilled, etc.), baked goods and delicious sweets.  Moreover, as guests note, there were dishes of both oriental cuisine (with a variety of seasonings) and familiar to our compatriots.  So everyone could find their own food in accordance with their taste preferences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt hotel otium golden sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1031820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since Otium Golden Hotel is not located on the first line, it does not have its own beach.  But its guests can freely use the beaches of two hotels included in the same hotel chain "Otium".  Moreover, the entire infrastructure (sunbeds, umbrellas, bar, snack bar, water park, etc.) is free for them.  As our compatriots note, you can walk from the hotel to the sea in leisurely steps in 10-15 minutes.  However, in the heat, doing this is not always pleasant.  But you can always get to the shore with the free bus provided by the hotel.  It runs between the hotel and the beach from morning to evening. </p><p>  The beach is sandy.  You can enter the sea both from the shore and from the pier.  Nearby there is a <span>coral reef.</span>  So be sure to bring a snorkeling mask with you. </p>
