Monkey Island Orchid Island</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most popular Vietnamese resort among Russians is Nha Trang, where you can relax and have fun, without experiencing any special problems with communication.  Russian language for local residents is understandable. </p><p>  Especially popular with most tourists are excursions to the northern islands of Nha Trang (reviews of them are presented in the article) located in Nyafu Bay.  These places attract not only wonderful animals and plants; tourism infrastructure is well developed on their territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nhatrangbeachreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Islands" class="if uuid-2736079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2736079.jpg"></div><h2>  Briefly about rest in Nha Trang </h2><p>  Vietnam has recently gained a reputation as a fashionable and popular tourist destination.  And rest and excursions in this country, especially in Nha Trang, are already a symbol of a successful vacation. </p><p>  In fact, the beach season in this country is almost all year round, not counting the rainy season.  There are wonderful bays, modern hotels and restaurants for every taste and budget, fabulous picturesque islands scattered along the entire coast.  Thanks to all this, the tourist destination Moscow-Nha Trang has become very popular with Russians in recent years. </p><p>  South Islands: </p><ul><li>  Winperl - an island connected to Nha Trang with <span>the longest cable car in the world</span> (a great place for children); </li><li>  Hon Mieu - the island is not for swimming, but there is a picturesque park and oceanarium; </li><li>  Hong Moon - a paradise for diving; </li><li>  Khon Tam - ecological reserve; </li><li>  Hon Mot is an island with underwater surprises (good for diving enthusiasts). </li></ul><p>  Northern Nha Trang Islands: Monkeys and Orchids.  About them and more detailed information is presented in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="dulichnhatrang.wikihoidap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orchid Island Park Area" class="if uuid-2736110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2736110.jpg"></div><h2>  Island Tours </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular routes at local travel agencies.  This tour costs about 25 dollars.  Her program includes visits to two islands of Nha Trang: Monkey Island and Orchid (or Elephant Island). </p><p>  An excursion as part of a group is cheaper (taken from the hotel, taken to the islands and fed).  A small minus is a too large group (14 or more people).  You can independently reach the islands.  To do this, drive to the northern port and buy a boat ticket to any island. </p><h2>  Orchid Island Attractions </h2><p>  He is the most developed and largest.  A trip to one of the northern islands of Nha Trang is especially pleasant for families with children.  She leaves a lot of vivid and unforgettable impressions.  The main objects of the island: </p><ul><li>  beach; </li><li>  ostrich and deer farm; </li><li>  circus with elephants and bears; </li><li>  orchid park; </li><li>  waterfall; </li><li>  stone sculpture garden. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="samtuoingoclinh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orchid Island" class="if uuid-2736101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2736101.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment and activities </h2><p>  On Nha Trang Orchid Island there is a beautifully equipped beach with a secure gentle entrance, with sunbeds and gazebos.  It is covered with pleasant fine sand.  Pets of deer and ostrich farms walk freely throughout the territory.  Visitors are allowed to feed and pet them.  You can ride on ostriches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Daily in a local small circus, performances are held with elephants and bears.  The main character is the elephant Lena, familiar to many tourists.  This good-natured animal gladly receives treats from visitors to the farm, rides (for a fee) and shakes on the trunk (for treats).  Visitors are allowed to take photos with their pets (elephants, bears and pythons), however, for a fee. </p><p>  On the way to the fabulous waterfall, no less wonderful landscapes open up.  Exotic plants, parrots, peacocks and other animals are also found here.  In the park by the stream during the flowering period of orchids, it is surprisingly beautiful.  The territory becomes like a carpet of buds of various shades and shapes.  In the purest water of the stream, thanks to convenient beaches, you can swim and do snorkeling (swimming in a mask with a breathing tube).  The garden of stone sculptures, which are figures of animals and various characters of myths and legends, is magnificent on this northern island of Nha Trang.  Near them, you can also take a photo. </p><h2>  Description of Monkey Island </h2><p>  There are many islands near the Nha Trang resort, but one of them is a full-fledged habitat of numerous monkeys.  It should be noted that primates fell on him not by chance and partly thanks to the Soviet Union.  During the Vietnam-Soviet friendship, there was a farm lab, which bred and used monkeys for experiments.  After the war, it was closed, but the animals left here were left to their own devices and began to actively breed.  The Vietnamese decided to use them as a kind of bait for tourists.  So there was an attraction in Nha Trang - the northern Monkey Island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnamtravel.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monkey Island Inhabitants" class="if uuid-2736082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2736082.jpg"></div><p>  This small island is only a couple of kilometers from the Vietnamese resort.  The monkey reserve is an amazingly beautiful park with well-groomed alleys and thickets of the jungle.  There is a small and cozy beach with shallow shores on the island.  For a fee, you can rent a gazebo and deck chair, as well as rent water equipment.  In the northern part of the island you can also go scuba diving by renting equipment at a dive station. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is 33 ha.  Here you can move not only on foot, but also on special mopeds (rental).  There is an opportunity to ride on a horse-drawn carriage. </p><h2>  Funny inhabitants of the island </h2><p>  The main characters of this northern island of Nha Trang are funny monkeys.  In extreme heat, they take refuge in the cool of the jungle.  You can lure them out of there only by refreshments.  Some of them, the smartest and smartest, run up on their own, only a tourist should start looking for something in his bag.  There are arrogant ones among them, who can even jump on their shoulders. </p><p>  It also happens that monkeys take food from visitors to the island, but this is not the worst tragedy.  These animals can grab anything: sunglasses, cameras, bags, bags and other items that are unattended.  There are a lot of monkeys, but there are people among tourists who leave the island a little disappointed due to the fact that not so many primates paid attention to them.  In reality, these animals can be forced to run from the thickets by asking the ranger to feed them (for a fee).  They immediately rush. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nhatrangtourday.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Food for Monkey Island Inhabitants" class="if uuid-2736107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2736107.jpg"></div><p>  According to some estimates of the reserve‚Äôs staff, today there are more than 1,500 primates on the island that have adapted perfectly to a small island in the sea. </p><h2>  Circus show </h2><p>  On Monkey Island you can see these funny animals and, on the other hand, at work.  There is a local circus here, which takes place several times a day.  In addition to monkeys, dogs, bears and elephants participate in it.  The show is interesting, but the methods of "training" using a stick can leave visitors with some unpleasant feeling.  At the end of the show, small "artists" collect "tips" from guests. </p><p>  It's nice to take a walk on the island and in a small cozy amusement park, which includes the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vietnampackagetravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monkey Island Beach" class="if uuid-2736151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2736151.jpg"></div><h2>  In conclusion about the reviews and tips of tourists </h2><p>  It is insanely exciting and interesting to travel to this resort place.  This is the opinion of many tourists who have visited the northern islands.  The route Moscow - Nha Trang is incredibly long (7730 kilometers).  But such a fabulous journey is worth it to see these exotic places with your own eyes.  The cost of tickets in this direction is about 20,000-25,000 rubles. </p><p>  According to tourist reviews, there are a lot of interesting things in Vietnam, especially on the islands.  In their reviews, many tourists write important tips on how to behave with local animals.  For example, you should not tease aggressively-minded monkeys, as there have been cases where ‚Äúcute‚Äù monkeys manage to bite tourists.  You should be careful and not make threatening and sudden movements.  Visitors with children should remember that small children should not be allowed to feed the monkeys with their hands, as macaques perceive them as their own - competing monkeys.  And teeth should not be shown: for these animals this is a sign of aggression, and they can attack. </p><p>  There is one more tip about swimming.  Some tourists do not recommend doing this after dinner, when the tide begins (it is not very convenient to walk on stones).  In general, a trip to the islands leaves an unforgettable experience. </p>
