The administration guarantees an unforgettable vacation when visiting, and therefore many travelers have already managed to visit this place.  Their reviews and a description of the infrastructure of the park can be found in this article.  Material is useful to everyone planning to relax in these places. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  There is only one water park in Adler, and therefore it is widely advertised among visiting tourists.  The institution begins to work at ten in the morning and ends late in the evening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of Amphibius Waterpark" class="if uuid-2378997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2378997.jpg"></div><p>  At six o‚Äôclock in the evening, there is a daily closing for a technical break, and it lasts until seven.  An adult will have to pay 1,200 rubles for entry, and for children from three to seven years, half as much.  The price drops to 800 rubles. If you enter after 19:30.  You can‚Äôt bring food with you and it‚Äôs recommended that you take interchangeable clothes.  Changing cabins are located on site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="f.otzyv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="adler water park" class="if uuid-2378583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2378583.jpg"></div><h2>  Accommodation and infrastructure </h2><p>  It is worth noting that in the popularity of the water park in Adler called "Amphibius" the location plays a big role.  It‚Äôs not so long to go to famous hotels located nearby, and that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt bypass the entertainment complex.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo hectares accommodates fifteen attractions of various kinds.  The summer and winter water park in Adler is positioned as a universal institution.  The administration guarantees the best vacation for extreme lovers and families with children.  Two slides called "Kamikaze" will give a descent at a speed of ten meters per second, with a total height of fifteen.  There are rides with more relaxed riding here.  These include the Lagoon, as well as the Giant.  Their total length reaches hundreds of meters and various turns along the way should give a lot of positive emotions to guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="water park amphibius adler" class="if uuid-2378584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2378584.jpg"></div><h2>  The rest of the infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to adult rides and slides, Adler Waterpark prepared special places for children to relax.  For children, a swimming pool is equipped with a length of sixty meters and a width of fifteen.  Depth starts from twenty centimeters and reaches 120. </p><p>  For adults, they also prepared three pools in case of a desire to relax in warm water.  One of them under the name "Keg" has the most unusual structure.  The length of the pools is from 20 to 24 meters, the amount of space depends on the visitors.  As the largest extreme sports, the Blue Hall slide with a length of a hundred meters and a steep descent with bends is positioned. </p><p>  There are catering facilities in the park in case visitors get hungry.  In a special cafe for children, you can order delicious sweet dishes.  In the evening, visitors are invited to go to the Faraon grill bar, which is located directly on the ship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sochisite.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="water park adler reviews" class="if uuid-2378587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2378587.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Most of the guests after visiting the Amfibius water park in Adler were satisfied.  This is especially true for tourists who visited such establishments for the first time.  Then the slides seem like a pleasant entertainment, although this is a rather controversial aspect. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most attractive, judging by the reviews, is the infrastructure for children with pools, safe rides and cafes with delicious cocktails.  Many families say that they could not take their child away from the water park, this adventure was so exciting for the baby.  A territory of two hectares is usually enough with a small influx of visitors, but at the height of the season there are problems with accommodation.  The administration is closely monitoring the cleanliness.  Sun beds are arranged quite densely in relation to each other, but this makes it possible to accommodate a huge number of them.  That is why there are no problems with finding a place for tanning.  The positive reviews about this park end there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adler.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in adler photo" class="if uuid-2378593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2378593.jpg"></div><h2>  A lot of negativity </h2><p>  Negative reviews about the Adler water park sound on a par with positive ones, although some points are noticed even by those who liked the rest in this place. </p><p>  The main thing that I want to note is that fans of adrenaline in the blood, extreme sports and thrill will be incredibly bored here.  Three slides and several slopes can surprise only those who have never before visited a water park.  For experienced visitors, after the first half hour, only the option with a tan or relaxation in the pool will remain. </p><p>  Another significant drawback are the prices on the territory of the entertainment institution.  It is forbidden to bring food with you, but the cost of a regular lunch is several times more expensive than outside the water park.  As a result, the desire to visit cafes and restaurants quickly disappears. </p><p>  An interesting point is that children are allowed on dangerous rides from only ten years old.  If you go with a child from seven years to nine, you will have to pay as for an adult, and the slides will be available to him only for children. </p><p>  Some users have recorded cases of poisoning in children after visiting the institution.  Complaints were about not too clear water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter water park in adler" class="if uuid-2378595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2378595.jpg"></div><h2>  A few tips to have a good time </h2><p>  If the photos of the water park in Adler did not immediately impress you, then going there is undesirable.  There are few slides and attractions; extreme sports fans should save money.  For a family time, the place is suitable if there is a supply of money or a desire to violate the ban on bringing food with you. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth coming here in the morning to spend as much time as you see fit.  Clothes for changing clothes should be taken with you, beach cabins are located on the territory.  If you can see a large number of visitors inside, it is better to wait for a more comfortable time.  In addition, the territory of the water park is almost always unpleasantly noisy and there are many lines. </p>
