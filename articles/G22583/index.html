    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  The opening of the Centra Maris Resort Jomtien 4 * took place in December 2015.

It is located a few kilometers from Pattaya - one of the main <span>resorts in Thailand.</span>  The center of this large city is a 30-minute drive away.  U-Tapao International Airport is a 50-minute drive away.  It takes about two hours to get to Bangkok. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the hotel are various tourist attractions.  The beach, according to many, is far away.  But there the guests bring a bus.  Although many walk - it takes about 15-20 minutes. </p><p>  Although the hotel is new, but in the holiday season of 2016, it received a fairly large number of tourists.  And, if you believe the reviews (they will be affected by attention a little later), then many would like to return here. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Centra Maris Resort Jomtien 4 * provides all the services and amenities that any good hotel should have.  Free high-speed Internet (Wi-Fi) is available throughout the hotel, private parking is available nearby, and the reception is open 24 hours a day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a tour desk, a left-luggage office, a concierge (guests can use his services), a nanny (relevant for visitors with children), and a laundry service.  Even a modern conference room is organized. </p><p>  Shuttle services and food delivery services to the apartments are also available.
