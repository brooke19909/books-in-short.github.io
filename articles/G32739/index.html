Even a person who has never been interested in this archipelago must have heard of Komodo Park or <span>the</span> Borobudur <span>Buddhist temple</span> , as if descended from the screen, from films about Indiana Jones.  But here is what can impress the imagination of even an experienced tourist Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu + Lakes of Tears.  Such a unique natural spectacle can no longer be found in any corner of the world.  And most interestingly, this complex spontaneously changes over time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kelimutu mountain indonesia" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/591656.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pride of indonesia </h2><p>  <span>The island of Flores,</span> on which Mount Kelimutu (Indonesia) is located, is part of the group of Eastern <span>Minor Sunda Islands.</span>  The mountain itself is a volcano and part of the Ring of Fire.  In total, the island has 14 volcanoes, and some of them are in "working condition", in connection with which earthquakes are not uncommon.  Kelimutu is considered extinct, although the last eruption occurred in 1968, so making such conclusions is premature.  You cannot call the volcano particularly high: it does not reach one meter to the mark of 1640 m. At the same time, it is an object of active tourist interest.  And all thanks to the Lakes of Tears. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kelimutu volcano" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/591655.jpg" width="600"></div>

When the lava poured out, the top of the mountain sank, and depressions called calderas appeared.  Since there is no effluent from them, precipitation gradually accumulated in them, as a result of which this natural wonder was formed.  The color of these lakes is especially attractive to people: regardless of each other, they change their color.  This is what the <span>Lakes of Tears</span> (or evil spirits) and Mount Kelimutu (Indonesia) are famous for - photos from different angles reflect an unforgettable sight that this extinct volcano represents.  Note that the two lakes are close by, almost touching each other.  The third from them is at a distance of almost one and a half kilometers. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Each of the lakes has its own name.  Those that are adjacent are called Tivu-Ata-Mbupu and Tivu-Nua-Muri-Kooh-Tai.  The first name translates as "Lake of the Elderly" or "Lake of the Souls of the Ancestors."  The second means "Lake of the boys and girls."  The third, located in the distance, is called Tivu-Ata-Polo, in the translation "Enchanted", "Lake of the enchanted people" or "Lake of the sorcerers" - it depends on how the interpreter voiced you.  According to the beliefs of local residents, in the colorful lakes the souls of the dead end their journey.  In Tivu-Ata-Mbupu, the spirits of sages and elders live, in Tivu-Nua-Muri-Kooh-Tai - children and youth, and in Tivu-Ata-Polo - sinners and evil sorcerers.  Traditions say that if you disturb, anger or insult the spirits living in the ponds that crown Mount Kelimutu (Indonesia) is crowned with, then the water in them will begin to change its color.  Probably, someone already touched the dead with something, since this phenomenon has happened more than once: now the lakes have a dense black, turquoise and green hues, but just a few years ago the range was different: burgundy - black - blue-green.  Tivu-Nua-Muri-Kookh-Tai altogether for a quarter century changed shades a dozen times.  Probably because it has become a haven for children, and they are very restless and unstable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indonesia mountain kelimutu lake of tears" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/591657.jpg" width="600"></div>

Solfatara enters one of the lakes - a crack through which hydrochloric acid and hydrogen sulfide enter it.  The latter, upon contact with oxygen in the atmosphere, turns into sulfuric acid.  Both compounds are very active, and since the lakes are very mineralized, chemical reactions occur in them, on which the <span>color of the water</span> depends <span>.</span>  While one of the lakes had a red tint, this spoke of the interaction of iron and hydrogen sulfide;  now the color is almost close to black.  All tones of green and blue are the result of different concentrations of the aforementioned acids and their reactions with various components of the lakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kelimutu mountain indonesia photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/591658.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <h2>  Way to a miracle </h2><p>  Mount Kelimutu (Indonesia), is part of a national park, which is relatively small, but is located quite far from the benefits of civilization - it‚Äôs 60 kilometers to the nearest city.  Therefore, Moni village, which is located directly at the foot of volcanoes, enjoys the great love of travelers.  Here you can not only relax, but also hear a variety of details (often very contradictory) of local legends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kelimutu volcano photo" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/591703.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To see the colorful lakes, it is most convenient to land in the End.  From there goes a minibus to Moni;  people who are not saving on costs can hire a taxi or rent a scooter. </p><p>  Another option is to catch a plane to Maumere;  True, this city is further from Kelimutu, 105 kilometers away, but for many tourists this route is more convenient for their reasons.  From there also buses go to Moni;  you‚Äôll have to spend 3-4 hours on the way - depending on what the weather is like and if there was a scree after the earthquake. </p><p>  Minibuses go to the mountains from Moni, and already to the craters you have to climb the stairs - as many as 13 kilometers. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  The observation platforms that Mount Kelimutu (Indonesia) is equipped with are fenced for safety.  Moving them is strictly forbidden - and do not ignore this ban.  The guide will gladly tell you about the young Dane, who wanted to take a photo from an unexpected angle and fell into the Lake of Young Souls.  By the way, his body was never found. </p><p>  The best view of the Lakes of Tears opens at dawn - later there is a high probability of fog, because of which it is often impossible to see anything. </p><p>  It is better to go down to dusk - the mountains are dangerous in the dark, and it comes very abruptly.  Try to go in a group: lakes have highly hazardous fumes, from which people lose consciousness.  In the crowd there will be someone to bear the fallen. </p><p>  When traveling in Indonesia, do not miss the Kelimutu volcano - the photos you take in these places will long remind you of visiting truly wonderful places.  And they will prove incredulous that the lakes are really colorful. </p>
