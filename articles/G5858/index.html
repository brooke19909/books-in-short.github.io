You can go on a trip for the weekend, May holidays or on vacation.  In any case, a trip to Tallinn will be interesting, eventful and memorable. </p><h2>  Travel options </h2><p>  In our article we want to talk about what you need to know about a trip to Tallinn.  You can visit the capital of Estonia for the weekend - this is a very common option.  The ancient medieval city has long attracted tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.booking.com/articles/destination-inspiration-tallinn-estonia.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Tallinn" class="if uuid-2487909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487909.jpg"></div><p>  You can organize an independent trip to Tallinn by bus or train.  And of course, the most convenient option is to travel by car.  By car, even a short trip can be turned into a real adventure.  Own transport gives freedom of movement, so for one trip you can see not only Tallinn itself, but also the nearest surroundings.  So, for example, you can walk through the forests, visit castles, admire the Estonian waterfalls, admire the sea villages and even plunge into the world of Estonian culture and nature. </p><p>  All major parks and attractions can be seen, for example, during a day trip by car to Tallinn from St. Petersburg.  However, if you wish, you can get to this beautiful city from any corner of our country if you buy, for example, a bus tour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bus ride </h2><p>  Numerous travel companies offer trips to Tallinn by bus (from St. Petersburg, Moscow and many other cities).  In this case, you have a choice of tour programs and travel duration.  Tour operators guarantee a ride on comfortable buses with a guide.  Nevertheless, many tourists prefer independent travel, which give freedom of movement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="auto.geenius.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A trip to Tallinn by bus" class="if uuid-2487896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487896.jpg"></div><p>  Residents of St. Petersburg and the surrounding regions are lucky in this regard, since they can go on a trip to Tallinn by bus on a weekend tour, which is very convenient.  The road and the Estonian capital is not too long, and therefore tireless.  In addition, carriers provide comfortable buses.  Up to ten flights are offered daily from <span>St. Petersburg bus stations</span> .  The duration of the trip from St. Petersburg to Tallinn by bus is six to seven hours, since the distance between cities is only 370 kilometers. </p><p>  Many companies offer their services, among them: Lux Express (ticket price from 700 rubles), Temptrans (from 840 rubles), EcoLines (from 550 rubles), etc. Each carrier sends at least two buses in a day.  Therefore, tourists have the opportunity to choose the best time and fare for themselves.  Bus trips to Tallinn are very popular among travelers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Train ride </h2><p>  It is possible to travel to Tallinn and by train.  So, for example, from St. Petersburg you can take a ticket for the Baltic Express to the Estonian capital.  The train leaves from Moscow station in St. Petersburg at 6.25. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railway station in Tallinn" class="if uuid-2487902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487902.jpg"></div><p>  The road takes about seven hours.  A train ticket will cost tourists much more than a bus: a coupe - from 3,100 rubles, a seating - 1,700 rubles, a luxury - more than 6 thousand. </p><h2>  To Tallinn by plane </h2><p>  <span>Trips to Tallinn</span> from St. Petersburg are convenient due to the insignificant distance between cities.  But despite this, there is also air traffic between St. Petersburg and the capital of Estonia.  Regular flights will interest those who want to save time.  The duration of the flight is only one hour.  The cost of round-trip tickets is slightly more than five thousand rubles, which is lower than the fare in the train compartment.  And the flight time is much less. </p><h2>  Trip from Moscow </h2><p>  A trip to Tallinn is also possible from Moscow.  The distance between cities is about a thousand kilometers, so the buses fade into the background.  For Muscovites, trips to Tallinn by train or plane are more relevant.  The flight to the Estonian capital takes about two hours.  A ticket will cost more than 10 thousand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Between Tallinn and Moscow runs the Baltic Express, which we mentioned earlier.  He passes through St. Petersburg.  The cost of the ticket is more than 6 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Car trip </h2><p>  Many tourists prefer an independent trip to Tallinn by car.  Such a trip has many advantages, because you decide where to go and what to see.  You do not depend on anyone, you can at your discretion adjust the viewing time of a place.  In addition, you can develop an individual route for yourself, including only objects of interest to you.  When planning a trip to Tallinn by car, check out local traffic rules in advance, consider the route, select a list of attractions, and collect all the necessary documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.postimees.ee" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.postimees.ee/801744/riigikontroll-piiriuletuse-kiirus-soltub-vene-tolli-toost"><img itemprop="image" alt="Border crossing" class="if uuid-2487913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487913.jpg"></div><p>  To get to the Estonian capital, you have to cross the border at checkpoints: Kunichina Gora - Koidula, Shumilkino - Luhamaa, Ivangorod - Narva.  The nearest checkpoint to St. Petersburg is located in Ivangorod, however, you can stand in line for up to five hours here.  To regulate the queues, the Estonian authorities created a reservation service for crossing the border of the country.  You can use it on the online service.  How effective is it is for you to judge. </p><h2>  What you need to know about travel </h2><p>  To travel to Tallinn by car, you must have a number of documents with you.  This is a Schengen visa, passport, car and medical insurance, driver‚Äôs license, certificate of registration of the car. </p><p>  If you are coming from St. Petersburg, it is more logical to cross the border in Ivangorod.  Before the rest of the checkpoint you have to make a big detour, which is illogical.  At night, there are few cars at the border.  Crossing it takes no more than forty minutes.  The place is incredibly picturesque, since <span>Narva Castle</span> and Ivangorod Fortress are almost opposite each other.  At night, they are illuminated by lights, which makes them look just fabulous. </p><p>  Further from Narva to Tallinn it is necessary to overcome another 210 kilometers.  The road after the border consists of two lanes.  It passes through small villages.  Seventy kilometers to Tallinn, the highway passes into a 4-lane highway. </p><p>  In the Estonian capital, it is necessary to immediately solve the parking problem, since there are very high fines for parking in the wrong place.  It is worthwhile to carefully study the plan of parking areas.  It is most convenient to use the parking lot of the hotel where you plan to stay.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, check the availability of parking and immediately reserve a place for your car. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Every tourist wonders what to see in Tallinn.  The trip can be longer or very short, so you need to have time to visit the main attractions.  Their list will vary depending on the length of stay in the Estonian capital and your preferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maaleht.delfi.ee" data-author=": " data-source="http://maaleht.delfi.ee/news/eestielu/arhiiv/haaleta-tallinna-vanalinn-laanemere-piirkonna-imeks?id=64457808"><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the old part of the city" class="if uuid-2487918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487918.jpg"></div><p>  The first thing to see during a trip to Tallinn (whether a tour is planned for the weekend, or for a longer time - it does not matter) is the Old Town.  It is quite small and resembles a single pedestrian-tourist zone.  In Tallinn, amazingly preserved ancient buildings of the medieval era.  It is very interesting to walk along the old streets of the city, immersed in the atmosphere of past centuries.  Local cafes stylized as the Middle Ages will help you to plunge deeper into the atmosphere of antiquity.  To visit one of them is an obligatory item of the program.  Tourists recommend going to the Old Hansa restaurant or to the medieval tavern located in the town hall building.  Here you can enjoy dishes and drinks typical of that era.  And the food itself will be served on the table in rough clay dishes. </p><h2>  Old city </h2><p>  If you plan a trip to Tallinn for 2 days, then you should start exploring the capital from the Old Town.  The main attractions are concentrated here.  It is worth noting that in Tallinn, literally every street or house in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe old city has its own history.  Even a simple walk will bring a lot of impressions. </p><p>  In ancient times, the center of any town in Europe was the town hall and the square in front of it.  Only representatives of the upper class could get into the building itself, but the squares were open for free access.  The heart of Tallinn is the Town Hall Square.  It has long been organized fairs, celebrations, executions, and all significant events in the city.  Absolutely all excursion walks in Tallinn begin with the Town Hall Square.  The area was formed in the period of 14-20 centuries.  At this time, buildings were being built around it.  At all times, the area was the center of attraction of all segments of the population.  Theaters gave their performances here, the market worked, musicians and acrobats performed. </p><p>  The main square of the city is a unique place, because it is from here that you can simultaneously see the spiers of the town hall, the Dome Cathedral, the churches of Niguliste, P√ºhavaimu and Olevist. </p><p>  She is beautiful at any time of the year.  In summer, it is decorated with bright summer restaurants and cafes, and in winter - a fluffy spruce appears, which is set in the very center. </p><h2>  City wall </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine Tallinn without the city wall, which is the main attraction and symbol of the city.  A powerful stone fence has a height of about twenty meters.  Fortifications were built around the city to protect against enemy attacks as early as the thirteenth century.  The city walls were also equipped with 50 tall towers.  To this day, less than half of them have survived.  And yet the structure still looks magnificent. </p><p>  Tourists have the opportunity not only to walk near the wall, but also visit the towers.  The most important of them is now a military museum.  Visitors not only examine the armor and weapons of the twelfth century, but also descend into secret rooms in the building's dungeon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pilt.delfi.ee" data-author=": " data-source="http://pilt.delfi.ee/picture/7823815/"><img itemprop="image" alt="City wall" class="if uuid-2487921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487921.jpg"></div><p>  The most beautiful of all the towers is called Fat Margarita.  A museum also operates within its walls.  Its exposition is dedicated to maritime affairs. </p><h2>  House of the Blackheads </h2><p>  Walking along Pikk Street, you can see the House of the Brotherhood of Blackheads.  Behind such a mysterious name lies the union of foreign merchants created in the fourteenth century.  The Merchants Association was created for joint ventures.  Merchants purchased the building, which was later called the House of the Blackheads. </p><p>  At one time, not everyone was accepted into the community.  It was not enough to be considered a successful entrepreneur; marital status was of great importance.  Surprisingly, all the merchants of this community were not married.  The brotherhood lasted until the mid-twentieth century, then it was dispersed.  And the building itself passed into municipal ownership. </p><h2>  The Dome Cathedral </h2><p>  The white-stone cathedral is dedicated to St. Mary.  It is considered one of the oldest temples in Tallinn.  The Dome Cathedral was consecrated back in 1240.  Over the centuries, the temple was rebuilt and restored several times, but nevertheless, many relics remained in its interiors.  There are burial places of the thirteenth century, epitaphs and coats of arms of noble families.  Among the ancient burial places there is also the grave of explorer I.F. Kruzenshtern. </p><h2>  Toompea Castle </h2><p>  The famous <span>Toompea Castle is</span> simply impossible to miss.  It is located on the mountain of the same name in the very center of the city.  The castle was built in the thirteenth century and is perfectly preserved to this day.  At one time he was a concentration of power in the city.  Since the knights erected a stone fortress, all the foreign kings and kings who ruled Estonia used it as their residence.  The castle has not lost its significance even now.  A parliament sits within its walls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://travel.sygic.com/zh/poi/zuo-tang-shan-cheng-bao-poi:2308"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tompea Castle" class="if uuid-2487926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487926.jpg"></div><p>  The fortress was rebuilt and restored many times throughout history, but at the same time, the masters managed to preserve its original features.  The castle complex includes the Long Herman Tower, which is 46 meters high.  She is a national symbol.  By tradition, the Estonian flag is raised daily to its peak. </p><h2>  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral </h2><p>  There are many Orthodox churches in Tallinn, among which the cathedral of Alexander Nevsky stands out.  The domes of the magnificent structure are visible from almost anywhere in the city, and the ringing of bells is heard even beyond its borders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aleksander_Nevski_katedraal.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Nevsky Cathedral" class="if uuid-2487932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487932.jpg"></div><p>  The cathedral was built over a hundred years ago.  A church also existed in the same place earlier, but it no longer accommodated all believers, so it was decided to build a new church.  The fate of the building has been threatened more than once.  In the thirties, the temple was generally listed for demolition.  But still he managed to defend.  Then, during the war, they wanted to destroy him, later they planned to place a planetarium in the building.  Nevertheless, the cathedral remained safe and sound. </p><h2>  Niguliste church </h2><p>  A notable attraction of the city is the Niguliste Church.  The building is equipped with a high spire, which is visible from almost anywhere in the city.  The Lutheran Church was built in the thirteenth century in honor of St. Nicholas, who is the patron saint of all sailors. </p><p>  Before the war, the temple was operational.  But then his activity was terminated.  During the bombing, the temple was badly damaged.  Later, the building was restored and opened as a branch of the Tallinn Art Museum.  Now in the exposition of the institution are church items dating from the 16-17th centuries.  The church periodically hosts concerts of organ music. </p><h2>  Tallinn Zoo </h2><p>  If you come to Tallinn with children, then you should visit the city zoo.  It is located in the city, but most of it is forest.  About 8 thousand animals live on its territory.  The construction of the zoo was started in 1937, when Estonian shooters brought a small lynx from the competition.  Since the animal needed to live somewhere, the city residents decided to organize a real zoo, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich had been discussed for a long time.  Rysenok Illu became its first inhabitant and a real symbol.  The staff of the institution did not disperse their forces in all directions, and therefore it was decided to work in several directions.  Currently, the zoo boasts an impressive collection of birds, among which you can see a huge variety of cranes, vultures, eagles and owls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maminuklubs.lv" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.maminuklubs.lv/sieviesu-klubs/zoo-darzs-tallina-un-vecpilseta-264013/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Tallinn" class="if uuid-2487934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2487934.jpg"></div><p>  The main activity of the institution is the care of endangered representatives.  In recent years, ten Amur leopards have been born at the zoo, which are on the verge of extinction. </p><p>  Children will surely enjoy walking and feeding animals. </p><h2>  Olevist Church </h2><p>  Among the numerous churches in Tallinn, one can also distinguish the Baptist church of Oleviste.  It got its name from the name of the Norwegian king Olaf II.  The exact date of construction of the temple is still unknown.  It is assumed that this happened in 1267. </p><p>  Until the sixteenth century, the church remained the tallest religious building in the world.  It was because of the height that the temple repeatedly suffered from natural elements.  The spire on the building attracted lightning, from which several times even fires occurred.  Now the temple is open to all believers.  And tourists can climb to the observation deck of the building. </p>
