It can be a cannon, warship, plane or tank.  They make crafts from a variety of materials - from colored paper and kitchen sponges, matchboxes and old shoeboxes, from cardboard and newspaper tubes.  You can make a card an application, or you can surprise a loved one with an original craft - folding paper. </p><p>  The article will examine in detail how to make origami tanks.  Those who are already familiar with the ancient art of folding paper figures know that it is most convenient to collect crafts either according to printed patterns, or following the work of the masters on the video.  Any origami is assembled from a square sheet of paper.  To create the tank, prepare double-sided green printer paper. </p><h2>  Two ways to cut a square </h2><p>  Before making an origami tank, prepare a square from a sheet in A4 format.  The easiest and fastest way is to fold one of the corners of the rectangle to the opposite side, as in the photo below.  The side excess strip is cut off with scissors.  By expanding the workpiece, you get a square whose side is 21 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a square" class="if uuid-3253002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253002.jpg"></div><p>  However, you can make an origami paper tank, the size of the blank for which should be larger.  How to quickly cut a square of a different size so that it is even and the corners are straight.  The second way is to use graph paper.  It can be bought at any stationery store and, having counted the required number of centimeters, cut a square of any size.  This is a convenient way to make templates for origami, so many masters use it by sticking a pattern on cardboard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make an origami T-34 tank </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the legendary T-34 tank was created.  This is not only the best and fastest tank of the time, but also the machine that brought victory closer to this terrible war.  Of course, origami masters could not ignore this popular and famous model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami pattern" class="if uuid-3253004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253004.jpg"></div><p>  Above is a diagram of how to make an origami tank from a square, the size of the sides of which is 21 cm, that is, made by folding a sheet in A4 format.  Read the diagram in the order of the numbers next to each figure. </p><h2>  How to fold the basic Double Square shape </h2><p>  In the origami diagram above under No. 1 there is an already folded figure.  Fans of this technique are familiar with this basic form, which is often found in work.  For beginners, we will tell you how to make an origami tank using a blank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a basic triangle" class="if uuid-3253021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253021.jpg"></div><p>  A square of paper is folded in half, first diagonally and then in the usual way.  Turn the workpiece angle to you and press the side squares along the diagonal line inward.  The result is a figure in which the lower and upper surfaces are square, and inside they are bent in half and are represented by rectangular triangles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Folding paper step by step </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at how to make an origami tank in stages from paper in accordance with the scheme numbers: </p><ol><li>  On the first base form, do 3 folds. </li><li>  Expand the workpiece to its original position and press inward the central small square, as well as the zipper fold.  Smooth everything gently with your hands. </li><li>  Fold the fold out. </li><li>  On the future tank tower, bend the corners on the sides from two sides. </li><li>  Wrap the sides and the lower corner inward, away from you. </li><li>  Lift up the bottom of the top layer of paper to the dotted line in the illustration. </li><li>  Spread the pockets on the sides, lower the triangle back down and turn the workpiece over to the other side. </li><li>  Repeat the side folds in the same way as the first side. </li><li>  Lift the triangle up to the dotted line level. </li><li>  Just as on the back, straighten the "pockets" and lower the part back down. </li><li>  It remains to bend the barrel of the gun and raise the lower edges inward. </li><li>  Align the barrel of the gun by lowering its top edge down. </li></ol><p>  To make the origami look like a real tank, complement the work with small elements of colored paper.  Glue the caterpillar wheels to the body and the red star to the tower. </p><h2>  Origami volumetric tank </h2><p>  The craft of this type of military equipment looks beautiful, if it is voluminous.  It is composed of several separate parts.  This is a paper tube muzzle, the hull of the tank and its tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper tank" class="if uuid-3251922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3251922.jpg"></div><p>  With the seeming difficulty, anyone, even a novice master, can make an origami tank with their own hands.  Further we will describe in detail its manufacture.  For work, it is necessary to prepare a sheet of thick paper in A4 format, cutting it in half in length. </p><h2>  Body manufacture </h2><p>  The size of the strip is 10x30 cm. Bend the extreme corners to the opposite side from one and the other edge.  When you roll the paper back, you will see diagonal folds.  The next step is to turn the sidewalls inward so that the bends are directly at the junction of the diagonals.  By pressing the paper with your fingers, make a triangle with an "accordion" inside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fold the hull of a tank" class="if uuid-3253029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253029.jpg"></div><p>  Then, on one side, attach the lower corners of the triangle to its top and iron the folds well.  On the other hand, after repeating the procedure, bend the right angles of the formed small triangles in the middle so that they touch each other in the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an origami paper tank" class="if uuid-3253033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253033.jpg"></div><p>  Bend the long side stripes in the middle until you connect to the triangles of the edges.  Flip over to the other side and secure the edges with a paper latch. </p><h2>  End of work </h2><p>  Turn the tank body upside down and bend all the corners inward, bend the resulting strips outward and iron the triangles with your fingers.  Next you need to make the tank tracks.  To do this, bend the edges of the outer strip to the fold line, and then lift them at an angle of 90 ¬∞ to the body. </p><p>  How to make an origami tank further, look at the video: </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="HJemo4tZCE0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJemo4tZCE0&amp;t=136s" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/8/2/9/0/18290.jpg"></div><p>  Any boy will be delighted with such a toy.  It turns out to be durable, so the child will be able to play calmly, not being afraid that the tank will fall apart.  Be sure to try to make a craft yourself.  Good luck </p>
