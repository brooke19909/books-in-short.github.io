    <p>  In the methodological sense, such a record is significantly different from traditional provisions.  The fact is that when debit subaccount.  75.1 receivables are generated.  An asset is created immediately for the amount of participants' obligations.  This case is considered the only one in accounting.  As a rule, obligations that arise under the terms of the contract are not reflected.  The accountant records only that debt that comes from the execution of the agreement.  For example, a liability arising from a supply contract is not reflected.  In this case, the debt on the already delivered batch of products is shown.  A feature that is provided for sc.  75 drafters of the plan must be considered.  When calculating liquidity ratios and coverage, quasi-receivables should be removed from the amount that provides liabilities.  75 the account arose, in fact, because there is a dogma according to which, at that moment, as soon as the company is created, its authorized capital should be immediately reflected in the statements.  Participants can deposit different assets into it.  If they are paid in kind, then they must undergo an independent appraisal.  When deposits are received, a record is made: </p><ul><li>  The debit of items on the reflection of cash, MPZ, etc. </li><li>  Credit subaccount  75.1 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="account 75 postings" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1122281.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Sale of shares </h2><p>  Due to it, the AO replenishes its charter capital.  When selling securities at a price exceeding the <span>face value,</span> the account is credited to this difference.  83. This method is proposed by the developers of recommendations to the Chart of Accounts.  Theoretically, the reflection of the operation is allowed in dB sc.  98.1.  This is because, in accordance with the current accounting principles, the amount of the authorized capital cannot be changed.  In this regard, it was proposed to introduce a regulatory account.  83. But the overpaid funds should be correlated with the forthcoming expenses only if they become the real income of the enterprise. </p><h2>  Features of profit payments </h2><p>  Subch  75.2 is used for settlement with founders who are not on the staff of the company.  It was said above that if the participant is an employee of the company, then monetary transactions with him are reflected on the account.  70. When the payment of income is announced, an entry is made: DB 84 Cd 75.2. </p><p>  From the amount accrued by the accountant taxes are withheld: DB 75.2 Cd 68. </p>
