Every year it is produced in huge quantities by beer corporations across the planet.  A can of beer is a container with a hoppy foamy drink.  But such containers are also used to store low-alcohol and non-alcoholic liquids.  The most common volumes of aluminum containers in the CIS countries: </p><ul><li>  330 ml; </li><li>  500 ml; </li><li>  pint - 568 ml (more popular in Europe). </li></ul><p>  The record holder for the production of a variety of cans of beer is Japan.  Here you can find 160 types of containers of the same size.  In addition, Japan surprises with a drink of the most unusual varieties: blue, <span>green beer.</span>  By Valentine's Day, chocolate beer is produced in limited quantities in the country.  European brands surprise both the smallest (150 ml) and quite weighty liter cans of beer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artsbeercans.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beer can" class="if uuid-2450511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2450511.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The date of invention of metal containers for beer is January 24, 1935.  It was a lighter and more durable alternative to glass bottles.  In addition, more advertising was placed on aluminum cans of beer.  The first containers had a cylindrical shape.  For their manufacture, three pieces of iron were required.  Included with the container was a special key that needed to uncork the container.  The first can of beer was very difficult compared to the modern counterpart.  She weighed 992 g (35 ounces).  Now the weight of the can is 15-20 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Can of beer with a neck </h2><p>  A little later, a competitor appeared in a cylinder-shaped container.  A can with a neck was much more convenient than its brother and immediately gained popularity.  Such banks were nicknamed Cone top.  Due to the conical top, the container was very similar to a classic beer bottle.  From above, it was closed with a cork, which was undoubtedly more convenient than opening the container with a knife. </p><p>  Buyers appreciated the convenience of the neck, but they did not like the taste of metal that appeared in the drink.  The solution was found quickly: from the inside, the cans began to be coated with a special varnish, which was originally invented for the needs of electricity.  In the photo you can see a can of beer with a neck, what is its unusual shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.merrillsauction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="can of beer with a neck" class="if uuid-2450518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2450518.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the popularity of this form of hops drink was fleeting.  The Second World War dictated its own rules.  A lot of metal was spent on the production of weapons, so they tried to reduce its use in all other industries. </p><p>  When the war came to an end, the production of containers with a neck was never able to reach a new round.  The last batch of legendary cans was released in 1960.  The problem arose with the transportation of cans with a neck.  Because of their shape, they took up much more space than cylindrical containers.  Gradually, designers came to the most optimal form of a truncated cylinder, which is also a more economical option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Legendary ring </h2><p>  In 1963, a can in the form of a truncated cylinder is equipped with a valve.  The first ring completely came off the container, which was not very convenient.  In addition, beer lovers threw valves everywhere, polluting the environment. </p><p>  The first eye that remained on the bank was invented in 1975 by Ermal Freise.  It acquired the name stay-on tab. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beer opening rings" class="if uuid-2450513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2450513.jpg"></div><h2>  Glass jar </h2><p>  Not so long ago, the Crown company proposed to the court of fans of a hoppy drink a container model that, when opened, turns almost into a glass.  This form of cans did not live up to the hopes of manufacturers, so they had to abandon it. </p><h2>  Two holes </h2><p>  The MilllerCoors brand in 2012 offered customers a new design of cans with two holes.  Tara was called Punch Top Can.  Such a container can be easily opened with anything. </p><h2>  The first can of beer in the USSR </h2><p>  The first brand of hop drink, which was produced in metal cans in the USSR, was the Golden Ring.  The issue was dedicated to the XXII Summer Olympic Games.  This event occurred in 1980. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  Tanks are made of double-rolled steel.  Manufacturers strive to make containers as light and thin as possible.  The Japanese became the record holder in this matter.  The company ‚ÄúKirin‚Äù created an ultralight container, the volume of which is 350 ml, and the weight is 14 g. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.foundshit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Truncated Cylinder Jars" class="if uuid-2450512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2450512.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Something else interesting about beer cans. </p><ol><li>  Some manufacturers invent interesting ‚Äútricks‚Äù for profit growth.  For example, the Boddingtons Pub El brand puts special capsules in a jar to increase the amount of foam when poured into a glass. </li><li>  Churchkey produced the drink in a regular can and added a can opener to it.  The commercial gives detailed instructions on how to use it. </li><li>  The scandal occurred when the American producers of New England Brewing released a batch of foamy drink featuring Mahatma Gandhi.  On the can of light ale Gandhi-Bot was a signature saying that the alcoholic drink promotes self-purification, the search for truth and love.  After the trial, the Americans had to apologize to the people of India. </li><li>  Fans of plinking (shooting at various targets) like to use beer cans in their arsenal. </li><li>  Greek Nikos Floros made a tare outfit in the style of surreal pop art. </li><li>  In Australia (the city of Darwin), an unusual regatta takes place every year.  Its participants build floating equipment from aluminum containers.  The most interesting exhibits are a functioning submarine and a galley, the size of which reaches 13 meters. </li><li>  From beer cans that just do not build.  American Bob Bishob became famous throughout the world for making a real airplane out of empty cans.  He is able to cover a fairly decent distance.  Its production took 11,000 thousand copies. </li><li>  Mike Reynolds (America) from beer containers designs real buildings.  For construction use blocks of 8 cans.  They are fastened with cement.  Building beer cans is cheap, and the buildings are strong.  For Americans, in whom most of the houses in the country are built of wood, this method does not seem surprising. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="petspa.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beer can cake" class="if uuid-2450514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2450514.jpg"></div><p>  In aluminum cans, the foamy drink suffers from sunlight and oxygen.  The best beer is draft.  It is stored in kegs.  Beer cans are simply a greatly reduced copy of such containers.  More than 3600 liters of hops drink contains the largest beer tank on the planet.  The capacity has the following dimensions: </p><ul><li>  height - 5 m; </li><li>  diameter - 2 m; </li><li>  weight - 400 kg. </li></ul><p>  If you have a friend or loved one who is an avid beer lover, you can surprise him by presenting a drink instead of a traditional cake on his birthday, but in the form of a birthday cake from cans of beer.  He will surely appreciate your efforts.  It is not difficult to make such a gift with your own hands. </p>
