Oled TV: prices, overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, technological progress is developing very rapidly.  For example, as early as 20 years ago, few in our country knew about the existence of a computer.  Now the PC is in almost every home.  Every day new gadgets appear, and old technologies are modernized. </p><p>  So, relatively recently (in March 2013), Oled-TVs began to be actively distributed.  What it is?  This is what we will talk about in this article.  We will examine in detail the features of this modern technology, talk about its advantages, disadvantages, etc. </p><h2>  Oled Technology </h2><p>  First, a few words about the technology itself.  Oled (from English organic light-emitting diode) is a special technology based on a semiconductor device made of special organic compounds.  These compounds can actively emit light if an electric current is passed through them.  The fact that organic materials are capable of electroluminescence (non-thermal luminescence, which is excited by electricity) was learned back in the 1950s.  The discovery was made by the French scientist Andre Bernanoz. </p><p>  But how is this technology used in televisions?  What are the highlights of Oled TVs?  What it is?  You can read about this and much more in this article. </p><h2>  Oled TVs: what is it? </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Old technologies can be found in the modern world.  A great example of this is Oled TVs.  What is it and what does it eat with?  You will find answers to these questions here. </p><p>  A characteristic feature of Oled-TVs is the matrix, in which organic LEDs are the main functional elements.  That is, in these televisions, organic elements are combined with electronics.  By passing an electric discharge through natural compounds, they get a bright glow.  And using phosphors, you can get high-quality glow of any color. </p><p>  In theory, this sounds very good, but how is everything in practice?  In fact, TVs with an Oled-screen have a lot of advantages, which we will talk about below. </p><h2>  Positive features </h2>

    <p>  Perhaps the first and most important advantage is the incredibly high brightness and contrast settings.  Organic LEDs provide a wide range of illumination.  Thanks to them, you can adjust the brightness from the minimum values ‚Äã‚Äã(for comfortable operation at night) and ending with a striking brightness of up to 100 thousand cd / m2.  As for contrast, on the Oled-TV you can get a phenomenal level of 10,000,000 to 1. Of course, such indicators are unattainable for other TVs. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another advantage is compactness.  Oled-TVs have very small dimensions and weight.  Again, all thanks to the very same organic LEDs that have amazing electroluminescence.  Because of this, the need for backlighting is completely eliminated.  Accordingly, without backlight, a lot of space is saved in the case. </p><p>  In addition, unusual LEDs allow manufacturers to produce new matrices that have a very large viewing angle.  This means that the Oled-TV can be viewed from any angle and the picture quality will remain at the same level without any distortion.  This feature will probably come in handy for those who like to watch movies in the family circle or in a large group of friends. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the matrices for Oled-TVs have an amazing response time.  Even in the most dynamic scenes or when the landscape changes abruptly, you will not notice an inertial footprint that is directly related to the great response. </p><p>  And finally, it‚Äôs worth mentioning the cost of electricity.  For some time, there were rumors that Oled-TVs are very voracious and require a lot of electricity.  However, it turned out quite the opposite.  Oled-TVs consume much less energy than the same LCD. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the advantages of Oled TVs, there are also disadvantages.  Perhaps the main drawback of such a device is its fragility.  Organic LEDs cannot boast a long lifespan.  Red and green LEDs can work for tens of thousands of hours (a pretty decent indicator).  The main problem is that the blue LED works for about 18 thousand hours (something about two years).  At the moment, active development of durable LEDs is underway.  In the meantime, buyers are forced to enjoy the amazing image for only a couple of years, and then watch the distorted image. </p><p>  Another drawback that does not allow many to purchase an OLED TV is the price.  Compared with Led TVs, Oled models are sky-high.  After all, the most interesting thing is that everything should be the other way around.  In theory, the production of Oled displays is much less expensive.  And this means that TVs with <span>organic LEDs</span> should be cheaper than liquid crystal ones.  But why is everything completely different in practice?  The thing is that the production technology of Oled displays has not yet been fully mastered.  This, in turn, leads to a significant increase in price. </p><h2>  Should I buy an Oled TV? </h2>

    <p>  Everything here is purely individual.  Of course, it‚Äôs best to wait a couple of years.  As it was written at the very beginning of the article, technologies are developing very quickly.  And that means in the next few years, the main disadvantages of Oled-TVs will be fixed and the technology will begin to spread massively.  It‚Äôs better to wait a year or two and get a quality product than to get an optimized and raw device now. </p><h2>  Best Oled TVs </h2><p>  If the above does not convince you and you are ready to give a lot of money to be one of the first to try out new technology, then let's look at the best models of Oled-TVs from various companies. </p><p>  At the moment, there are very few companies that produce Oled-TVs.  This is due to the fact that huge financial resources are needed to master the new technology.  Accordingly, only large companies like Samsung or LG can produce such TVs.  We‚Äôll talk about their products now. </p><h2>  Samsung Oled TVs </h2>

    <p>  Samsung KN55S9CAFXZA is a delightful representative of Samsung Oled TVs.  The diagonal of the screen is as much as 55 inches.  Combined with new technology, this will give an amazing picture.  It is also worth saying a few words about a special function called Smart TV.  TVs of the current generation are controlled by voice or gestures.  Thanks to this, the control has become much more responsive and convenient.  In addition, Samsung KN55S9CAFXZA has another interesting feature called Smart Dual View.  Thanks to this mode, you can simultaneously watch 2 TV programs on one TV.  The new model has been improved browser.  Now you can chat on social networks or watch videos on YouTube without any delay.  Do not forget that the Samsung KN55S9CAFXZA is also an active 3D Oled-TV.  Thanks to new technology, the picture will become much more realistic and juicier.  In the end, we can say that the Samsung KN55S9CAFXZA is a delightful Oled-TV.  The price for it varies within 10,000 dollars. </p><h2>  Oled TVs LG </h2>

    <p>  The 55EA9800 is currently the <span>best LG Oled TV</span> .  The price of such a device is about $ 9,000 (cheaper than the counterpart from Samsung).  The diagonal of the display is 55 inches.  LG 55EA9800 has a ton of useful features.  For example, the TV supports Skype.  In addition, there are standard features like voice control, Picture-in-Picture mode, etc. Interestingly, the TV has 24p True Cinema support.  With it, you can view movies in the quality in which they were shot (i.e. 24 frames per second).  Like most modern TVs, the LG 55EA9800 is able to connect to Wi-Fi. </p>
