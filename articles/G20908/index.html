    <h2>  Sanatorium "Krasny Bor" (Smolensk): reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the rest in this sanatorium are very diverse, they reflect both the pros and cons of this medical institution.  To begin with, let's dwell on the merits of a health resort.  Most visitors note a high level of medical care, wellness procedures.  In addition, many note excellent excursion programs and leisure activities in general.  But among the shortcomings, most patients call poor living conditions: the health resort infrastructure corresponds to 60-70 years of the last century, cramped rooms, small bathrooms, the room conditions are poor, household appliances are morally obsolete, the territory of the sanatorium is poorly maintained, overgrown with grass, residential buildings need not even in a major overhaul, but in the demolition and construction of new ones, in some rooms windows are broken, electric wires stick out from the walls, plumbing does not work, entrance doors are broken and much more.  There are many negative reviews about nutrition, which can be summarized by the fact that patients often survive thanks to the grocery store located in the health resort.  In addition, some visitors complain that the rooms are rented to strangers who are not undergoing treatment at this institution, such residents often come here for entertainment, behave noisily, drink alcohol, start fireworks and interfere with patients' relaxation. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort Krasny Bor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457696.jpg" width="342"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  According to official information distributed by the administration of the public health agency on the Internet and advertising leaflets, rest and treatment in the sanatorium will leave unforgettable impressions, as well as a charge of vivacity and positive emotions for the year ahead, when you feel that for the first time, you will definitely want to return to Krasny Bor .  However, according to patient reviews, a completely different picture is emerging.  True, in fairness it is worth noting that most reviews say that health care in a health resort is at a very high level.  But living conditions are just terrible.  Although, maybe this is the subjective opinion of people who are accustomed to elite world resorts?  It is difficult to say, because, judging by the number of negative reviews, there is actually not all good.  It's a shame that the administration pays a lot of attention to the medical side and completely forgets about the household component. </p>
