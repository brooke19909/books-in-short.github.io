Covers for tablets help in this unambiguously, protecting the device from mechanical damage, moisture and sunlight.  The market offers budget and cheap models from various materials in any configuration.  Let's review the models, finding out in more detail their practicality and features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bingapis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original tablet cases" class="if uuid-2416589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2416589.jpg"></div><h2>  Leather modifications </h2><p>  Genuine leather tablet cases are a great choice.  They are resistant to wear, durable, are made with various patterns in several colors, have excellent protective properties. </p><p>  Products may vary in type of dressing and origin.  Classical suede and nubuck are included in this category.  The material is not inferior to the skin, has a beautiful appearance.  Such modifications are more expensive than analogues, but surpass them in basic characteristics. </p><h2>  Fabric variations </h2><p>  The 10-inch tablet case and other fabric versions are made from natural or artificial components.  There are many similar materials on the market.  Cotton or linen products must have a reliable coating and high density to provide adequate protection for your computer from moisture and shock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who are not going to change the cover often will find analogues of artificial fabric.  They are stronger than natural variations, more resistant to abrasion, do not fade under the influence of sunlight.  Such models have an affordable price and a pretty decent life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bluemaize.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best tablet case" class="if uuid-2416602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2416602.jpg"></div><h2>  Leatherette </h2><p>  Modern copies of genuine leather are almost indistinguishable visually and by touch.  Manufacturers have successfully learned to repeat the texture and patterns of classic material.  The most inexpensive covers for tablets are made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride).  This option cannot be called optimal, since the product does not tolerate temperature extremes and has an unpleasant pungent smell of chemical origin.  Not the best impact the material has on the environment in terms of ecology. </p><p>  Modification of PVC is appropriate when there is an urgent need to save.  If the choice fell on dermatin, prefer artificial leather made of polyurethane (the second name is eco-leather).  The material does not contain harmful impurities, does not smell, is resistant to abrasion, has an affordable price. </p><h2>  Silicone Tablet Cases </h2><p>  Such models are convenient in operation, although they have a uniform design.  Products are made of thick silicone, but do not give a one hundred percent guarantee of gadget protection in the event of a fall.  These options are devoid of a rigid base, protect the device only from chips and scratches.  The advantages of such cases include the fact that they fit well in the hand, do not slip, are easily removed and put on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cons of silicone products: </p><ul><li>  For each tablet model, a specific <span>case is</span> selected <span>(universal</span> variations are not provided). </li><li>  There is a possibility of rupture during operation. </li><li>  Cheap modifications have an unpleasant chemical smell. </li><li>  Silicone gets dirty quickly. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bingapis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 inch tablet case" class="if uuid-2416584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2416584.jpg"></div><h2>  Plastic cases </h2><p>  A case for a <span>tablet of 7 inches</span> and other sizes made of plastic is the cheapest option.  They are available in the form of a bumper or a back cover.  Such products are presented on the market in a wide range. </p><p>  Modifications among themselves differ in composition, color, pattern and type of coating (matte, glossy coatings, soft touch).  These cases protect the gadget well from splashes, scratches and chips, but are not effective when struck or dropped. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Covers for the Samsung tablet, like most other brands, differ in design.  Main categories are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Overlays.  The indicated versions are most often made of silicone or plastic; they practically do not affect the mass of the main device.  The main protection - against splashes, scratches, chips, minimally protects from falls and bumps.  The device monitor is especially susceptible to any negative effects. </li><li>  Folders or bags.  Cases of this type are great for transporting the gadget, providing protection from various types of exposure.  Nevertheless, to work with the device it will be necessary to get it out of the cover completely. </li><li>  Books.  These modifications are one of the most popular in their segment.  They optimally combine protective options and ease of use.  The material for the manufacture of such covers are various materials on a rigid basis.  They can be focused on a specific model or act as a universal product suitable for most devices of a certain size.  Many of the bookcase cases are transformed into a stand, which adds another plus.  Among the shortcomings are large dimensions and a decent weight. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bluemaize.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Case bag for tablet" class="if uuid-2416600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2416600.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations of users and specialists </h2><p>  When choosing a case for tablet 10.1 and other sizes, consumers are advised to pay attention to the following points: </p><ul><li>  Models in a dark color retain a presentable appearance longer, scuffs and small scratches are almost invisible. </li><li>  When choosing a universal case, you should pay attention to the diagonal of the screen, since manufacturers take into account this particular factor.  Some manufacturers equip products with additional internal or external compartments (for credit cards, business cards, pens, and other trifles). </li><li>  Each buyer has the right to decide for himself whether he will purchase a cheap cover for one season or an expensive thing for long-term use.  In one and the other case, there are pros and cons. </li><li>  For children, it is better to buy bright, inexpensive, but durable modifications.  On average, the cost of one simplest instance starts from 300-500 rubles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bluemaize.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Matter Tablet Case" class="if uuid-2416598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2416598.jpg"></div><h2>  For everyday use </h2><p>  If you often have to travel around the city or on business trips, and you can‚Äôt part with the gadget, the best option would be a case for an 8, 7, 10 inch tablet on foam rubber.  It is equipped with a soft inner gasket, which assumes the force of extraneous impact.  It is light weight and does not burden the main device. </p><p>  Modifications are available in various colors, with zipper or Velcro.  The material is scratch resistant, easy to wear.  The only drawback is that to work with a computer, it must be completely removed from the case. </p><h2>  Coasters </h2><p>  No less popular are such cases for tablets.  Some variations allow you to transform the case into an elegant stand.  Using a keyboard or mouse, you can use the tablet as a desktop computer.  The maximum protection of such products is aimed mainly at the front of the gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avatarandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather tablet case" class="if uuid-2416605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2416605.jpg"></div><p>  Among the stands, there are several categories: </p><ul><li>  Magnetic models. </li><li>  Plastic options. </li><li>  Versions with special fasteners. </li></ul><p>  With this case, you can work with the device directly in a taxi, subway or minibus.  It is possible to get and put together a design in only a few seconds. </p>
