Some even decide to stay at home.  However, is it worth spending your vacation to spend it where you will have to spend the next working months?  Tunisia is a great place to relax, where there is everything for this.  Comfortable hotels, the azure sea, the gentle sun, interesting sights.  This is a country with a rich enough history, so having been there, a person will definitely take home a lot of positive impressions, vivid photographs and, possibly, even a desire to return there again. </p>
