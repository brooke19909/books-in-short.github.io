They consume little electricity, which attract buyers.  Many do not understand the labeling of <span>LED lamps.</span>  It is important to understand what is indicated on the product.  With the right approach to the choice of a lighting device, a person receives the desired lighting.  Marking of LED-lamps is necessary so that the buyer can easily find a suitable option for himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sparkfruit.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED bulbs and specifications" class="if uuid-3154005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3154005.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Nowadays, a large number of citizens switched to LED lighting.  This type of device has its advantages: </p><ol><li>  Long service life. </li><li>  High energy efficiency ratio. </li><li>  Lamps respond quickly to a blackout. </li><li>  Resistant to mechanical stress (diodes are not afraid of shaking). </li><li>  The operating temperature of these lamps is low. </li><li>  They are resistant to power surges. </li><li>  You can adjust the luminous flux, direct to certain objects in the house. </li><li>  Suitable for zone lighting. </li></ol><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  This type of lamp has practically no drawbacks.  The disadvantages include the fact that by the end of its life the product loses its brightness. </p><h2>  Classification of LED light sources </h2><p>  Marking of LED lamps helps a person to choose certain parameters and choose the right model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="come-home-to-copper.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp" class="if uuid-3153992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3153992.jpg"></div><p>  On the packaging you can see the purpose of the lamp, as well as the type of device.  Using the marking on the box, it is indicated what type of cap is on this product.  The classification of LED lamps helps a person quickly navigate the presented variety of light sources. </p><h2>  Labeling Features </h2><p>  At this point, you need to pay special attention.  Marking of LED lamps is carried out according to certain standards.  The product shall indicate: </p><ol><li>  LED lamp power.  The options are: 10W and 25W. </li><li>  The period of uninterrupted operation.  Most often indicate the time period, which is 50 thousand hours.  The service life depends on the device manufacturer. </li><li>  On each package you can see an indicator of the degree of energy savings of the light source.  It is usually designated as A, A +.  The lettering A +++ is also found. </li><li>  On some lamps, you can see the designation A55.  It stands for a standard flask.  There are also mirror and matte.  Candle shaped flasks are in demand. </li></ol><p>  What else to look for: </p><ol><li>  View of the base of a particular lamp. </li><li>  Color rendering index, brightness of the device. </li><li>  The luminous flux of the desired model. </li><li>  Technical features of the device. </li><li>  Permissible temperature for operation.  Most often on packages indicate an interval from -40 degrees to +40 degrees. <div class="photo" data-original="greenfuture.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp classification" class="if uuid-3153987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3153987.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  If the buyer understands the labeling of LED lamps, it will be easy for him to pick up the device.  The purchased product will last a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Differences in products for home and street </h2><p>  The types and characteristics of LED lamps differ depending on their purpose.  Light sources are for home, warehouse, street.  Labeling will vary depending on the purpose of the device. </p><p>  An LED lamp is suitable for an apartment.  Her base will be E27 or E14.  On the street, LED lamps are often used as lights for individual areas.  These devices are an additional light source.  For home, you can now buy a ball lamp.  It does not take up much space and gives a pleasant light to the eyes. </p><h2>  What are the different types of products? </h2><p>  Manufacturers divide LED lamps into the following types, which have their own characteristics: </p><ol><li>  For general use (for example, intended for private houses, apartments).  They are also used in offices. </li><li>  LED lamps of a searchlight type.  They are used to illuminate the street, suburban area. </li><li>  Linear  They can be used as a replacement for fluorescent lamps. <div class="photo" data-original="www.mysunlight.co.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lamp types and specifications" class="if uuid-3154001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3154001.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Cap Features </h2><p>  LED light sources are available with different caps.  LED lamps with a standard type of base are in great demand among citizens.  They are indicated by the letter E. It is distinguished by a threaded connection directly with the cartridge.  The diameter of the threaded connection is indicated next to the letter.  If it is standard, then E27 is written.  This type of lamp is installed in chandeliers, table lamps, as well as sconces. </p><p>  To create bright lighting in a country house, people use lamps with an E40 socket.  If the letters G and U are indicated on the packaging, then the base is equipped with a pin connection, with a thickening at the ends.  A distance of ten millimeters is provided between the pins.  Lamps are great for special ceiling lights. </p><p>  Currently, LED models are being produced, which are labeled as GU5.3.  These devices are suitable for spotlights.  With them we get unusual lighting of space.  Spot lighting is necessary when a person wants to emphasize certain details in the interior with a play of light or he likes diffused light. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led lamp types" class="if uuid-3154009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3154009.jpg"></div><p>  If there is a mark G on the base, then it refers to the pin.  Most often it is used in linear products. </p><p>  LED lamps can be installed instead of fluorescent lamps due to the tube type bulb.  Such compounds are labeled G13.  For the ceiling, there are lamps marked GX53. </p><h2>  Why is it important to choose the right light output and color rendering? </h2><p>  For human vision, the correct organization of the supply of light is necessary.  Of great importance is the color reproduction of the object on which the light falls.  You need to select the appropriate color rendering index.  The luminous flux also affects the supply of lighting. </p><p>  Color rendering ensures that the lamp correctly reproduces the natural colors of Ra.  The luminous flux is responsible for the power of lighting.  It is customary to measure in lumens.  On each package, manufacturers write the power of the light output of the lamp.  It is usually higher with LED light sources than with standard lamps.  It must be remembered that the brightness of the LED source decreases as it is used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED types and characteristics" class="if uuid-3154006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3154006.jpg"></div><h2>  Nuances when buying an LED light source </h2><p>  Experts do not recommend buying LED lamps for a children's bedroom.  The light from this type of product has a blue tint.  Even if you choose a warm tone, it will still be different from the sun.  In the nursery, it is recommended to put models whose light is close to the sun. </p><p>  It is noted that many manufacturers overestimate the lamp life.  When buying, you need to save a check from the store.  If the product fails before the due date, it can be replaced with a new one. </p><p>  If the light starts to pulsate when you turn on the device, it means that the lamp has a factory defect.  In such a situation, it can also be exchanged for a new one.  It is important to remove the flashing device immediately, as it is harmful to eyesight. </p><p>  It is important to choose quality products.  If the manufacturer leaves his contacts on the packaging, then he is confident in the quality of his products.  If the packaging does not contain markings or contacts of the manufacturer, then this product is not recommended for purchase for further use. </p><p>  An important role in choosing a light source is played by the degree of protection of LED lamps.  Moisture and dust must not enter the device.  The price of the lamp will depend on the degree of protection of the lamp.  It is better not to save on this parameter.  Then the device will last longer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.delightfull.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamps types and characteristics" class="if uuid-3154011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3154011.jpg"></div><p>  Pay attention to the power of the light source.  Electricity bills in the apartment will depend on this parameter.  Typically, a LED lamp has a constant voltage rating of 12 volts.  This type of luminaire has a special converter that allows the light source to work from a 220 V network.  The manufacturer must indicate this characteristic on the product. </p><p>  LED lamps come with a light diffuser.  If it is not, then the LEDs are installed at different angles.  As a result, the flow of light can propagate from 60 degrees to 120 degrees. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined what types of LED lamps are.  As you can see, there are a large number of models.  Therefore, before going to the store, you need to determine in advance the base, color rendering settings and other characteristics. </p>
