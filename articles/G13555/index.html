Close attention is being paid to the development of tourism and the implementation of the Veduchi ski resort project in Chechnya.  After all, this project can become one of the main drivers of economic development.  The first tourists in the ski resort should appear at the beginning of 2018. </p><h2>  How did the construction begin? </h2><p>  The project is very complex, like any construction in the mountains.  The difficulty is connected with the laying of routes, the construction of infrastructure and roads in the mountains.  When planning this ski resort, negotiations were held with construction companies in Germany, Israel and Turkey.  The costs for each object were fully calculated, and an estimate was obtained of how effective this project would be for the republic.  As a result, an agreement was signed between the OJSC <span>‚ÄúResorts of the North Caucasus (KSK)‚Äù</span> and LLC ‚ÄúVeduchi‚Äù on the construction of a ski resort. </p>

    <p>  It is planned by the end of 2017 in parallel with the construction of infrastructure facilities of the resort to open commercial hunting and fishing in this territory.  This will be a good help for the development of the region, but most importantly, the population will get a job, satisfying the needs of tourists who come on vacation and for entertainment.  It is planned until 2025 to create 720 jobs involved in the resort area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Investor Attraction </h2><p>  The project is being implemented as a state development program for the North Caucasus, for which about 6.5 billion rubles were allocated.  The result of this project is the possible creation of a special economic zone in the Itum-Kalinsky district, which is located in the picturesque Argun Gorge.  This is very beneficial for investors who will invest in project facilities.  The municipality will automatically exempt them from taxes for a period specified by law.  <span>Ruslan Baysarov</span> believes that anyone who wants to work can open his own business and get his own benefit from the project.  That is, the investor who comes and develops a restaurant and hotel business here, and the number of objects is not limited, will be exempted from a number of taxes: on property, land, and salary. </p><h2>  What is included in the construction plans? </h2><p>  A road is being built from Grozny to the Veduchi ski resort.  The opening of this route will allow an hour to get from the airport of the <span>capital of Chechnya</span> to the village of Veduchi.  A lot of work has already been done to electrify the district and provide it with water. </p>

    <p>  The French company POMA is one of the leaders in world transport systems.  Its ropeways are in 63 countries, and the manufactured and installed lifts of this company over many years of operation have shown excellent operating results.  There was not a single accident on more than 700 cable cars.  The POMA company participated in a competition held by KSK OJSC and got the opportunity to build cable cars in a ski resort.  In September 2016, a work schedule and construction deadlines were agreed with this company.  During the year, a minimum infrastructure should be created to launch the first slope, and by the end of the year the project of the first launch complex should be ready. </p><h2>  Adjustment work </h2><p>  The opening of the Veduchi ski resort in Chechnya, which was supposed to take place by the end of the year, is postponed to the beginning of 2018.  According to the press, in December 2017, <span>commissioning</span> will begin at the complex and, most likely, only a technical launch can be carried out.  And also with the management of KSK OJSC, an agreement was reached to comply with the work schedule.  Currently, in the resort area there are partially constructed objects of tourist infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chechnya ski resort leading opening" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2163458.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What will be the tracks at the resort? </h2><p>  The plans of construction organizations to make 19 runs of varying difficulty from green to black.  They will pass in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe northern slopes of the Daneduk ridge.  The estimated length of the tracks is about 30 km.  The project has 8 cable lifts and one baby lift.  The height of the highest point of the route is 2980 meters.  It is expected that the route, whose length is more than twelve kilometers, and the descent will take about 20 minutes, will be unique.  Of all the tracks of the future ski resort Veduchi, in 2017, one was ready, tested by famous athletes from Russia, Europe and the USA during the presentation of the project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="building a ski resort" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2163457.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The resort administration plans to have a snowboard park, a trail for beginners, as well as a children's ski town and a free riding area.  In addition to ski slopes, cross-country trails will be laid in the resort.  For summer sports, platforms for roller-skating, ATVs, rafting will be created.  Colossal plans! </p><h2>  What will Veduchi resort look like? </h2><p>  The view of the resort itself will be unusual.  According to the project, a complex of several chalets and a comfortable hotel will be built in the resort.  It is the architectural appearance of buildings that is unusual, made in the style that is traditional for these places.  This is a view of the <span>Chechen towers.</span>  So all administrative buildings will be completed.  Cafes and restaurants are also in the design stage.  There will be several of them throughout the ski resort of Veduchi.  Some cafes will be built at the highest point of the resort. </p>
