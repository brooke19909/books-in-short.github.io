It is simply impossible to make competent sound mixing without a really good audio system.  Studio monitors are specifically designed to make it possible to process sound as efficiently as possible, remove everything superfluous from it, and even change it.  Such a system will not make a person a professional, but it will greatly facilitate the work and improve its quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thehub.musiciansfriend.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap studio monitors" class="if uuid-2341562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341562.jpg"></div><h2>  Not only screen </h2><p>  Most people understand a monitor as a display for a computer.  The output device visual information.  However, the term itself is much broader, and it does not mean any particular device. </p><p>  In the last century, science fiction writers used to call monitors systems for monitoring the state of something, developed robots with artificial intelligence, and even research objects.  They only assumed what our future would be like.  This is precisely what created the temptation to give objects various beautiful names.  However, progress did not stand still, and the term was improved.  Appeared visual information output devices.  More mundane, these are computer monitors.  It is this understanding that is rooted in the minds of people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the term implied any device that would allow people to control a process or define it.  Studio monitors are not a display.  Moreover, it is a means of outputting audio information.  Most of all, they resemble ordinary speakers, but they are not. </p><h2>  Ideal for working with sound. </h2><p>  Many beginner sound engineers and simply video editors dream of an ideal audio system.  One that would allow you to step by step control the balance of the instruments, hear the slightest changes in the sound, track the tiniest side effects of compressing the track, speakers that can provide the most clear sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="harman.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Very expensive studio monitors" class="if uuid-2341565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341565.jpg"></div><p>  Conventional, even the most expensive, but not professional systems are poorly suited for these purposes.  An ordinary consumer always wants to get a clean and pleasant sound, but at work it is not so important.  Studio monitors provide not pleasant sounding of the track, but give the editor the opportunity to hear even the most minor defects in the recording.  Knowing the existence of defects and side effects of various plug-ins, you can significantly improve the sound. </p><h2>  What is the feature? </h2><p>  The first thing you need to learn is that monitors are not ordinary speakers.  This is a professional tool, and you just don‚Äôt need to get it.  One of the main features is a narrow specialization.  It is inefficient to use such equipment outside the walls of a workroom made of noise-absorbing materials.  Otherwise, instead of pleasant music, listeners may hear aggravated defects, which will be unpleasant for everyone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are two types of design for studio monitors, these are: </p><ul><li>  Active.  This design includes a built-in sound amplifier, which eliminates many problems, especially when recording. </li><li>  Passive.  There is no amplifier in this solution.  Many professionals prefer just such a system.  It is believed that in conjunction with a separate amplifier, they will work better than any active system. </li></ul><h2>  Size matters </h2><p>  Monitors are also divided into near, middle and long range.  It directly depends on the size of the speakers.  Each of them is very specialized and designed for premises of a certain type.  In other words, it all depends on the quadrature and content of the studio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.audiomentor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small professional studio" class="if uuid-2341563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341563.jpg"></div><p>  For a small home or just a small studio working with sound, short-range monitors will be enough.  Also, any device will be much more useful if the room is soundproofed.  Especially if the ceiling and walls are covered with sharp foam rubber echo-absorbing materials. </p><h2>  For those who make music </h2><p>  Working with an announcer's voice and making music are two completely different tasks.  Studio monitors for music will be much more expensive.  They are demanding on sound insulation and are very powerful.  Often for such purposes they acquire not a loud audio system, but special headphones.  According to many sound engineers, it is much more convenient to pick up the rhythm of a song and hear the flaws in the headphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="musiccritic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional studio with monitors" class="if uuid-2341561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341561.jpg"></div><p>  For those who process announcer voices or mount video projects, headphones, on the contrary, will not be very useful.  It is much easier and more efficient to equip a small room with small echo absorbers and short-radius monitors. </p><h2>  Midfield Monitors </h2><p>  Such systems expand the possibilities in the field of recognition of low frequencies.  The fact is that for monitors of a small field this feature is significantly limited.  As a pleasant bonus, there will be the possibility of full control over those sound effects that listeners will not hear close, but those who are far away will certainly be distinguished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arionlegacy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful studio monitors for home studio" class="if uuid-2341567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341567.jpg"></div><h2>  Far Field Monitors </h2><p>  If someone asks which studio monitors are the best, then we can safely say that those that are far field systems.  They can be safely called universal.  They are used in large and modern studios.  They differ in that they allow you to control all frequencies, listen to music and voice over at any volume.  Working with such equipment becomes much easier.  Their only drawback is the really great price. </p><h2>  Connection method </h2><p>  When purchasing new equipment, each of us must read the instructions.  In almost the whole world, this rule is being violated, and people are really wondering how to connect studio monitors.  Begin by installing them.  They need to be positioned so that they are at the same height with the ears.  Racks with monitors are carried out a little forward and are installed slightly on the sides.  If you mentally connect the monitors to the sound engineer‚Äôs head with invisible edges, you should get an isosceles triangle.  In this position, they will be most effective.  Incorrect placement will not only not have a positive effect, but in addition will ruin everything.  Due to their specificity, monitors do not make sound better.  Incorrect placement will give huge distortions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="equipboard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio monitors KRK" class="if uuid-2341566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341566.jpg"></div><p>  If the work is carried out in a full-fledged studio, then you need to connect all sound equipment to a full-fledged sound interface.  If the studio is equipped at home, then a computer sound card will do.  If we are talking about connecting passive monitors, then, most likely, a preamp is also required. </p><h2>  Monitor manufacturers overview </h2><p>  Studio monitor reviews vary.  However, in each case, one constant result is noticeable.  Cheap monitors, namely less than 20,000 rubles, are not suitable for a recording studio.  They can be useful for homework voice-over, but nothing more.  In addition, it is important to know that often the most objective reviews are not of models, but of companies that produce monitors.  It is in such material that you can find out the truth about the product. </p><p>  KRK is a manufacturer of excellent equipment.  However, it focuses on successful sound engineers.  All inexpensive and semi-budget models of monitors are an extremely bad decision.  Up to the popular VXT series, absolutely all products of the company sin with bubbling and buzzing sounds, which are even with an ideal arrangement of technology. </p><p>  Axelvox makes equipment designed for those who are constrained by the budget.  Somehow serious audio production, their monitors often do not pull.  This is especially true for the TR-x, TR-xx, PM, and N series. </p><p>  Behringer has established itself as a mediocre manufacturer.  The quality is usually very poor.  However, they have a very good Truth series.  They pass on the minimum bar of 20,000 rubles and at the same time can immediately indicate the wrong information.  Compete with inexpensive "Yamaha". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wirerealm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio monitors" class="if uuid-2341564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2341564.jpg"></div><h2>  Yamaha </h2><p>  Studio monitors <span>Yamaha HS</span> are leaders in the segment of low-cost devices.  In general, this company produces wonderful products.  There are models for professionals, for budget studios and for beginners.  HS is considered the best option for those who are just starting to work with sound.  It's simple, they give more than any other monitors can give.  For all its merits, this particular model is the most demanding on the conditions of accommodation.  With the right settings, monitors easily ‚Äújump above their heads‚Äù. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Even before you come to the store, you must read objective reviews about studio monitors.  This is not the case where everything will be subjective.  Those who buy such equipment are most often professionals.  If the device is bad, buzzing or there are no frequencies in it, then everything will be written in the reviews.  This is the very rare case when you need to pay maximum attention to the description of the technical shortcomings of a particular model.  Understanding will give a complete picture and an accurate answer to the question of whether monitors are suitable or not. </p>
