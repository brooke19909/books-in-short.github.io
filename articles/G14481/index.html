Kovrov is located very close to his famous brother.  A look into this town will be very interesting, because Kovrov has existed only in the status of a city for more than two centuries.  Its history was created by princes and the Russian people.  Now it is a modern cultural and industrial center where new technologies are successfully developing and the memory of ancestors is carefully preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir region Kovrov" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/460523.jpg" width="599"></div>

Kovrov, as a city, began its life in 1778 after the decree of Catherine II on the formation of a new county Kovrovsky.  Until then, it was a village.  Initially, there was a courtyard of a certain Epifanka, a prince hunter, and the place was called Epifanovka.  It was in the XII century, under Prince Dolgoruky.  His son Andrei, nicknamed Bogolyubsky and canonized in the future, was a passionate hunter.  Once, on the very eve of Christmas, in a strong snowstorm, he returned from Suzdal to Starodub.  Now it is the Klyazma town.  Kovrov (Vladimir region), whose sights are known far beyond the region, is proud of this historical place.  Andrei Yurievich lost his way.  The road led him to the compound of Epiphanes.  In honor of his salvation, he ordered a wooden church to be built in Epifanovka.  The hunter‚Äôs son took up the matter.  For zeal, he was granted forests, meadows and wastelands, called Epifanovsky, and the village began to bear the name Rozhdestvenino.  In those days, Tatars often raided Russia.  Residents of un fortified villages escaped in forests and large villages.  Christmas invaders burned to the ground.  There were almost no inhabitants there.  Even the Epifanovs moved to Suzdal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of Kovrov, Vladimir Region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/460525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How Rozhdestvenino became Carpet </h2><p>  In the XIV century, the village and surrounding lands were presented to princes from the Starodubsky family.  They had a nickname Carpets, as one of them at the Battle of Kulikovo broke into the headquarters of Mamaia and brought out an expensive carpet from there.  The nickname turned into a surname, and the village began to be called Kovrovo.  Prince Vasily built a tall tower on Klyazma, and the priests allocated a place near the lake, called Popov.  In 1523, he died near the city of Polotsk, but was buried in Kovrov at the family cemetery.  The village went to his son Semyon, and after his grandson Ivan.  In 1567, he donated Kovrovo and the surrounding land to the Savior-Efimov Monastery, which served as an impetus for their development.  The prince‚Äôs tower was also given to the monks under the hut.  It repaired the courts and reprisals against local residents.  Catherine II liked the Vladimir region.  She took the carpets from the monastery and gave it the status of a city.  Since then, its new history began, the most important stage of which was the construction of a railway line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Vladimir region Kovrov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/460524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of the railway in Kovrov </h2><p>  A modern Kovrov map of the Vladimir Region displays all the arteries available in the city, reliable and convenient.  However, it was not always so good.  Work on the creation of the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod branch began in 1858.  After 7 years, it launched the first train that crashed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current Kovrov-1 station.  For two years, they corrected the deficiencies, but failed to launch the new train, because a water pump and two bridge spans collapsed near the Kovrov station.  For the construction of a new one had to change the course of the river.  To prevent anything else from happening, his supports were painted red.  The bridge is still called Red.  Now the train started without incident.  Carpet developed rapidly.  Railway workshops and many small and large enterprises appeared in the city.  During the war years, military weapons, bombs and shells for the army were produced here.  Now it is the largest industrial center of the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Administration of the city of Kovrov, Vladimir region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/460526.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural resources </h2><p>  In a wonderful natural region is the Vladimir region.  Kovrov grew up on the banks of Klyazma, through which two bridges were thrown in the city.  Nearby is the Klyazma Nature Reserve, which occupies the land between Kovrov and the <span>Teza River.</span>  In these places there are many reservoirs - 67 lakes with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 45 hectares, 19 to 1 hectare, as well as smaller ones.  In the forest tracts around Kovrov, berries and mushrooms are collected.  There are 50 species of large and small mammals (hares, squirrels, foxes, moose) and more than 200 species of birds, including hazel grouse, black grouse, duck, capercaillie. </p><h2>  Clay toy </h2><p>  Since ancient times, clay was mined in Kovrov, from which they made not only dishes, but also wonderful toys.  This trade was undeservedly forgotten, but since the end of the twentieth century it has revived again.  Nowadays, bright, original, recognizable among dozens of others clay toys made by the hands of carpet-makers are famous all over the world.  The administration of the city of Kovrov, Vladimir Region, is trying in every possible way to develop the desire of the townspeople for creativity and strengthen the connection of generations.  In this regard, it is planned to create an Arms Museum in Kovrov, restore the historical center, and provide the necessary support to the creators of clay toys.  With the support of the administration, the All-Russian Sports Dance Competition is held in Kovrov every year, and an art school has been opened. </p>
