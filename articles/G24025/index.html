What is this tool like?  What is it used for?  What benefits does he provide us? </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  A person in the modern world may be able to use a large number of different financial instruments.  But many of them require significant experience and a huge supply of knowledge.  Relatively easy and not difficult in this matter is a deposit.  To use it, you must be a capable citizen and have a minimum amount of knowledge.  Rates on deposits can minimize the impact of inflation on savings, and sometimes even slightly increase the amount of available funds.  But still some knowledge is needed. </p><p>  So, it is necessary to distinguish potential fraudsters from financial institutions that deal with money.  Suppose that the country accepts deposits at six percent per annum, loans are issued at fifteen.  And then an organization appears that takes money from the population at 15% and declares the issue at 30%.  Could it be that their words are true?  Yes, it is quite possible.  But to take a loan at 30% will be only those who were denied offering at 15%.  The risk of non-return is increasing.  It may be that it will simply be a fundraising year or several years, and then the money will sink into oblivion.  If the bank is a member of the insurance agency, then a certain amount will be refunded.  True, interest on deposits will not be paid in such cases.  This, however, is not scary: our money with us is already good.  But let's not rush and consider everything in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What should I look for when choosing? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.krungsri.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposit opening" class="if uuid-2405410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405410.jpg"></div><p>  So, we want to open bank deposits.  Now you need to choose a financial institution that will allow us to rest assured that nothing will happen to the funds.  What points should you pay attention to?  First of all, you need to look at the transparency of activities.  That is, is it possible to find information about shareholders, management, how accessible they are, whether documentation and reporting are open, what measures have been taken to ensure security, the life of a financial institution in the market.  All this is essential. </p><p>  In addition, it will not be amiss to use a calculator to determine the best option.  Suppose there is a choice: 20%, which are accrued at the end of the year, or 19% with capitalization every month.  Although the second option offers less (at first glance) in fact, it is a more profitable option.  To verify this, just use a calculator.  In the first case, we get for a thousand rubles an amount of 1200 rubles.  Everything is simple here.  Capitalization takes time to calculate, so they will be given in an abridged version.  So, the first month and for one thousand rubles the amount of 19% is charged.  and credited to the account.  As a result, the deposit is not a thousand rubles, but a little more.  According to the results of the first month, there will be 1016.14 rubles in the account.  And already on this increased amount interest is accrued.  And the final result is 1207.47 rubles.  Of course, someone might argue that seven rubles is not such a big amount.  But this is only with one thousand.  And if there are a hundred?  Or is a whole million considered?  Who will refuse seven thousand rubles? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Common mistakes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.solvafin.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank deposits" class="if uuid-2405421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405421.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, it is necessary to determine the goal.  Many people think: to choose a current or deposit deposit?  Therefore, it is necessary to understand their purpose.  A deposit is intended to accumulate cash and minimize the impact of inflation by calculating interest. </p><p>  With the current, everything is different.  It is used to accumulate and concentrate funds that can be used at any given time.  Therefore, interest is not foreseen on it or they are insignificant.  An example is credit cards.  A common situation is when the funds that are on them are interest.  Moreover, if this is bank money, then a person pays a financial institution.  When an individual‚Äôs funds are on the card, then interest on use is already paid to him. </p><p>  And I also want to go back and re-examine such a typical mistake as focusing exclusively on large percentages.  It should be remembered that highlighting against the general background indicates that risky or even prohibited operations by regulators and legislation are carried out with the money of depositors.  Therefore, you should be very careful when choosing a financial institution.  In order not to lose deposits with banks, you should also not exceed the amount that is covered by insurance.  At the moment, it is 1.4 million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We select the bank and conditions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.policybazaar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="terms of deposits" class="if uuid-2405413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405413.jpg"></div><p>  So, we are interested in opening deposits.  In order not to miscalculate, be guided by simple criteria: </p><ol><li>  Participation in <span>the deposit insurance system.</span>  The longer the term, the better. </li><li>  The size of the financial institution.  The more you have to deal with a large bank, the less likely it is to go bankrupt in the near future.  This is to some extent a guarantee of reliability.  True, it is hard to imagine that large institutions will suddenly go broke and, for example, the deposits of Sberbank will simply disappear. </li><li>  Assets.  It is for them that one should first of all be guided in determining the size.  You can find this information on the Bank of Russia page.  Additional attention can be paid to the number of branches, as well as the geography of their locations.  This information should already be sought directly on the website of the credit institution itself. </li><li>  Financial statements.  This is suitable for those who want to give a chance to small banks.  It is necessary to ensure that reporting complies with liquidity standards.  You also need to ask about overdue debt (it is desirable that it does not exceed the figure of five percent of the amount of loans), as well as the dynamics of its change.  Fortunately, all these data are presented on the website of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  The composition of shareholders.  Their list is posted on the website of the bank itself and should not cause suspicion.  If among them there are international investment funds, then this is an indicator of reliability.  But at the same time, in the face of constantly growing sanctions and political instability, this can play a cruel joke.  Therefore, you need to carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. </li></ol><h2>  About rate and interest </h2><p>  There are many nuances.  In banking, a fixed, floating and increasing / decreasing rate is used.  To say unequivocally which of these options is the best is problematic.  The easiest to understand is a fixed rate.  Floating can be tied to certain events.  The increasing / decreasing rate is negotiated at the conclusion of the contract and leads to an increase / decrease in payments. </p><p>  The amount of money received is positively affected by the possibility of replenishing a bank deposit.  So, if inflation slows down, it will be profitable to invest additional funds.  Often they also offer the possibility of early withdrawal, but in such cases significant fines are imposed: from a third to all accrued interest.  We should not forget about the capitalization of the contribution.  Although rushing to the cherished word is not necessary.  To identify the benefits of a particular scheme, it is better to use a calculator.  Since the size of inflation is now insignificant, there is no need to claim large interest.  At the beginning of 2018, there was a situation when, in cases where more than 12% per annum is offered on deposits, then these are most likely scammers.  Let's take as an example, how much interest is accrued by such a rather large commercial structure as UniCredit Bank.  This banking institution offers its customers from 4.75% to 8.35% for ruble deposits, depending on the conditions chosen and the agreed term.  For foreign currencies, such as the US dollar or the euro, their value does not exceed 3.5 percent per annum. </p><h2>  About programs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.spotlightre.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposit rates" class="if uuid-2405426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405426.jpg"></div><p>  Banking institutions are interested in their customer base growing.  To do this, they use a wide range of solutions.  One of the most popular is the creation of targeted programs.  For example, separately for students, pensioners, working people (the so-called salary projects).  Opening deposits is accompanied by certain bonuses, for example, an increased interest rate.  In addition, additional services may be offered, such as arranging an investment or accumulative life insurance program, applying for a non-state pension fund, and much more, which will allow you to get a loyal customer for a long time. </p><p>  In addition, benefits may be introduced for the size of the contribution.  For example, a person contributed 10 million rubles to the account and received a 0.5% increase.  By the way, it is better not to count on the golden mountains.  So, at the end of 2017, when placing funds for twelve months, only Loko-Bank offered more than 9% per annum.  And then, this rate was available only as part of a special offer and was valid for a limited time.  But if we talk about the main financial institutions of the country, then deposits of Sberbank, VTB and others can offer about 5-7%.  Although if you pay attention to a medium-sized bank, you can find an offer for 8%.  You should be careful and stay within reasonable limits.  And if the reader thinks this is a stupid warning, then a little dry statistics should be given: in mid-2017, there were almost 8 million depositors who lost money due to bank failures.  The volume of payments for them sought to mark one and a half trillion rubles!  This is the official data of the Deposit Insurance Agency. </p><h2>  Training </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.karasserybank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interest on deposits" class="if uuid-2405429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405429.jpg"></div><p>  When opening deposits in rubles, you need to think not only about interest rates.  But in addition to reliability checks, which were mentioned earlier, one should ask about the maximum and minimum deposit amount, the possibility of replenishing the account and early withdrawal of money, the procedure for calculating the amounts and many other things that determine the convenience and comfort of interaction.  Large financial institutions usually offer several options for placing funds.  This creates the illusion of a significant choice, but in practice, profitability does not increase significantly.  For example, an advertising campaign is conducted on the provision of deposits at 8%.  And in small letters below it is written that this offer is valid for deposits from 300 thousand rubles.  And if a person wants to place less, then only 7%.  Formally, everything is true, and the requirements of the law on advertising are met.  But at the same time they will offer less than expected.  After all, few can attribute three hundred thousand rubles to a deposit, right?  You should also carefully study the contract.  After all, it may turn out that the rate is floating, and the first few months will be attractive, and then it will go down. </p><h2>  And what do banking institutions offer us? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="goldensmoneys.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interest on deposits" class="if uuid-2405442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405442.jpg"></div><p>  So much information has already been considered, but we did not consider the most treasured question (how much?).  The terms of deposits at different banks provide for different percentages depending on the chosen cooperation program.  Earlier, UniCredit Bank was mentioned.  What do other structures offer?  Take, for example, Promsvyazbank.  He offers his depositors within the framework of special offers from 6.7% to 8.45%.  Not bad?  True, but the amount deposited on a deposit should start from 500 thousand (in some cases, from a million). </p><p>  You can pay attention to the "Agricultural Bank", which is 100% owned by the state.  It offers <span>replenishable deposits</span> for which account transactions are provided.  In rubles, it offers from 6.4 to 8.6%. </p><p>  Home Credit Bank offers to host deposits for up to 36 months at a rate of 7 to 8%.  A significant advantage is the payment of interest every month.  An additional plus is the small size of the minimum deposit amount, only one thousand rubles. </p><p>  But the most profitable offer is provided by VTB Bank of Moscow.  The most profitable deposits from it in rubles allow you to get 10% per annum.  True, neither replenish nor remove them.  And the initial contribution amount is at least 30 thousand rubles.  If we talk about other proposals, they begin with a rate of 4.3 percent per annum. </p><h2>  What do the giants offer? </h2><p>  It has just been examined what individuals offer deposits in individual institutions of the second league.  And what can the famous and popular giants have to offer?  Alfa-Bank offers the possibility of concluding agreements for a period of up to three years with a small deposit amount of 10 thousand rubles.  True, the highest income that is provided by him is to receive an interest rate of 7.43%.  And it starts with a mark of 6.4%. </p><p>  Tinkoff works for up to two years.  Rates offered by him range from 6.16% to 8%.  Early termination is possible, but in such cases the rate is 0.1 percent.  Russian Standard Bank offers its depositors from 6.5 to 8.5 percent per annum.  The replenishment amount is from ten thousand rubles.  VTB 24 offers cooperation for up to 5 years.  The rate varies from 4.1 to 7.1 percent per annum. </p><p>  And this brief review is closed by the giant of the domestic market of financial institutions - the Savings Bank.  He offers a large number of different deposits, which vary both in minimum amounts and in terms.  In order to open a deposit, it is enough to have an amount of 1000 rubles.  It should be noted that Sberbank is more focused on large investors.  That is, the more will be contributed, the greater the amount of interest.  True, counting on more than 5.63% is not necessary.  But the reliability factor is relevant here.  So, although it cannot be said that <span>deposits for pensioners</span> are the most attractive in terms of income, you can be sure of the safety of their funds. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposits of individuals" class="if uuid-2405439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2405439.jpg"></div><p>  And again, you need to talk about caution and care.  Yes, this topic has been touched upon more than once, but it is very relevant.  Data from the Deposit Insurance Agency about eight million people awaiting compensation for a total of one and a half trillion rubles are a good example of what you can not relax.  It is necessary to carefully and carefully approach the choice of financial institution to which the funds will be transferred. </p><p>  In general, the best option is to constantly improve your own literacy and monitor the situation in selected commercial structures.  After all, now is far from the Middle Ages, when it was enough to master a limited supply of knowledge (blacksmithing, pottery, cultivation of agricultural products), and this was enough for life.  If you want to improve your life, you need to understand that for this you need to improve, learn something new, try and act.  Only then will there be changes and improvements.  It should be remembered that life is under the control of the people themselves.  No one will solve problems on their own and improve conditions.  Only we.  Today is a deposit.  Tomorrow is a government loan bond.  Then investment in stocks or your own business - and the person will be a millionaire!  There is a lot of work behind these words, but one thing should always be kept in mind: the road will take the road! </p>
