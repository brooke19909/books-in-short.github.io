Although, if we are talking about a long stay at the hotel, then we can note some uniformity in food. </p><p>  The staff here are very polite, from cleaners and gardeners to administrators.  Many of them understand Russian well.  Animation is at its best - the guys are trying to entertain the guests, but they are not too intrusive.  In short, travelers recommend the Bahia Lara complex (hotel).  Turkey, Antalya in particular, are ideal for a leisurely, full of pleasant vacation experience. </p>
