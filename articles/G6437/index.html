And citizens should be able to use its services.  Some of them connect and disconnect quite easily.  The main thing is to know how to act in a particular case.  Recently, the service of auto payments has been very popular.  But how to remove auto payment from the card of Sberbank?  Next, we have to find the answer to this question.  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems.  And even an inexperienced client of Sberbank will be able to achieve the desired result. </p><h2>  Service Description </h2><p>  How to remove auto payment from Sberbank card?  It is impossible to unequivocally answer a similar question.  As a rule, you have to rely on personal preferences, as well as on what specifically you no longer want to pay for. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.akchabar.kg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to disable Sberbank auto payment" class="if uuid-3225929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225929.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to understand what kind of service in question.  Perhaps deactivation thereof will cause a lot of inconvenience to the citizen. </p><p>  "Auto payment" is a service by connecting which a citizen will be able to automatically transfer money in the form of payments for services.  For example, replenish a mobile phone number or pay for utilities.  It is very convenient if you know how to use this setting.  Only sometimes there is a need for disconnection.  We will familiarize ourselves with this task further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Solutions </h2><p>  How to disable "Iota" auto payment from Sberbank card?  And any other service paid automatically?  It is possible to cope with this task, as already mentioned, in different ways.  We'll have to figure out all the existing scenarios. </p><p>  At the moment, the shutdown of the previously mentioned services can be carried out: </p><ul><li>  via SMS command; </li><li>  using a terminal or an ATM of Sberbank; </li><li>  by phone; </li><li>  using online banking. </li></ul><p>  In reality, everything is not as difficult as it might seem initially.  Competent actions of the client will lead to a quick solution to the task.  Sberbank offers many diverse ways to connect and disconnect its services. </p><h2>  Terminal </h2><p>  How to disable auto payment from a bank card of Sberbank?  Earlier it was said that it is possible to cope with such an operation in different ways.  The main thing is to adhere to a certain algorithm of actions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM and Sberbank payment terminal to disable auto payment" class="if uuid-3225928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225928.jpg"></div><p>  Let's start with the easiest ways.  For example, you can activate and deactivate the aforementioned service through Sberbank payment terminals.  This process takes only a few minutes. </p><p>  Instructions for solving the task involves the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Find a working bank terminal, and then insert your bank plastic into it. </li><li>  Specify a PIN code for further work with the system. </li><li>  Select "Auto Payments" in the menu that appears. </li><li>  Click on the "Disable" button. </li><li>  Confirm action. </li></ol><p>  Then it remains to wait for the processing of the operation.  Connected auto payments will be disconnected.  Nothing incomprehensible or difficult!  However, few people are happy with such a decision.  It is not very convenient, especially if there is a need to deactivate the corresponding service in the evening or at night. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  ATMs to help </h2><p>  I wonder how to remove auto payment from the card of Sberbank?  To achieve the appropriate result, citizens can use ATMs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disable auto payment in the terminal" class="if uuid-3225927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225927.jpg"></div><p>  To implement this method, it is necessary to resort to the use of the previously proposed instructions.  Sberbank ATMs operate on the same principles as with payment terminals.  It is not as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  But it has already been emphasized that such solutions are not too and not always convenient.  Therefore, we will further try to study other methods of disabling a service called "Auto Payment". </p><h2>  Sberbank online - how to use to deactivate a service </h2><p>  How to disable mobile auto payment from a Sberbank card?  The most convenient way to solve this problem is to use the Sberbank Online service.  With it, you can quickly disconnect and connect a variety of services, as well as manage a bank card account.  It is not as difficult as it might seem initially. </p><p>  I wonder how to disable the ‚ÄúMegogo‚Äù auto payment from the Sberbank card?  Want to opt out of auto-recharging your mobile phone account?  Then it is recommended to perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Go to Sberbank Online.  The user must have a pre-registered profile on the corresponding site. </li><li>  Confirm authorization in the system.  To do this, the confirmation code is indicated in the field that appears.  It will come in the form of SMS messages. </li><li>  Log in to your Personal Account at Sberbank Online. </li><li>  View to the right of the page.  There is a small menu.  In it, at the very bottom, will be the inscription "My auto payments."  You must click on the corresponding line. </li><li>  Click on "Management ...". </li><li>  Choose a service that you don‚Äôt want to pay automatically anymore. </li><li>  Set the value to "Disable". </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that auto payment in this way can not only be turned off, but also suspended.  Such a solution is most suitable.  It will be much easier to restore the automatic transfer of funds for a particular service if you suspend it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="sbankami.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Online - how to refuse auto payments" class="if uuid-3225923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225923.jpg"></div><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to remove auto payment from the card of Sberbank.  "Megaphone", "Iota", as well as SIM-cards of other telecom operators after the done actions will not be automatically replenished.  The main thing is to choose the right item to disable in the Sberbank Online menu. </p><h2>  SMS request for help - first method </h2><p>  How to disable Rostelecom auto payment from Sberbank card?  For example, you can call the bank and ask for it.  But we‚Äôll talk about this decision later.  Before this, consider another fairly simple way to get out of this situation. </p><p>  It is about sending an SMS request to implement the task.  This technique is quite common in practice.  First, find out how to immediately stop all auto payments. </p><p>  In our case, a client of Sberbank will need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Open a new message dialing mode on your phone. </li><li>  Write the text "Auto payment -".  You do not need to put quotation marks. </li><li>  Send the generated SMS message to the short number 900. </li></ol><p>  All that remains for a man now is to wait.  After successful processing of the request, the user will receive a message about disconnecting auto payments from a bank card.  If necessary, a person will be able to activate them again at any time.  True, you will have to configure automatic transactions from the very beginning. </p><h2>  SMS Requests - The Second Way </h2><p>  How to remove auto payment from Sberbank card?  It could already be noted that there is no unequivocal answer to this kind of question.  You have to act as convenient for a particular person. </p><p>  If necessary, you can refuse to auto-balance the balance of your mobile phone.  In this case, SMS requests are also used.  This is a fairly quick and easy solution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disable auto payment by phone number" class="if uuid-3225930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225930.jpg"></div><p>  A guide to achieving the desired result will look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Start writing a new SMS message. </li><li>  In the text of the letter write "Auto payment - phone_number_which_not_ need_to replenish the last_4_digit_of the bank_card".  All data is shown without brackets and quotation marks. </li><li>  Send a processing request to 900. </li></ol><p>  Fast, easy and very convenient!  If a person has only one bank plastic attached to the phone number, he may not indicate his last four digits in the SMS message.  Otherwise, you can‚Äôt do without it. </p><h2>  Phone and call center </h2><p>  Need to activate a Sberbank card?  Disable auto payment or connect any service to bank plastic?  You can use a call to the call center for this undertaking.  This technique is not too common, but sometimes it helps to achieve the desired result. </p><p>  To stop using the Auto Payment feature, we recommend that you do the following: </p><ol><li>  Dial 8 800 555 55 50 on the phone. </li><li>  Wait for a live operator to answer the caller.  "Answering" with an answering machine is not as easy as it seems. </li><li>  Report your intentions.  In our case, it is necessary to say that you want to refuse car payment, and then refer to the service for which money is debited. </li><li>  Name the data requested by the call center employee.  Usually it is required to provide the surname, name and patronymic of the client, as well as data from bank plastic.  The code word is also useful. </li><li>  As soon as an employee of Sberbank identifies the speaker, you can ask to disconnect a specific service and wait. </li></ol><p>  In the course of the actions, the representative of the financial company will form an application to disable a particular service, after which the client will receive a message about the successful completion of the corresponding operation.  In fact, it is not so difficult and not as long as it seems at first. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbleaks.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to disable auto payment Sberbank" class="if uuid-3225925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225925.jpg"></div><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  I wonder how to remove auto payment from the card of Sberbank?  The last solution to this problem is practically not found in real life, but it exists.  Usually, inexperienced clients resort to it, who hardly communicate with equipment such as ATMs, terminals and computers. </p><p>  Some citizens prefer to personally contact the bank to receive a particular service.  And in our case, too.  How to disable auto payment from a bank card of Sberbank? </p><p>  Guidelines for achieving the goal will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Take a card, as well as an identity card. </li><li>  Find Sberbank and come to this financial institution.  Any department will do.  You will have to contact the employee of the corresponding branch. </li><li>  Ask to turn off auto payments or debiting money from the card account for one service in automatic mode.  The latter will have to be clarified. </li><li>  Wait a while.  If necessary, fill out an application for refusing to use the "Auto payment" function. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="sbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS request to turn off auto payment" class="if uuid-3225924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3225924.jpg"></div><p>  It is done.  Now, Sberbank employees will draw up an application to disable the named service.  Nothing difficult or incomprehensible! </p>
