    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Divya Cave in the Primorsky Territory is located in quite remote and inaccessible places, but despite this, it has been known to speleologists for more than two centuries.  Its first scientific description was published in 1772.  The author of this study was N.P. Rychkov.  Almost half a century later (1821), V.N.Berkh, a researcher of these places, visited here.  The plan of the cave was first drawn up in 1949 by S. Lukin.  Later Divya cave was examined by other cavers, discovering its new sites. </p><h2>  The legend of the name of the cave </h2><p>  As we have already said, Divya Cave has been known since antiquity.  She is shrouded in many legends and legends that are invariably associated with the Virgin Beauty, who once lived in a dense taiga forest near the Colva River.  On moonlit evenings, the beautiful Virgo appeared on a high river bank and spun.  Her songs spread across the Urals.  But as soon as someone approached this place, she disappeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Divya Cave Perm Territory" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1811943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After some time, the young athlete Vetlan settled on the opposite bank, and the Virgin, once seeing him, was no longer able to retreat from the river, fascinated by its beauty.  Young people fell in love and decided to unite their hearts forever, but the high-water Colva opposed this.  The virgin rushed into the river to be with her lover, but this was not destined to come true - the girl drowned.  She reincarnated in a high and beautiful mountain.  Since then, the mountain has been called the Devius Stone. </p><p>  The hero was petrified by grief, turning into the equally beautiful Vetlan stone, which is located on the opposite bank of the Colva, a little downstream.  The name of the mountain got its name and the cave - Devya.  Over time, this name was transformed and gained its current sound - Divya. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Divya cave in the Urals is unique primarily because it is formed by an ancient stream that flowed from an aquifer that has already disappeared.  For this reason, the cave has a peculiar structure.  It is low, but in some areas it turns into impenetrable narrow manholes.  In some places there are lifts and halls, the height of which reaches fifteen meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="divya cave in the Urals" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1811945.jpg" width="570"></div>

Due to its unusual origin, the cave was included in the International List of Hydrological Monuments.  Due to the moisture inside the cave, it seems that the water left it recently and is about to flood again in a huge stream. </p><h2>  How to get into the cave? </h2><p>  The entrance to it is in the Divvego stone massif, in a forest at an altitude of more than ninety meters above the river.  It is a small hole that resembles a hole.  Its width is one and a half meters, and the height is only fifty centimeters.  You can get into the cave only by crawling.  This passage was named in honor of Lukin - the first compiler of the cave scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="divya cave photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1811942.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The cave is two-tiered; its cavities are stretched from east to west.  With a total length of 10,100 meters, its depth is twenty-eight meters.  The most extensive grottoes reach a length of fifty meters and a height of fifteen.  Along with them there are many narrow corridors that are quite difficult to overcome.  Their names speak for themselves - Worm, <span>Rolling Mill</span> , etc. </p><p>  The divya cave, a photo of which you can see in our article, amazes with its interior: picturesque stalactites and stalagmites, streak forms, huge stalagmites columns more than three and a half meters high, for example, in the Pillar Grotto, etc.  Almost all types of crystalline and sintered calcite formations found in caves are gathered together in Divya Cave. </p><p>  Especially beautiful is the fairy tale grotto, which fully justifies its name.  It has a lot of stalagmites of the most bizarre forms, and the walls are covered with natics of yellow and white colors.  Of interest to researchers is a statue of a woman fashioned from clay.  This is the "mistress of the cave."  She is in the Dalniy Grotto.  The air temperature in the cave is constant throughout the year.  It can range from +4 to + 8 ° C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Divya cave Perm region how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1811941.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Traveling through these dungeons is an amazing adventure that does not bother even beginner explorers.  Divya Cave is similar to the habitat of the fairy gnomes.  For experienced researchers, the passage through the cave is simple.  For beginners, the main danger lies in the possibility of getting lost in countless moves. </p><p>  Often, researchers settle down for the night right in the dungeons, picking up the driest place.  Behave in the cave should be quiet, especially in winter, since bats hibernate in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="divya cave" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1811948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lakes </h2><p>  Divya has several lakes.  Even one of the grottoes is called Lake District.  The largest underground water body is located in the grotto of the Sun.  About one hundred eighty square meters is the area of ​​his mirror.  It stretches for ninety-six meters.  The depth of the lake is one and a half meters. </p><h2>  Reviews and tips of experienced tourists </h2><p>  According to tourists who visited this cave, they received a lot of vivid impressions from this extraordinary adventure.  Everyone who wants to visit the cave on their own needs to have good preparation and at least basic experience of visiting caves.  Although Divya is horizontal, it has a third category of difficulty.  This is explained by the length of the moves and the confusion of the labyrinths, which causes a risk of overwork, the possibility of getting lost, hypothermia, loss of light sources. </p><p>  Plan your trip for at least three days.  Print a map of the cave, it will be difficult for an inexperienced person to navigate without it.  There is no need for special equipment when visiting the cave, the difficulties of studying it arise only in the narrow labyrinths of passages, this is especially felt in its far part. </p><p>  You will need about eight hours to inspect the near section, and around twenty in a large circle.  In this case, an underground base camp should be organized. </p><h2>  Divya Cave, Perm Territory: how to get there? </h2><p>  The nearest airport and train station are in Perm.  From the city to the village Nyrob follows a shuttle bus.  The road will take you six and a half hours.  You can get from the village to the cave by car.  Better if it will be an SUV.  Then you should agree with the locals on the delivery to the cave and back by motor boat.  From the river to the cave you will be led by a well-packed path.  The climb to the cave is not easy, but surmountable. </p>
