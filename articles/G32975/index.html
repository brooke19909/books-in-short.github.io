The young resort began to develop actively in the second half of the eighties.  Very quickly, Belek gained the status of the most expensive resort, since many high-class golf courses were built on its coast.  In our article we want to talk about one of the five-star establishments of this place called Siam Elegance. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Siam Elegance is located in the Turkish Mediterranean, on the outskirts of Belek.  The hotel has its own private beach, located 50 meters from the building.  The hotel complex stands out among similar establishments with a special design.  The luxury hotel is designed in Thai style.  In addition, it is complemented by excellent infrastructure, complemented by a water park, swimming pools, amusement park, recreation areas and sports grounds. </p><p>  The location of the complex is convenient in that it is only forty kilometers from the airport, so the road to it does not take much time.  The hotel is in an incredibly beautiful place.  It was built in 2008, so it can be attributed to relatively young institutions.  However, modern oriental design was given to the complex in 2012.  The architecture of the Far East gives the hotel a special atmosphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siam elegance" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2016515.jpg" width="600"></div>

The village belongs to the very young resorts of the Mediterranean.  The village as a place of rest is chosen by couples with children.  For kids, the local climate is very comfortable, in addition, the village has a lot of entertainment for young holidaymakers.  Among the resort hotels you can pick up a variety of options, right up to fashionable establishments that are able to satisfy the highest demands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siam elegance 5 service" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2016527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Bogazkent is good for recreation of all categories of tourists, except active youth who seek entertainment until the morning.  The fact is that all the resort's recreational facilities are located in the hotels themselves.  It’s hard to find something interesting outside.  Therefore, if you are interested in nightlife, you will have to go by taxi to Belek. </p><p>  The sandy coast of the town stretches for six kilometers.  Clear and clear water attracts tourists to local beaches.  Here you can even see the rarest carriage-caretta turtles.  It is thanks to these amazing animals that the surrounding territories have the status of a National Reserve.  The local coast is characterized by a smooth entry into the water and a large sand cover.  For this reason, local hotels are popular with families with children. </p><p>  Bogazkent belongs to the protected area, where there are 39 species of birds that live in these parts.  And that's not counting migratory birds.  The resort is interesting and cultural attractions.  Relaxing in Bogazkent, you can go on an excursion to the ruins of ancient Perge or the ruins of Aspendos.  No less interesting is rafting on the Manavgat River.  The proximity of Belek allows you to go shopping and entertainment. </p><h2>  Reviews on Siam Elegance 5 * (Belek) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who rested in it in 2017.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the opinions of the guests are incredibly contradictory, but all vacationers unanimously say that in general the complex does not meet the stated five stars.  And there are many reasons for this, which we will discuss later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siam elegance 5 room description" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2016528.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, tourists note that earlier the institution had a higher level of service.  But now the quality of service is much lower. </p><p>  Siam Elegance Hotel (Turkey) is located in a picturesque place.  Its territory, although small, but very beautiful and thought out to the smallest detail.  Beautiful plants and cleanliness will delight every tourist. </p><p>  The hotel itself is made in Thai style, both outside and inside.  Most of the rooms are very modest in size.  The apartments of the complex are clean and beautiful, but, according to vacationers, need updating.  Near the hotel there is a neighboring hotel, so the windows of the side rooms look directly at the building, which does not really please the guests of such rooms. </p><p>  In general, the rooms are good, all the equipment is working properly.  However, not all vacationers like low beds in apartments.  Room cleaning is carried out every day, but tourists rate its quality as satisfactory, since it is not good enough.  Unfortunately, the bathrooms completely lack slippers and bathrobes, which are declared on the institution’s website, which is very strange for a five-star hotel. </p><p>  As for towels, their quantity is not always enough, and bed linen is changed extremely rarely.  The rooms have very poor soundproofing.  Therefore, if you go to bed early, then you should ask for rooms not in the center of the building, but in the side wing. </p><p>  The hotel has internet difficulties.  On the website of the institution, it is declared as one of the services.  However, in fact, its quality is such that it is practically impossible to use the room.  And in the lobby, Wi-Fi is very weak. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Siam Elegance currently only has a main restaurant and bars.  A la carte establishments are either temporarily or permanently closed.  According to tourists, the restaurant has a good assortment of dishes, but not all food is delicious.  So, for example, many fruits are served in green, and indeed their choice is small.  There are few meat dishes; as a rule, chicken and food prepared from minced meat are present.  But there is no seafood at all, except for the absolutely tastelessly made fish.  In general, the food is quite good, but not consistent with the five-star status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel siam elegance 5" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2016519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ice cream is only given a couple of hours a day, so not everyone can catch it.  In addition, it is not very tasty, according to guests. </p><p>  A lot of comments from vacationers arises regarding the restaurant staff.  Waiters work extremely slowly, there are always a lot of dirty dishes in the hall.  Without a cash reward, the staff is in no hurry to approach the tables. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Beautiful and well-equipped territory of the hotel makes the most pleasant impression.  Beautiful pools with slides delight not only children, but also adults.  The hotel offers a pretty good animation program.  In the daytime, you can take part in daily water aerobics classes and play sports games.  But in the evenings, guests will find a show program in the amphitheater, after which a disco begins to work.  Of course, tourists with children are not much interested in nightlife, so the local disco bar is often empty. </p><p>  For children, the hotel has an amusement park, which is open to all guests.  A separate pool and a club for kids allows you to diversify the relaxation of young tourists. </p><p>  For adults, there is a spa with a variety of treatments.  If you want to really relax, then by all means pay attention to yourself by visiting pleasant procedures. </p><p>  The hotel has equipped recreation areas near the pools, skillfully integrated into the overall design and atmosphere of the institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siam elegance 5 reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2016520.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The sandy beach of Siam Elegance 5 * has a pebble entry into the sea, so tourists recommend purchasing special shoes in advance.  There is no pier at the hotel, but it is available at the neighboring complex, which guests of Siam safely use.  The beach is located next to the hotel, so there is no need to take long walks.  The coast is equipped with sunbeds and awnings.  According to tourists, the beach is still dirty, so the administration should pay attention to this issue. </p><p>  In the hotel lobby you can always find a representative of a travel agency who will tell you where to go on an excursion.  And near the complex you can always find local guides, whose services are much cheaper.  You can go to Belek for shopping and for a walk on dolmushi, as the road does not take much time. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, the hotel "Siam Elegance" makes a very good impression.  However, the institution has a number of significant shortcomings that are worth eliminating.  Since the hotel is not new, the rooms need updating.  The same goes for the restaurant, which should review the menu.  However, the main drawback, according to tourists, is the level of service that does not correspond to the declared level of the institution.  Of course, the shortcomings are not so critical, however, arriving at the resort, guests tend to enjoy a vacation that must fully correspond to a certain level.  Therefore, buying a tour to this institution, think about whether you are ready for some inconvenience. </p>
