Releasing the latest versions of the devices, the creators offer the technology market some new highlights or chips.  The iPod Touch 6 multimedia player, an overview of which you will read below, has not bypassed the tradition. </p><h2>  What is it and what does it eat with? </h2><p>  The new generation of iPods was released in the summer of 2015 as part of a traditional exhibition at which Apple presents its latest products and developments.  The sixth generation cannot be called revolutionary.  Most likely, this is grinding and refinement of previously proposed ideas and technologies.  Along with iPod Touch 6, iPod Nano and <span>iPod Shuffle</span> were also presented at the presentation <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  Updating the multimedia player has been asking for a long time, because the previous fifth generation lasted about three years, which is a long time for the modern market of mobile and entertainment devices.  The presentation of the gadget was modest and without the pathos characteristic of the company, in the form of a small announcement.  Consider the characteristics, user experience of the device, as well as all the obvious pros and cons of the new device for buyers and fans of the products of the "apple" company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>iPod Touch</span> 6 Technical Overview </h2><p>  The new player does not lag behind other Apple devices, in particular the sixth generation iPhone, and is built on the architecture of a modern and powerful A8 processor.  This allows the player to have almost the same performance as the aforementioned smartphone.  Tests and diagnostics show that thanks to the 64-bit processor, the performance of the device has grown as much as 8 times compared to the previous generation.  To save energy in the player, you can switch between single-core and multi-core modes.  Is this result not worthy of praise? </p>

    <p>  Let's move on to other characteristics.  The graphic component also pleasantly surprises.  Its productivity has grown 10 times.  It is worth clarifying that the device gives these indicators even with truncated processor frequency indicators - from 1.4 to 1.1 GHz.  The developers took this step because of the forced energy savings.  After all, iPod Touch 6 is, first of all, a player and a multimedia player, and not a high-speed smartphone.  This solution allowed to increase the operating time up to 40 hours with a rather weak battery (1000 mAh).  Also, iPod Touch 6 is equipped with 1 GB of RAM and a fast M8 coprocessor, which helps in the productive work of all the player's sensors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All diagnostic programs show a multiple increase in productivity compared to the fifth generation.  This is all thanks to the good work of the creators and optimization of iPod Touch 6. The review of the device goes to the screen. </p><h2>  Display device and camera </h2><p>  The display also does not lag behind current trends and Apple's flagship.  The 4-inch screen with multi-touch and excellent color reproduction is unlikely to disappoint its owner.  The resolution remains from the previous generation - 1136x640 pixels.  For this diagonal, such a resolution is ideal. </p>

    <p>  The rear main camera migrated from <span>iPhone 6.</span> The creators slightly refreshed the old ones and added new features and shooting modes.  The resolution of the matrix remained unchanged - 8 megapixels.  But the front camera has remained from the fifth generation with a resolution of 1.2 megapixels.  Both functions support the ability to record movies in <span>Full-HD resolution.</span>  Using the main camera, you can take high-quality panoramic pictures with a resolution of up to 43 megapixels. </p><h2>  iPod Touch 6: Overview of Additional Features </h2><p>  The device, of course, runs on iOS 8.4.  Also, iPod Touch 6 is equipped with Bluetooth version 4.1 and high-speed Wi-Fi module. </p><p>  A nice bonus for the owners of the player will be a special innovation - streaming music service Apple Music.  And one more good news - the cover for iPod Touch 6 can safely come up from the previous generation with minimal errors.  However, it would be better to invest in a new one.  Indeed, at such a cost of the device, funds for accessories look rather modest.  Seamlessly proceed to the conclusion and prices. </p><h2>  Prices and total </h2><p>  The sixth generation is available in 4 versions with different amounts of internal memory.  iPod Touch 6 16gb costs about 15 thousand rubles.  For 32 and 64 Gb you will have to pay 19 and 22 thousand, respectively.  The most expensive version with 128 Gb will cost the buyer almost 30,000 rubles. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the wide color gamut of the device.  The device can be purchased in 6 versions: silver, gold, pink, blue, red and space gray. </p>

    <p>  We can say that the output of iPod Touch 6 has not changed the situation in the market of multimedia players dramatically.  Apple products are still hi-end devices, which will have to pay a round sum.  But this waste is worth it, because for this money the buyer will receive an almost perfect and very technological device with a lot of possibilities.  True connoisseurs of the company's products and music lovers will definitely be satisfied with the acquisition.  The sound quality and performance of the iPod Touch 6 is currently out of competition. </p>
