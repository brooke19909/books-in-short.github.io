  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Science as a social institution and value system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Without society and its members, many components of modern life, including science, do not make sense.  Only in the society of scientists is the <span>system of values,</span> norms and traditions created, the history of which dates back more than 2000 years.  Science as a social institution is the embodiment of the most diverse relationships arising between members of the scientific community and other people.  They have undergone various changes over different periods, since the attitude of society towards science has always been changeable. </p><p>  And science itself as a social institution is subject to changes that depend on the conditions of its existence.  Take, for example, the number of scientists.  If in ancient Greek philosophical schools they could be listed by name, today this army consists of more than five million professionally organized international communities.  Today, science as a <span>social phenomenon</span> is a powerful sphere of knowledge production that can revolutionize the minds.  It has a powerful material base and developed specialized infrastructure and communication channels. </p><p>  Science as a <span>social institution</span> sees its purpose and purpose in the production of knowledge and its dissemination in society.  To do this, scientists develop research tools, come up with new techniques and replenish their ranks with new people interested in their social mission. </p><p>  Modern science as a cultural sphere represents the sphere of joint activity of creative associations, within which not only highly qualified specialists in some separate specialized areas of scientific activity work, but also people whose activities are aimed at self-realization and fulfillment of their functions with the highest degree of dedication.  Routine work in this area is adjacent to creative pursuit.  From a scientist, life constantly requires confirmation of his qualifications, subjecting various tests to the level of his professionalism.  And society and the state, to which science as a social institution is highly valued, stimulates its activities, increasing the remuneration of members of the scientific community, awarding them various ranks, awards and <span>academic degrees.</span> </p><p>  Science as a social phenomenon originated in Western Europe along with the <span>industrial revolution,</span> which became the reason for the formation of capitalist relations.  The division of labor made possible not only economic growth, but also the separation of practice from theory.  And scientific organizations began to unite in a separate area, serving the needs of improving public welfare.  And in this, education played a large role as a method of introducing the younger generation to scientific achievements. </p><p>  Science as a sphere of culture is its most important element, which differs from other types of activity in that its result is not predetermined in advance.  Knowledge is acquired, not delivered ready-made, as, for example, this happens in art.  However, it is impossible to oppose the rest of the elements of culture to science, because objective knowledge, as well as art phenomena, are characterized by logic, a generalization of the processes taking place. </p><p>  <span>The signs of science</span> as a social institution in today's world are subject to even greater institutionalization.  They permeate production, the <span>political sphere,</span> closely interact with the administrative activities of man.  Outstripping the development of the economy and technical industries, the scientific sphere has long turned into a leading industry, often predetermining and predicting the course of events.  She faces a big problem of humanization, which should turn scientific discoveries facing humanity. </p>
