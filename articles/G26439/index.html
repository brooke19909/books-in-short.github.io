    <p>  But in order to create a masterpiece, it is not enough just to take a photo on the background of the sea coast.  You need to bring life into it. </p><p>  The sun, the sea, the beach photo ... This combination of words should give the imagination a kind of vivid picture.  Do not be afraid of experiments, because it is in experiments that real creativity is born. </p><h2>  Tips for an amateur seaside photo shoot </h2><p>  Even if you are not a professional model, whose pictures will later be published on the pages of glossy magazines, this does not mean that you can‚Äôt get good photos that attract enthusiastic looks.  How beautifully photographed at sea, so that captured memories adorn the pages of home photo albums for many more years? </p><p>  To become a true professional in photography, you need to take courses, study the mountains of literature, watch many hours of instructional videos and practice every day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to associate yourself with the world of photography, but just want to look decent in the frame or to master several photo techniques to tell friends, then try to help. </p><p>  Here are some tips for both models and novice photographers to help understand the confusing world of lenses and flash.  Perhaps they will serve you as a guide for creating a series of incredible photographs against the sea. </p><h2>  Homemade blanks </h2><p>  Before the photo shoot, roll around at home in front of the mirror, ‚Äútrying on‚Äù a variety of poses, think about how to take pictures on the beach.  You can even take some test photos for clarity.  Choose for yourself several favorable angles that emphasize your advantages and hide disadvantages. </p><p>  Think over your image and look at a few accessories.  For example, it can be a hat with wide brim, giving your image a certain romanticism.  Or a beautiful pareo, bending into a weightless sculpture under a gust of wind.  Also, to complete your look, you can choose jewelry to match a swimsuit. </p><p>  Arriving at the beach, do not start the same hour to shoot.  Spend a few extra minutes to choose a location.  Even if the embankment looks the same, it can be presented in completely different ways in the photo.  Stones and rocks look very beautiful near the sea, so if they are in sight, do not miss the chance to take a few pictures against their background.  With a high degree of probability they will be very attractive. </p><h2>  Get rid of the excess, add the right one </h2><p>  How to be photographed at sea?  So that extra people do not fall into the frame.  Even if you put on a stunning swimsuit and chose the perfect pose for the photo, and in the background some boy makes a face or picks his nose - this photo is more likely to cause laughter than admiration.  Of course, if you own an art called Photoshop, you can easily get rid of this problem.  Otherwise, we advise you to choose a place where you will be spared the unwanted company in the frame. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can beat photography in the form of a production by adding interesting objects to the frame.  It can be an exotic cocktail in the foreground, and a deck chair with a pareo casually thrown over it.  Such details enliven the photo, add a ‚Äútwist‚Äù to it. </p><h2>  Play on camera </h2><p>  Pay attention to facial expressions.  A beautiful bend in the waist, combined with a forehead wrinkled from the sun or closed eyes, looks ridiculous.  If the sun is too bright, cover your eyes with sunglasses.  This accessory is very appropriate during a marine photo shoot. </p><p>  To get rid of sudden changes in shadows in intense sunlight, it is better to use a flash.  This technique reduces contrast contrast.  Correctly position the camera in relation to the sun, otherwise the model will appear only as a dark outline. </p><p>  Experiment with the arrangement in the frame.  If the model is placed on the right side, and not in the center, the photo will be saturated with the plot.  This is justified by the habit of our brain to perceive information from left to right. </p><p>  Show emotions!  Sometimes the most successful shots are obtained not when the planned actions are performed, but during improvisation.  Jump, run, burrow in the sand, run away from the waves, let yourself go crazy.  As a result, you will prove to everyone that you know how to take pictures at sea.  Such photos are lively, and therefore cause deeper emotions. </p>

    <h2>  A couple of technical points </h2><p>  The most advantageous time periods for creating beautiful photos on the sea are morning or evening.  Particularly attractive models look on the background of sea sunset.  But do not forget that the sun sets very quickly, and you only need 2-3 minutes to create stunning shots. </p><p>  Position the camera correctly.  To take a portrait picture, keep it at eye level, while for a full-length photo, you need to place the camera at the level of the belt.  Do not tilt the top of the camera down, otherwise the model‚Äôs legs in the photo will appear shorter than they actually are. </p><h2>  Profitable poses for a bikini portfolio </h2><p>  Each girl is sure that she knows how to take pictures at sea ... Exactly until she reviews dozens of her photographs and notices a certain uniformity.  The same angle, the same postures.  Only swimwear is different.  And here he is, one small step from delight to disappointment.  But the situation is not hopeless, it can be corrected by receiving several theoretical recommendations and working them out in practice. </p><p>  To understand how to properly take pictures at sea, you must first familiarize yourself with the most attractive poses.  The position of the arms, legs, rotation of the head and gaze play an almost decisive role in the formulation of the composition of the photo. </p><p>  So, let's look at some attractive ideas. </p><ol><li>  Settle down in the sand and imagine that this is the best day of your life.  You are freed from the daily routine and nothing distracts you from enjoying the sun.  Bend your back, bend your knees slightly and flirtatiously expose your face to the sun. </li><li>  Add a little romance to your look.  Turn to the sea and look towards the horizon separating the sky and the sea.  Think of something unobtrusive and enjoyable. </li><li>  You do not need to learn how to take pictures at sea, because you are a goddess.  Feel free, relaxed, and sexy.  Sit back on the rock and leave your body to the camera.  One hand can be launched into the hair, this will give the image even more sexuality.  The other hand is a support.  You can also play with your legs, arrange them in different positions: one to bend a little, the other to leave in a relaxed straightened state. </li><li>  Get out of the sea smoothly and <span>beautifully, gait</span> supermodels on the catwalk.  Play with accessories, flirty touch one hand to the sunglasses, slightly lower them, show your playful look.  Or even get rid of everything superfluous, play with the position of your body, put your hands in your hair.  Be free in your movements, and this freedom will be transferred to your photos. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea photo beach" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22962/492985.jpg" width="550"></div></li><li>  Demonstrate the beauty of your body, the smooth curves of the waist and hips.  This is best done in a lying position on your side.  You can lean on one hand, place the other on your hips.  Or completely position the body on soft sand.  You can look into the lens, watch a sexy guy in the distance, or admire the seagulls in the sky. </li><li>  Conquer everyone with your smile.  There is nothing more beautiful than the sea, photos, the beach and a <span>sincere smile.</span>  Imagine the <span>expression on your</span> friend‚Äôs <span>face</span> when she understands that your summer photos are much cooler, and laugh at it heartily.  And then imagine that this is a handsome guy who has delivered a terrific compliment to you, thank him with a sweet smile. </li><li>  Seduce your eyes.  Take some close-up shots and play with facial expressions and facial expressions.  Present the whole spectrum of your emotions.  You will see how much the photo changes, even if you take them in the same position. </li><li>  Enjoy every minute on the coast.  Sit on your knees, hug them with your hands, close your eyes and take a deep breath with pleasure.  Life is Beautiful! </li><li>  The perspective from above can look very interesting and unusual.  Sit on the sand and rest your hands behind your back.  Play with the position of the head and the direction of your gaze. </li><li>  Attach accessories and additional items to the shooting.  Throw green apples on the sand, hug a teddy bear, or sit on your favorite chair in the reach of the waves.  Bring something unusual to the beach, out of this world ... You will be surprised how amazing the result can be.  How to take pictures at sea so that everyone gasps with delight?  Come up with something non-standard and creative! <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to take pictures on the beach" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/493619.jpg" width="577"></div></li><li>  Animals in the photo play a special role.  When we see a cat, a dog or, for example, a horse in the frame, our emotions appear in their original form.  <span>It is tenderness</span> and admiration, mixed together.  Of course, attracting an animal to the shooting is not easy, but the result is worth it.  It is already worth interacting with your partner in a photo shoot.  Treat the animal as an equal, and not as an interesting subject - and get the appropriate return. </li><li>  Hair is one of the main assets of girls.  Play with them, raise them, run your hand in them, throw them on one side or make a wave of hair.  It is not easy to achieve such an effect, most likely, you will have to devote a lot of time and several dozen frames to this moment, but if you get a shot, then everyone‚Äôs delight is guaranteed. </li></ol><p>  How to take pictures at sea so that your picture resembles a magazine cover?  Show all your sexuality and femininity, be creative - and get the desired result. </p>

    <p>  What is the best way to be photographed at sea by a couple in love?  Here are some ideas! </p><ol><li>  Stand back to back, hold hands and look at the camera. </li><li>  The guy hugs the girl from behind, the look can be fixed in the distance. </li><li>  Jump up holding hands. </li><li>  The girl bows her head to the guy‚Äôs shoulder. </li><li>  The guy kisses his lover's hand. </li><li>  The guy holds the girl's hand, standing on one knee. </li><li>  The guy lifts the girl above himself (as in the film "Dirty Dancing"). </li><li>  Get on your knees, turn to face each other.  The guy touches the girl‚Äôs face with his palm. </li><li>  Imagine a cute conversation, flirt with each other. </li><li>  Kiss!  Such shots are the most tremulous. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How beautifully photographed at sea" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22962/493013.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ol><p>  But by the way, it doesn‚Äôt matter what position you choose, the main thing is that you, your beloved and the view of the sea, get into the lens.  Photos should be live, talk about your feelings.  Show a certain relationship, chemistry.  Beautiful photos of a couple are not just fulfilled poses, this is a romantic story.  Remember this! </p><h2>  There should be a lot of beauty, or How to photograph girls with magnificent volumes at sea </h2><p>  Everyone can be photogenic.  Of course, a sultry beauty with perfect forms to fall in love with a camera is much easier than a lady with excessive pounds.  But a woman remains a woman, regardless of weight category.  And this means that she wants to look attractive, including in the photo. </p><p>  How to take pictures at sea to full girls to hide visible flaws from the all-seeing camera lens? </p><p>  First of all, you must recognize yourself as you are.  45 kg or 90 kg - yes, a big difference.  But you are you, with all the advantages and disadvantages.  If your figure is different from ideal parameters, this does not mean that you are unattractive.  Do not be shy about yourself, your body, thereby driving yourself into a web of contrived complexes.  You just need to find yourself, your style and a good angle. </p><p>  In order to visually reduce volumes, it is better to become not directly, but in a half turn.  In the full-length photo, you can slightly cross your legs.  <span>The wide hips</span> are hidden with the help of hands: lower one hand along the hip, hiding its outline, the second can be placed on the hip.  Use additional items and accessories to hide the splendor of certain areas of the body. </p><p>  In a sitting position, it is also better to use a half-angle view.  Hands can be folded on your knees, but so that the line of the hips was hidden behind them. </p><p>  In portrait photography and in all close-ups, you need to take pictures a little from above.  Thus, the forms are more compact and slightly elongated vertically, double chins and unnecessary folds disappear. </p><p>  A face that is too round can be corrected by loosening the hair and covering the side contours of the face. </p><p>  Choose a suitable posture for yourself, pull in your stomach, proudly straighten your shoulders, chest forward!  Show the camera your most amazing smile, because this is your best <span>vacation on the sea.</span>  Photos can be proudly posted on the pages of your home album. </p>

    <p>  So the most capricious fashion models are children at sea.  A photo with them is joy, and successful photos are joy squared.  But be that as it may, each parent wants to capture his child on vacation.  What to do?  Tip: just watch the child and at the right time click on the "start".  The most lively and emotional photos with children are obtained when the child does not suspect that he is being shot.  He swims in the sea, builds sand castles, tries to make new acquaintances ... The child has fun, and does not wrinkle his forehead from the fact that his parents tore him from an exciting occupation.  These moments deserve a place in the family photo album. </p>
