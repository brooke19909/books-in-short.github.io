If in many other scientific disciplines there are two main <span>methods of cognition,</span> namely observation and experiment, then only the first method is available for history.  Even though every true scientist tries to minimize the impact on the object of observation, he still interprets what he saw in his own way.  Depending on the methodological approaches used by scientists, the world receives various interpretations of the same event, various teachings, schools and so on. </p>

    <p>  The following methods of historical research are distinguished: <br>  - brain teaser, <br>  - general scientific </p><p>  - special <br>  - interdisciplinary. </p><p>  <strong><span>Logical methods of</span> historical research</strong> <strong><br></strong>  In practice, historians have to use <span>special</span> research <span>methods</span> , which are based on logical and general scientific methods.  Logical <span>(philosophical) methods</span> include <span>analysis and synthesis,</span> analogy and comparison, modeling and generalization, and others. </p><p>  Synthesis involves the reunion of an event or object from more than small components, that is, it uses the movement from simple to complex.  The complete opposite of synthesis is analysis, in which you have to move from complex to simple. </p><p>  No less important are such research methods in history as induction and deduction.  The latter allows us to develop a theory based on the systematization of empirical knowledge of the studied object, deriving numerous consequences.  Induction, on the other hand, transfers everything from a particular to a general, often probabilistic, position. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientists also use analgesia and comparison.  The first makes it possible to see a certain similarity between different objects that have a large number of relations, properties and other things, and a comparison is a judgment about the signs of differences and similarities between objects.  Comparison is extremely important for qualitative and quantitative characteristics, classification, evaluation and other things. </p><p>  Of particular importance are the methods of historical research modeling, which allows only to suggest a connection between objects in order to identify their location in the system, and generalization is a method that identifies common features that allow you to make an even more abstract version of an event or some other process. </p><p>  <strong>General scientific methods of historical research</strong> <strong><br></strong>  In this case, the above methods are supplemented by empirical methods of cognition, that is, experiment, observation and measurement, as well as theoretical research methods, such as mathematical methods, transitions from abstract to concrete and vice versa, and others. </p><p>  <strong>Special methods of historical research</strong> <strong><br></strong>  One of the most important in this area is the <span>comparative historical method,</span> which not only identifies the underlying problems of phenomena, but also points to similarities and peculiarities in historical processes, indicates the trends of various events. </p><p>  At one time, the theory of Karl Marx and his <span>historical-dialectical method</span> gained particular popularity <span>,</span> in contrast to which the civilizational method came forward. </p><p>  <strong>Interdisciplinary research methods in history</strong> <strong><br></strong>  Like any other science, history is interconnected with other disciplines that help to know the unknown to explain certain historical events.  For example, using the methods of psychoanalysis, historians have the opportunity to interpret the behavior of historical figures.  Very important is the interaction between geography and history, which resulted in a cartographic method of research.  Linguistics allowed us to learn a lot about early history through a synthesis of the approaches of history and linguistics.  The connections between history and sociology, mathematics, etc. are also very close. </p><p>  <span>The cartographic method of</span> research is a separate section of cartography that has important historical and economic significance.  With its help, you can not only determine the place of residence of individual tribes, designate the movement of tribes, etc., but also find out the location of minerals and other important objects. </p><p>  Obviously, history is closely interconnected with other sciences, which greatly facilitate research and provide an opportunity to obtain more complete and extensive information about the studied object. </p>
