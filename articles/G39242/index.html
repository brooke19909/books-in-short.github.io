Sitges is a town that falls into this category.  It is located in the possessions of Catalonia, near Barcelona.  In ancient times, it was only a fishing village, and in the twentieth century it received the status of a city, although in fact it is a very quiet and peaceful place. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that it is provincial Spain, Sitges is a place where there are many clubs, museums and other entertainment venues.  Young people from all over Europe constantly come here in order to relax from student everyday life and just enjoy the night and day life, the sea, the sun and the golden Catalan sands.  It should be noted that the beaches in this resort are very clean and well-groomed, therefore they have repeatedly received the Blue Flag award for this. </p><p>  On the territory of this tiny town you can buy real branded items, jewelry and household items.  It is full of boutiques and shopping centers that offer their customers a very wide selection of products, which not all of Spain can boast of. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sitges Spain Photo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/277783.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sitges is a city that is located an hour from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãso you can get there through <span>this metropolis.</span>  Direct flights from Moscow go there every day, and after landing at the airport, just take the train or bus that will take you directly to Sitges.  You can also rent a car in this region, and then any of your journeys will become even more comfortable and enjoyable. </p><p>  The European country, which in the summer is literally overflowing with tourists, is, of course, Spain.  Sitges collects on its not very vast lands a huge number of people from different countries, therefore its beaches are constantly crammed.  If you value a secluded vacation, then the suburban coasts, in which there are much fewer tourists than in urban recreation areas, are a suitable place.  Outside the city there are also gay beaches and nudist bays.  It is worth noting that near any recreation area there are always several beach cafes where you can order ice cream, a cocktail or something to eat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sitges Spain Attractions" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/277425.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The place where luxurious cottages, expensive hotels and various palaces are located is Sitges, Spain.  The sights of this city are almost all dated to the XX-XXI century. Among them are the House of Pere Carreres, as well as the villa "Anita", which were built in the first half of the last century.  The only property of the city, which has been preserved since ancient times, is the church of St. Bartholomew and St. Thecla, which was built here on the very shore of the sea in the 17th century.  Also, tourists often visit the Marisel Palace, which appeared here in 1912.  Its large stylish halls and an exhibition of paintings that belonged to Charles Deering are famous. </p><p>  In conclusion, it should be said that the place where you can learn how to make unmatched cocktails, play the guitar and cook paella is Sitges, Spain.  Photos of the city are presented in the article, and although looking at them, you can‚Äôt immediately say all this, it‚Äôs still worth going there.  You can fully enjoy the local cuisine, and drinks, and the charming charm of the fishing past, and the noisy present of this city. </p>
