    <h2>  Brief description of the company </h2><p>  Liga Money is a young and promising company providing microcredit services.  It was founded in April 2014.  At the same time, the MFI passed state registration and issued the first microloan.  Initially, it was a small company with disabilities and a small team.  A little later, League of Money (reviews of this company can be found below) has grown into a real retail network. </p><p>  Currently, the company is widely represented in 20 regions of Russia.  But this figure, according to the founders of MFIs, is not a limit.  It is planned to open over 50 new representative offices by the end of this year.  It is difficult to say whether it will be able to fulfill the promise or not.  But it is absolutely clear that the ambitions of this company literally beat over the edge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What services does it provide? </h2><p>  ‚ÄúLeague of Money‚Äù (reviews about this organization left by users partially affect its reputation) provides microcredit services for individuals and legal entities.  Currently, MFIs offer the three most popular programs: </p><ul><li>  Bronze loan; </li><li>  "Silver"; </li><li>  "Gold". </li></ul><p>  All three programs are inappropriate consumer microloans issued in the amount of 10,000 to 50,000 rubles, for a period not exceeding 52 weeks.  Such loans are issued in national currency.  And the rate is 150.80-201.76% per year or from 0.42% per day. </p>

    <h2>  Options for obtaining a microloan </h2><p>  If there is an approved application, League of Money (customer reviews confirm this) offer the following options for obtaining a loan: </p><ul><li>  by crediting the loan amount to the bank account of the loaned person; </li><li>  by crediting a credit amount to a customer‚Äôs card; </li><li>  money transfer through partner banks and other organizations, terminals. </li></ul><p>  In a word, you can choose any convenient option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What do customers say about the company‚Äôs service? </h2><p>  In order to understand how professionally the representatives of the company work, it is enough to study the reviews.  The League of Money company is often spoken of in a positive way.  For example, some MFI clients confidently state that they are completely satisfied with the quality of service.  Others enthusiastically tell how quickly they managed to get a loan.  According to them, all the paperwork took no more than 10-15 minutes. </p><p>  Some talk about helpful and polite managers who are always in touch.  It is they who so often help to find the answer to urgent questions.  Others talk about the convenience of working with personal managers.  In their opinion, it is very convenient that each client has his own credit assistant.  Of course, there are also people who are dissatisfied with the service, who were deprived of attention in a particular department.  But you will not please everyone.  How many people, so many opinions. </p>

    <h2>  Who can get a loan at the Money League? </h2><p>  It is believed that everyone can apply to MFIs.  But this is far from the case.  As with any financial institution, Liga Money LLC (reviews of companies of such a plan are often associated with a number of erroneous opinions) has its own rules for potential borrowers.  Among them are the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  age within 18-75 years; </li><li>  the presence of citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  availability of permanent registration at the place of residence; </li><li>  permanent residence in the area where the MFI office is located; </li><li>  having an open <span>bank account</span> or card. </li></ul><p>  In addition, a potential borrower of a non-banking organization is obliged to inspire confidence in the League of Money microfinance company.  Reviews about this company allow you to think about how seriously they approach customer assessment here.  According to most borrowers, MFI representatives ask a number of questions, sometimes conduct testing and even make a visual assessment of potential clients.  Ultimately, this allows them to reduce the risk of meeting an unscrupulous borrower. </p>

    <h2>  Lending conditions: do borrowers like them? </h2><p>  Many borrowers who have managed to solve their financial problems with the help of the ‚ÄúMoney League‚Äù like the terms of the loan.  According to them, the loan itself can be obtained by passport.  At the same time, it is possible to submit an application in any convenient way, for example, to come to the MFI department or through a special form on the ligadeneg.ru website, call the hotline: 8 (800) 234-67-67. </p><p>  Some borrowers of the League of Money company (their reviews are often accompanied by a detailed description of the situation) like an individual approach.  According to them, all applications of potential customers are considered individually.  And after their approval, the borrower is waiting for a personal credit schedule and special conditions calculated exclusively for him. </p>

    <h2>  How difficult it is to work at Money League: employee reviews </h2><p>  In order to assess the quality of the company, sometimes it‚Äôs not enough to study only the opinions of users.  It is believed that in this case the picture will not be complete.  Consequently, the grade given to the League of Money company will not be correct.  Employee reviews in this situation will help resolve the dilemma and display MFIs in all its glory. </p><p>  For example, former employees of this company often speak of strict discipline.  They complain about the extremely short <span>lunch break</span> and the tough demands on smokers.  Others like the opportunity for rapid career growth and the presence of an <span>individual approach to each client.</span> </p><p>  Some of them are satisfied with the conditions for granting microloans, namely, short terms.  According to them, such customers are easier to control, track payments and possible late payments.  This is exactly what people who previously worked or still work at Liga Money LLC believe.  Employee reviews, as you can see, are connected with the internal schedule, the features of the labor regime and other working moments. </p>

    <h2>  The nuances of paying a microloan in an MFI </h2><p>  Making planned payments on a microloan is not difficult at all.  To do this, go to the company‚Äôs website, select the ‚ÄúPay‚Äù tab and fill out the appropriate form.  It must contain the following data: </p><ul><li>  loan agreement number; </li><li>  FULL NAME; </li><li>  amount. </li></ul><p>  Then it remains only to choose a payment method "Credit card" and make a payment. </p><h2>  Is it profitable to apply to the Money League? </h2><p>  According to some customers, taking a loan at Money League is very profitable if you follow the schedule and do not miss the payment dates.  According to others, the interest here is high, therefore, it is unprofitable to arrange a loan for a long period.  Still others say the opposite.  In their opinion, the rate in this company is much lower than that of other MFIs. </p><h2>  What about late payment? </h2><p>  Based on the rules of MFIs, if there is an untimely or late payment, the borrower needs to pay a penalty.  Its size, as a rule, is indicated in the text of the loan agreement and amounts to 20% per annum of the total amount that was late or not received at all.  If the debtor refuses to pay the bills, the MFI transfers its credit to third parties for the purpose of further collection.  However, the borrower has the right to prohibit the lender from contacting third-party organizations, in this case, representatives of collection agencies.  To do this, he needs to write an additional statement.  It is his employees of the League of Money who usually attach to the personal file of the borrower.  It is noteworthy that all this information is available in the loan agreement.  But, as practice shows, most citizens, if they read it, are very inattentive.  How is it really? </p><h2>  What do users say about loan debt? </h2><p>  Turning to a <span>microfinance organization,</span> many clients behave very imposingly.  And all because the MFI is a non-banking organization.  But this opinion turns out to be erroneous, because after several missed payments the borrower is charged interest and penalties. </p><p>  When the amount of non-payment reaches a certain limit, representatives of the ‚ÄúMoney League‚Äù simply transfer the debtor's case to the collectors.  And with them, as you know, the conversation is short.  That is why most of the negative reviews regarding MFIs are related to the work of collection companies.  For example, some defaulters talk about how collectors call and threaten them over the phone.  Others report the amount of debt, painting the walls in the porch with paint.  Still others talk about a damaged door, into which specialists trying to get out debts, etc. </p><p>  That's just none of them even thinks that any life difficulties can be resolved peacefully, for example, by reporting them to the representatives of MFIs.  They can revise the payment schedule, agree to a partial repayment of the loan and even lower interest.  But all this with real customer troubles that are easy to verify and prove. </p>
