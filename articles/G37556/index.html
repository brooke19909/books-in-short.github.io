    <h2>  Bank financial problems </h2><p>  According to most customers, they could not have imagined that their guarantor was experiencing any financial difficulties.  For example, Miraf-Bank (Omsk) paid interest on a regular basis, issued loans and touted with new <span>banking products.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It all started in December 2015, when one of the influential financial portals published on its website a message about the disconnection of Miraf Bank from BESP payments. </p><p>  At that time, the bank's customers did not yet realize the seriousness of their beloved guarantor.  In addition, the press service of the financial organization Miraf Bank (Omsk, the city where the company‚Äôs head office is located) continued to insist on full control over the situation. </p><p>  On the day of publication of the message, the press service of the bank made a statement about some misunderstanding in the program.  At the same time, they insisted that all payments will continue to occur as usual.  But it turned out to be much more serious. </p>

    <h2>  Miraf Bank: problems (termination of payments on deposits) </h2><p>  Since the end of December 2015, Miraf Bank has ceased to issue deposits.  According to the new rule of a financial organization, residents of Omsk were allowed to withdraw no more than 10-15,000 rubles per day.  Ito by prior request.  However, larger amounts on deposits simply froze and refused to issue even parts. </p><p>  On December 28 of the same year, Miraf Bank (payments here could be made in national and foreign currencies) organized a global meeting.  According to preliminary data, it was held at the head office of the joint-stock company (on Frunze St.). </p><p>  But even then, bank representatives denied solvency problems.  They assured everyone that the reason for the delays in payments was a change in the financial policy of the credit institution. </p><p>  Among the possible reasons, according to eyewitnesses, the bank called illegal panic of customers.  It is because of them that Miraf Bank does not make payments.  This is due to the incredible number of requests from users who simply did not have time to process the employees of the organization. </p><p>  Then, the joint-stock company employees strongly recommended to be patient and entrust the matter to professionals.  The depositors could only believe and expect a final verdict. </p>

    <h2>  Introduction of interim administration in the bank </h2><p>  The situation finally became clear only after the total checks of the bank began.  Then, the regulator introduced an interim administration.  It was she who managed to discover the real reasons because of which Miraf-Bank does not make payments.  One of them was the financial fraud of the leadership of a credit institution. </p><p>  According to preliminary information, shortly before the introduction of the interim administration, bank representatives sold assets worth more than 560 million rubles.  And they did it in a hurry. </p><p>  At the same time, Miraf Bank (whose problems were just beginning) paid debts in the amount of about 120 million rubles.  Moreover, this money was received from some lenders and given to others. </p><h2>  Inventory and shortfall detection </h2><p>  As a result of the inventory, new facts of bank violation were revealed.  As it turned out, representatives of this financial institution tried to hide from the regulator a shortage of property in the amount of 288.53 million rubles.  Moreover, a significant part of the amount was associated with the absence of bonds and bills, as well as loan agreements and other documentation. </p><p>  In addition to securities in the Miraf Bank organization (the company's problems are related to the unlawful management policy), the audit revealed unaccounted furniture, equipment, bills and vehicles.  All of them actually "hung in the air" and were not listed anywhere. </p><p>  During the audit, a huge ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the joint-stock company‚Äôs budget was also identified, amounting to 1 billion 512.8 million rubles.  It was this amount that determined the difference between the size of the bank‚Äôs assets and its liabilities. </p>

    <h2>  Revocation of a license from Miraf Bank </h2><p>  As a result of the work, the commission of inquiry made a lot of conclusions, clearly not in favor of the Miraf-Bank credit institution.  The license was revoked as a result of the audit, and the reputation of the joint-stock company was completely damaged. </p><p>  According to official data, among the reasons that led to the revocation of the license were the following: </p><ul><li>  repeated violation of federal laws and regulations; </li><li>  the provision of incorrect and inaccurate data on the financial activities of the company; </li><li>  mediation in money laundering of wealthy citizens; </li><li>  investing in low-quality assets without creating additional reserves; </li><li>  default on creditors. </li></ul><p>  And so he lost the license of Miraf Bank.  Its branches, opened in <span>Moscow, Omsk,</span> Togliatti and other cities of the Russian Federation, were closed before further orders of the Central Bank. </p><h2>  Bank Trial and Bankruptcy Declaration </h2><p>  After the license was revoked, the Central Bank filed a lawsuit in which it demanded that the financial institution be declared bankrupt.  As a result of the trial, held on January 24, 2016, the court declared Miraf Bank insolvent.  After that <span>, the Deposit Insurance Agency</span> announced its verdict <span>.</span>  According to this statement, the bankrupt bank depositors had to pay about 2.8 billion rubles of compensation. </p><h2>  Payments for depositors of a bankrupt organization </h2><p>  In order to avoid panic among depositors, the DIA representative office announced the beginning of insurance payments of Miraf Bank on February 4, 2016.  At the same time, the amount of this compensation should have amounted to 100% of the sum of all accounts of the depositor previously opened in a bankrupt bank.  However, the remuneration received should not have exceeded 1.4 million rubles in total. </p><p>  Depositors can receive the compensation set by the DIA by February 4, 2017.  Payments in this case were taken by Rosselkhozbank.  Moreover, each investor has the right to choose the most convenient option for receiving money (in cash or in the form of crediting to the client‚Äôs bank account). </p><p>  In order to find out information regarding the addresses of the operating branches of the agent bank, you need to call the hotline: 8 (800) 200-02-90.  The order of payments can be tracked by publications made in the print edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda in Omsk. </p><p>  At the moment, about 4.8 thousand individuals, as well as 150 medium and large-level entrepreneurs, have applied to Miraf Bank for compensation issues.  In the near future, the number of applicants for compensation, according to representatives of the DIA, will increase significantly. </p>
