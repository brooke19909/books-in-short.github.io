If you like to create something new with your hands, decorate your home with designer crafts, decorations and panels, you know exactly what it is about.  Not a single thing that any other person does not need is subjected to such creative attention as needleworkers.  So, for example, they do not ignore wine corks.  They make excellent home decorations, useful and just pleasing to the eye.  Are you curious to see what we have prepared for you?  Then go ahead, we have in store a couple of successful crafts. </p><h2>  Creativity </h2><p>  Following our instructions, you can make excellent crafts, for example, paintings, convenient coasters, figures.  You can‚Äôt imagine what can be done from wine corks!  The Internet is full of ideas, but at the same time each of your work will be original, because not a single traffic jam used by you will be like another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wineenthusiast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original cork board" class="if uuid-2581457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581457.jpg"></div><p>  But before creating from them, let's learn how to prepare corks so that it is easier to use them for creating crafts. </p><h2>  Traffic jam preparation </h2><p>  Wine corks can always be used, right?  They can also decorate the wall, and decorate a corner in your kitchen, and create panels or neat coasters, tags and key rings.  And when you have collected enough traffic jams, the question is how to use them correctly.  Often corks, for example, from champagne, have a rumpled appearance, while others, for example, can be dipped in red wine, they need to be leveled and washed.  To work in the future with traffic jams it was simple and pleasant that they easily succumb to the knife, boil them.  No matter how strange it may sound, however, cooking will not only soften the cork, but also clean and level it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="diyjoy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How many interesting things can be made from traffic jams" class="if uuid-2581448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581448.jpg"></div><p>  Having welded a portion of the collected corks, you can safely proceed to the creative process. </p><h2>  Wine cork pattern </h2><p>  Cork panels are very popular, they harmoniously complement any interior.  The paintings look great both in the bedroom and in the kitchen, it all depends on what you depict on them. </p><p>  Look at the beautiful traffic jam picture below.  Gorgeous image that is very easy to lay out.  But start with a simple one, such as flowers, fungi, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodshomedesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great picture!" class="if uuid-2581447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581447.jpg"></div><p>  After you have prepared the corks, divide them by color and cut into circles no more than three millimeters wide.  On the drawing paper, draw the contours of your painting with a pencil.  You can also print your outline by finding a suitable simple picture on the Internet. </p><p>  Place the cork on the paper, do not forget about the colors and shades.  When all the circles are located on the "canvas", take a closer look, whether everything is so, whether everything suits you, whether your picture looks right, and proceed.  Stock up with superglue or glue gun and gradually attach the details to the Whatman paper, collecting the picture, like a puzzle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cfusrug.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Geometry, a panel from traffic jams" class="if uuid-2581463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581463.jpg"></div><p>  See what panel can be made of corks and beer caps.

For example, hot coasters.  In general, a small napkin made of cork circles is just a great decoration for a table in the kitchen or in the living room on a coffee table. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.architecturendesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot Stands" class="if uuid-2581441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581441.jpg"></div><p>  There are many options for creating a stand.  You can cut the corks along or in circles, lay out the ornament, press the circles tightly to each other or glue them in the form of honeycombs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cremedelacraft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great table decoration" class="if uuid-2581455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581455.jpg"></div><p>  Use a hot glue gun to firmly fasten the cork to each other, then you will get excellent, durable, heat-resistant coasters made by yourself from improvised materials. </p><h2>  Examples </h2><p>  How to make a panel of traffic jams, we already know, and what else can you create with your own hands to diversify the interior?

Nice and comfortable, and the keys are always in place. </p><p>  Figures from this material are no less relevant.  See how wonderful this heart of corks looks.  You can put a couple of bottles in it or store any little thing.  Nice decoration in the living room, hallway and kitchen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hometalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wine cork carriage" class="if uuid-2581466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2581466.jpg"></div><p>  There are many other options, such as candle holders, cork boards, brooches and wreaths.
