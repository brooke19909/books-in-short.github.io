Such figures from long balls can often be received as a gift at performances of circus artists.  However, with proper dexterity, any person will be able to please his family and friends with an unusual air present.  In order to understand all the intricacies of this case, read the useful tips for making figures from a long ball and instructions for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balloons" class="if uuid-2700380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2700380.jpg"></div><h2>  Which balls are best to choose and what might be needed </h2><p>  In order to make a figure of long balls with your own hands, you will need a manual or mechanical pump specifically designed for inflating balls.  It is very difficult to inflate long balls with your mouth, and besides, if you want to make several figures of medium complexity, you will need to inflate about ten balls, which not everyone can do.  For the first time, when you are just starting to practice figures from balls, do not spend a lot of money on a pump - take the cheapest, plastic, manual one. </p><p>  When choosing balls, pay attention to their size: they should be quite long so that different compositions can be made from them.  If the figure you want to make consists of many small details, then give preference to shorter balls and in the course of work, connect them together. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not save on balls: the cheapest are made of thin rubber, which will greatly complicate your work.  Agree, it will be very unpleasant to hear a pop from a bursting ball at the very end of the manufacture of a beautiful figure.  Also appreciate the smell of latex - it should not be caustic and chemical, as manufacturers often tend to save on dyes and replace high-quality materials with toxic and harmful ones for both children and adults. </p><h2>  What figures to start with </h2><p>  Before you can amaze your family with complex compositions, you must master the simplest figures of balloons.  First, learn how to make small balls.  To do this, step back from the end of the inflated ball to the end of the ball for at least three centimeters and scroll the ball around its axis.  Repeat this item to fasten it. </p><p>  The next step is to learn how to fold the ball into a ring: for this, connect the two ends of the ball to each other using a thread or just tie the ends together. </p><p>  Heart - is a kind of ring from a ball, since in fact it is the same figure only with a recess in the middle.  To obtain a characteristic bend of the heart, bend a long ball in half, bend its ends in the opposite direction, and then connect them together. </p><p>  By learning these three elements, you can make almost any shape out of long balls. </p><h2>  The figure of the balls - a dog </h2><p>  To get the most popular shape from a long ball, you must: </p><ol><li>  Inflate the balloon, leaving an end of 15 cm. </li><li>  Now twist three small balls from the inflated edge. </li><li>  Next, connect the second and third balls and twist them together so that you get a muzzle of a dog and two ears. </li><li>  Now twist the oblong bubble, which will act as the neck of our future dog. </li><li>  The next step is to twist two longer sections - the front legs of the dog.  Connect them together in a "lock" way - you should get a narrow ring. </li><li>  Now twist three more bubbles: long and two shorter - this will be the trunk and hind legs.  Connect the hind legs in the same way as in the previous paragraph. </li><li>  The rest of the ball is the tail. </li></ol><p>  By varying the length of the body parts, you can make a giraffe, a cat, a hare, and a tiger. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesprucecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two dogs made of balls" class="if uuid-2700379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2700379.jpg"></div><h2>  Elephant made of long balloons </h2><p>  To understand how to make a figure out of long balls in the form of an elephant, it is not necessary to have extensive experience in this interesting lesson.  Just follow the simple instructions: </p><ol><li>  To begin, inflate the ball, leaving a small edge at the base. </li><li>  Twist three oblong "sausages", which should occupy about half the ball - these will be the ears and trunk.

Connect your legs together to form a ring. </li><li>  Roll the tail out of the remaining small ball. </li><li>  Draw an elephant eye marker or stick a couple of stickers in the form of eyes. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ball elephant" class="if uuid-2700385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2700385.jpg"></div><h2>  Balloon swan </h2><p>  A very cute bird - a symbol of love and fidelity - can be made from one long ball.  For this you need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Inflate the balloon, leaving about eight centimeters at one end. </li><li>  Twist a small bubble at the edge of the ball - this is the tail. </li><li>  To retreat from the opposite edge about thirty centimeters and twist the "sausage". </li><li>  Now connect the bubble and the place where the second part twists.  You should get a ring with a small bubble at the top - the trunk and tail. </li><li>  Now twist the third bubble, about twenty centimeters long, and roll it also into a ring.  The resulting figure resembles a figure eight. </li><li>  Now push the resulting part into the ring of the first bubble - these will be the wings of our swan. </li><li>  Next, bend the remaining end of the ball in the shape of a long neck and head.  The remaining inflated end will serve as a beak. </li><li>  Draw the eyes of the bird. </li></ol><p>  With proper dexterity, it will take no more than three minutes to make such a figure, and the result looks more than cute and will definitely appeal to romantic people and children.  Also, such swans can be launched into the garden pond during the event to decorate the area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ball swan" class="if uuid-2700703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2700703.jpg"></div><h2>  Dinosaur </h2><p>  Another figure, which is based on the ‚Äúdog‚Äù pattern, is a dinosaur, but it has several features: firstly, the production starts from the tail, secondly, there is no muzzle, and thirdly, a recognizable scallop is located on top. </p><ol><li>  Inflate the ball and from the edge where the place of air intake is located, roll up three "sausages" - tail and legs. </li><li>  Fold your legs in a ring, as explained in the figures of an elephant and a dog. </li><li>  Then make one more ring - this will be the body of our dinosaur. </li><li>  Next, roll five small balls and place them above the body, twisting at its base. </li><li>  Make two "sausages" and roll them into a ring to make front paws. </li><li>  With the last step, bend the face of the dinosaur so that it does not merge with the neck. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="asubtlerevelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balloon Dinosaur" class="if uuid-2700382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2700382.jpg"></div><h2>  A simple figure of long balloons with your own hands: a bouquet of flowers </h2><p>  To please loved ones with an original bouquet, you can spend an hour of your time on it instead of a thousand rubles.
