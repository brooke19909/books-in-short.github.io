Reichenbach Falls, which attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world every year, is one of the main attractions of this country.  This article will tell the reader basic information about him. </p><h2>  Reichenbach Falls: Description </h2><p>  He is not the tallest and most powerful on our planet.  Formed from <span>thawed snow</span> on the peaks of the Alps, a powerful and noisy water stream carries its waters into the abyss, which, as it seems, has no bottom.  From its depths, small splashes fly in all directions, like smoke from a fire, forming a water curtain. </p><p>  Shining rocks surround this <span>stormy stream,</span> striking in its strength.  If you look into the very abyss, then at a depth you can see how a stream boils in a narrowed vent.  His roar never ceases.  And at the same time it is so loud that people literally stall, and they begin to feel dizzy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reichenbach waterfall switzerland" class="if uuid-2277983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2277983.jpg"></div><p>  This waterfall has entered the classical world literature.  Everyone who has read Arthur Conan Doyle's detective stories in his youth will probably remember that it was in this place that a fight broke out between <span>Professor Moriarty</span> and Sherlock Holmes.  If in those days when the great writer lived, a trip to these places was accessible to very few, today, with the development of tourism, travelers from all over the world come to the Berskoe Highlands, to the tiny town of Mayrigen.  They strive to see this amazing cascade and the Australian Alps, where you can enjoy the beauty of snow-capped peaks.  It is here that the famous mountain stream is formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reichenbach is not just a waterfall, but a large multi-stage cascade.  Its total height is 250 meters.  This water stream is considered one of the highest and most powerful in the Alps, included in the ranking of the most beautiful in Europe.  The landscape surrounding the Reichenbach waterfall is stunning: numerous streams, majestic alpine peaks covered with caps of never-melting glaciers, medieval, like toy villages.  The Aare River carries its waters along a narrow gorge.  The Reichenbach Falls, the photo of which we posted in this article, is served by a funicular that delivers tourists for 10 Swiss francs directly to the abyss. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reichenbach Falls Description" class="if uuid-2277984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2277984.jpg"></div><p>  The observation deck, from which one hundred twenty meters of the water stream is visible, framed by rocks, is located on the Terminus plateau.  Those who wish can climb even higher, to the beginning of the waterfall, on foot.  Such a walk will take no more than twenty minutes.  From the top there are stunning views of huge wells, funnels, washed by a stream of great power in mighty rocks. </p><h2>  Meiringen </h2><p>  The town is located in the vicinity of Interlaken.  He went down in history for two reasons.  According to legend, at the end of the XVIII century, the Italian chef Gasparini came up with an original air cake, consisting of egg whipped with sugar.  He named it after an alpine village.  The unusual taste of the cake was appreciated at the court of Louis XV, and the first name meiring, under the influence of French pronunciation, began to sound like meringue (meringue).  In our country, a sweet snow-white dessert is known as a meringue (baiser), which translates as a kiss. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But it is worth recognizing that the current hotel owners earn on behalf of the famous London detective, who supposedly died in the abyss of Reichenbach Falls.  One of the most famous hotels is adorned with a Baker Street plate.  Next to the Parkhotel du Sauvage, inside a small wooden church, is a museum that is a reconstruction of Holmes's London apartment.  In the mid-eighties of the last century, a bronze statue of the legendary detective appeared here.  She took pride of place in Conan Doyle Square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.notabletravels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meiringen in Switzerland" class="if uuid-2277985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2277985.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the waterfall located? </h2><p>  This incredible natural wonder is located near Willengen, two kilometers from Meiringen.  In fact, the waterfall is located between two large cities - Interlaken and Lucerne.  A cable car runs to Reichenbach Falls from Meiringen.  The coordinates of this attraction are 46 ¬∞ 42`49` north latitude and 8 ¬∞ 10`57` east longitude. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="46.703243" data-lng="8.175742600000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/3/3/933.png"></div><h2>  Waterfall Attractions </h2><p>  At the very top station of the funicular, there is a route diagram of Conan Doyle.  When the great English writer visited here, he decided that it was here that his beloved hero, the famous Sherlock Holmes, should die.  Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland is overthrown from almost sheer cliffs, raising a huge fountain of spray. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myswitzerland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reichenbach Falls: Funicular" class="if uuid-2277986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2277986.jpg"></div><p>  If you go back down the mountain, opposite the movement of the funicular, you will get to the site where the fight occurred, which was described by Conan Doyle in the story ‚ÄúHolmes‚Äôs Last Affair‚Äù.  Here is a commemorative plaque.  Interestingly, the Soviet audience saw not the Swiss Reichenbach waterfall, but the Abkhaz Gegsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sherlockology.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfall sights" class="if uuid-2277995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2277995.jpg"></div><p>  If you have such an opportunity, be sure to take a walk along one of Conan Doyle's routes.  On the upper platform you can visit the cozy restaurant Gasthaus Zwirgi, where you will be offered a special signature dish of local chefs - ‚ÄúWitch Fondue‚Äù. </p><h2>  Reichenbach Falls: how to get there? </h2><p>  You can use the rail.  The journey from Zurich to the waterfall will take about three hours.  First you need to get to Interlaken or Lucerne.  Experienced tourists recommend choosing the second option: you do not need to make additional transfers.  The road will take a little more than an hour.  From Lucerne, Giswil Station can be reached by train in 30 minutes.  From here, a bus takes you 20 minutes to Meiringen.  You can walk to the funicular from the station in 20 minutes or wait for bus number 114 and take it to the Klinik Reichenbach stop. </p><p>  The funicular that runs on the Meiringen-Reichenbach route takes you to the lower observation deck on Mount Terminus.  It offers a magnificent view of the freely falling water stream (120 meters).  And since the height of the waterfall is twice as large, you can walk to the middle and upper platform.  If you go uphill with a brisk pace, the road will take about half an hour. </p><h2>  Tour cost </h2><p>  Switzerland is a rather expensive country, so many are interested in how much it costs to visit Reichenbach Falls.  If you will depart from Zurich, then a ticket to Meiringen (second class) will cost 39 francs (2,300 rubles).  Getting through <span>intermediate stations,</span> costs will not change.  If you use the city bus, add another 3 francs (180 rubles) and 10 francs (600 rubles) for the funicular.  Do not throw away the last ticket after the first trip - it is valid for the return trip to Meiringen.  The attraction can only be visited in the warm season: from May to October. </p>
