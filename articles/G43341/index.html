Thanks to them, you can create all kinds of masterpieces that become an adornment of clothing, items of room design and other accessories.  It is only necessary to select correctly the embroidery technique that will be combined with the main product.  In this article, we will analyze the back needle stitch in detail.  It is often called backstitch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seam back needle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/119499.jpg" width="438"></div>

    <p>  This stitch is contour and is used in embroidery to highlight elements and give clarity to the picture.  They also sometimes replace the sewing machine, connecting the two parts with each other, but now we will focus on embroidery.  In his works, he is often used to depict animals eyes, nose, mouth, in general, all the details that require clarity. </p><p>  On embroidery patterns, it is usually indicated by a solid line.  In such sources there is always an explanation of which thread to embroider should be used and how many layers should be folded.  The main point here is the beginning of work only when the thing (or other accessory) is completely ready.  And in the best case - after the product has been washed. </p><p>  Fix the seam ‚Äúback to the needle‚Äù at the very beginning, using the usual eyelet.  It is better to take a needle, not a thick one, which you embroidered with a cross, but a thin and sharp one so as not to spoil the finished crosses.  Such a technique is considered delicate and delicate, which is why for its implementation it is necessary to use the same tools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery Threads" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/119500.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to properly sew a ‚Äúback needle‚Äù?  First, carefully look at the diagram where this element is present.  After that, we draw the thread to the front part, but not at the starting point, but a little backward in the direction of the picture (usually this is one canvas cell horizontally, vertically or diagonally).  As a rule, the tissue is pierced at point 1. After that, we introduce the needle into the zero point.  And we deduce at point 2, which is at the same distance from 1 as 0. It turns out that you embroider, returning, each time back.  When you have finished the last stitch, on the front of the embroidery, fasten the thread on the wrong side in any way known to you. </p><p>  Another important point is which stitch size to choose.  If your line direction does not change, that is, for example, it goes strictly horizontally, then you can choose not 1 cell, but more.  It is believed that the size of the stitch should not exceed 4 cells, often on the forums needlewomen share their opinion that the length of 3 cells is optimal, otherwise the threads begin to sag.  But if you have a curved line, then it is better to use only 1 cell. </p><p>  Be careful and try to get into the previous stitch so that the seam is even and without spaces.  And also try to pull the threads evenly tight.  If you notice that it doesn‚Äôt work out as intended, it‚Äôs better to dissolve everything and try again.  At first, it may not be perfect for you, so first practice small jobs, and when you fill your hand, it will turn out easily and quickly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The world of embroidery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/119502.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <p>  The result is a more accurate and attractive picture, and another important plus of this seam is that the wrong side is also quite neat.  Experienced needlewomen sometimes replace the ‚Äúback needle‚Äù seam with another or alternate it, since there is not always a desire to cut and stretch the thread again or pull it on the wrong side. </p><p>  Often there are disagreements between needlewomen about whether to complement the picture with such touches or not.  Some believe that the color palette of the <span>picture embroidered with a cross is</span> enough.  Others are sure that it is simply necessary to revive the composition. </p>
