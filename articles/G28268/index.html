Every year this city gains popularity as a tourist destination.  Here you can walk for days on end, but never see at least a quarter of the sights.  As Kafka said: “Prague never lets go.”  So it is, having come here once, you strive to return again and again in order to inspect what you did not manage to or once again get to where you already managed to visit.  Here is such a wonderful city! </p><p>  In view of the growing interest from tourists in the city, more and more hotels are appearing to develop the region, and the old ones, built decades ago, are undergoing reconstruction to meet the requirements of the modern tourist market.  The best Prague hotels in the city center are located.  After all, most of the guests come here just to explore the old town, which is located in <span>the Prague</span> 1 area. <img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Hotels in the City Center" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1533517.jpg" width="600"></p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Once Prague was the capital of Bohemia.  This is a typical European city: with squares, a promenade and bridges over the Vltava River, golden-domed cathedrals and towers, red-tiled roofs, numerous monuments, etc.  Despite the fact that the Czech Republic was also involved in the Second World War, the city was practically not damaged and retained its historical value.  The modern part of the city is also interesting.  There are many modern buildings, restaurants and cafes.  Nevertheless, tourists are drawn to the historical center, which is located in the Prague 1 area. It is here that the best hotels in Prague are located.  In the city center, living is very convenient for tourists.  You can wander late into the old streets and not worry about how, and on what to get to the right place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Old Prague </h2><p>  That is the name of the district number 1 of the Czech capital.  This is the historic city center.  Here at every step you can meet the attraction.  Moreover, one that can take your breath away.  Each kind of old Prague seemed to have come off a postcard.

Of course, the Czech capital is not among the most ancient cities in Europe, but it has a special color, a kind of aura that makes it attractive to millions of tourists.  <span>Charles Bridge is</span> especially interesting for them <span>.</span>  The rulers of the city, Czech rulers liked to walk on it.  Nearby there is their residence - Prague Castle - well, a very grandiose building.  It is interesting to know that this is the largest castle in the world.  In Prague 1, of particular interest is the Josefov quarter, where the Jews lived.  Oddly enough, the German invaders did not want to destroy it, but decided to leave it in memory of the fact that representatives of the biblical people or, as they called them, the "lower race" once lived here.  In the same area is only part of the "small country", consisting of baroque castles.  Hotels in Prague in the city center often look at one or another attraction.  And this is another plus.  Prague 2 is also considered one of the important districts of the capital.  True, it is located on the other side of the Vltava.
