Developers, analyzing their product, try to remove all unnecessary and add something new to their creations.  An example of this is the <span>Logitech</span> G27 <span>steering wheel</span> .  This is a more advanced version of the famous G25, which was released in 2006.  G25 was a real breakthrough, and the players greeted him very warmly.  High quality materials and excellent assembly left no one indifferent.  But he was far from perfect, he had inherent flaws that required improvement, which Logitech did.  Having listened to user comments, the company finalized and created an even more advanced device.  In 2009, the <span>Logitech G27</span> steering wheel appeared on store shelves <span>.</span>  What is the new device surpassed the G25?  Let's take a closer look. </p><h2>  Buttons </h2>

However, only 2 of them were directly on the steering wheel.  To engage others, you had to be distracted by removing your hand.  Logitech's G27 steering wheel no longer has this problem.  There are 4 buttons on the device, for convenience they have been slightly reduced.

LED tachometer, which is used in the "Formula 1".  It is located on the wheel hub and for its operation, the game must support this steering function.  This feature has already appeared in many modern applications and will be implemented in the future.  In the G25, the twin-engine feedback system.  It has a big drawback, namely, a very loud noise.  Logitech G27 steering wheel lacks such a problem due to helical gearing.  The gas pedal is at a different level from the rest, which allows you to not confuse them and more comfortable to use.

But, of course, in the first place was the connection and assembly.  During assembly, you can once again verify the quality of the material from which the steering components are made.  Logitech kept his promise and did not come up with something supernova, but improved the model that players liked.  The steering wheel turns very smoothly, just like a real car, this ensures excellent car ownership on a virtual road.  The shift lever is convenient, and most importantly, has become more natural.  The tachometer very clearly matches the indicators on the screen.  And the pedals, thanks to the great tuning options, allow you to conveniently sit behind the wheel and not feel clamped.  But the fact that the steering wheel has exceeded almost everything in its predecessor does not mean that the players will have nothing to complain about.  For example, they removed the sequential gearbox loved by everyone.  The steering wheel is incompatible with the Xbox 360, although it was expected that it will work on all possible consoles and PCs.

So, you can give the steering buttons various shapes and change their surface.  This will allow players not to be distracted from the virtual road and to the touch to understand whether they press the right button or not, place them further from the center of the steering wheel, it will be more convenient to press them.  There are also almost unlimited possibilities for improving the tachometer.  For example, the location in its place of a small monitor, on which all the basic parameters of the game will be displayed. </p><p>  Of course, many users of the old G25 will ask for a sequential gearbox switch.  It will also be useful to develop a hand brake, indispensable in rally games and drifting.  In collaboration with the main game developers, you can add many settings and programs with training information.  So each player will instantly understand <span>how to configure the</span> Logitech G27 <span>steering wheel</span> , will be able to easily understand its functions, compatibility with games and personalizes the device according to its needs and capabilities.  It will also save you from a long and tedious connection procedure. </p><p>  Of course, recently, many media have been talking about the fact that car simulators are fading into the background and are generally declining.  But Logitech does not pay any attention to this, continuing to develop new high-quality rudders, which does not cease to please the players and raise the bar of reliability and performance higher and higher. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

But, nevertheless, when it was created, rather big breakthroughs were made, which set new tasks for competitors.  This is another high-quality product and the reason for the pride of this wonderful company.  Of course, there are drawbacks, and the main one is that the steering wheel is incompatible with the Xbox 360, and there are a lot of interesting simulators on this console.  It remains to hope that the manufacturer in its future projects will correct all the shortcomings, again listen to the opinions of the players and create something unbelievable.  Now you know what Logitech’s G27 steering wheel is in practice.  The overall rating of this device is, of course, positive.
