The city is rich not only with beautiful beaches, but also with historical monuments that have survived to our times.  The city is located on a peninsula, north of Burgas.  It is believed that Nessebar is one of the most ancient cities in Europe.  His story began three millennia ago.  Archaeological excavations are ongoing here to this day.  Every year they make new discoveries of ancient peoples.  Nessebar is included in the list of UNESCO assets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in nessebar" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1512702.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The ancient district of the city can be considered surprisingly surviving.  Two centuries ago, he went under water as a result of an earthquake, and on land only a small part of it survived, on which all the temples are located.  And now the underwater part of the city can be seen from a boat in calm sunny weather. </p><p>  The pride of Nessebar is its unique beaches.  They are rightly considered the most beautiful in Bulgaria.  The local coast even holds the Blue Flag. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  When planning a vacation, you can think about how to get to the Vigo Hotel 4 *.  Of course, you can order a transfer, this service is provided by the complex.  But you can get to it yourself.  The nearest transport hubs are located in Burgas (railway station, airport), about thirty kilometers away.  From Burgas to Nessebar can be reached by bus.  The road will take no more than forty minutes.  In addition, there are buses going to Sunny Beach.  Using them, you will need to make a transfer to the vehicle to Nessebar.  You can still use a taxi, but it will cost more than public transport. </p><h2>  Weather in Nessebar </h2><p>  The climate of the resort can be described as temperate continental.  Weather in Nessebar allows you to swim and sunbathe on the beaches from May to October.  However, at other times you can also meet tourists who skillfully combine relaxation with an entertainment program.  The city is intertwined with the past and the present, luxury hotels are adjacent to the ancient ruins.  The high season lasts from July to August.  At this time, the city is crowded with vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Vigo Bulgaria" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1512707.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But in the low season (from October to April) Nessebar practically returns to normal life, there are very few tourists here.  You can swim in the sea from June until the end of September, when the water temperature still holds at around 21-22 degrees. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Resting in Nessebar, it is worth taking the time, breaking away from a beach holiday, for exploring local attractions and the most beautiful places.  The ancient part of the city is most interesting for tourists.  It is located on a small peninsula, which is connected to the land by a small isthmus.  Old Nessebar has a special atmosphere created by medieval churches, ramparts, old houses with wooden stairs. </p><p>  Churches are the main attractions of the city.  Each has its own unique history and architecture.  The Metropolitan Church of St. Stephen is the oldest of them.  Legend has it that it was built on the site of the temple of Apollo.  The frescoes, the bishop's department and the iconostasis are well preserved in the temple. </p><p>  For guests of the city, a windmill made of wood and a Turkish bath are no less interesting.  Ethnographic and archaeological museums function in Nessebar.  Their visitors can see ancient coins, antique figured ceramics, gold jewelry of the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vigo hotel 4 nessebar" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1512709.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to historical attractions, in Nessebar you can see natural beauties, such as natural sand dunes and White Rocks.  The city has numerous entertainment.  Tourists will certainly appreciate the water park and Luna Park, to which free buses run.  The city has a huge number of cafes where you can taste delicious seafood, which is prepared simply amazing. </p><h2>  Vigo Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the complex, I would like to discuss the reviews of guests who visited it in order to form a more reliable opinion.  I would like to note that the reviews of vacationers about the hotel are a bit contradictory: from enthusiasm to dissatisfaction with some moments.  Although the vast majority of tourists remain satisfied with the budget option for relaxing in a hotel.  According to holidaymakers, the complex has an excellent location, you probably can‚Äôt find the best.  The path to the beach takes no more than five minutes.  The hotel is located near a seaside park and offers panoramic views of the sea coast and park alleys.  Hotel Vigo (Bulgaria) is located between the old and new parts of the city, and therefore you can always walk to any place on foot.  Near the complex there are shops and a supermarket.  The hotel has several exits, one of them leads to the sea, and the second - to a shopping street.  As in many tourist complexes, some of the rooms are private apartments.  In Bulgaria, this practice is considered the norm. </p><p>  Hotel Vigo 4 * includes several buildings, the main building has four-star status, and the other two are three-star apartments.  There is no fundamental difference between them.  The hotel has a good number of rooms.  All apartments are well maintained and clean.  Maids clean their rooms daily, according to the schedule, towels are changed every other day, but bed linen is changed once every three to four days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vigo hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1512712.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  There are two beaches in front of the hotel complex, one is wild, and the second is equipped with paid sunbeds.  During the high season, there are many vacationers on the coast. </p><p>  The diet in the hotel is chosen by the tourists themselves.  You can only order breakfast at the hotel or prefer half board or All Inclusive.  However, not all vacationers are satisfied with the variety of food.  It is worth noting that the presence of mini-kitchens in the rooms makes it possible to independently prepare dishes.  In addition, there are a large number of cafes near the hotel, where you can eat cheaply at any time.  Probably, it is in Bulgaria that it makes no sense to buy tours with the All Inclusive system that everyone loves, if you want to try the best seafood dishes in local restaurants. </p><p>  In general, tourists rate the hotel food as good and of high quality.  Daily guests are served meat, fish, fruits, snacks, side dishes, salads.  Sometimes in the restaurant there are lines to avoid them, you can arrive early. </p><p>  The hotel provides free Wi-Fi in the lobby, but you have to pay for using the Internet in the rooms.  Near the hotel there is a bus stop, which makes it easy to get to the right place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel vigo hotel 4" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1512713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is suitable for those tourists who are considering options for a budget holiday on the sea coast.  The room rate at the hotel is quite reasonable.  Tour for two vacationers with accommodation in a double room costs from 387 euros.  According to tourists, the hotel fully complies with the ratio of "price-quality". </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Vigo 4 * is an economy-class hotel that is able to please guests with quality food, excellent location, reasonable prices and a beautiful beach. </p>
