    <h2>  What does a tax deduction consist of? </h2><p>  There are three components that make up the tax deduction for an apartment: </p><ol><li>  For new construction or the purchase of a finished construction project of the Russian Federation or a certain share, land. </li><li>  For the repayment of interest on loans that were taken from organizations operating in the Russian Federation or from private entrepreneurs. </li><li>  To reduce interest on loans taken at banks when the amount is spent on the construction or acquisition of a finished share in housing. </li></ol><h2>  Tax deduction </h2><p>  The maximum tax deduction for an apartment can be obtained by purchasing an apartment worth 2,000,000 rubles.  If the total purchase amount is greater, then the tax deduction is still calculated from 2,000,000 rubles.  The largest deduction can be applied both to one acquired property, and to their group. </p><p>  When a loan is taken to purchase your own home, the tax deduction for the apartment is calculated from the maximum amount of 3,000,000 rubles.  This amount is not spent on expenses related to the purchase of an apartment, but on the payment of a loan.  Restrictions on tax deduction apply to loans that were taken after January 1, 2014. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a person who is a taxpayer has not received all the payments in full, then he can receive the rest of the money at the onset of each next tax period. </p>

    <h2>  Tax deduction expenses </h2><p>  When new construction is carried out or property is purchased in a finished house, the following costs are determined: </p><ol><li>  Designing documents by which projects are carried out and estimates are calculated. </li><li>  The acquisition of various materials for the construction of buildings and additional structures. </li><li>  Acquisition of housing, given the cases when unfinished housing is purchased. </li><li>  Implementation of construction and decoration of structural elements. </li><li>  Organization of a full line of communications, including the supply of light, water and gas. </li></ol><h2>  Calculation of tax deduction when buying an apartment </h2><p>  The amount of tax deduction includes the following components: </p><ol><li>  The acquisition of housing. </li><li>  Buying rights to a specific property in a house that is not yet completed. </li><li>  Purchase of all necessary materials for construction. </li><li>  Finishing work, which are directly involved in the facility purchased exclusively for housing.  Also, this item includes the design of documentation, which determines the estimate for the entire list of additional work related to the completion and decoration of residential premises. </li></ol><p>  In order for the tax deduction to take into account the amount that is used to complete the construction and lining the premises, it is necessary to indicate in the contract for the purchase of housing that the house has not yet been completed.  Other expenses that are not included in the list are not relevant in the preparation of the tax deduction.  If it is necessary to carry out a redevelopment, to purchase furniture and sanitary equipment, to draw up all the necessary transactions, then citizens are obliged to implement all this for personal money.  When a pensioner purchases an apartment, the tax deduction is automatically calculated only in case of his active work and official employment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Tax deduction is not used in some situations. </h2><p>  Cases in which a tax deduction is not taken into account: </p><ol><li>  In the case when payment for construction or finished housing was made on behalf of employers or any other persons, of the part of the amount of maternity capital or finances that are in the budget. </li><li>  If the standard contract for the sale of an apartment is signed between relatives, that is, interdependent parties. </li></ol><h2>  Exact tax deduction </h2><p>  If the property was acquired into shared ownership exclusively before January 1, 2014, the amount of the tax deduction will be equally distributed between its owners.  After this time, this privilege is revoked.  The property deduction is distributed to each owner, depending on what specific part of the expenses he incurred in acquiring a particular property. </p><p>  When parents purchase housing with their children, they have the right to refuse to distribute the tax deduction into parts, and to take the entire amount, since it goes to one family.  Sometimes a home is purchased under an exchange agreement with payment.  In this case, the tax deduction is also distributed according to all parameters, since the conclusion of this agreement does not contradict the law, in particular, the requirements of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The property that both spouses buy after marriage is recognized as their common property, therefore, a tax deduction is given to them without branches.  In this case, the amount is divided by mutual agreement. </p>

    <h2>  How to get a tax deduction? </h2><p>  In order to receive a tax deduction, you must be a taxpayer and carry out the following actions: </p><ol><li>  There is a thorough filling out of the declaration, guided by a single form of 3-personal income tax. </li><li>  A reference is given from the accounting department, which must be taken at the place of work.  It indicates the amounts received and withheld.  It is developed in a single form of 2-personal income tax. </li></ol><p>  When the tax deduction for the apartment is calculated, the documents are prepared in the following list: </p><ol><li>  A certificate confirming the fact of registration of the right of ownership, which is necessary for the independent purchase of both a fully constructed residential building and a construction project that is being finalized. </li><li>  An agreement confirming the acquisition of an apartment or room, as well as the <span>act of transferring the</span> full apartment or a share in it.  A certificate of registration of ownership is also suitable.  The list of documents varies depending on the type of transaction. </li><li>  When a land plot is purchased on which a certain building will be built on its own, it is necessary to provide a certificate of registration of ownership, drawn up exclusively on the acquired land. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Copies of payment documents </h2><p>  When the tax deduction for an apartment is taken into account, the documents must be compiled and systematized without fail: </p><ol><li>  Confirmation that the taxpayer purchased property with personal money.  For this, certain papers must be presented.  These are various receipts that are paid on receipt orders, bank statements that confirm the transfer of funds from the taxpayer account to the seller‚Äôs account;  cash or sales checks;  acts confirming the facts of the purchase of certain goods from individuals, where the necessary information about the seller must be entered - those contained in the passport. </li><li>  Certificates confirming the repayment of a loan or interest accrued upon the conclusion of a loan agreement.  The mortgage apartment also belongs to this category.  The tax deduction is calculated according to a special plan.  If there are no cash receipts, in this case such documents may be special extracts, as well as certificates from the organization that was issuing the loan stating that all the necessary interest has been paid.  When an apartment is being purchased, tax deduction documents (more precisely, their availability) are provided in full. </li></ol>

It indicates the claim for the right to receive a tax deduction based on the listed facts. </li><li>  It is necessary to fully prepare copies of all documents, without which it is impossible to receive a tax deduction for an apartment. </li><li>  Take to the tax authority at the place of permanent registration a correctly and accurately filled out application with a pre-assembled and systematized package of necessary documentation.

This will happen if all the rules are followed, and the person has provided a full package of documents, because otherwise the process of generating and receiving a tax deduction can be complicated and delayed. </li></ol>
