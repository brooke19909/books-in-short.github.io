Meanwhile, here are wonderful conditions for a good rest.  The Bodrum Peninsula, lying in the east of the country and washed by the Aegean Sea, is an unspoken resort of the Turkish elite.  Here you can find both wonderful secluded coves, quiet, calm, surrounded by olive and orange groves, and enchantingly bright and cheerful entertainment centers.  The city of Bodrum is one of the central on the peninsula.  It is located in Gokova Bay, just opposite the <span>island of Kos (Greece).</span>  In the city there are hotels of all categories, from simple ones with one or two star guest houses to chic four and five-star complexes.  Let's take a look at one of the best. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The 4-star Grand Levent Hotel is located on the Bodrum Peninsula in the quiet and very picturesque village of Ortakent, which in Turkish can be translated as the "central city".  It is so indeed.  Ortakent is located approximately in the center of the peninsula, on the banks of the beautiful Bay of Bitez, in the <span>Aegean Sea.</span>  From the city of Bodrum it is westbound.  Between the conditional borders of Ortakent and Bodrum is about 8 km.  The Grand Levent Hotel 4 * is located at the end of the village, closer to the village of Yahsi.  Therefore, between the hotel and Bodrum about 12 km.  A few minutes walk from the hotel stretches the chic Yali embankment with dozens of cafes and restaurants and the best beach in Turkey.  The Ortakent district is famous for its evergreen groves, a wide network of shops and many attractions inherited from the peoples who inhabited it thousands of years ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Levent Hotel 4" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/955261.jpg" width="481"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The nearest international airport to the hotel Grand Levent Hotel 4 * is 49 km away.  It is called Milas-Bodrum.  From here, the hotel can be reached by booked transfer, taxi or comfortable, modern and affordable Hawash buses.  By the way, you can take a walk to many Turkish cities (Antalya, Izmir, Samsun and others).  The inconvenience of buses is that they follow only to the bus station in the village of Ortakent.  From there, you will have to take a taxi to the hotel.  In the summer, charter flights from Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan are made <span>at Bodrum Airport</span> .  If you couldn‚Äôt get a ticket for a plane arriving at this airport, there is a second airport 190 km from the hotel, where air buses from Russia also fly.  This is the airport in Dalaman.  You can get from there to the hotel by all the same Havash buses, or by taxi. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Grand Levent Hotel 4 * occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 0.5 hectares (5000 square meters).  It is not very much to arrange multiple sports grounds and tennis courts here, but enough to harmoniously place 8 hotel buildings, children's and adult pools, a bar, a children's playground, an amphitheater and a free car park.  Many buildings are built in the Greek style, which is dominated by slender snow-white columns.  The whole territory of the hotel is surrounded by greenery and blooming all year round, chic flower beds are arranged everywhere, there are shady alleys and spacious lawns, but everything is very compact.  All the buildings are nearby, you don‚Äôt have to go far from your building, for example, to a restaurant for breakfast or relax by the pool.  The territory is guarded.  There are no complaints of tourists about any incidents and misunderstandings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water temperature" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/955260.jpg" width="447"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is in a great location.  From his gate to the embankment literally two or three steps.  It has a great variety of restaurants and taverns, where every tourist can choose food (for lunch) to his taste and wallet.  The most popular restaurant is Cakir Motel, and one of the closest to the hotel and also quite good is Omerin Yeri Balik Restoran. </p><h2>  Leisure in the walls of the hotel </h2><p>  Grand Levent Hotel 4 stars has on its territory a wonderful and fairly spacious pool.  Sun loungers, deck chairs and umbrellas are always available here, and there is a place with a canopy, where it is convenient to relax even in the heat of the afternoon.  Near the pool for children.  Animation at the hotel is neither adult nor child.  The staff can play with the children on their own initiative (everyone here loves children very much and treats them well), while parents, for example, have dinner.  There is no discotheque or night club in the Grand Levent Hotel either.  All that vacationers can count on is quiet, pleasant and very unobtrusive music that sounds almost all day. </p>

    <p>  For sports enthusiasts, the hotel has a gym, but the simulators in it are not the latest models.  There are also billiard and tennis tables, backgammon, table football.  There is an excellent running track near the hotel along the promenade, so those who cannot live without sports will be satisfied.  Wi-Fi at the hotel is free throughout. </p><h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  The village of Ortakent, which houses the 4-star Grand Levent Hotel, has a reputation for being a quiet, cozy place where there are no nightly entertainment.  Daytime and evening entertainment here is represented by walks along the promenade, the sea, walks in the village, where many historical buildings have been preserved.  Everyone who wants more active entertainment needs to go to Bodrum.  Here, tourist life is in full swing.  Shops, restaurants, discos, night clubs, <span>hotels of Bodrum</span> (Turkey) are famous on the entire coast.  Reviews of tourists enthusiastically report on the wonderful, the only disco in Europe with a transparent floor "Catamaran".  The liner goes to sea and returns only in the morning.  There is also a disco in the city under the stars of Halicarnassus, which attracts people from all over the coast.  Shopping Bodrum vacationers at the Grand Levent Hotel will also be very pleased.  In the city's shopping centers (Midtown, Waikiki), prices are very low, and you can bargain everywhere.  Fans of antiquity will be interested in going on an excursion to the <span>Castle Fortress of St. Peter,</span> to the ruins of the Mausoleum, to Ephesus, Evromon and other historical cities of the peninsula. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Hotel Grand Levent is located 50 meters from the city beach, which rents about 100 meters of the property.  The Aegean coast (Turkey) is famous for its cleanliness and beauty, and the beach in Ortakent is even awarded the Blue Flag.  The hotel's beach is clean, sandy (which is especially good for parents with young children).  Sunset at sea is smooth, but stones can come under your feet.  The problem is easy to solve by buying special rubber shoes.  The water temperature may surprise you with its coolness even in the middle of summer, but this is a characteristic feature of the whole Aegean Sea.  But the water is unusually clean and very salty.  The density is such that, out of habit, it seems as if the sea pushes your body to the surface.  For guests of the hotel on the beach there is a bar.  Rest here is calm, without noisy water rides.  The only thing you may not like is the music that sounds from the bars on the waterfront. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Levent Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/227595.jpg" width="600"></div>
