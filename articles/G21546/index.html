    <p>  Life in the resort villages and coastal towns of Crete is seething due to the presence of many restaurants, shops, disco bars, taverns and many hotels of various levels.  One of the most popular tourist destinations is the Eva Bay Hotel. </p><h2>  About the resort </h2><p>  As a vacation destination, Crete stands out for its versatility from a number of other island resorts in Europe.  Those who wish can enjoy a measured, quiet holiday on the seashore or, conversely, have a break in full in numerous night clubs and entertainment venues.  Everyone will find entertainment in Crete to their liking: tiredness from overloads and hard work can be cured by passive relaxation, and the anguish caused by the monotonous routine of gray everyday life can be changed to unrestrained fun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crete refers to the Greek resorts in which the beach season is as long as possible.  Here it is extended until the very end of October.  It is during the velvet season that tourists who do not like intense heat like to come here. </p><p>  Those who worry that in October the sea in Crete is already becoming cool and you can‚Äôt swim, experts say: their concern is in vain.  Crete in October is just beginning to remind of autumn.  The sea has not yet had time to cool down, but warm days are already giving way to cloudy, and sometimes rainy.  Crete in October may well please with wonderful weather, which, however, by the end of the month will surely be replaced by windy and cloudy with short rains.  The cooling in Crete begins to be felt in the last days of the month, the authors of the reviews recommend lovers of the velvet season to take warm things with them on the road. </p><p>  One of the most important factors for a successful holiday, in addition to attractions, weather conditions and a wealth of infrastructure, is quality service and comfortable living.  According to reviews, Eva Bay Hotel 4 * is one of the options that provide everything you need for the convenience of guests. </p><h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  Hotel Eva Bay Hotel 4 * has pleasant rooms, friendly atmosphere, attentive staff.  Neat green area is not provided for walking with children.  The local animation is characterized as inactive (live music sounds once a week).  The Eva Bay Hotel is located on a rather busy street with many bars and shops.  Reviews recommend it for couples and youth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eva bay crete" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/1536250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Vacationers report that in rooms in which windows face the main street of the village, it is noisy in the evenings.  Those who basically want to relax in silence are advised to pay extra when buying a tour for accommodation in rooms with direct or side sea views. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  The food at the Eva Bay Hotel is characterized as very diverse.  In the assortment - various types of meat and fish, periodically prepare squid, mussels and even octopus dishes.  The all inclusive system works, which covers a variety of cocktails, banis, whiskey, etc. </p><p>  Some guests complain that smoking areas are not allocated in bars and in a part of the open-air restaurant, and everyone present has to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the smoke. </p><p>  An ordered early breakfast, if sent on an excursion in the morning, is, according to reviews, somewhat scarce (no hot, only sliced), but overall it is enough, tourists share.  A packed breakfast includes: peach, pear or apple, a bottle of mineral water, juice (orange) and a packet of nuts - this is enough for a snack on the go. </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  Guests are pleased with the location of the hotel: near the city of Rethymnon, it is easy to get here by bus.  Nearby are many shops in which, according to reviews, guests can buy anything they want. </p><p>  Vacationers often resort to car rental and go for walks in the vicinity, where in the vicinity there is something to see.  According to hotel guests, Eva Bay is the most convenient starting point for independent trips around the island. </p><h2>  About excursions </h2><p>  Those who prefer not to use the services of a hotel guide (although many see a good specialist in it), move around the island on their own with a rented car (you can take it in a rental office, which provides full insurance and discounts for loyalty).  It is recommended to visit Heraklion, Eleftern, Kedrodasos, Patsos Gorge, Devil's Bay, <span>Samaria Gorge,</span> the beaches of the Libyan Sea, to follow the White Mountains trekking route. </p><h2>  About the beach and the sea </h2><p>  The beach and the sea are characterized by vacationers as excellent.  The entrance to the sea is not very convenient, but suitable for adults, subject to slippers. </p><p>  There is a problem on the beach that is typical of many hotels: although it is specifically stipulated in the living conditions that sun loungers cannot be occupied, leaving personal items and towels on them, vacationers constantly violate this rule.  In the mornings, by 9 o‚Äôclock on the sun loungers you can see the towels laid out by the guests, remaining there until the evening.  But sunbathers are present only on a third of the available sunbeds.  Those who are going to go somewhere on an excursion in the morning and return to dinner risk losing their chance to sit comfortably on the beach. </p>

    <h2>  About services and entertainment </h2><p>  Wi-fi at the hotel is expensive, review authors say.  But on the loungers on the far right (if you look towards the sea), it "catches" free from a neighboring hotel. </p><p>  Animation, for many, according to reviews, is more than optional, the hotel is inactive: on Wednesdays in the meadow glide evenings of Greek music, and on Saturdays there is a disco. </p><h2>  About staff and contingent </h2><p>  The staff, according to reviews, is attentive and polite, some employees speak Russian fairly well. </p><p>  The contingent of residents - about 40% are Russians.  In addition, Czechs, Poles, Dutch, Germans, French, and Balts live.  There are not many children, the hotel is clearly not focused on them. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to reviews, the hotel fully meets the expectations of those who want peace and comfort.  Many guests satisfied with the local service (staff, comfortable rooms, food) plan to return here. </p><p>  But those who are going on vacation with children are recommended to find another option. </p>
