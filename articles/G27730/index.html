According to Rosstat, on March 30, 2014 the number of permanent residents of the Russian Federation amounted to 146 019 512 people.  At the same time, sixty-five percent of people live in the European part of the country, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãless than eighteen percent of the total territory, of which the population of Central Russia is about thirty percent.

    <h2>  Headcount </h2><p>  In the Russian Empire, the first census was conducted in 1897, it demonstrated that the population (within modern borders) was 67 million 473 thousand people.  Now in the Russian Federation they regularly monitor the dynamics of the population.  Statistics of the population of Russia is carried out through the current accounting of natural movement carried out by Rosstat and its territorial bodies, as well as registry offices;  current accounting of migration movement carried out upon arrival by passport offices.  But, of course, censuses are the most important type of accounting for numbers.  The last <span>census of</span> Russia was carried out in 2010.  Current accounting is also carried out, which allows at any time to assess the demographic situation in the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  National composition </h2><p>  The Constitution says that the Russian Federation is a multinational state.  Representatives of more than one hundred and eighty peoples live on its territory.  The Russian population of Russia is (according to the 2010 census) 77.71 percent of the total population (111 million out of 142.9 million people).  People of other nationalities, as well as persons who did not indicate their nationality, make up (according to the 2010 census) a little more than 22.2 percent of the population (31.8 million).  For comparison, we cite the data of the previous census conducted in 2002.  Then, the statistics of the population of Russia by ethnic composition differed slightly.  Of the total number of residents of 145.2 million people, Russian citizens amounted to 115.9 million (79.83 percent), people of other nationalities and persons who did not indicate their nationality - 29.3 million (20.2 percent).  The Russian population throughout the territory is distributed very unevenly.  For example, in such regions of the country as Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia, the number of Russians is less than five percent of the total number of inhabitants. </p>

    <h2>  Languages </h2><p>  More than a hundred languages ‚Äã‚Äãand dialects belonging to the Altai, Ural, Indo-European <span>language families,</span> Paleo-Asian and Caucasian language groups, says the population of the country.  At the same time, Russia has only one state language - Russian (Article 68 of the Constitution).  It is native to approximately one hundred and thirty million people, which is about 92% of the population.  The most common spoken languages, in addition to Russian, are Ukrainian, Belarusian, Ossetian, Armenian, German (belong to the Indo-European family), Chuvash, Bashkir, Tatar (belong to the Altai family), Mari, Erzya, Udmurt (belong to the Ural family), Avar , Chechen, Dargin (belong to the <span>Nakh-Dagestan languages),</span> Kabardino-Circassian (refers to the Abkhaz-Adyghe family). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Republic of the Russian Federation has the right to establish its official languages.  For example, in Karachay-Cherkessia, in addition to Russian, Karachai, Abazin, Circassian, and Nogai languages ‚Äã‚Äãalso have the status of state.  UNESCO in 2009 recognized one hundred and thirty-six languages ‚Äã‚Äãused in Russia at the stage of extinction. </p><h2>  Religion </h2><p>  The Russian Federation is a secular state.  The constitution guarantees residents freedom of religion: it gives the right to profess any religion or not to profess at all, as well as freely choose and disseminate their beliefs.  The religious composition of the population of Russia is as diverse as the national.  Christians and Muslims, Jews and Buddhists live in the country.  There are pagans and convinced atheists.  Most citizens consider themselves Orthodox.  In general, official statistics in the field of religions are not kept.  The issue of religion was raised for the last time in the 1937 census.  According to VTsIOM polls, a little more than half of the residents of the Russian Federation consider themselves to be believers, of which only ten percent systematically go to church and observe all rituals and rites.  And the remaining forty-three percent attend church only on holidays and rituals; they do not observe rituals.  A third of the respondents (thirty-one percent) admit that God exists, but have little interest in church life.  Approximately six percent of the respondents are convinced atheists, and eight percent do not think at all about their attitude to religion. </p>

    <h2>  Russia: territory, population </h2><p>  The main resettlement strip is the triangle, the northern peak of which is St. Petersburg, the southern peak of Sochi, and the eastern peak of Irkutsk.  Deserts and semi-deserts are located southeast of this triangle, and <span>permafrost</span> and taiga zones are to the north.  Speaking about how many people live in Russia, we have already noted that the bulk of the population is concentrated in the central part of the country.  In Siberia, which covers almost three fourths of the entire territory, less than twenty percent of people live.  The urban population of Russia is concentrated mainly in the middle lane of the European part (From Moscow to Ufa) and in the south (from Sochi to Derbent). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the Far East and Siberia, the bulk of the inhabitants settled along the Trans-Siberian Railway.  In this part, the population of Russian cities is represented by residents of Novosibirsk, Omsk, <span>Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk,</span> Vladivostok, Khabarovsk.  Also, many people live in the Kuzbass region.  As of 2012, there are fifteen million-plus cities in the Russian Federation (with a population of more than a million).  These are Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Samara, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Chelyabinsk, Rostov-on-Don, Kazan, Omsk, Perm, Ufa, Krasnoyarsk, Volgograd, Voronezh.  The largest settlements, the so-called sub-millionaires, in which the number of inhabitants has not yet reached a million, include Krasnodar, Saratov and Tolyatti.  The population of the cities of Russia, which were listed above, makes up almost a quarter of the total number (twenty-two percent).  In one hundred and sixty-five settlements of the country (according to 2012), more than one hundred thousand people live. </p><h2>  Russian population by years </h2><p>  It's no secret that in the last decade in the Russian Federation there has been a demographic crisis.  Only in 2013 did the situation improve somewhat, and a natural population growth was noted throughout the country.  About how many people live in Russia now, we have already said.  Now let's see how the situation has changed over the past years. </p>

    <h2>  2006 year </h2><p>  According to the Federal State Statistics Service, in 2006, 1 million 496.6 thousand people were born in Russia (22.2 thousand more than the previous year), 2 million 166.7 thousand people died (137.2 thousand less than in previous year).  Thus, the birth rate was 10.4, and the mortality rate was 15.2.  The population decline is 687.1 thousand people, which is 159.5 thousand less than in 2005.  Taking <span>into account migration</span> growth, the total decrease amounted to 532.6 thousand people.  Over the period under review, the indicator of life expectancy significantly increased.  So, if in 2005 it was 65.3 years, then in 2006 it rose to 66.8 years.  For men, for the first time since 1998, life expectancy exceeded the retirement age and amounted to 60.37 years (compared with 2005 plus 1.5 years), and for women - 73.23 years (plus 0.83 years). </p><h2>  2007 year </h2><p>  The composition of the Russian population in this period has changed slightly, because migration growth has increased significantly - by 67.1 percent (103.7 thousand people) compared to the previous year.  Due to this, the deterioration of the demographic situation slowed down.  During the year, 1 million 610.1 thousand people were born, and 2 million 080.4 thousand died.  The birth rate was 11.3, the mortality rate was 14.6.  Thus, compared with 2006, 130.5 thousand (8.8 percent) more were born, and 86.3 thousand (4 percent) less died.  In October 2007, a record number of babies was born over the past fifteen years - 154.3 thousand.  In general, in all republics of the country in 2007 there was an increase in the number of births, a natural increase was observed in twenty-one regions.  Even in the Magadan region, the number of newborns compared to last year increased from 1820 to 1825. The natural decrease is 470.3 thousand people, of which 212.1 thousand are the permanent population. </p><h2>  2008 year </h2><p>  The demographic situation continued to improve.  1 million 713.9 thousand people were born, 2 million 075.9 thousand died.  The birth rate was 12, the mortality rate was 14.5.  The natural decline is 362 thousand people, of which the decline in the resident population is 104.9 thousand.  Migration growth decreased slightly, but only slightly: from 258.2 thousand to 257.1 thousand. Nevertheless, it compensated for the loss of the population by seventy-one percent. </p>

    <h2>  year 2009 </h2><p>  Demographic indicators, again, improved.  1 million 761.7 thousand people were born, 2 million 10.5 thousand died.  The birth rate was 12.3, and the mortality rate was 14.1.  Natural decline - 249.4 thousand people.  Due to migration growth, which fully compensated for the natural decline, for the first time in fifteen years, compared with the previous year, the population of the country increased and amounted to 141,927,297 people in 2009, which is twenty three thousand more than in 2008 of the year.  In sixty-seven regions there was an increase in the number of births, in seventy-five regions there was a decrease in the number of deaths. </p><h2>  2010 year </h2><p>  During this period, 1 million 178.9 thousand people were born, 2 million 28.5 thousand died.  The birth rate was 12.5, the mortality rate was 14.2.  A slight increase in the mortality rate compared to 2009 can be explained by the abnormal heat that hit Russia in July-August 2010.  The natural decline, amounting to 239.6 thousand people, was fully compensated by migration growth.  As we already reported, in 2010 another census was conducted.  According to her, the number of inhabitants of Russia amounted to 142 905 200 people. </p><h2>  2011 </h2><p>  In January-April of the reporting period, a 14.1 percent decrease in the birth rate was noted compared with the same period of the previous year.  Mortality also decreased - by 20.6 percent.  Natural decline was significantly reduced and amounted to 129.1 thousand people per year.  Migration growth - 320.1 thousand </p>

    <h2>  year 2012 </h2><p>  1 million 902.1 thousand people were born, which is 5.9 percent (105.5 thousand) more than in 2011.  1 million 906.3 thousand people died, which is 1 percent (19.4 thousand) less than in 2011.  The natural decline amounted to only 4251 people - with the previous year this is a noticeable difference.  <span>Migration growth</span> decreased slightly - 294.9 thousand.  In forty regions of the country there was a natural increase (in 2011, only in twenty-eight subjects). </p><h2>  year 2013 </h2><p>  For the first time in many years, more people were born than died.  Although, in comparison with 2012, fewer babies were born - only 1 million 895.8 thousand. But a significantly smaller number of people died - 1 million 871.8 thousand.  Thus, the natural increase was 24 013 people, it was already observed in forty-three regions of Russia.  Migration growth remained almost at the same level - 295.8 thousand. </p><h2>  year 2014 </h2><p>  The latest statistics are available as of January-February 2014.  In two months, 301.5 thousand people were born in Russia, which is 391 fewer than in the same period of 2013.  317.9 thousand died, which is 11,376 people less than in January-February 2013.  As a result, the natural decrease amounted to 16,427 people, which is significantly less than the indicator of the same previous period - 27,412 people.  In thirty-four regions of the country, natural growth was noted. </p><h2>  Life span </h2><p>  Of course, it is important to know how many people live in Russia.  But no less significant question: "How many people live in Russia?"  A 2013 WHO annual report reported that among the entire population of Central Asia and Europe, Russian men have the shortest life expectancy.  They survive on average only to 62.8 years, which is very unfortunate.  For comparison: the largest life expectancy of the male population is observed in Israel - 80.1 years.  In Spain, this figure is 78.8 years, and in the UK - 78.4 years. </p>

    <h2>  Demographic trends </h2><p>  It should be noted that the age structure of the population of the Russian Federation has significantly deteriorated in recent years, the number of Russians who are of working age is declining, while the number of pensioners is growing rapidly.  Researchers predict that in the coming decades Russia may face a crisis of pension reform, as working citizens will not be able to support the rapidly increasing number of pensioners. </p><p>  Also, employees of the Institute for Demographic Research expect that the number of the Russian population will decrease, since the birth rate in families is relatively low, people prefer to have no more than one child, a maximum of two, which, of course, affects demographic trends.  At the same time, say, in Caucasian families, the birth rate is an order of magnitude higher, therefore, the number of these peoples in the total number of inhabitants of the country will gradually increase.  This situation cannot but alarm. </p><p>  The only way out is seen in improving people's living standards, public health, and providing citizens with the opportunity to adequately support and educate children.  A powerful policy should also be pursued aimed at strengthening the institution of the family in all spheres of activity and in all areas.  It is worth saying that the decline in the birth rate is a problem not only of Russia, but also of a global scale. </p>
