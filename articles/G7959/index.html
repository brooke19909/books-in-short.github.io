In ancient times, it was called differently - Fiskos.  It was here that Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent moved when he was preparing for his campaign in Greek Rhodes.  For some time the city was called by his name.  Many sights are associated with this era in the history of Marmaris.  Among the architectural monuments that have been preserved at the moment, it should be noted the Castle built in 1521, or Kervansaray.

    <p>  In general, both in Marmaris itself and in its environs there are many amazing objects with a wonderful history.  Most of them do not even know those who have come here several times to rest.  The narrow cobbled streets of this city, the fortress built in the sixteenth century, the tomb of the famous Sarian, etc. - all this attracts those who are already tired of the beaches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Marmaris today </h2><p>  Currently, this Turkish resort, affectionately washed by the Aegean and Mediterranean seas, the mountain slopes of which are covered with coniferous forests, is very popular among Russian tourists.  People who choose an active and fun vacation to spend unforgettable time in Marmaris, a city where nightlife is in full swing, often come here.  In addition, it is very convenient from here to make unique boat trips not only along the coast of Turkey, but also to Rhodes or the Turtle Islands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris hotels 4" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/565009.jpg" width="321"></div>

    <p>  Marmaris, whose coastal map shows that its sandy and pebble beaches stretch across the winding coast with bays and bays, is also the place where <span>sailing</span> competitions are held annually in the eastern Mediterranean. </p><h2>  Marmaris Hotels </h2><p>  This prestigious resort is chosen not only by lovers of club life, but also by many celebrities.  There are many places where tourists can stay.  The choice is quite large: from the economy class to the upscale luxury hotels that Marmaris is famous for.  <span>5, 4</span> or 3 star <span>hotels</span> are characterized by a wide variety of services and a wide range of prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris hotels 3 stars" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/565305.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For many, Turkey is mistakenly associated only with cheap service.  However, turning to a travel agency, they realize that such information is not true.  In a city like Marmaris (the map is proof of this), there are a lot of different hotels.  There are also many places where you can go on an excursion, and the rest itself can be both budgetary and very expensive.  The choice of hotel depends primarily on the contents of the wallet.  And, of course, from the preferred type of rest. </p><h2>  Prices for accommodation </h2><p>  Many prefer a middle ground.  Therefore, when buying a tour to Marmaris, 4 star hotels are the best option.  Moreover, you can book hotels on the coast and in the city center.  Those who are more interested in excursions can safely choose Marmaris hotels 4 stars or 3 away from the sea.  In this case, traveling around the resort and its environs can be decently saved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MARMARIS HOTELS 5" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/566090.jpg" width="582"></div>

    <p>  Those who are attracted by the beach and the gentle sun, it is better to turn their attention to the hotels of Marmaris - 4 stars, 5, and even 3, located on the first line of the coast.  At the same time, they can easily combine spa and sightseeing vacations. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  It would seem that choosing a hotel is not difficult.  However, the success of the vacation depends on how well to do this.  Indeed, without good service, friendly staff, delicious food and a soft bed, without which tourists do not feel comfortable, the rest will not be complete.  However, this does not mean at all that, staying in a three-star hotel, a person will be deprived of all this.  After all, the same economy class hotels must also comply with the standards and fully serve guests. </p><p>  The best five-star Marmaris hotels are Club Munamar, Ideal Prime Beach and Marti Resort.  The rating is based on the feedback of those people who have already visited them.  Prices for them in the highest season range from eighty thousand rubles for two for a stay of seven days with meals on the concept of "all inclusive". </p><p>  Of the four-star hotels, tourists most often choose Art Mari, Caprice Beach and Halici Semera Hotel HV-2.  All of them are located on the shore and provide a fairly wide list of entertainment.  Prices for holidays in hotels of this category are somewhat lower.  With a preliminary reservation, it is possible to purchase trips for two starting from forty thousand rubles (with a full food package). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris map" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/565016.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most of all tourists come to three-star hotels.  There are a lot of them, and they are located mainly on the shore.  Emre Beach, Begonville, Adler, Diana Club - this is not a complete list of places where those who prefer a budget vacation can stay.  Room rates per person per day can cost from five hundred rubles.  However, such prices for tours are not so common, so vouchers must be booked in advance.  Therefore, in calculating your vacation, it is better to proceed from the cost of a thousand rubles.  Moreover, the most comfortable and cozy "luxury" class rooms in hotels of this category will, of course, cost a little more. </p><p>  All three-star Marmaris hotels have both advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore, the search must be approached competently and well in advance, only in this case it will be possible to find the most optimal and suitable option.  Among these hotels, the Intermar Hotel 3 * (Dalaman, Marmaris) is quite popular. </p><h2>  general information </h2>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since Intermar Hotel 3 * is a small three-star hotel, it does not have its own beach.  Vacationers can use the urban swimming area, which is one hundred and fifty meters from the hotel.  The path to the beach passes through the motorway.  For safety, pedestrians are encouraged to cross over to the sea through an underpass.  On the beach, tourists can get sun loungers, mattresses, equipment for entertainment and sports on the water.  For all services you need to pay extra. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  As for the animation.  Intermar Hotel 3 * does not provide a special entertainment program.  But tourists can have a good time swimming in the pool with slides or taking sun baths on the terrace, equipped with sun loungers and parasols.  You can play ping pong and billiards at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Intermar Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/565014.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The main range of entertainment for tourists is concentrated outside.  At the reception, for example, you can order sightseeing tours.  Or explore the city and its surroundings on your own by renting a car.  Since the hotel is located a short distance from the center of Marmaris, all entertainment infrastructure is within walking distance from it.  If desired, you can visit clubs, local shops and restaurants, bars, etc. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In order for tourists to have a more complete impression, they need to read the comments of compatriots who have already stayed at Intermar Hotel 3 *.  The reviews, I must say, are very different: there are also positive ones, when people had a clear idea where they were going, and therefore they did not have illusions about the high level of service.  But there are also negative ones.  Many, for example, do not like the meager menu.  Such comments are most often left by those who know Turkey only in five-star hotels, while experienced tourists are already aware that expecting a luxurious buffet from an economy class hotel is pointless.  There are no complaints about the rooms and the service. </p>
