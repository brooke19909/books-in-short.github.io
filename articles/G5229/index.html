    <p>  In summer, you can also relax in Bali, as this season is sunny and the humidity level is minimal.  However, you will not feel the heat, as fresh air here will provide a light breeze from the coast.  The water temperature reaches more than 25-27 degrees Celsius, so you can enjoy plenty of fun in the ocean or go diving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the autumn season, the climax of the beach season begins, but already in the last September decade you will feel how the north wind blows.  October and November are times of heavy rains and high levels of humidity in the air.  During this period, the island becomes stuffy, therefore, due to the heat, the tourist flow is significantly reduced. </p><p>  In winter, in December, a period of local summer begins in Bali.  You will be able to observe the growth of tropical plants.  However, sometimes it may rain, and not quite short.  But you should not worry about the weather in Bali for the New Year.  At this time, tourists still come to the island.  In a secluded atmosphere you can meet the holidays in Bali.  <span>New Year</span> (weather, reviews of which are presented in this article) will leave you an unforgettable experience.  In winter, the island has fairly warm water, so you can swim in the ocean. </p>

    <p>  In Sanur, the oldest Balinese resort, most tourists relax each year.  Here is one of the largest water sports centers in Indonesia.  Here you can engage in diving, study and receive the relevant documents at the end of the course.  Travelers are invited to relax on a wonderful beach, as well as in a huge entertainment center.  In addition, you can go to the small island of Serangana, on which many large sea turtles live.  In the resort of Ubud, located offshore, there is the opportunity to study the local culture and natural conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bali for New Year 2017 </h2><p>  A large number of tourists want to not just spend their holidays on the island, but to celebrate holidays here, in particular, to celebrate the New Year.  However, it must be borne in mind that the people of Bali do not do this the way we are used to.  The celebration of the New Year is not considered a significant event, but because it is rather held for tourists and is not really important for locals.  However, regardless of such circumstances, vacationers can have fun, as in all hotels and restaurants for the holidays, celebrations, various kinds of entertainment, dance events with fireworks, and other show programs are being prepared.  Otherwise, the Balinese celebrate their traditional New Year, which falls on the end of March and the beginning of April. </p><h2>  What should be considered before the trip? </h2><p>  If you want to buy tickets to Bali for the New Year, you should know what local standards of conduct follow.  If you need to go to an Indonesian temple, wear closed clothing.  You can enter it freely, but traditionally visitors leave an amount for donations of about 1,000 rupees (about 940 rubles).  In addition, Indonesia should not kiss, hug, or drink alcohol among people.  Women should also take the time to wear open clothes. </p><h2>  The cost of travel </h2><p>  Tours to Bali for the New Year 2017 will cost you a tidy sum.  Typically, accommodation in most decent hotels between December 28 and January 10, as well as airfare, cost anywhere from $ 1,500 to $ 5,000. </p><h2>  Island Tours </h2><p>  As you can already understand from what has been said above, you can celebrate the New Year holidays not only here - with frosts, in snowy cities.  If your soul craves travel, go to exotic lands.  Tours to Bali for the New Year 2017 offer a combination of clean beaches with clear water, sunny weather and tropical terrain, which you will remember for a long time with its colorful atmosphere.  Go to the island - and you can spend holidays enjoying nature and historical sights. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the New Year festivities </h2><p>  Having decided to go on holiday to Bali for the New Year, you should first learn about what features Indonesia has.  The inhabitants of the island have local customs regarding how to celebrate this holiday.  However, they have it at the end of March and is called "Niepie."  This is due to the Hindu population, which celebrates it in its own way, not at all in the way we are accustomed to imagine.  That is why European travelers still prefer to traditionally celebrate New Year in <span>Bali.</span>  <span>Reviews of tourists</span> say that on ordinary days in restaurants and hotels there are impressive entertainment programs, so joy and fun during the holiday season is provided.  Many travelers like the island so much that they return to Bali.  They book tours for the New Year exactly at the time when it is celebrated locally in order to feel the full flavor and see what traditions and customs the inhabitants of this country have.  It should be noted that, in fact, you need to look at it, since the situation here is completely different.  New Year's Day in Bali is celebrated for 5 days, and the festivities begin with ceremonies symbolizing purification.  Then the locals are engaged in the expulsion of evil forces from their home, however, after that they treat them in every way so that they cannot harm them.  The most important triumph is considered to be Nyepi, which falls on the third day of the holidays.  After him, the locals celebrate the day of forgiveness.  Such customs are somewhat similar to Christian ones.  This refers to Forgiveness Sunday, but these traditions are in fact unrelated to anything.  Nyepi is celebrated on the new moon, and in 2017 this holiday will be held on the 28th, in March. </p>

    <h2>  Local tradition celebrations </h2><p>  Those who want to come to the island should know that, despite the Balinese's friendliness and hospitality, the locals will not be able to understand the essence of European festivities.  Although they often celebrate the celebration with tourists who came to rest.  Bali (New Year 2017) will become truly unforgettable for you if the festival does not overshadow anything.  Locals do not drink alcohol and raw water because of their religious beliefs.  Although, despite the existing traditions, the inhabitants of Bali help the Europeans in organizing the holiday.  For those who love exotic pastime, the New Year on the island will bring not only enjoyment of the warm climate, but also other cultural surroundings.  You can study local traditions, make comparisons and understand that celebration can be celebrated in a different way. </p><h2>  Purification Ceremony Custom - Melasti </h2><p>  Residents of Bali celebrate the New Year, as you already understood, in a completely different way.  The Melasti ceremony traditionally begins three days before the main holiday, and this year its date fell on March 25.  Custom includes ‚Äúwashing‚Äù misfortunes and negative energy from the body.  Early in the morning, the local people put on holiday dresses and carry statues of the gods to the coast, where they pray.  It is also customary to wash temple sculptures with water, which is pre-consecrated.  They believe that if a person spends the last days of the year it is useful, then the next year should become happy.  During the ceremony you can observe and see the traditional rites without obstacles. </p><h2>  Carnival processions </h2><p>  A day before the start of Nieppi (in 2017 it will be on March 27), a carnival procession takes place, in which people in costumes of big stuffed ‚Äúhoo-hoo‚Äù take part.  It is a symbol of evil spirits that must be banished.  Local people prepare all day, and the carnival begins at 6 p.m., and it ends after midnight.  Costume processions are held in all villages on the island of Bali.  That is, wherever you live, in which part of it you didn‚Äôt rest, you simply cannot miss the celebration.  Just go outside and enjoy the colorful spectacle. </p>

    <h2>  Niepie Festival </h2><p>  This celebration is necessarily held in Bali.  Celebrating the New Year without the traditional Day of Silence is impossible.  This year it fell on March 28th.  After the festivities there comes a time of "silence", when the local population fasts and meditates, and is with their families.  It is believed that on this day you need to think a lot and clear your thoughts.  Nieppi is taken with great seriousness by the Balinese, and they also observe a large number of traditions that are unthinkable to us.  For example, at this time you can‚Äôt leave the house, make noise, go to work or to entertainment events.  They do not recommend talking at high volume, sitting with the light, or listening to music.  Television and radio stations, airports (everything except medical facilities) ceases to work.  It's hard to meet someone on the street, in addition to squads of squads who check that no one is in the cities and villages.  Of course, the Internet connection, mobile communications and access to electricity are functioning smoothly.  However, in general, Bali is empty for a whole day, and the local population is sitting at home. </p><p>  Why are the inhabitants of the island celebrating the New Year holidays in this way?  The reason is that at the parade and carnival, evil forces that emerged from the ocean waters on the coast were awakened.  They should not see anyone on the street in Bali.  Then they will think that there is no one there at all, and they will have to go where they came, leaving its territory.  Such customs are appreciated by the Balinese to this day. </p><h2>  We plan a vacation during the Nyepi period on the island </h2><p>  Dates of festivities change annually.  You should be aware that airports these days do not operate on the island.  Airlines book tickets at this time, if purchased in advance.  However, during the determination of the exact dates of the celebrations, flights are postponed one day after or until the date for which you had previously calculated.  To avoid this situation, buy tickets for other days.  As you can already understand from the above information, shopping centers, catering establishments on Nyepi's day do not work.  That is why it is better to buy products in a few days, since you will need to cook your own food (of course, if you do not live in an all-inclusive hotel).  You may also face the fact that you can‚Äôt withdraw money a day before the start of Nyepi due to idle ATMs.  Members of the hotel staff will be at the workplace, so on the Day of Silence you still have the opportunity to relax in the spa or pools.  The main thing is that you do not leave your hotel.  Local residents are also asked to honor these traditions by those who come to them from other countries.  It‚Äôs better not to turn on the bright light or simply curtain the window, and also not speak loudly and not listen to loud music.  If you do not want to abide by these customs, you can leave the island on the day of Nyepi.  So additional tours are organized.  These are trips, for example, one of the neighboring islands, where residents do not adhere to such traditions.  In the hotel you can choose one of the excursion programs designed for one day.  Among them are trips to the island of Lombok or the <span>island of Gili.</span>  Keep in mind that many tourists gather there at this time.  If you need to get to these islands, you should book a place in a few weeks. </p>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  If you want to go to Bali for the New Year period, or at any other time, you should arrange insurance, the cost of which will be approximately fifteen dollars.  She will act while you travel.  The insurance policy can be ordinary, not sports, because it is issued, mainly, quickly enough.  Citizens of the European Union, as well as Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians receive a free stamp for a month at the airport.  You will need a printout of the return ticket.  Also, your passport must be valid for at least six months by the time your trip begins.  Alcoholic beverages are best bought in duty free, as Indonesian alcohol is quite expensive (you can bring in one liter per person). </p><h2>        ? </h2><p>  !  ,       , ,  ,  ,    .   ,  - ‚Äì  ¬´¬ª .           ,  <span> </span>    . </p>
