These are fittings and accessories, thanks to which the user can conveniently and safely connect electrical appliances to the power source.  The most common wiring accessories are quite familiar sockets with switches, cartridges, plugs, etc. But there are also more complex devices that bear responsibility not for a specific device, but for the overall infrastructure - for example, within a house or apartment.  In any case, even an insignificant electrical accessory if improperly installed or used can lead to disastrous consequences. </p><h2>  Installation of distribution board </h2>

    <p>  To enter and <span>distribute electricity</span> in the house, a so-called shield is needed.  Outwardly, it is a small metal cabinet, to which an electric wiring is connected, and inside there are electrical devices.  Installation is carried out after the main electrical connection has been made.  An empty shield is fixed with construction hardware - usually by the wall method.  Next, connect.  Terminations of lead-in wires are marked depending on the group of electrical devices that they will service.  Then the wires are led from the bottom into a pre-prepared shield and distributed.  Input can also be carried out from the top.  In this case, special DIN rails are mounted.  After this, grounding and grounding wiring products are installed, as well as a junction box for the phase cable.  Zero circuits are output to the N-bus, and ground wires to the PE-bus.  In modern boards, a modular installation configuration is used, according to which the layout is implemented by means of clamps - this method is convenient because it relieves the painter from painstaking manipulations with the connections. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Home wiring preparation </h2>

    <p>  After installing <span>the switchboard</span> , the direct branching of the current supply channels through the apartment or house is performed.  The main bearing element will be the metal hose.  This is a kind of sheath of a current-carrying wire.  It is made of galvanized metal film or tape, which protects the line from physical damage.  This circuit is laid inside hollow ceilings and walls.  It can be said that this is the main line for supplying electricity within the framework of one house or apartment.  Wires with a small cross-section depart from it, from which sockets with switches and other local consumers will be powered.  An important element of this infrastructure is a <span>junction box</span> for wiring products, which acts as a kind of network distributor.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that, in comparison with typical branches in the same metal hose, it makes it possible to temporarily connect individual branches.  In essence, this is the same principle of shield clamps - no need to make durable connections such as twists and adhesions.  It is enough to insert the cable through the appropriate plug or adapter and a specific section will receive power supply. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rules for placing sockets and switches </h2>

    <p>  In residential premises, outlets should be located at a distance of up to 50 cm from the corners, and up to 30 cm relative to the floor.  As for the switches, they are installed 1 m from the doorways.  In height, they are integrated at 80 cm from the floor covering.  However, for convenience, installation at a level of 50-60 cm has been practiced recently. According to special rules, wiring accessories are placed in the bathroom, in the kitchen, as well as in rooms with a high level of humidity.  First of all, sockets should be installed at least 110 cm from the floor.  In the kitchen, you must observe the distance from the gas pipeline - at least 50 cm are maintained. </p><h2>  Connecting sockets with switches </h2><p>  Connection is carried out in three stages.  At the first stage, the electricity at the entrance is turned off to ensure the safety of work.  Next, the old switch, if any, is dismantled.  The fixing screws are loosened, after which the device can be removed.  Then a new product is installed.  This process begins by loosening the screws holding the plate with the wire.  The end of the <span>wires is exposed,</span> after which it is inserted into the terminal of the device and tightened with a screw.  It is important to remember that the installation of wiring products must be carried out with utmost care in handling the cores.  For example, when fixing, do not tighten them with excessive force.  If there is a desire to provide higher reliability of the connection, then it is possible to make an annular coupling by bending the core accordingly.  At the final stage, the housing is installed in the socket.  The operation is performed with complete screws - the main thing in this part is to observe the correctness of the device's position by levels. </p>

    <h2>  Safety Compliance </h2><p>  All manipulations with electrical devices should be carried out only in conditions of a complete blackout.  At the same time, each time before contact with exposed parts of products integrated into the network, it is necessary to check the voltage with a special indicator - you can use a multimeter for this.  The correct wiring diagram must also be maintained.  It is recommended to install wiring accessories in accordance with the drawings attached to the kit documentation.  Sometimes schemes are applied to the back of products.  So that after installation, the device retains its physical integrity and correctly performs the functions, the load should be correctly calculated.  Again, acceptable limits are usually indicated in the documents for the devices or on the case. </p><h2>  Manufacturers of wiring accessories </h2>

    <p>  The market for electrical devices is wide enough for everyone to find the best solution for their needs.  However, there are not many really high-quality products.  In this sense, it is worth highlighting such companies as SVEN, ABB and Legrand.  As for SVEN products, it is characterized by the quality of technical performance of accessories.  Developers use high-quality galvanized steel, experiment with design solutions for enclosures and provide multilayer protective shells.  ABB devices have similar advantages.  The wiring accessories of this company comply with the primary quality standards, they are distinguished by their durability, exquisite forms and style of execution.  Products from Legrand have long been known to electrical engineers.  In this case, we can emphasize the active introduction of high technology and support for a basic quality level. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The engineering equipment of an apartment or house bears a great responsibility - not only for comfort, but also for safety.  Therefore, saving on the components of such systems is not worth it.  It is advisable to initially use electrical products of Legrand, SVEN, ABB or other brands of a similar level.  It will also be useful to calculate the possibilities for applying high-tech solutions.  Perhaps this will be the integration of electrical engineering into the system of a smart home, or the expansion of the basic functionality of a traditional electrical infrastructure. </p>
