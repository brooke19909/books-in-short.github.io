  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Lingonberry" in Yanino: description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The small village of Yanino lies just a couple of kilometers from St. Petersburg.  Perhaps this is what attracts developers here, because in the last decade the construction in Yanino has unfolded with extraordinary scope and enviable activity.  LCD "Lingonberry" - one of the new complexes being built here.  Two of his lines have already been completed, now the builders are completing the third.  According to the plan, by the summer of this year, the LCD will be fully populated.  This complex is declared as economy class housing, but apartments here are not inferior to comfort class.  We offer detailed information about what other features are available in Lingonberry and whether it is worth investing money here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  There are two Yanino - 1 and 2. The first village is much larger, the second is somewhat quieter and cleaner, but it is located about 3 km further from the city.  The first has a relatively developed infrastructure, and to the Ring Road from it only 1300 meters along the highway, which promises residents significant amenities.  LCD "Lingonberry" is being built in Yanino-1.  According to the mystery shopper who visited this complex, he is squeezed into existing buildings, so there are no more than 50 meters to neighboring houses.  The Koltushskoye highway passes from the Lingonberry only 190 meters, but it will not interfere much with the residents of the complex in question, because the Yaninsky residential complex and a number of Khrushchev‚Äôs stood between it and the highway, like a shield.  The address at Lingonberry is: Novaya street, plot No. 14 a., </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  On the one hand, the Brusnichny residential complex in Yanino is located in a convenient place from the point of view of transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Motorists, of course, will be regarded as a plus location of the complex next to the Koltush highway and a three-minute drive from the Ring Road, just at the site of a major fork.  The problem is that the Koltushskoye highway so far has only two lanes, and the private sector, stretching along the road, prevents it from expanding.  Therefore, traffic jams are a frequent occurrence. </p><p>  For those who are going to use public transport, the location of the complex seems to be quite good.  Three metro stations ‚ÄúLadozhskaya‚Äù, ‚ÄúUlitsa Dybenko‚Äù and ‚ÄúProspect Bolshevikov‚Äù are located at 7 km from it.  They can be reached by minibuses, the stop of which is located on the highway, two minutes from Brusnichnoye, but public transport gets into the same traffic jams during rush hours.  Therefore, the path to the subway can take more than half an hour. </p><p>  In the future, it is planned to open a new metro station ‚ÄúYanino‚Äù, but this will happen no earlier than 2025. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Lingonberry in Yanino reviews" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1612884.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  People have an opinion that ecology is much better outside the city, because there are no enterprises there, and around there are endless natural masses.  LCD "Lingonberry" fits into this pastoral picture is not entirely clear.  It, as already mentioned, is located near the highway loaded with vehicles, beyond which the Yaninsky industrial zone is located.  Here, just 200 meters from the complex, the North-West Concrete Company plant is located, a little further on the Leningrad Reinforced Concrete Plant, and the Beton-Lux company located its squares to the right 50 meters to the right.  In addition, the largest garbage processing plant in the region operates in the industrial zone, just 350-400 meters from Brusnichny.  It was built 6 years ago, but already receives more than 500 tons of waste every day.  At the same time, some of them are processed by the plant into compost, and some are buried.  It is difficult to predict the future prospects of its development. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For residents of the ‚ÄúBrusnichny‚Äù residential complex, residential buildings that enclose the complex from concrete plants and from MPBO-2 are an indisputable plus. </p><p>  The positive aspects of the location of the complex in terms of ecology are <span>Rzhevsky Forest Park</span> and Korkinskoye Lake located 800 meters away, which can be reached by car in 15 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Lingonberry in Yanino" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1612922.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  Nevskaya Construction Company is the developer of the Brusnichny residential complex.  "NSC" is a whole group of organizations specializing in the construction and sale of real estate.  Previously, NSC acted as a contractor, but now it does everything on its own, from the development stage of the housing complex to the implementation stage.  At the moment, there are 4 objects in her piggy bank.  This is the ‚ÄúLingonberry‚Äù complex, the Smolny townhouse and two apartment buildings, one of which has the beautiful name ‚ÄúLadoga Coast‚Äù. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and design of the complex </h2><p>  It looks pretty pretty from the side of the Lingonberry in Yanino.  Reviews of real estate investors note that all three of its buildings were erected in a modern design, have bright beautiful facades that perfectly complement the balconies with panoramic glazing.  The entire complex according to the architectural design should include three eight-story buildings.  The first is built in the shape of the letter "G".  It has 4 sections.  The second building also has an L-shaped, but it has 3 sections.  The third building is the smallest, consists of only 1 section.  There is no complex fencing point and security installation in the project; entrance to its territory will be free.  In the yards here it is planned to carry out landscaping, build playgrounds, create recreation areas.  On the first floors of all three houses will be located various commercial offices.  It is already known that a store and a private clinic will open here.  The buildings of the buildings have one underground technical floor.  Underground parking is not planned.  It will be outdoor free, designed for 100 cars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lingonberry lingonberry reviews" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1612974.jpg" width="500"></div>

RC ‚ÄúLingonberry‚Äù is being built close to other modern LCDs, such as ‚ÄúYaninsky‚Äù, ‚ÄúIoannina Country‚Äù, ‚ÄúYaninsky cascade‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew Yanino‚Äù, the territory of which will be open, which will make it possible to use their infrastructure.  It is certainly convenient.  But, on the other hand, in the village there is only one school and two kindergartens, which are clearly not enough for all former and new residents.  The same situation with medical care.  250 meters from Lingonberry is the only medical facility available in Yanino - a small outpatient clinic where only a few doctors are admitted. </p><p>  Other infrastructure facilities include a store, which is 50 meters from the complex, a post office and a church located near the dispensary, the Culture House and the Skummi store located outside Koltushskoye Shosse, a gas station, a tire fitting point, a parts store, and a Dixy supermarket ‚ÄùAnd the Norman store, 400 meters from the highway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction in Yanino LCD Lingonberry" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1612900.jpg" width="507"></div>
