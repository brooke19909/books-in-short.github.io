However, in history there are many women who are not inferior to them in cruelty.  Nevertheless, there are really less serial killers among them than among the stronger sex.  Probably because it requires planning, and women are emotional creatures, and they don‚Äôt really like it.  However, not so few of them.  After reading the article, you will see that women maniacs are not so rare in history. </p><h2>  Bella (Belle) Sorenson Gunnes </h2>

    <p>  The first woman we will talk about is Bella Sorenson Gunness.  She has allegedly 42 victims.  This is a native of Norway, who moved to the United States and married a businessman from Chicago.  Bella Sorenson Guinness was killing for money and just for fun.  Some researchers believe that this woman also killed her two daughters.  She poisoned them in order to get insurance.  Officially, the death of Bella‚Äôs children is considered the result of the disease, however, judging by a number of signs, it could also have caused poisoning.  In addition, Bella Sorenson Guinness is suspected of burning a family business in order to receive insurance payments.  Her husband later died under very strange circumstances.  Of course, his wife again received money for this.  Perhaps the woman sent her husband to the other world, feeding him special "medicines."  Bella was later called the "black widow." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  She wanted to buy a farm for the proceeds from the murder of her husband, but apparently she did not have enough money.  Then the woman began to seduce elderly and middle-aged men.  Bella made love letters with them, got married, and then her husbands died, and the ‚Äúblack widow‚Äù earned income.  A very sophisticated business.  According to rumors, 42 bodies are buried in the land in areas belonging to Gunness.  And the woman earned about 250 thousand dollars on her "business". </p><p>  However, someone put an end to this woman‚Äôs unusual ‚Äúcareer‚Äù.  Her body was found burnt, and her head was chopped off.  Although the question remains open whether the corpse really belonged to Belle, or the woman again came out of the water dry.  A terrifying story, isn't it?  However, the other most cruel women maniacs cause no less emotions.  We‚Äôll talk about one of them. </p><h2>  Jane Toppan </h2><p>  Jane is a nurse who killed weak and <span>sick people.</span>  It is known that her father was crazy, and the girl spent her childhood in a shelter in Boston.  When Jane Toppan grew up, she became a physically fit, <span>large woman.</span>  The future criminal has learned to be a nurse.  During the training, teachers noticed the girl's unhealthy attraction to <span>autopsy</span> photographs <span>.</span>  However, Jane managed to get an education and find a job.  She began to look after patients who considered her a caring nurse.  The woman was even called "Jane Jolly."  After some time, Toppan realized that bringing patients to the brink of death gives her sexual pleasure.  She drugged her victims, then trying to resuscitate them in order to repeat this operation.  Jane often went to bed with the dying.  The woman probably molested them while the patients clung to life with all their might!  Toppan began her killer career in 1885 and continued her atrocities until she was arrested.  The woman was charged with 11 murders.  Jane, while in custody, gave a shocking testimony.  She admitted that she killed 31 people.  Toppan wanted to be the record holder, the woman who committed the most murders.  Jane recognized as crazy.  She spent the rest of her life in a criminal hospital for criminals, like many other <span>serial female maniacs.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rosemary West </h2>

    <p>  Eileen Vuornos is one of the most famous serial killers today.  This woman worked as a prostitute, was a lesbian.  She knew sin as a child: Eileen became pregnant at the age of 13.  After 2 years she was kicked out of the house.  It is known that a woman committed armed robberies.  In addition, she managed to marry a 70-year-old elderly man who later complained that his wife was beating him.  Arrests, drunken fights and other things helped the old man in court to ensure that Vuornos was forbidden to approach him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The woman entered into a lesbian relationship.  Her chosen one was a girl named Tyria.  In order to feed herself and her, Eileen began to engage in prostitution.  She killed 8 customers.  Eileen, shortly before her death, vowed that she had committed the first murder in self-defense.  Unlike many other female killers, Vuornos was not afraid of the sight of blood.  She killed her victims with pistol shots.  By the way, in 2003 the film "Monster" was released with Charlize Theron in the role of Eileen.  The actress received Golden Globe and Oscar awards for this role. </p><h2>  Andrea Yates </h2>

    <p>  Maniacs of the world, women and men, often suffer from mental disorders.  And Andrea Yates probably suffered from schizophrenia.  Although she was not officially diagnosed with this diagnosis, the presence of a woman with serious mental disorders is obvious.  Andrea killed 5 of her children, drowning them all in the bathroom.  Rusty, her domineering husband, wanted to have many children, and his wife had constant depressions, which even reached the point of suicide attempts.  The additional psychological burden associated with raising children turned out to be fatal. </p><p>  Her husband knew that Andrea had problems with his head (although he later blamed the psychiatrists for everything that happened), so he usually asked someone to stay with his children and his wife during his absence.  But then one day the woman was left alone.  She took advantage of this to drown her children.  Rusty said that he wanted to leave his wife alone for a while, so that she would not really get used to the help of others.  Andrea had enough hours to kill all five children in turn.  Then the woman called the rescue service and told about the deed. </p><p>  Andrea thought that for her and for the children their death would be the best way out.  The fact is that the woman was a religious fanatic.  She called her children "unrighteous" and believed that her own sins would not allow them to grow up as worthy Christians. </p><h2>  Beverly Ellitt </h2>

    <p>  The story of the next woman, Beverly Ellitt, is also related to the killing of children.  She was nicknamed the "angel of death."  The woman was a registered nurse.  She killed children by injecting insulin or <span>potassium chloride</span> into their blood to cause cardiac arrest.  In total, this woman has 4 committed murders and another 9 attempts.  Moreover, all 13 attempts to kill children occurred in a very short time, within two weeks!  Beverly's oldest victim was 5 years old, and the youngest was not even two months old.  The psychiatrists who studied the case of this woman came to the conclusion that she suffered from a very unusual mental disorder - Munchausen‚Äôs syndrome.  The motive for her killing and hurting others is to attract attention.  Ellitt, as a child, loved to pretend to be seriously ill.  Beverly was sent to a hospital for insane criminals.  The woman was assigned 13 life sentences.  Relatives of the children she killed threaten to crack down on her if the woman is ever released. </p><h2>  Carla Homolka </h2>

    <p>  Our next heroine is Carla Homolka from Canada, a beautiful blonde who loved Paul Bernardo, the serial killer known as the Scarborough rapist.  Feelings for a lover made him help him in his crimes.  Together, they committed the abduction, rape and murder of 3 young women.  At the same time, one of them was Carla's sister!  Niece begged Homolka to let her go, and she took pity, and even gave her relative a teddy bear.  After the arrest, Carla made a deal with the authorities in order to mitigate the punishment, - she told about the murders her husband committed.  Paul, however, claimed that it was she who killed everyone.  Discovered videos indicate that this woman was at least not a victim, whom her husband forced him to commit criminal acts. </p><h2>  Susan Smith </h2>

    <p>  Susan Smith, unlike many other female killers, was not insane.  In her right mind, she killed two sons, Alex and Michael.  The woman tried to make herself insane, assuring that she had committed murders for religious reasons.  However, the facts indicate something else.  Tom, the beloved of this woman, shortly before the tragedy occurred, abandoned her.  After that, Smith brought her children to the river, removed the car from the handbrake and pushed it into the water.  A woman stood and watched a car with her two children plunge into the water, and then called the police and reported that some black man had committed the crime. </p><p>  Susan claimed that her stepfather raped her as a child.  Having matured, the girl began to dream of perfect love, at the same time experiencing the need for regular sex.  Behind the bars, she managed to sleep with two guards.  One of them awarded Susan syphilis. </p><h2>  Diana Downes </h2><p>  As you can see, many women maniacs killed their children.  Our next heroine, Diana Downes, is no exception.  When Lew, her lover, told her that the children were not part of his plans, the woman decided ... to kill her children!  Diana from her previous marriage had 3 children - Danny, Cheryl and Christie.  In order to get rid of them, she took the children to the desert.  Here, a woman in cold blood killed Cheryl, her 7-year-old daughter.  She also shot at Danny and Christy, however, they managed to survive, although 3-year-old Danny was paralyzed below the waist, and Christy was partially paralyzed.  The latter was able to testify and told the court what her mother had done. </p><h2>  Lyudmila Spesivtseva </h2><p>  Our list so far consists only of foreign names.  But there are Russian women killers.  One of them is Spesivtseva Lyudmila Yakovlevna.  Although she did not kill herself, she actively helped the cannibal Alexander Spesivtsev, her crazy son, do it.  For some time, an elderly woman-maniac worked as an assistant to a blind lawyer in court.  She often brought home photographs of dead people and showed them to Alexander.  Is it any wonder that he grew up mentally ill, turned into a sociopath?  Alexander was in a mental hospital, but after a while he was released.  He returned to his mother and soon began to kill, and the woman not only did not interfere with him, but also began to help!  Lyudmila lured girls to the cannibal, took out the remains of victims from the house.  One of the victims managed to live quite a long time in order to testify (the exhausted child still died after some time).  The camera forever recorded the terrifying words of the girl who said that Lyudmila fed her and the rest of the captives with the meat of their murdered friend!  It is also assumed, although not officially confirmed, that she cooked the meat of the victims and sold it on the market.  A family of maniacs killed at least 20 people.  However, there are probably even more victims - photos of minors were found in the Spesivtsev‚Äôs apartment, as well as clothes that could belong to 82 people!  There is an assumption that Alexander was helped not only by Lyudmila, but also by his sister. </p><h2>  Saltykova Daria Nikolaevna </h2><p>  Maniac women in Russia, it turns out, is not a new phenomenon.  <span>Daria Saltykova</span> was born in 1730, and died in 1801.  The Russian landowner Saltychikha (such a nickname was given to Daria) went down in history as a sadist and a murderer of several dozen serfs subject to her.  By the decision of Empress Catherine II and the Senate, she was stripped of the title of a pillar noblewoman.  The woman was sentenced to life imprisonment and placed in a monastery prison, in which she died at the age of 71 years.  At the age of 26, Daria was widowed, having received at her disposal about 600 peasants.  The investigator in her case, on the basis of Saltykova‚Äôs house books, compiled a list of 138 serfs, whose fate had to be determined.  50 people, according to the records, ‚Äúdied of illness‚Äù, 72 ‚Äúwere missing‚Äù, and another 16 were considered as ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù or ‚Äúleaving for her husband‚Äù.  According to the testimony of peasants, 75 people were killed in the villages and the estate of the landowner, mainly girls and women.  Saltykova spent 33 years in prison and died in 1801.  She was buried with all her relatives in the cemetery of the Donskoy Monastery, the tombstone was preserved. </p><h2>  Amelia Elizabeth Dyer </h2><p>  Another example from the story is Amelia Elizabeth Dyer.  This woman was born in 1837, and executed in 1896.  A criminal from England is considered the most massive child murder in history.  At the age of 24, in 1861, the girl married George Thomas, who was 59 years old at the time of the wedding.  It is known that the groom during the marriage reduced 10 years, and the bride added so that the age difference between them would not be so frightening.  She committed her crimes in the <span>Victorian era</span> and was a kind of baby farmer.  This woman was executed by hanging for one murder, but it is believed that she is responsible for the deaths of other children, who may be more than four hundred. </p><p>  The Dyer trial began in 1896, May 22.  The death sentence was carried out in Newgate Prison on June 10, 1896. Amelia's last words were: "I have nothing to say." </p><p>  Killer women, as you see, are not such a rare occurrence.  Who is to blame for this?  Are they only themselves?  It is likely that our society itself is unhealthy if so many socially dangerous elements continue to appear in it.  In no way justifying the criminals themselves, it should be noted that famous women maniacs are phenomena that make you think a lot. </p>
