And naturally, when choosing a resort, they are looking for where it is better to relax with little travelers.  Moreover, it is desirable that this was not only the sea and a clean beach, but some fun games and interesting excursions.  In addition, Cyprus has good food and decent service in hotels.  Protaras is suitable for an inexpensive family vacation.  There are many cozy bays and beautiful nature.  The sand on the beach is shallow, soft.  Of the attractions there is an oceanarium and a <span>water park.</span>  <span>Limassol</span> rolls over the amount of entertainment per capita of tourists.  There is an amusement park, and exotic farms, and knight's castles with shows and performances.  But still it is a big city.  Some people like the elite resort of Paphos, but the local hotels have few programs aimed at entertaining children.  Therefore, the leader of family vacations in Cyprus is Ayia Napa.  We‚Äôll talk about this resort now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

So many bars, hotels and nightclubs were built here, that the resort immediately earned the fame of ‚Äúsecond Ibiza‚Äù.  And the locals themselves also love Ayia Napa and go here to relax.  In this city you can see the famous monastery of the same name, as well as the rock tombs of Macronissos, which belong to the ancient era.  Attractions lovers are advised to visit the Sea Museum and Cape Greco with the Cavo National Park. </p><p>  Ayia Napa also refers to those resorts in Cyprus, where it is better to go with children.  Local beaches are gentle, in the vicinity there is a beautiful water park, where special holidays for kids are organized.  And the land attractions of Ayia Napa, such as the Ferris wheel and the Catapult, invariably delight teenagers.
