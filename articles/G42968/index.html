    <p>  Lunch at the restaurant costs 350 rubles.  Such a price for delicious business lunches is quite acceptable for a luxury southern resort.  It's nice to sit in the restaurant, everything shines clean in it.  The staff cleverly serves the guests.  There is no hint of stuffiness in the hall, it is always fresh in it. </p><p>  Meals are served on expensive English dishes.  The restaurant tries to use semi-finished products to a minimum.  Chefs cook yogurt with their own hands, which are served with salads, noodles for soups and more. </p><p>  The beach complex pleases with amenities.  The use of sun loungers, towels and umbrellas is included in the price.  Many tourists disappear there all day.  Having bought a variety of food and drinks, they are located in a shade falling from the arches of the complex. </p><p>  Tourists regret that there is no transfer to the beach, the path to it is still decent.  For older travelers and young children in the heat it is hard to walk to the coast and back.  The beach complex is not fenced.  "Savages" break through the guards, grab deckchairs or sit on towels closer to the sea, which prevents guests from relaxing peacefully. </p><p>  For swimming in the pool, hotel guests do not need to buy a separate subscription.  If you do not want to go to the sea, you can swim in the pool at any time.  Free places on the beach and pool are always there.  Towels and deckchairs are plentiful. </p>

    <p>  The animation team involves adults and children in fun contests.  The hotel buildings are fully air-conditioned, their rooms are equipped with the appropriate modern technology. </p><p>  Tourists like the location of the hotel complex.  Not far from it there is an amusement park "Riviera".  Walking distance to the boulevards, market, promenade and train station. </p><p>  More dissatisfaction is expressed by guests from the main old building.  The rooms there are not as comfortable as in the new one.  Breakfast at the restaurant of this building is worse.  Misunderstandings with staff.  In general, the hotel, according to tourists, corresponds to the European three-star complexes. </p>
