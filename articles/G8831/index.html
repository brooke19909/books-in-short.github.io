  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meaningful Holidays in Japan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most mysterious and fascinating country is Japan.  It is difficult to disagree with this, because only the Japanese can see beauty even in ordinary stone and invest so much sense and wisdom in three-line verses - hoku.  The popularity of this eastern country is growing every year, because intellectual tourism is becoming fashionable.  In other words, travelers were already fed up with thoughtless <span>beach vacations,</span> and it became interesting to reflect on the culture of the country and try to solve its riddles.  Far from everyone can appreciate a vacation in Japan, but this uniqueness lies in the charm of visiting this country. </p><p>  <span>The capital of Japan</span> is Tokyo - a city where skyscrapers, constant movement and vanity, and ancient pagodas, gardens are combined, where it is very quiet and calm.  It will be interesting to see the Tosegu Temple, the Imperial Palace, the Museum of Science, the Shitomashi Historical Museum, the Kite Museum and many others.  There are approximately 30 museums in Tokyo.  Disneyland is located here, which copies its California counterpart.  To date, the Tokyo version is superior to the American in terms of number of attractions.  A visit to this park will make holidays in Japan for children fascinating and memorable.  In addition, another Disneyland is located nearby, which is based on cartoons of marine themes. </p><p>  Those who want to spend their holidays in Japan with the maximum health benefits should visit the <span>island of Honshu,</span> where the unique resort of Hakone is located.  It is famous for its hot springs and a large number of rotenburo, arranged near hotels.  These are open-air baths in which you can enjoy the local scenery.  From the beginning of July to the end of August, tourists are invited to visit the most famous sleeping volcano in the world of Fuji, which is a symbol of this country.  His last eruption was in 1708. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the fact that flights are very expensive, many tourists prefer to buy last-minute <span>tours to Japan,</span> saving about half the cost of a trip.  This allows more people to get acquainted with the multifaceted culture of the country.  Another important place that must be taken into account when planning your vacation in Japan is the city of Kyoto, which was the oldest capital.  Here is the rock garden at the Ryoanji Temple, the Golden Pavilion, Kiyomizu Temples.  The Golden Pavilion was built at the end of the 14th century.  It is a three-story building, the roof of which is covered with thin gold plates.  Next to it is a sand garden.  Such a love for the beauty of inanimate nature among the Japanese arose not by chance.  This is due to the fact that the land of Japan is not suitable for the rapid growth of plants, and the <span>population density</span> does not allow to occupy empty territory for planting. </p><p>  Along with the oldest temples and gardens in Japan, numerous business centers, skyscrapers, research institutes harmoniously coexist.  This country can rightfully be considered one of the leaders in scientific development, since most of the innovative ideas belong to its scientists.  Despite the growing interest in Japan from Western countries and Russia, it has been cherishing its traditions for many centuries and never betraying them.  This applies to absolutely all spheres of life: from the upbringing of children to the labor activity.  In order to try to understand the essence of Japanese thinking, you need to live here at least a couple of months. </p><p>  As such, the tourist seasons are not here, since all the attractions are accessible all year round.  In this regard, last minute packages to Japan do not appear as often as in other countries.  Their acquisition makes visiting the country more accessible to more people.  In order to feel Japan you need to be spiritually prepared. </p>
