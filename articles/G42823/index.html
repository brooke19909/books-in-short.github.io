There are a large number of models on the market that can compete with the ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone.  At the same time, such flagships, as a rule, are much cheaper. </p><p>  But still, a huge number of people are trying to figure out how to distinguish the original iPhone from a fake.  Some Chinese developers put up for sale very bad fakes, and very high-quality ones.  Therefore, we have to understand this issue. </p><h2>  Why fake? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that problems with replicas have become rare, the question of how to distinguish the original ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù from a fake remains an urgent one.  Why are some manufacturers doing these kinds of things? </p><p>  First, in the pursuit of money.  Of course, this is the main reason.  It is the attempt to enter a popular brand that is the driving force.  Secondly, many Apple fans cannot afford the device from this company, so they are looking for cheaper options.  There is a demand - there is a supply. </p><p>  The replica is very high quality.  In this case, only one way of distinguishing the original iPhone from a fake can help.  There are copies made poorly.  In this case, a visual inspection is enough to determine the fake. </p><h2>  Replica Detection Methods </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter what model you have in your hands: iPhone 5 or 6. How to distinguish an original iPhone from a fake?  The following methods will help: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  visual inspection; </li><li>  checking the configuration and packaging; </li><li>  serial number check; </li><li>  phone system inspection; </li><li>  Check compatibility with iTunes. </li></ul><p>  These are the simplest and most popular options that will help you identify a Chinese fake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fake &quot;iPhone&quot;" class="if uuid-2908750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908750.jpg"></div><h2>  Easiest option </h2><p>  But there is one unspoken way that seems to many not quite objective.  Many believe that a person who at least once in his life held a real iPhone in his hands will definitely identify a copy.  Therefore, you can either go to the store yourself to feel the ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone there, or ask for help from the person who owns the iPhone. </p><p>  If objectively, the method is not the most reliable.  Sometimes the first impression can be deceiving, and the first look at the replica will be blurred by the joy of buying a new phone.  Therefore, it is better to delve into the study of more mundane ways. </p><h2>  Packing check </h2><p>  The easiest way to understand how to distinguish the original "iPhone 7" from a fake is to look at the box and equipment. </p><p>  Apple is known for its reverent attitude to detail.  Developers are trying to keep branded elements in everything.  Therefore, attentive users will probably notice inaccuracies in the package. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This box is made of thick cardboard.  It has sharp corners.  The logo is embossed.  There is a sticker on the back of the box that contains all the information about the device. </p><p>  In order not to go to court, many Chinese manufacturers provide different data.  For example, they may write iPhone with errors.  Here you can find a variety of variations: from iPhon to lPhone.  In the latter case, the lowercase letter L is used instead of i. </p><p>  Also, the main logo can be modified.  For example, an apple is bitten on the other hand.  Some display a pear.  In general, each manufacturer, as it may, is twisted.  The most accurate copies are usually obtained by identical labels on the sticker, and dense quality packaging.  In this case, it remains to look inside. </p><h2>  Package Check </h2><p>  Apple's packaging is almost never changed.  Some serious changes are always mentioned at the presentation.  Therefore, it is easy to trace and check the box for the presence of required components. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osworld.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to distinguish the original iPhone" class="if uuid-2908754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908754.jpg"></div><p>  So, there is always a charger inside, and the Lightning power cable is supplied with it.  Also, the user can use the original headset.  Wireless headphones are now especially popular.  In a special envelope is the accompanying documentation.  There is a paper clip to remove the SIM card tray. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Separately, you can consider accessories.  They are made of durable plastic.  They should not be scratched, burrs, cuts or other defects.  The power cable should be soft.  Each component is neatly packaged.  Now the company is practicing the supply of elements in separate boxes. </p><h2>  Visual inspection </h2><p>  How to distinguish an original iPhone from a fake?  In this case, it all depends on the specific model.  It is important to understand the difference in smartphone modifications.  Details and differences need to be found.  But there are common elements by which you can recognize the replica. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.righto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charger difference" class="if uuid-2908760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908760.jpg"></div><p>  All parts of the original device fit tightly.  There can be no backlashes and creaks.  Gaps are also excluded.  The body of the device is monolithic.  It is impossible to disassemble, remove the cover, remove the battery, etc. </p><p>  You can understand a lot from the buttons.  They should clearly respond to pressing, not play and do not creak.  There are some points that fake always showed: </p><ul><li>  removable battery; </li><li>  the presence of two SIM cards (with the exception of new items in 2018); </li><li>  the presence of a slot for a memory card; </li><li>  micro USB connector instead of Lightning; </li><li>  telescopic antenna. </li></ul><h2>  Attention to detail </h2><p>  How to distinguish the original "iPhone 8" from a fake?  You have to look closely at the details that are a feature of this particular model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.psst.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visual inspection of &quot;iPhone&quot;" class="if uuid-2908757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908757.jpg"></div><p>  We look at the camera.  The original device has a neatly located module in the right place.  There should be no dust under the glass.  Also, there can be no defects there. </p><p>  The screen of the original iPhone received a deep black color.  It does not cast gray, does not ripple, does not have broken pixels, etc. Of course, if there are any problems with the screen, this does not mean that the device is not original.  Perhaps it visited a service center. </p><p>  Next is a closer look at the logo.  It is made of stainless steel.  It can not be fingered or torn off.  It is reliably recessed into the housing and is part of it. </p><p>  You can pay attention to the Lightning port.  On the sides of it there are bolts located symmetrically.  They have a five-sided thread.  If it is damaged, scratched or has any other defect, there is an option that the smartphone was tried to be repaired or replaced with a ‚Äústuffing‚Äù in it. </p><h2>  Checking Serial Number and IMEI </h2><p>  This method will unequivocally give the answer, the replica in your hands or not.  Although he will not always save you from the iPhone, which was in the service center. </p><p>  First you need to compare the IMEI numbers on the package and in the system itself.  To find it, you need to go to your smartphone‚Äôs settings, find the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù - ‚ÄúAbout the device‚Äù section and collect the necessary information there. </p><p>  Next, you will need to check IMEI on a special resource.  In general, there are a large number of them, for example, iphoneox.  After entering the code, information about the device will appear.  It describes the release date, technical parameters and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idownloadblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check IMEI" class="if uuid-2908784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908784.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the resource will help determine if the phone is ‚Äúblack‚Äù. </p><p>  Next, check the <span>serial number.</span>  It is also on the packaging and in the phone.  Thanks to him, you can understand how to distinguish the original "iPhone 6s" from a fake. </p><p>  On the official website of the company, you can check the right to warranty service.  If you have the original in your hands, the site will indicate the date of purchase, as well as the status of technical support. </p><h2>  System check </h2><p>  Another simplest way to understand how to distinguish the original iPhone 5 from a fake.  This method always helps to identify a cue.  The fact is that Apple has created the original iOS operating system, which works only on "apple" devices.  It cannot be installed on any other smartphone. </p><p>  In order to somehow get out of this situation, the developers of fake phones install everyone‚Äôs favorite Android, but "finish" it with iOS.  And despite this, the difference is always noticeable. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the performance of branded programs.  The iPhone has popular services such as iTunes, as well as a "native" browser and the famous voice assistant Siri.  If the phone is original, then all of the above services will work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="metro.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android system" class="if uuid-2908771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908771.jpg"></div><p>  There is an option to check the application store.  Many users know that the apple company is branded.  The App Store is the original Apple service.  It, of course, cannot be in any other device. </p><p>  Despite similar icons and other tricks, if you open this service on a fake smartphone, the famous Google Play will open.  These application stores are very different, so you can‚Äôt confuse the buyer. </p><h2>  ITunes compatibility </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, iTunes can help with the question of how to distinguish the original iPhone 5s from a fake.  The program is proprietary and helps to synchronize smartphone data on a PC. </p><p>  Since Apple worked on all this, connecting a third-party device paired with this application will fail.  Therefore, it will be enough to connect the iPhone to the PC and launch iTunes.  The program will try to synchronize data and determine the device.  Naturally, in the case of a replica, this process will not be successful. </p><h2>  Questions about Headphones </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, a careful inspection of the configuration can help determine the replica.  Now all new iPhones come with the original EarPods headset.  To identify a fake smartphone, it is enough to distinguish the original iPhone headphones from a fake.  How to do it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original Apple Headset" class="if uuid-2908774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908774.jpg"></div><p>  Some people think that just listening to the sound is enough to identify the original headset.  Apple branded headphones are very high quality, they give a deep, clear sound and low bass. </p><p>  Next is a closer look at the details: </p><ol><li>  The original headset has a dense dark blue metal mesh inside the ear cushions.  A fabric mesh is often used in a fake. </li><li>  There are no gaps between the parts of the headphones in the original.  Fakes are usually made sloppy, so they have large gaps. </li><li>  The original headset has a marking of the right and left earphones.  The fake does not have it or it was made incorrectly. </li><li>  The material is smooth and free from defects in the original. </li></ol><p>  Sometimes the manufacturer does not bother and does not even repeat the original form of ear pads.  He does not attach too much importance to a quality wire, if it is a wired version.  It is very thin and rough, due to which it can quickly crack or tear. </p><h2>  Replica purchase </h2><p>  Of course, knowledge about the definition of fake iPhone is useful, but it is better to avoid such a thing.  You will find yourself in a winning situation only when you collect money for the original smartphone and purchase it from an authorized dealer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Invalid fingerprint scanner" class="if uuid-2908767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2908767.jpg"></div><p>  Quality device has 1 year warranty and support from Apple.  You get the opportunity to use all the branded services that fans of the company loved so much.  All official updates with automatic installation ‚Äúfly‚Äù to the original smartphone. </p>
