    <p>  If a citizen who has reached retirement age has a previously concluded contract with an NPF, then he has the right to contact any nearest office of the company to make pension payments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An attractive system is in place for working citizens, providing the funded part of pensions.  By concluding an agreement with a company, an individual can effectively manage the cumulative part of his retirement pension by transferring it to the management of a reliable company. </p><p>  People who paid taxes to the state every month, after concluding an agreement with a commercial pension fund, can take part in a special co-financing program, as well as generate additional payments when they reach retirement age.  It is only necessary to personally participate in the NGO program. </p><p>  In order to conclude an agreement with a Gazprom entity for an individual in order to manage their pension savings, a person needs only to have a passport and a certificate of state pension insurance.

    <p>  Cooperation between private companies and NPF Gazprom also looks very attractive.  Any enterprise seeks to reward its valuable personnel with higher wages and an expanded social package.  One of the factors of encouragement is the various programs for planning the future retirement of workers.  Having received a guarantee of financial security in old age, employees strive to work as efficiently as possible. </p><p>  Thanks to the introduction of a universal pension program in companies, working conditions for employees of enterprises improve, because the management took care of their wards and their future.  According to the laws of the Russian Federation, an enterprise can pledge up to 12 percent of funds from a fund earmarked for salary payments in its expenses.  The main advantage of NPFs over competitors is the availability of many investment management schemes.  All programs are aimed at meeting the needs of citizens of various categories. </p><h2>  How to transfer your funded part to NPF </h2><p>  In order to entrust your part of the pension savings under the management of the company NPF, known throughout the country, you must contact one of its offices by writing a statement.  Based on this document, a contract is concluded. </p><p>  Many enterprises have representative offices of private pension funds that work for the convenience of citizens.  After all, an application can be submitted directly to the workplace. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>
