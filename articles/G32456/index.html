For residents of many other countries, he is associated with the true image of a typical American.  The origin of the name, according to the main version, is due to the fact that it was once called the tribe that once lived here.  Translated from the Aboriginal language, the name means "allies, good friends." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texas state" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/673425.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The state of Texas (USA) has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã696.2 thousand square kilometers.  As noted above, it is located in the south of the country, where it borders with the northern regions of Mexico.  From west to east, it stretches for almost 1,600 kilometers.  Its western neighbor is New Mexico, the eastern one is Arkansas, and the northern one is Oklahoma.  The largest rivers that flow through the state are the Colorado, Trinity, Red River, Rio Grande and Brazos.  Most of Texas is located on shrubby plains.  In the west are numerous deserts and steppes.  Due to geological features, a significant part of the earth is covered with cracks.  If you travel here from east to west, you can see how the wavy plains with hills replace the <span>pine forests</span> and coastal swamps, and behind them - the desert and mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Texas USA" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/673428.jpg" width="600"></div>

It should be noted that the first of them is in fourth place in size in the entire state.  In addition to them, there are 22 large agglomerations.  <span>The capital of Texas</span> is the city of Austin, which is located in the central region.  It consists of 254 counties, each of which is administered by authorized meetings.  The population of the state is about 22 million people. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Texas is a state that is rightfully considered the world-famous American center for the developed chemical and oil industry, a high educational level and agriculture.  In addition, many financial institutions are concentrated on its territory.  From the earliest times to the present day, agriculture has been a very important sector of the economy in Texas.  Locals are now earning fortunes by raising cattle.  At the beginning of the last century, the region turned into a key oil producer throughout <span>North America.</span>  The state of Texas provided for the extraction of more than 30 percent of "black gold", and also controlled the lion's share of imports of this raw material.  The level of development of light industry, which is mainly represented by the cultivation of cotton and its processing, is also at the proper level.  High-tech companies are located in large cities.  It should also be noted that it is in Houston that the Mission Control Center (NASA) is based. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texas city" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/673426.jpg" width="600"></div>

If the central and northern parts are characterized by a continental climate with cool winters and warm summers, then the subtropical hot climate prevails in the south.  Not uniform is the rainfall.  It decreases greatly from east to west.  In the first case, they average 1300 mm in a year, and in the second, about 300 mm.  In the central regions, severe <span>tornadoes</span> often occur <span>,</span> causing catastrophic damage to them.  The ideal months to visit Texas are October and November.  It is at this time that the temperature here is not very high, and the weather is calm and stable, so tourists do not have to be afraid of adverse weather conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texas" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/673429.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Based on the number of attractions, one of the most interesting cities is Dallas.  Despite the large number of skyscrapers and modern buildings, many <span>historical monuments</span> that date back to the nineteenth century have been preserved here (it was then that the future metropolis was founded).  One of the most mysterious and tragic events in American history is also associated with it.  It was here that John Kennedy was killed.  At the place where that shot was once fired, there is now a museum.  Another interesting city is Fort Worth. </p><p>  Be that as it may, the Americans themselves believe that Texas is a state whose main attraction is its diverse nature.  Everyone who wants to learn more about the local flora and fauna is advised to visit the Big Bend National Park.  Quite a popular destination among tourists recently has become the Royal Ranch, which is located on the <span>Gulf of Mexico.</span> </p>
