Formation of the Galicia-Volyn Principality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To really understand history, you need to mentally imagine the era of interest, the spirit of its time and main characters.  Today we will take a short trip to medieval Russia through the picturesque lands of Galicia and Volhynia. </p><h2>  What is it, Russia of the 12-13th centuries? </h2><p>  First of all, it is divided into small states, each of which lives according to its own laws and has its own ruler (prince).  Such a phenomenon was called the <span>feudal fragmentation of</span> Russia.  In each principality, people speak a specific dialect of the Russian language, which depends on the geographical location of the territory. </p><p>  The device of the <span>feudal society of</span> Russia is also interesting.  Historians distinguish two classes - the ruling elite, consisting of the nobility (influential boyars), and the estate of dependent peasants.  For some reason, the latter always turned out to be much larger. </p><p>  Representatives of another estate, artisans, lived in large cities.  These people had a wonderful ability to create authentic things.  Thanks to them, <span>Gzhel painting</span> and wood carving appeared, known not only in Russia but also abroad.  In a few words we talked about medieval Russia, then there will be exclusively the history of the Galicia-Volyn principality. </p>

    <h2>  The lands that make up the principality </h2><p>  The young state, the development of which began under the <span>Grand Duke</span> Roman Mstislavovich, consisted of different lands.  What were these territories?  The state included Galician, Volyn, Lutsk, Polesye, Kholm, Zvenigorod and Terebovlyan lands.  As well as part of the territories of modern Moldova, Transcarpathia, Podolia and Podlasie. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Like various puzzles, these plots of land succinctly formed the Principality of Galicia-Volyn (the geographical position and neighboring countries of the young state will be described in the next chapter). </p>

The geographical location of the new alliance was obviously advantageous.

    <p>  A good location meant various neighbors, but far from all of them were friendly to the young state. </p><p>  In the east, the young tandem had a long border with Kiev and the Turovo-Pinsk principality.  Relations between the fraternal peoples were friendly.  But the countries in the west and north did not particularly favor the young state.  Poland and Lithuania always wanted to control Galicia and Volhynia, which in the end they achieved in the 14th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the south, the state was adjacent to the Golden Horde.  Relations with the southern neighbor have always been difficult.  This is due to serious cultural differences and the presence of disputed territories. </p><h2>  Brief historical background </h2><p>  The Principality arose in 1199, under a combination of two circumstances.  The first was quite logical - the location of two culturally close territories (Galicia and Volhynia) and unfriendly neighboring countries (the Polish Kingdom and the Golden Horde).  The second is the emergence of a strong political figure - Prince Roman Mstislavovich.  The wise ruler was well aware that the larger the state, the easier it is for him to confront a common adversary, and culturally close peoples will coexist in one state.  His plan paid off, and at the end of the 12th century a new entity appeared. </p><p>  Who weakened the young state?  Natives of the Golden Horde were able to shake the Galicia-Volyn principality.  State development ended at the end of the 14th century. </p><h2>  Wise rulers </h2><p>  Over the 200 years of the existence of the state, different people have been in power.  Wise princes are a real find for Galicia and Volhynia.  So, who managed to bring peace and peace to this long-suffering territory?  Who were these people? </p><ul><li>  Yaroslav Vladimirovich Osmomysl - the predecessor of Roman Mstislavovich, the first to come to the territories under consideration.  Could successfully establish itself at the mouth of the Danube. </li><li>  Roman Mstislavovich - the unifier of Galicia and Volhynia. </li><li>  Danila Romanovich Galitsky is the son of Roman Mstislavovich.  Again brought together the lands of the Galicia-Volyn principality. </li></ul>

    <p>  Subsequent rulers of the principality were less strong-willed.  In 1392 the Galician-Volyn principality ceased to exist.  Princes could not resist external opponents.  As a result, Volyn became Lithuanian, Galicia went to Poland, and Chervona Rus - to the Hungarians. </p><p>  Concrete people created the Galician-Volyn principality.  The princes, whose achievements are described in this chapter, contributed to the prosperity and victories of the young state in the south-west of Russia. </p><h2>  Relations with neighbors and foreign policy </h2><p>  Influential countries surrounded the Principality of Galicia-Volyn.  The geographical position of the young state implied conflicts with neighbors.  The nature of foreign policy depended heavily on the historical period and the particular ruler: there were vivid conquests, there was also a period of forced cooperation with Rome.  The latter was carried out in order to protect against the Poles. </p><p>  The aggressive campaigns of <span>Roman Mstislavovich</span> and Danila Galitsky made the young state one of the strongest in Eastern Europe.  The unifying prince pursued a wise foreign policy towards Lithuania, the Polish Kingdom and Hungary.  He managed to spread influence to Kievan Rus in 1202-1203.  As a result, the Kievites had no choice but to accept a new ruler. </p><p>  No less interesting is the political triumph of Danila Galitsky.  When he was a child, chaos reigned in the territory of Volyn and Galicia.  But, having matured, the young heir went in the footsteps of his father.  Under Danil Romanovich, the Galician-Volyn principality reappeared.  The prince significantly expanded the territory of his state: annexed his eastern neighbor and part of Poland (including the city of Lublin). </p>

    <h2>  Unique culture </h2><p>  History impartially shows that each influential state creates its own authentic culture.  It is from her that people recognize him. </p><p>  The cultural characteristics of the Galicia-Volyn principality are very diverse.  We will look at the architecture of medieval cities. </p><p>  Stone cathedrals and castles characterize the <span>Principality of</span> Galicia-Volyn <span>(Novgorod</span> land was rich in similar buildings).  In the 12-13th centuries, a unique architectural school was formed on the lands of Galicia and Volhynia.  She absorbed both the traditions of Western European masters and the technology of the Kiev school.  Local craftsmen created such architectural masterpieces as the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir-Volynsky and the church of St. Panteleimon in Galich. </p>
