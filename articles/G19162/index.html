Everyone has the appropriate combination, but not everyone knows about it.  An individual <span>tax number</span> may be required under different circumstances.  And therefore, it is important to know how to get it.  Or rather, where you can see the relevant information.  It is not as difficult as it seems.  And with proper preparation, it will be possible to cope with a similar task in the shortest possible time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="buhproffi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out a citizen's TIN" class="if uuid-2314684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314684.jpg"></div><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  What is the TIN of an individual?  Before you learn the relevant information, you need to understand what we will deal with. </p><p>  <span>An individual taxpayer number</span> is a combination identifier that is used to search for data on a citizen in the Federal Tax Service database.  This component is required both during employment and during the opening of an IP / LLC. </p><p>  How many numbers are there in an individual's TIN?  12 numbers that are assigned to each person at birth.  Only not everyone knows that they have a tax ID.  It does not change under any circumstances. </p><h2>  Information Search Methods </h2><p>  Learn the TIN of an individual is offered in different ways.  And depending on the circumstances, the algorithm of actions will change. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, how to get data on an individual taxpayer number?  You can go with the following tricks: </p><ul><li>  study tax payment; </li><li>  look at the data in the TIN certificate; </li><li>  take advantage of "State services"; </li><li>  use the "Find out your TIN" service. </li></ul><p>  All of these options are absolutely free.  Anyone can use them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vesbiz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What does the TIN look like?" class="if uuid-2314685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314685.jpg"></div><h2>  What is useful for search </h2><p>  Can I find out the TIN of an individual by passport?  And in general, what information is useful for translating ideas into reality? </p><p>  It is worth remembering that the taxpayer identifier by F. I. O. is impossible to find.  A citizen will have to have some other information about a person.  Ideally, passport data. </p><p>  That is, according to the passport, the identifier under study can be found.  But only by last name and first name - no. </p><p>  Depending on who searches for data, they may require: </p><ul><li>  passport data of the person sought; </li><li>  F. I. O. person; </li><li>  the region in which the person lives. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  It is advisable to provide registration information.  SNILS is not required.  It is not possible to find the tax ID using the information from the insurance certificate. </p><h2>  By payment </h2><p>  Everyone can learn the TIN of an individual.  Let's start with the simplest option.  But to realize it is not always possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is about finding information in a payment notification from the Federal Tax Service.  <span>The taxpayer TIN</span> will be mandatory indicated in the relevant payment.  Just look at the Payer block.  Everything is simple and clear. </p><p>  The disadvantage of this solution is that payment notifications from tax authorities are sent out at some point.  And if a person does not have old copies of papers, he will have to wait for a new payment.  And it takes a lot of time.  Especially if the deadline for paying this or that tax is not coming to an end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smbizness.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Search TIN" class="if uuid-2314679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314679.jpg"></div><h2>  Certificate and data </h2><p>  You can find out the TIN by passport of an individual.  But for this, as a rule, it is necessary to issue a certificate of the established form.  After that, a person will be able to see the information he is interested in in full in the issued paper. </p><p>  The taxpayer identification number is written on the established certificate.  This is a combination of 12 digits that is unique.  It is impossible not to notice her. </p><h2>  How to get a certificate </h2><p>  A few words about how to issue a certificate with TIN.  This requires only an identification card and a statement.  The service is completely free.  She appears within 3-5 days. </p><p>  To get a document with a tax ID, you need: </p><ol><li>  Collect a specific package of documents.  We already spoke about him. </li><li>  Fill out an application for issuing a TIN. </li><li>  Contact the Federal Tax Service by registration with the appropriate request. </li><li>  Wait a few days. </li><li>  To receive in your hands a ready-made certificate of the established form. </li></ol><p>  Quick, easy, convenient.  After the actions taken, a person can no longer think about finding an individual identifier in the Federal Tax Service. </p><h2>  Government Services and Data </h2><p>  With the development of technology, citizens began to offer a variety of state and municipal services via the Internet.  Today in Russia there is a portal called "Government Services".  With it, anyone will be able to discover information about themselves or other persons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yurface.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Registration with the Federal Tax Service" class="if uuid-2314682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314682.jpg"></div><p>  Checking the TIN of an individual is offered through the "Find Your TIN" service.  It is located on the "State Services", is free and works flawlessly. </p><p>  To use this technique, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Register on the Gosuslugi website and log in using your username and password. </li><li>  Confirm the profile in any convenient way. </li><li>  Go to the "Service Catalog". </li><li>  Select "FTS" - "Find out your ...". </li><li>  Click on the option "Get ...". </li><li>  Fill in the information in the free fields.  Usually you need to indicate the name of the person, his region of residence, as well as registration. </li><li>  Click on the "Learn" or "Search" button. </li><li>  Wait until the test results appear on the screen. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  After a few minutes, the taxpayer information will appear on the display.  It is not as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  The most difficult is to register for the "State Services", as well as proof of identity.  These procedures take about 2 weeks.  And therefore, not everyone is ready to use this kind of trick. </p><h2>  FTS website to help </h2><p>  Tax on the TIN of an individual can search for data on citizens.  This is the main use of the identifier in real life. </p><p>  To find out the TIN of an individual absolutely free and without registration, the user can use the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation.  Here is the service "Find out your TIN".  It works just like "Public Services".  But in this case there is no need to register a separate profile. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipshnik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Government services and TIN check" class="if uuid-2314680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314680.jpg"></div><p>  The action algorithm comes down to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Visit nalog.ru page. </li><li>  Open the "Services" block. </li><li>  Click on the button "Find out your TIN". </li><li>  Fill in all the fields that appear on the screen. </li><li>  Click on the "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Just a couple of seconds - and the user will see a tax ID.  With its help, it will be possible to find out tax debts, as well as pay them off.  Everything is extremely simple and clear. </p><h2>  Personal visits </h2><p>  But that is not all.  The TIN of an individual is invited to find out directly at the local authority of the Federal Tax Service.  This is not the most common scenario.  Obtaining information on third parties in this way does not work.  This fact will have to be taken into account by all citizens. </p><p>  In general, the applicant needs: </p><ol><li>  Take your passport with you.  It is advisable to have a certificate of registration. </li><li>  Contact the Federal Tax Service at the place of registration. </li><li>  Inform employees of their intentions. </li></ol><p>  Tax officers will tell the person his TIN.  Quite often, a citizen is offered to immediately issue a certificate of the established form.  If it is, but lost, the documentation can be restored. </p><p>  As already mentioned, third parties cannot get a taxpayer identifier.  But this is possible if the applicant has the passport details of the person.  Fraudsters often use this particular technique to accomplish the task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipshnik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find out your TIN" class="if uuid-2314681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314681.jpg"></div><h2>  Tax Search </h2><p>  Taxes on the TIN of an individual are easier to find out than it seems.  In Russia today you can use the following services: </p><ul><li>  electronic wallets; </li><li>  "Government services"; </li><li>  website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation ("Personal Account" of the taxpayer); </li><li>  Internet banking; </li><li>  service "Payment of government services". </li></ul><p>  In all these cases, it is enough to log into the appropriate service, then indicate the taxpayer ID and wait for the scan results. </p><p>  The simplest layouts are the use of "State Services" and "Personal Account" of the taxpayer.  Taxes on the TIN of an individual will be displayed in the "LC" after authorization on the relevant sites. </p><h2>  Payment by ID </h2><p>  Now a few words about how to pay tax debt.  This is not the most difficult task.  Especially if the citizen already has an individual identifier. </p><p>  Debt by TIN of an individual is checked quickly.  It is proposed to repay it through all the debt verification services listed above.  Additionally, you can pay tax through ATMs or terminals. </p><p>  Consider the procedure for paying off TIN debt of an individual through online wallets.  In order to implement the task, you need: </p><ol><li>  Log in to your online wallet. </li><li>  Open "Goods, services". </li><li>  Click on the "Taxes" or "Tax Search" button.  Captions may vary depending on the payment system used. </li><li>  Indicate citizen ID. </li><li>  Click on the button that searches for data. </li><li>  Select a specific payment on the screen. </li><li>  Click on the "Pay" button. </li><li>  Confirm the transaction by first examining the payment details. </li></ol><p>  You don‚Äôt have to do anything else.  In a few days, the transaction will be processed by the tax office. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Checking the TIN of an individual in Russia is much simpler than it seems.  Every modern person can cope with the task.  It is enough to follow the instructions listed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yurface.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Certificate TIN" class="if uuid-2314683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2314683.jpg"></div><p>  Having decided to check the TIN of an individual, you will need to have passport information of the person.  Then the task will cause a minimum of trouble.  And even a person who is poorly versed in paperwork will be able to bring the idea to life.  The main thing is to remember that it is absolutely free to find out the TIN of an individual.  You do not need to pay for this service under any circumstances. </p>
