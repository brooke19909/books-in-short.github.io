    <h2>  Didim </h2><p>  This town itself is not a resort, but rather a tour.  If you are staying in Turkey on the coast of the Aegean, then you are sure to come here to at least see two things.  This is the main local beach Altinkum (Golden Sands) and a huge temple of Apollo, built in the eighth century BC.  Its ruins neither in size nor in antiquity are inferior to other famous structures of antiquity that are nearby.  For example, the <span>temple of Artemis of</span> Ephesus.  At the same time, the local sanctuary of Apollo is in much better condition.  Here you can also see the ruins of the stadium where the Holy Games were held.  This temple in importance and preservation can only be compared with the <span>Delphic Oracle</span> in Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Buyuk anadolu didim resort 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/686883.jpg"></div>  There are not so many hotels in the district, but there are only two ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  One of them is Buyuk Anadolu Didim Resort 5. Didim modern is a little out of the way.  But once he stood on the so-called "Sacred Road" to Miletus and was famous throughout ancient Greece.  Do not forget that <span>Asia Minor</span> was the birthplace of European philosophy.

He has a beautiful and well-groomed territory.  Tourists take there most of the photos that are posted on the network.  Stylish building, decent rooms.  Nice beach, comfortable sunbeds, gentle entry for children.  Clean, cleaned every day.  The food is excellent, quality, and everyone needs it.  Friendly staff - not a single request remains unfulfilled.  The animation at the hotel is amazing, especially for the kids.  Many locals rest here, so no one gets drunk or screams at night.  True, the hotel is in a quiet place, so young people who will not have enough local discos will find it difficult to find entertainment.  Experienced tourists recommend it for couples, lovers of nature and solitude, as well as romantic lovers.
