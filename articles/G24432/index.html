    <p>  The third Leningrad partisan brigade operated in the Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod and Tver (then Kalinin) regions.  The dense forests, many lakes and marshland helped the partisans to hide safely, to deliver sudden attacks on the enemy, who could not answer them with tanks or heavy artillery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Before the advent of the Third Leningrad partisan brigade, fascists reigned in these parts.  Invaders robbed local residents, mocked them, intimidated and executed.  The story of the hero of partisan Herman began with the fact that he, along with his people, inflicted a number of crushing blows on the enemy.  In record time and with minimal human losses, nine German garrisons, fifty administrative boards were crushed, five Hitler echelons were derailed, which killed a lot of enemy manpower and equipment. </p><p>  Such successes inspired not only the partisans, but also the locals, many of whom began to enter the German squad.  Soon the number of his brigade increased from 100 to 450 people, by the end of 1942 there were already more than 1000 partisans, and in the autumn of 1943 - 2500 people!  It was already a truly formidable force, the stronghold and soul of which was the hero of the Second World War German Alexander Viktorovich. </p><h2>  Achievements during the war </h2>

    <p>  German partisan detachments liberated hundreds of settlements in the Novgorod, Pskov and Tver regions.  Places in the district of the cities of Staraya Russa, Bottom and Bezhanitsy began to be called the Partisan Territory. </p><p>  The hero of the article was one of the first to apply tactics of quick maneuvers and rapid raids.  During their activities, Germanic heroes: </p><ul><li>  exterminated, according to documents, 9652 Germans and many more documented enemies not confirmed, </li><li>  organized 44 successful train wrecks, in which the enemy lost a lot of equipment and manpower, </li><li>  blew up 31 <span>railway bridges</span> , </li><li>  burned hundreds of enemy warehouses, </li><li>  destroyed 70 volost administrations, </li><li>  defeated 17 Nazi garrisons, </li><li>  35 thousand Soviet citizens were saved from captivity and hijacking into slavery. </li></ul><p>  Partisan German Alexander Viktorovich, together with his fighters, performed many feats, their activities were marked by many awards.  Herman was awarded the rank of colonel. </p><h2>  A capital base is equipped behind enemy lines </h2><p>  In addition to outstanding fighting qualities and strategic talents, the partisans Herman, whose history is described in the article, also had the gift of a business executive. </p><p>  It has already been mentioned that he treasured every human life entrusted to him by the highest military command.  He was also worried about arranging the life of his soldiers as comfortably as possible, so that after tiring outings the soldiers could fully rest, and in case of injury get the necessary medical help.  Therefore, having settled in the forest, German partisans settled down completely unconventionally: they lived with minimal but necessary amenities on a stationary base - in heated barracks, the headquarters was located in a capital building, kitchens, saunas, a medical center were built on the territory of the brigade mini-hospital, warehouses. </p><p>  Partizan German was convinced that nothing should be destroyed from what could help his soldiers defeat the Nazis.  Therefore, uniforms and weapons came not only from the mainland, but also replenished at the expense of trophies. </p><p>  The partisans appreciated such care and said of him: "We will not be lost with our commander!", "We are behind the brigade commander - into fire and water!" </p><h2>  Existing airdrome and railway </h2>

    <p>  They are surprising in themselves, and two more facts sound implausible: partisan German, whose photos demonstrate his open, bold look, built a real airfield on his base and mastered the railway! </p><p>  A stationary airfield was built by the same partisans.  A wide logging hole was cut in the forest, anti-aircraft calculations were made, the runway with warning posts was equipped according to all the rules, and infrastructure was created to receive large transport aircraft.  Communication with the mainland was established.  The partisans immediately responded with attacks to enemy attempts to destroy the airfield.  So Hitler's oil base in the city of Porkhov, German air depots in the village of Pushkin Mountains were destroyed.  As a result, throughout the entire existence of the partisan base, Soviet planes flew there regularly, supplying uniforms, food, ammunition, taking the wounded. </p><p>  An interesting story happened with the railway.  In one of the reconnaissance sorties, German soldiers found a narrow-gauge peat railway with an abandoned steam locomotive, wagons and platforms.  Upon closer examination, it turned out that everything was in working order, and the partisans began to actively use the narrow gauge railway under the Nazis‚Äôs nose.  The railway passed mainly through the marshland.  Only one of its sections was approaching Podsevy station, which was controlled by the Germans.  The partisans each time, if necessary, to go through this section, arranged shelling of the station, and the train each time safely passed the obstacle. </p><h2>  Attempts to destroy the squad </h2><p>  Do not think that the partisan German, along with his fighters, calmly fought behind enemy lines.  The Nazis all the time made attempts to destroy this brigade. </p><p>  In March 1943, a large-scale punitive operation was conducted against 4,000 German soldiers and officers, reinforced by tanks and artillery, against German partisan detachments.  The battlefield was the village of Rovnyak in the Porkhov district of the Pskov region.  During the battles more than 900 fascists were killed, 3 enemy echelons were destroyed, 4 highway bridges were blown up, 6 tanks were destroyed.  In contrast to the significant losses of the Nazis, the partisan German brigade lost 96 fighters, of which 37 were killed and 59 wounded. </p><p>  In May 1943, desiring to end the partisans in the Leningrad forests, the Germans threw a whole rifle division at them.  In total, Soviet heroes survived 19 battles, during which the enemy lost 1,604 soldiers and officers, 7 echelons, 16 highway bridges and 2 cars were blown up.  In the ranks of the partisans, 39 fighters were killed and 64 wounded. </p><p>  In August 1943, a well-known specialist was invited to these parts, who destroyed many partisan detachments near Smolensk.  This was immediately notified by his scouts to partisans German.  Who is it?  How does this mysterious specialist work?  The reconnaissance group was able to establish that the Nazi expert acts as follows: they remove clothing and shoes from captured Soviet soldiers, give sniff to trained dogs, which take a trace and take punishers to the partisan‚Äôs location.  Moreover, neither sprinkling the path with shag, nor trampling the road with other people could knock the dogs off the track.  Having received this data, Alexander German immediately came up with an original plan.  His people captured the "language", which was taken to the headquarters by a secret path through the swamps, then organized his escape, and mined the trail.  When the Germans advanced in a large detachment along this road to the headquarters of the partisans, the mines naturally exploded, and the entire fascist detachment perished without a single shot from our side. </p><h2>  The battle under the granary.
