    <h2>  The tax base </h2><p>  How is the corporate income tax calculated?  The tax rate is multiplied by the difference between revenues and expenses.  If the amount of revenue is less than the amount of costs, then the base is zero.  Profit is determined on an accrual basis from the beginning of the calendar year.  Since the legislation spells out certain types of corporate income tax rates, income must be considered separately for each type of activity. </p><p>  The Tax Code defines the specifics of determining income and expenses for different categories of payers: banks <span>(st. 290-292),</span> insurance companies (st. 293), non-state pension funds (st. 295), microfinance organizations (st. 297), professional participants of the RZB ( Art. 299), transactions with the Central Bank (Art. 280), urgent financial transactions (Art. 305), clearing organizations (Art. 299).  Gambling organizations keep separate records of revenues and costs.  Only economically viable expenses are considered, which are documented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is the corporate income tax rate? </h2><p>  The amount of the fee paid is transferred to the federal and local budgets.  Since 2017, there have been changes in the distribution of interest.  The basic corporate income tax rate has not changed and amounts to 20%.  Previously, 2% of the amount paid went to the federal budget, and 18% remained in the local budget.  From 2017 to 2020, a new scheme was introduced.  The amount of tax calculated at the rate of 3% will be transferred to the federal budget, and 17% to the budget of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.  Regional authorities may reduce the collection rate for certain categories of payers.  In 2017-2020, it cannot be less than 12.5%. </p>

    <h2>  Reporting </h2><p>  At the end of each tax period, the organization must submit a <span>declaration</span> to the <span>Federal Tax Service.</span>  The form of the report and the rules for its preparation are approved by Order of the Federal Tax Service N MMV-7-3 / 600.  The declaration is submitted to the inspection at the location of the enterprise or its unit.  The report is submitted in paper form.  The largest taxpayers can submit an electronic declaration, as well as organizations in which the average number of employees for the previous year was more than 100 people. </p><h2>  2017 tax changes </h2><p>  The amount of the provision for doubtful debts should be less than 10% of revenue for the previous or reporting period.  Doubtful debt is debt that exceeds the amount of a counter obligation.  If the organization has accounts receivable and payable to one counterparty, then only an amount in excess of accounts payable can be written off to doubtful debts. </p><p>  The amount of loss carried forward is limited.  From 01/01/2017 to 12/31/2020, it is impossible to reduce losses of previous periods by more than 50%.  This change does not affect the base to which tax incentives apply.  The changes relate to losses incurred after 01.01.2007. </p>

    <p>  Since 2017, the restriction on the transfer of the amount of losses incurred after 01/01/2007 has been lifted.  The transfer can now be carried out for all subsequent years.  Changes regarding the adjustment of taxes paid to the state and local budgets should be reflected in the declaration and payments.  These documents must clearly reflect what amounts are paid at a rate of 3%, and which at a rate of 17%. </p><p>  The reasons for the recognition of consolidated debt has become more.  For example, there are two interdependent foreign organizations (one of the organizations is the founder of the second).  Before one of them, a Russian company had a debt obligation.  In this case, the debt is recognized as consolidated.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what share of capital a foreign lender owns.  Now the consolidated debt is determined by the size of all taxpayer obligations. </p><p>  If the capitalization coefficient has changed during the reporting period, then the question may arise about adjusting the tax base.  Since 2017, the costs of controlled debt do not need to be restated.  As mentioned earlier, the costs incurred may include the costs incurred in assessing the qualifications of employees.  In order to stimulate the conduct of such inspections, provisions will be developed on the accounting of valuation costs.  The company will be able to take into account the costs if the assessment was carried out on the basis of a service agreement, and an employment contract was concluded with the subject. </p>

    <p>  The procedure for calculating tax penalties has been changed, and the amount of penalties has been increased.  The changes relate to delays that arise after 10/01/2017.  If you overdue the tax payment period by more than 30 days, then the amount of interest will have to be calculated using the following algorithm: </p><ul><li>  1/300 rate of the Central Bank, valid from 1 to 30 days of delay; </li><li>  1/150 of the Central Bank rate effective from the 31 day of delay. </li></ul><p>  In the case of repayment of all arrears before 10/01/2017, the number of days of delay does not matter. </p>
