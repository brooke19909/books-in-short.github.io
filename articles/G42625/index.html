    <p>  When issuing cash, first of all, bank employees pay attention to the size of the client‚Äôs income.  Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a certificate confirming the amount of wages, as well as the availability of a permanent place of work. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the salary should exceed the monthly loan payment by 2 times.  If you need to get a <span>loan from Sberbank</span> without collateral, then such a client must be no more than 65 years old.  However, there is no need to provide a guarantor.  This is only necessary if the borrower is over 65 years old.  But in this situation, he must fully pay his debt before the 75th birthday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mortgage loans </h2><p>  This type of lending to the population is also relevant today.  In order to receive money, you must make an initial payment, which amounts to a certain percentage of the total cost of the selected apartment. </p><p>  You can use maternity capital as an initial payment.  Mortgage lending is provided for the purchase of residential space in new buildings, as well as for the purchase of an apartment in the secondary market.  In addition, you can take money for the construction of your country house. </p><h2>  Security loans </h2><p>  This type of lending is designed for those citizens who require large amounts.  In this case, the property owned by the client acts as a pledge.  Such loans are divided into 2 categories: mortgage and consumer.  In this case, funds can be used for any purpose. </p>

    <p>  However, the maximum possible loan amount is usually not more than 1 million rubles, and the debt repayment period should not exceed 20 years. </p><h2>  Lending terms for individuals at Sberbank of Russia </h2><p>  If we are talking about housing and consumer loans, then there are certain requirements for borrowers. </p><p>  The loan is issued exclusively in national currency.

    <h2>  Interest rates on loans to individuals in Sberbank in 2017 </h2><p>  While almost all banks increase their interest <span>rates, Sberbank</span> went to meet their clients.  In February of this year, interest was lowered.  Moreover, the recalculation of base rates was made exclusively for bank customers.  According to these changes, it is possible to calculate the most profitable period of consumer lending.  You can also always use the online service.  Using a loan calculator from Sberbank, it is very easy to calculate a consumer loan. </p><p>  It is most advantageous to take funds for up to 2 years.  In this case, the basic rate on a consumer loan will be from 12.9%.  Overpayment for housing loans will be 10.25%. </p><p>  If you fill out an application online, then the overpayment will be reduced by another 1%. </p><h2>  Features of lending to individuals </h2><p>  Today in Sberbank, as in most financial institutions, there are special preferential terms on loans. </p><p>  First of all, these programs concern young families in which at least 3 children are growing.  In this case, they may receive a lower interest rate.  Also, participants in these programs are allowed to receive additional subsidies from local governments. </p>

    <p>  In addition, there are preferential conditions for working and non-working pensioners. </p><h2>  Loans without references and guarantors </h2><p>  As with any bank, the solvency of any potential customer is checked at Sberbank.  To do this, all documents provided by the borrower must be considered at the head office of the credit organization.  If a citizen cannot confirm his solvency, then in this case he must provide a guarantor. </p><p>  However, if everything is in order with the documents and he has been working continuously for a long time, then the loan will be approved.  Nevertheless, some clients for one reason or another do not want to provide information.  In this case, you really can not bring a package of documents, but the down payment should be more than 50% of the purchased property. </p><h2>  Conditions for Salary Card Holders </h2><p>  Sberbank has benefits for those customers who are already holders of salary or pension cards.  In this case, in order to get a loan at the bank, it is enough to provide only 1 document - a passport. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, applications are considered within a few hours, and the loan amount can range from 15 thousand rubles to 200 thousand rubles.  In this case, the base rate will be minimal. </p><h2>  Conditions for retirees </h2><p>  This question is also of interest to many.  In fact, in Sberbank, the terms of lending to individuals also apply to pensioners. </p><p>  If a citizen who is on a well-deserved rest is still continuing his career, he has the right to apply for a loan before the age of 75.  However, in this case, the presence of the guarantor is mandatory.  If this is not possible, then the loan is available only to those citizens who are not yet 65 years old.  For pensioners, the same benefits are provided as for clients holding salary cards. </p><h2>  What documents are required to obtain loans to individuals? </h2><p>  In order to get a consumer loan, standard documents are provided.  These include the borrower's passport, as well as a certificate confirming the availability of a permanent income and place of work. </p><p>  If we are talking about mortgage lending, it is also necessary to bring documents confirming the ownership of property to the department of lending to individuals of Sberbank, as well as paper for housing, which the borrower plans to purchase. </p><h2>  What is the procedure for issuing and repaying a loan? </h2><p>  The procedure for obtaining a loan and its repayment is extremely simple.  First of all, you need to apply for a loan in the official branch of the bank or via the Internet.  Moreover, under the terms of lending to individuals, Sberbank provides the necessary package of documents and signs the corresponding application. </p><p>  After that, the bank transfers all the data to the main office, where the application is considered.  If the client is not yet the holder of the bank's salary card, then consideration of the loan issuance takes from 2 to 6 days. </p>

    <p>  For payroll clients, this time period is reduced to 2 hours.  After confirming the application, the client must come to the bank and sign the corresponding loan agreement.  At the next stage, he will be given money either in cash or transferred to a previously issued credit card. </p><p>  No fees are provided for this procedure.  After that, the borrower is provided with a schedule according to which he must make monthly payments in order to fully repay the loan.  Money is paid monthly, usually in equal installments.  At the same time, there is the possibility of early repayment of the loan.  However, this issue needs to be clarified before signing the contract. </p>
