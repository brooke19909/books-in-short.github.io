  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How many Disneylands in the world where they are</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Needless to say, Disneyland has been and remains one of the most popular tourist destinations.  Both children and adults always walk with incredible enthusiasm through the fabulous towns of an amusement park.  Let's see how many Disneylands in the world and where they are located. </p><h2>  Disneyland Hong Kong </h2><p>  Disneyland in Hong Kong can be called one of the youngest fabulous parks in the world.  First of all, it is designed for children, so if you are a big fan of extreme entertainment in the form of high-speed attractions, then you will be bored here.  But this does not mean that the park is quiet and calm.  A huge number of bright shows, performances and games are held throughout the working day.  It is best to come here with children. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the park is for children, the queues for tickets can sometimes be quite large, especially at weekends, therefore, if possible, it is best to come to the park on weekdays or in the afternoon.  The park is open from 10:00 to 21:00, but it is best to check the opening hours on the official website before visiting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getyourguide.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Hong Kong" class="if uuid-3213371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3213371.jpg"></div><h2>  Disneyland Paris </h2><p>  Not many travelers know how many Disneylands are there in the world.  But what Paris is the most popular and favorite, everyone knowsÔºÅ </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About 12 million tourists come to the Parisian fairytale park every year.  With such popularity in Paris, only the Notre Dame Cathedral can be compared.  This amusement park opened back in 1992, but overtook the popularity of its older brother, a park that is located in the United States. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe amusement park is about two thousand hectares, and in this vast territory there are four zones: DisneyPark, DisneyStudio, DisneyHotels and DisneyVillage.  Each park has its own theme, and if DisneyPark is designed for kids, then the rest of the parks will have something for adults to do.  Attractions of varying degrees of difficulty, quests, vibrant shows, entertainment for every taste. </p><p>  When visiting the park, you need to keep in mind that all tickets are divided into several categories: mini, magic and super-magic.  Tickets can be bought both at the box office and online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="disneyparks.disney.go.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Paris" class="if uuid-3213369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3213369.jpg"></div><p>  So, how much are tickets to Disneyland Paris.  Children from three to twelve years old are provided with a children's ticket at a price of 40 euros - for a mini, 52 euros - for a magic and 62 euros for a super-magic.  For children over 12 years old and adults tickets will cost at the following prices: 47 euros for a mini, 59 euros for a magic and 75 euros for a super-magic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All tickets can be bought at the box office, online or at specialized gift shops in the park.  Remember that online tickets must be printed in advance. </p><h2>  Disneyland Tokyo </h2><p>  Japan also has its own Disneyland, not inferior in size and quantity of entertainment to other parks.  About 30 million people visit this park annually.  In any weather and day of the week there are a lot of people. </p><p>  The park is divided into seven main zones, which host about forty attractions, as well as restaurants and souvenir shops.  A parade of all Disney characters is held several times a day.  They sing, dance and fly, creating an amazing sight.  However, in order to get to the show, you must book your visit in advance. </p><p>  At Disneyland Tokyo, there are special vending machines for selling tickets for rides on which the time is indicated.  This is a great option that helps to use time wisely and not stand in lines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tokyodisneyresort.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Tokyo" class="if uuid-3213372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3213372.jpg"></div><h2>  Disneyland at sea </h2><p>  In addition to the classic amusement park, Tokyo has one more, in Chiba.  The theme of this park is connected exclusively with sea heroes and travels, therefore all shows and performances are connected with the sea.  There are also seven zones: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Mediterranean </li><li>  lagoon of mermaids; </li><li>  Mysterious Island; </li><li>  lost in a river delta; </li><li>  the Arabian coast; </li><li>  american waterfront; </li><li>  port Discovery. </li></ul><p>  It is noteworthy that the park is located by the sea, but this does not make it less popular.  About 15 million tourists from all over the world come here annually. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tokyodisneyresort.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland show" class="if uuid-3213373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3213373.jpg"></div><h2>  Disneyland Florida </h2><p>  The most popular and coveted entertainment area on the planet is Walt Disney World in the US state of Florida.  All kinds of amusement parks, restaurant areas, hotels, golf courses and souvenir shops are located on the territory of one hundred square kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park in Orlando" class="if uuid-3213360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3213360.jpg"></div><p>  Disneyland in the United States, Orlando, consists of four thematic and two water parks with its own infrastructure.  It is not possible to go around all the gaming and entertainment areas in one or even three days, so tourists usually book hotels directly in the park so as not to waste precious time on the road. </p><p>  Walt Disney conceived a huge world of entertainment back in 1959.  This was the second park, since the first was already opened in 1955 in the state of California.  Unfortunately, Walt was not destined to see the final.  Construction was completed by his brother, and named the park after Walt Disney. </p><p>  The amusement park is open from 9:00 to 21:00 local time, but before visiting, you should check the time on the official website, since each zone can work in different ways.  Ticket prices start at $ 114 and depend on the zones you want to visit. </p><h2>  Disneyland California </h2><p>  How many Disneylands in the world and in what parts of the world they are located, perhaps not everyone knows.  But the fact that only in America there are two of them is known by many.  The world's first Disney amusement park was built in 1955 in Anaheim, California. </p><div class="photo" data-original="babiestravellite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="park in america" class="if uuid-3213362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3213362.jpg"></div><p>  This park has eight thematic zones and about 55 types of attractions.  The device of this particular park was copied by all the other Disneyland parks.  There is something to see here.  In addition to daytime shows, quests and performances, you should pay attention to the stunning evening light shows that will not only appeal to children, but also delight adults. </p><h2>  Russian Disneyland </h2><p>  Several years ago, Moscow authorities decided to build up the Nagatinskaya floodplain.  The place was not chosen by chance: in a territory of several hectares a magnificent park will be planted, more than three thousand trees will be planted, entertainment grounds and attractions will be installed.  This project is called "Russian Disneyland", as the park will not be equal in scale and intensity of events.  The first visitors are planned to be received in 2019.  Prices at Disneyland in Moscow also promise affordable. </p><h2>  Disneyland Epcot </h2><p>  Epcot is an American Disneyland park located in Orlando.  However, many distinguish it into a completely separate Disneyland, as the theme of this park is based on various scientific discoveries, physical laws and future technologies.  The park has been operating since 1983 and is considered one of the oldest.  Despite this, the zone stably holds the third place in attendance among all the parks in America. </p><p>  Walt Disney has always said that this place will become a kind of prototype of the city of the future, an ideal community where technologies will be available to every resident of the city.  But the park in the form in which its creator had conceived, did not appear.  Instead, state leadership built a conceptual area called Reedy Creek.  As such, there is no special theme in the park.  Over time, its creators gave it a form of a world exhibition, where cultures from all over the world are represented in equal parts.  It is considered a separate park and include it in response to the question, how many Disneylands in the world. </p><p>  The park consists of two zones: "Showcase of the Future" and "Future World".  Both zones are built in the original hourglass shape.  The Future World Pavilion focuses on technology development.  Even the rides are named according to the theme.  For example, Spaceship Earth or Mission: Space.  In the "Showcases of the Future" halls, special pavilions are organized that represent eleven countries: Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, the USA, Morocco, Japan, France, Canada and England. </p>
