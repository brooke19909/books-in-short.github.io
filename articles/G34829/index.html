What to do to unlock?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Often MTS clients can hear: "Number is blocked."  What to do in this case?  How to unlock a sim card?  And in general, can this be done?  In fact, it will not be possible to unequivocally answer the questions posed.  Indeed, a lot depends on why the SIM card was blocked.  In some cases, you will have to come to terms with the fact that it will not work to return the room‚Äôs functionality.  Only most often to solve the emerging problems is quite simple and easy.  What exactly should I do if the subscriber hears "The number you dialed is blocked"?  Or when the caller is informed that his SIM card is blocked by the system? </p><h2>  Chimes </h2><p>  It has already been said that a lot depends on the situation.  To begin with, it is worth considering a fairly common case - when it comes to situations in which you can hear from MTS: <span>"The number is temporarily</span> blocked."  What to do? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay number is blocked what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458206.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is recommended to repeat the call several times.  If the message is repeated, then it is required to inform the interlocutor in any way.  And already he will solve the problem associated with blocking.  Until this moment, <span>it</span> will <span>not</span> work to reach the <span>subscriber</span> . </p><h2>  Pin </h2><p>  The following situation is the inability to work with the number due to the incorrect entry of the pin code.  In the modern world is extremely rare.  Does the MTS subscriber have a number blocked?  What to do? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only solution here is to use the PUK code.  If the PIN code was entered incorrectly, then the ‚ÄúPUK‚Äù will help restore access to the SIM card.  Usually this data is available on the card to which the SIM card was attached.  Nothing special.  Problems will be when this card is lost. </p><p>  Accordingly, at the request of the phone, a PUK-code is entered, then a new PIN is invented and repeated.  So access to the number will be restored.  And you can use the SIM card further without any problems. </p>

    <h2>  Office </h2><p>  Have MTS subscribers blocked their number?  What to do in this case?  There is one good trick that will solve the problem.  In particular, if the subscriber used the "Voluntary blocking" service.  Within six months, you can get your number back.  How exactly? </p><p>  This is done easily and simply.  If the subscriber has thought about how to unlock the MTS phone number, it is recommended that you contact your nearest office with an identification card.  What for?  To write an application of a standard form for the restoration of a SIM card and unlocking a number.  Problems can arise if the SIM card is not framed by a real user. </p><p>  Nevertheless, if a user of MTS has had a lock for one reason or another, you can solve the problem in the office.  As already mentioned, by writing an application to restore access to the number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Calls </h2><p>  Does the MTS subscriber have a number blocked?  What to do in this case?  You can try to unlock it by contacting the operator.  It is enough to communicate your intention, as well as give personal data.  Actual for situations in which "Voluntary blocking" takes place. </p><p>  To call the MTS operator, it is necessary to dial 0890 on mobile devices. The call is free.  But for callers from landline numbers, the combination is changing.  And then you have to dial 8 800 250 08 90. </p><p>  In any case, this is another way to solve the problem.  It should be noted that the help of certain services is not always required.  In some situations, subscribers are able to independently solve the problem.  But how exactly?  What unlocking methods are relevant for MTS today?  Of course, with the exception of all the previously listed methods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if mts phone number is blocked" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458208.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  What to do if a phone number is blocked?  MTS offers another relatively new method for solving the problem.  Which one?  We are talking about using the "Personal Account" on the official website of MTS. </p><p>  If the number was blocked, then you will have to follow the following algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Register on the MTS website.  It is advisable to do this in advance.  Quite often, blocked numbers cannot be registered in the system. </li><li>  Pass authorization in the "My Account" on the official page of the mobile operator. </li><li>  Go to the menu "Number Management" - "Block".  An ‚Äúassistant‚Äù will appear on the screen.  Following his instructions, you can quickly unlock the number. </li></ol><p>  Accordingly, nothing more will need to be done.  Usually to unlock, just select the appropriate menu item and confirm the action.  Now it‚Äôs not so scary if it turns out that the MTS subscriber has a blocked number.  What to do in this case?  Already found out, but with all this it is worth considering a few more situations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay number is temporarily blocked what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1458209.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Have not used for a long time </h2><p>  All the previously listed methods are relevant for blocking that occurred as a result of using the "Voluntary blocking" service.  Sometimes the operator himself does not allow using one or another number.  For example, with a long "idle" phone.  That is, when the number is not used for a while. </p><p>  From the moment of blocking, the subscriber will have 6 months to return the number to himself.  It is best to write a statement of the established form and contact him at the MTS office.  If more time has passed, you won‚Äôt be able to restore the SIM card.  Such rules apply to all mobile operators.  In other words, if the number has not been used for about six months, it is removed from the active ones.  Therefore, do not forget about working with certain SIM cards at least once every six months. </p><h2>  Balance </h2><p>  The last and most common option is blocking due to a negative balance.  It is in such cases that the easiest way to solve the problem.  How exactly?  Simply replenish the balance of the SIM card.  To what extent?  Either to zero balance, or to positive.  Enough will be even 1 penny "in the black." </p>

    <p>  Account replenishment is made by any available and known method.  For example, via the Internet or payment terminals.  As soon as the funds arrive at the indicated blocked number, it will be unlocked. </p><p>  When blocking, many recommend calling the operator.  It is he who can clarify the reason why the service of the SIM card is suspended. </p>
