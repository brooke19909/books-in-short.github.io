    <p>  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 20 hectares, within the city limits, ‚ÄúCherlenny Yar‚Äù - a safari park (Voronezh).  His address: the village of Semiluksky Vyselki, 2a Smorodinovaya street, stop "Plotina". </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Back in 2009, this part of the land went into the ownership of the A. Popov Zoo, when they decided to equip a subsidiary farm there.  Over time, management plans have changed, after it became clear that animals lack space, communication with nature.  Then it was decided to give the animals more freedom and settle in the natural habitat.  With the beginning of the first construction work, animals gradually began to arrive here.  Now, various species of animals have settled in this pine forest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  "Red Yar" (safari park) is located in a historical place that was on these lands a couple of centuries ago.  It is here that on the hill there is a confluence of two rivers - Voronezh and Don.  It was then called Wild Field, and on its expanses there was a chronicle place - Red Scarlet.  In connection with this legend, the administration of the future park did not think very long about the name of its new zooproject.  The menagerie began its work in June 2015, and the grand opening was in October and timed to the Day of the Protection of Animals. </p><h2>  Animal habitat </h2><p>  Safari Park (Voronezh) is a modern zoo nursery, which is equipped with everything necessary for the maintenance, treatment and breeding of rare, endangered species of wild animals.  Here, animals are allocated large spacious areas for walking and arranging their housing.  The natural conditions created for them are completely close to the natural ones: fields, meadows, ponds, greens, trees, flowers. </p>

    <p>  One indicator that our smaller brothers live well here is the appearance of their offspring.  Another function that the staff sets itself is to preserve endangered species of animals.  The zoo administration fully copes with these responsibilities.  As a result, it can be judged that the animals really like it, and they feel very comfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Walk in the country </h2><p>  Having left the route: Voronezh - safari park, you will cover the distance in just 20 minutes when driving your own car or ordering a minibus. </p><p>  Upon arrival, you just have to get out of the car, you will be charmed: the cleanest air, birds singing, insects chirping, frogs croaking on the shore of a reservoir and lizards quickly moving in the grass. </p><p>  At the entrance there is a large gate and, of course, a security guard who will cordially open before you the entrance to the safari park (Voronezh).  The whole journey begins with an <span>ecological trail,</span> which has its own name - "Tiguli".  It represents a track laid out of boards, and runs throughout the territory.  Its length is more than a kilometer.  This is done for the convenience of guests traveling through the forest so that they do not get off the route and do not get lost. </p>

    <p>  On the enclosures with animals there are signs on which informative information for tourists is placed.  Guests are also allowed to feed animals, but products must be taken from home: carrots, cabbage, apples. </p><p>  For almost a year of its work, the menagerie has become a popular place for families.  Tourists come to the city of Voronezh from all over the region.  Safari Park has become a successful zoo nursery project in the open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Animals </h2><p>  Locals of the park are in special enclosures, there are more than 11 species of animals, but over time it is planned to expand the collection.  So, the first to open the tour is a corral with <span>mountain rams,</span> or mouflons, which constantly beg visitors for goodies.  Then comes the family of Tibetan yaks, formidable bison, wild boars with mischievous offspring, nutria, <span>Cameroonian goats.</span>  There are also horses, several small funny donkeys, and a surprisingly beautiful <span>sika deer.</span>  In addition, here you can find a rare reindeer, whose horns are covered with wool. </p>

    <p>  In a separate zone called the ‚ÄúBird's yard‚Äù, domesticated birds ‚Äî males and chickens ‚Äî settled.  And while walking in the park, you will surely meet beavers living on the banks of a reservoir, squirrels, marten, and hedgehogs.  You can also see graceful swans, white storks, ducks, mallards, jays, lake gulls.  All these animals settled in a pine forest and complement the overall picture of the nursery. </p><p>  On the solemn day of the opening of the zoo, a female llama was brought here.  She was settled in a new pen with a male to create offspring. </p><h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  Have you decided to leave the bustling metropolis, its dusty, smoky streets, having left the city of Voronezh for a short while?  Safari Park "Red Yar" will provide you with the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of nature and the clean air of pine forest. </p><p>  Walking and seeing all the animals, you can visit a beautiful place, which is located on the shore of the reservoir under the name "Glade of stumps."  It is here that tourists like to come and arrange photo shoots with snags that are beautifully and unpretentiously scattered throughout the lawn. </p>

    <p>  The administration also took care of the entertainment for visiting guests.  Across the territory of the nursery there are places for rest or a snack - arbors with benches.  They are made of natural wood and fit very harmoniously into the surrounding landscape. </p><p>  The attraction is very famous here - the stupa of Baba Yaga, which has become a symbol of the park and gathers around itself a lot of people who want to take a picture against it.  In addition, here you can ride horses. </p><h2>  Weekend trip </h2><p>  Nowadays, the tourism business is developing very rapidly.  In order not to get bored at the weekend, you just have to decide where it is best to go.  A very good solution is a family trip to the safari park.  From Voronezh, you will not spend much time on the road, and the children will not get tired on the way, which will allow them to feel cheerful in nature. </p>

    <p>  When planning your trip, it is worth remembering that the zoo operates only three times a week: Friday, Saturday, Sunday - from 10 to 18 hours.  Children under seven years of age are free to enter.  Also in the cold season there are always happy to see guests. </p><h2>  Animal stories </h2><p>  The zoo staff tells curious guests very fascinating cases from the life of their wards.  So, a very complicated story in the Cameroonian goat family.  They have a real love triangle: no one knows who the female will choose, but the offspring is slowly growing up. </p><p>  But in the pen of the Tibetan yak dynasty, a complete family idyll reigns, and the baby grows up healthy, he loves to chew on hay. </p><p>  Terrible bison surround their heir with great care, love and attention.  The head of the family is always alert and does not allow outsiders to enter their territory.  At the slightest danger, he is ready to protect his cub. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Impressions of visitors are very positive.  I really like the large territory of the park, a picturesque place, beautiful and majestic pine trees, clean air, a pond.  I am glad that the administration took care of the guests and arranged relaxation places.  In the enclosures there is always order, animals are well-groomed. </p>

    <p>  Of course, if you want a larger walk in the open air zoo, then you should look for another route: Voronezh - safari park (Lipetsk region).  This place will certainly surprise you with its scope and the number of animal specimens represented in it.  Therefore, the only minus of the scarlet Yar nursery is the small number of animals represented.  However, this can not even be reproached, because it has just opened, and over time the number of its inhabitants will certainly increase. </p><p>  If you planned a weekend trip to the city of Voronezh, a safari park will be a very good choice for relaxation - you will be provided with a lot of impressions and emotions. </p>
