    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  All potential guests before choosing a hotel are interested in the issue of food.

By the way, it is worth noting one feature: daily in the dining area guests are <span>served a continental breakfast,</span> which will especially appeal to lovers of delicacies and culinary delights.  And the restaurant with the beautiful name Lydia, which offers stunning views of the expanse of the Ionian Sea, serves traditional and local cuisine. </p>

    <p>  In general, guests can try a lot of delicious and original dishes, and not only in the main restaurant.  The hotel has an <span>√† la carte</span> restaurant, a cozy cafe-bar called Bar Noire, as well as the Greek tavern Byzantino.  In addition, the hotel operates a service such as breakfast in the room.  And people who are used to eating in a special way can order dishes from the diet menu.  As you can see, nutrition issues are completely absent in this case.  In principle, as are the problems regarding its quality. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Many couples decide to take their child on vacation.  But in this case, they begin to be interested in a lot of questions: starting with whether it is possible to leave him with the nanny and ending with his placement.  So, it should be noted first of all the fact that if the child is not two years old, but he is placed free of charge on the crib, which is placed in the reserved room.  If you plan to come with a child whose age is from two to 13 years, then in this case he will live for free, only in a standard bed.  If he is more than 13, then he will have to pay 75% of the cost of living for one person for his placement.  A maximum of one apartment can accommodate one extra bed.  By the way, before you go on vacation, you should check with the hotel about this service, that is, confirm your intention to come with a child.  So that the administration has time to prepare an extra bed for arrival. </p><h2>  Special qualities </h2><p>  Hospitality is the quality that Greece is famous for all over the world.  Mabely Grand Hotel 5 * is not only a hotel with amazing quality of the services offered, it is also a place where each guest is treated carefully, with respect, trying to help him feel at home.  The only minus in the service, perhaps, is that the staff does not speak Russian.  But does it play a role when tourists are offered such a huge number of various services for every taste?  After all, you can even come to a hotel with your pet, and this is not permitted in every hotel.  Rather, it‚Äôs not enough where they can come with a cat or dog.  True, on this occasion, you must first arrange with the hotel, in the same way as in the case of an extra bed. </p>
