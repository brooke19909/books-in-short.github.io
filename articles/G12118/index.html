Then new unusual flagships entered the market - S6 and S6 Edge.  The version with curved edges of the display became the most popular, so in the first months, the developers did not have time to make up for the shortage of this model in store windows. </p><p>  The next year, the manufacturer decided not to hesitate with the release of a new phone, so S7 and S7 Edge immediately appeared.  This time the ‚Äúcouple‚Äù was more balanced, and therefore the plus version was not worth the wait. </p><p>  At the time of the release of the Galaxy S7 Edge, this model became the most popular in the world.  Pre-orders again showed that the buyer gives preference to curved screens.  In addition, the new smartphone was able to fix display problems.  What else has changed in the phone, we learn further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7 edge" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1421294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The new ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge‚Äù, the price of which at pre-sales amounted to about 60 thousand rubles, is supplied in a standard configuration for the company.  The box contains a charger with support for Fast Adaptive Charge and, accordingly, a USB cable.  There is also an instruction, a clip for a slot and headphones.  This kit is enough for any user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Comparing with last year's flagship S6 edge, it is noticeable that the brand new models immediately increased the diagonal of the display, so the Galaxy S7 Edge is no longer a smaller copy of its older brother, but a smartphone with the same dimensions. </p><p>  At first glance, there are no external changes.  But still, the developers finalized the sharp edge of the case, made it more curved.  Now smart has become more convenient to hold in your hand.  Its dimensions also increased slightly due to the new volumetric battery and durable finishing materials. </p><p>  The main changes that touched the flagship body are the return of the protective coating against water and dust.  Here is the familiar IP68 standard, which works stably, without any errors.  The phone is completely protected from dust and especially water.  It can be about half an hour at a depth of one meter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 edge Price" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1421419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I was also pleased that the case was saved from already boring ugly plugs.  All connectors are protected by a special membrane.  The new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, the price of which meets all expectations, has become a monopod.  Now you can get to the battery only in the service center.  The cover of the smartphone is glued with a special protective tape, which allows you to immerse the phone in water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Everything in its place </h2><p>  Basically, the design remained the same as before.  Of course, no frames can be found on the screen.  Above the display is a speaker, on the sides of it are sensors and a <span>front camera.</span>  The company logo flaunts right there.  Under the screen is a classic button. </p><p>  On the rear panel is the main camera with LED flash.  Under it was placed again the logo.  At the bottom of the case is a speaker, microphone, charger connector and a place for headphones.  At the top there is only a small hole in the additional microphone and a SIM card tray.  On the right side is the lock button, on the left volume rocker. </p><h2>  Unusual design solution </h2><p>  The new flagship screen did not become a sensation, but still continued to delight customers.  At Galaxy S7 Edge, the price depends on the <span>curved display.</span>  The rest of the smartphone is no different from its fellow S7. </p><p>  The resolution of the display has not changed, as in last year‚Äôs smartphone, Quad HD with a resolution of 2560x1440.  The screen is noticeably improved.  Increased the overall brightness margin.  The matrix remains the same - juicy and rich <span>AMOLED.</span>  <span>The display</span> is very high quality.  Black color looks ‚Äúcoal‚Äù, the contrast is balanced, and the brightness is comfortable both at night and at noon in the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new samsung galaxy s7 edge price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1421295.jpg" width="544"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the settings, you can adjust the screen display if AMOLED seems too artificial to someone.  There is a mode that allows you to adjust the color scheme, close to a more realistic one. </p><h2>  Energy costs </h2><p>  A special option, Always On, was presented at the press release, which looks really good.  It works as follows: when the user locks the device, the calendar, clock and some notifications are still displayed on the screen.  That is, the phone is still in partial activity.  The developers claimed that Always On spend only 1% of the charge per hour.  In practice, it turned out that the function is quite expensive for the energy of the smartphone.  If you turn it off, the phone will live 20-30% longer. </p><h2>  "Filling" </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, whose price fluctuates around 60 thousand rubles, received the top version of the operating system - Android 6.0.1.  He works in tandem with the already familiar TouchWiz.  In this model, the option is redone for the OS, so everything looks very harmonious and balanced. </p><p>  Given the cost of the device, you probably should not say that in the system you can find any errors or lags.  No brakes were observed, the OS ‚Äúflies‚Äù.  Thanks to the redesigned proprietary shell, the menu was assembled on one screen, which looks pretty concise.  ‚ÄúGoogle applications‚Äù and, of course, proprietary software were placed in a separate folder. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúMemorable‚Äù changes </h2><p>  Last year, the company decided to remove support for memory cards from all its flagships.  Most likely, such changes have occurred in the pursuit of fashion.  Then followed a series of mistakes.  It was decided to release smartphones on 32, 64 and 128 GB.  In practice, it turned out that it is almost impossible to find the latest version of the device.  Naturally, such problems could not go unnoticed. </p><p>  In 2016, microSD support was returned.  The situation with internal memory remained the same with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.  The price depends on the version of the device.  The most expensive is the 64 GB model. </p>

    <p>  Considering that you can now put microSD in your smartphone, the 64 GB version has become less popular.  By the way, the tray for the memory card and SIM card is combined.  The user can choose what he needs: two SIM cards or one, but paired with a memory card. </p><p>  "RAM" in the new flagship also became larger - 4 GB.  Naturally, such an improvement affected the operation of the phone. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The company changed its preferences and instead of the famous Qualcomm, the Exynos 8890 is located inside the smartphone. Fans were at first skeptical about replacing the processor, but, as various tests show, the 8-core device not only bypassed the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, but also noted moderate power consumption. </p><p>  Testing the new Mali-T880 graphics chipset also showed stunning results.  Compared with the previous version, this one has become "faster" by as much as 80%. </p><h2>  Activity </h2><p>  The new Galaxy S7 Edge has a powerful 3600 mAh battery.  Its autonomy shows excellent results, given the size of the display, performance indicators and multitasking.  The developer took care of excellent optimization, which allows you to save the device‚Äôs charge for a long time. </p><p>  Despite the new-fangled Type-C connectors, Samsung did not move away from the proven microUSB.  The kit includes a charger that allows you to power the phone from 0 to 100% in just 100 minutes.  There is also the possibility of wireless charging. </p><h2>  Pleasant trifles </h2><p>  At the time of the release of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, it was not found in Svyaznoy.  Which seriously disappointed fans, especially those who had been waiting for a new product with an amazing camera since the press release. </p>

    <p>  There is nothing special to say about the front.  Its resolution is 5 megapixels, it copes with its ‚Äúselfie‚Äù function perfectly.  Face correction, color change and correction of its geometry were added to the menu. </p><p>  But the main surprise was the appearance of the main camera at 12 megapixels.  At first, this news shocked fans, because the previous Samsung model had as much as 16 megapixels.  It turned out that a module from Sony IMX260 was specially developed for the company.  Its luminosity increased to 1.7, and the main "trick" was the change in pixel size to 1.4 microns.  Thus, the developers did not increase the number of pixels, but their size, which qualitatively affected the photo. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  At the beginning of the year, Galaxy S7 Edge became the most high-quality and powerful smartphone.  Outwardly, it has not changed much compared to the previous version, but many innovations have been placed inside it that have significantly improved the performance of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s7 edge connected" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1421426.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Beautiful design and quality materials - this is the first thing that catches your eye.  But behind the metal shell is a huge number of functions that make this smartphone the best on the market.  3600 mAh large battery.  High-quality camera module with an increased pixel size.  Switch to Exynos and an improved version of the graphics chipset. </p><p>  After entering the market, the model for some reason did not appear in the Svyaznoy store.  Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge can now be bought at a price of 40 to 70 thousand rubles.  It can be ordered both in China, at a low price, and purchased in the online store of any city and country. </p>
