    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to weave an angel‚Äôs heart out of elastic bands or an ordinary heart-pendant, choose for yourself.  The bracelet is easily made using a slingshot.  A double column machine is also suitable.  Weaving on the fingers is possible, but some actions are not very convenient to perform with one hand when the second is used as a working tool. </p><h2>  How to weave a bracelet made of elastic bands "Heart of an angel" (getting started) </h2><p>  This jewelry, consisting of a chain of openwork hearts, is not very difficult to make.  The sequence of work is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Put on both columns of the slingshot an elastic band of color No. 1, crossing it with a figure of eight. </li><li>  Put the second rubber band in color No. 2 on both horns without twisting, like all subsequent ones. </li><li>  Drop the first rubber band from the left column through the top to the middle. </li><li>  Move the top gum from right to left. </li><li>  Put another rubber band in color No. 2 on both horns without crossing. </li><li>  Remove the bottom loop from the right column through the top to the middle. </li><li>  Transfer the top loop from the left column to the right. </li><li>  Put a No. 1 elastic band on both horns. </li><li>  Drop from each horn the upper elastic band of color No. 2 loops to the middle. </li><li>  Put a rubber band of color No. 2 on both horns.  From this moment, a sequence of steps will be taken that will be repeated in the future until the desired length of the bracelet is obtained. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave an angel heart bracelet" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/984139.jpg" width="340"></div></h2><h2>  Bracelet weave pattern </h2><p>  The sequence given below is steps 1 through 8 and is repeated: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Drop the bottom loop from the left column to the middle, and then transfer the top from the right to the left. </li><li>  Put another rubber band in color No. 2 on both horns. </li><li>  Drop the bottom loop from the right column through the top to the middle, and transfer the top from the left to the right. </li><li>  Put on both horns an elastic band of color No. "1. </li><li>  Discard the upper loop of color No. 2 from the left column to the middle. </li><li>  Through the next loop of color No. 2, pull the hooked lower gum of color No. 1 and also discard it to the middle. </li><li>  Now you need to do the same with the right column.  Discard the top loop to the middle, and pull the bottom through the previous gum and discard also to the middle. </li><li>  Put on both horns again a rubber band of color No. 2. </li><li>  Discard the lower gum of color No. 2 on the left horn to the middle, and transfer the upper gum of color No. 2 from right to left.  You can assume that you know how to weave an angel heart bracelet from elastic bands.  After all, this step is already a similar course of a repeating sequence of actions. </li></ol><p>  When you reach the required length, you need to fix the bracelet.  Drop to the middle through the upper lower loops from both columns.  Put on an elastic band of matching color on both horns.  Remove the lower loops again to the middle, and transfer the remaining upper loop from the right column to the left.  Stretch a pair of elastic bands from the left column on both and carefully put on the clip-on clasp.  Fasten the second part of the clasp at the beginning of the bracelet. </p><p>  The product is completed. </p><h2>  Useful bracelet weaving tips </h2><p>  The product you have turned bilateral.  If you used a contrasting color scheme, then the sequence of hearts and the weaving of the middle part are clearly visible on the pattern.  To master the principle of weaving and remember the sequence of steps, you can make the first bracelet from the same rubber bands.  You will learn how to weave the "Heart of an Angel" from elastic bands, remember the stages of work, and then you can already use two color shades, but it will be easier to weave when you do not have to look at the instructions at every step.  You will clearly understand what gum that forms - the heart or the middle, so you can even combine hearts of different colors in one bracelet, for example, two through two identical ones with a contrasting middle. </p><h2>  How to weave an angel heart without a slingshot </h2><p>  If you do not have the indicated device, you can completely do without it.  If you have a machine, it is enough to use two columns from your design.  If there is no this tool, but you still want to make a bracelet, you can try to make it right on your fingers.  The middle and index on the left hand are used if you are working with the right.  Another option is to make a slingshot of your own.  You can take a plastic disposable fork and remove the middle two teeth or assemble the tool from felt-tip pens or any other rods or sticks. </p><h2>  How to weave a heart action figure out of rubber bands </h2><p>  The instructions below are for braiding only.  It is quite convenient and fast.  When choosing rubber bands for weaving, buy the smallest diameter and even, otherwise the figure may turn out to be sloppy.  If you can‚Äôt weave a heart out of rubber bands on the machine, then just hook the version with a hook. </p>
