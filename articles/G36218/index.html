On the left side are the usual volume swings, and on the right - the power button.  There are also two slots on the right edge.  The top of them is intended purely for a SIM card, and the second is universal.  Here you can install either a second SIM card and save on calls or <span>data transfer</span> from the global web, or an external flash drive and thereby significantly increase the amount of memory.  A typical audio jack for connecting external speakers to the device, a talking microphone and a MicroUSB format port are displayed on the lower side.  The back of the gadget is made of metal and reliably protects the Samsung A3 phone from various damages.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  This feature of the device is also distinguished.  LED backlighting, the main camera and a loud speaker are also located here.  The front of the device is protected by Gorilla Glass 3rd revision.  The screen size of this device is 4.5 inches.  Below it are three main control buttons.  The central one is mechanical, and the two extremes are sensory.  A <span>front camera, a</span> speaker for making telephone calls and a number of sensors and sensors are displayed above the display.

    <h2>  <span>Central processor</span> and its computing capabilities </h2><p>  The best entry-level processor currently used in the Samsung A3 phone.  Reviews highlight this positive point.  More specifically, this is <span>Snapdragon 410</span> from Qualcomm, the leading developer of mobile chips.  Its second name is MSM8916.  All computing modules are based on one of the most advanced architectures - A53, which, in addition to everything else, is also 64-bit.  Each of the cores of this CPU can operate in the highest load mode at a frequency of 1200 MHz.  This processor can easily solve any, including the most demanding in terms of hardware resources, task.  Its capabilities are definitely enough for a year or two.  In this case, there will be no need to even think about whether this smartphone will pull this or that application. </p><h2>  Graphics and display </h2><p>  The basis of the graphics subsystem is Adreno 306 on the Samsung A3 phone.  The review, reviews about it, as well as technical specifications are not impressive.  This is far from the flagship solution to date, but its performance is quite enough to run any, including the most demanding, toys.  There is no need to talk about other programs.  The performance margin of this video accelerator is enough for a year, or even two.  The matrix of the screen, like most phones of this manufacturer, is made using the Super AMOLED technology.  The display resolution of this smartphone model is 540x960px.  Of course, this is not even HD, but the image quality is not satisfactory.  It is not possible to visually distinguish pixels on the screen.  Viewing angles are wide enough, and image distortion does not occur.  Color reproduction, contrast and brightness of the complaints also do not cause.  Everything is perfectly balanced and works flawlessly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Photo &amp; Video </h2><p>  A very high-quality main camera is installed on the Samsung Galaxy A3 phone.  Reviews note the high quality of photos and videos obtained with its help.  It is based on an 8 megapixel sensor element.  In addition to the usual LED backlighting and autofocus technology, it also implements digital zoom, panoramic shooting, geometries, face recognition and a whole range of modes that allow you to get a high-quality image under almost any conditions.  The situation with video is no worse.  It is possible to shoot videos in Full HD quality with a resolution of 1080 r and a refresh rate of 30 frames per second.  A little more modest front camera.  She has a 5 megapixel sensor, and the viewing angle is 120 degrees.  This allows, in addition to the usual video calls, to make selfies with its help. </p><h2>  Amount of memory </h2><p>  1 GB is the nominal capacity of random access memory that is installed in the Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone.  Reviews say that this is enough for comfortable work on this gadget.  The OS itself takes about 300-400 MB.  The rest of RAM is dedicated to solving user problems.  The capacity of the internal drive is 16 GB.  They are quite enough for most programs.  If this is not enough, then instead of the 2nd SIM card, you can install an external flash drive for 64 GB.  Another way to solve this problem is to use cloud storage, on which you can transfer photos, videos and other personal files.  An example is Yandex.Disk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery is built into the Samsung Galaxy A3 Duos phone.  Reviews highlight the build quality of a solid metal case.  But there is no possibility of <span>replacing the battery</span> in this case.  Its capacity is 1900 mAh.  This value with an average load level is enough for 2-3 days.  If you download this gadget to the maximum, then the value will decrease to 1 day.  But in the maximum saving mode, it will be possible to stretch 4 days on a single charge. </p><h2>  System software </h2><p>  "Android" is far from the most recent version 4.4 installed on this phone.  The appearance of a newer modification of the system software for this gadget is still in question.  But if we take into account the modification of the central processor (and it, as was noted earlier, is 64-bit in it), then we can state with a high degree of probability that the transition to 5.0 or later version will take place without fail.  In addition to the operating system itself, this smartphone has the ‚ÄúTouch Vis‚Äù add-on familiar to the South Korean giant devices.  Accordingly, the set of applications in this case is more than usual. </p>

    <h2>  Games </h2><p>  Modern gaming applications are the main indicators of smartphone performance.  Of course, Samsung A3 cannot boast of indicators close to the level of flagship devices.  The reviews of the owners of the device confirm this.  But still, his hardware resources are enough to launch any toy at the moment.  And in the coming year there will certainly not be a need to think about whether the gadget's performance is enough to play.  And so the ‚ÄúAsphalt‚Äù of the latest version, Subway Surfers and other popular toys on it will go without problems and with normal quality. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  All the necessary interfaces for exchanging information with the outside world are on the Samsung A3 phone.  Reviews of the impressive communications kit confirm this once again.  This list includes: </p><ul><li><p>  Support for two SIM cards that work seamlessly on 2G and 3G networks.  In the latter case, the data transfer speed is several megabytes, and this is quite enough even for making video calls. </p></li><li><p>  Another important communication module is Wi-Fi.  In this case, the transfer speed increases to 150 Mbps, and this allows you to upload files of any size to the device. </p></li><li><p>  The developers did not forget about the "Bluetooth".  This gadget has a 4th generation transmitter. </p></li><li><p>  Also, the smartphone supports all, without exception, navigation systems.  The 4.5-inch diagonal allows you to use the phone as a full-fledged navigator. </p></li><li><p>  To connect to a PC, it is most rational to use MicroUSB.  This allows you to quickly load or unload an impressive amount of data. </p></li><li><p>  The last port, 3.5 mm, allows you to output an <span>audio signal</span> from the phone to an external speaker system. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  Competitive Price </h2><p>  It is difficult to compare Samsung A3 with any other gadget.  Owner reviews attribute it to the segment of entry-level devices.  But at the same time he has a one-piece metal case with a very productive CPU by today's standards.  Also its front panel is protected by 3rd generation Gorilla Glass.  And a similar device costs only $ 230.  Given the previously given facts, this is not so much today. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The owners say that there is only one minus for the A3 - this is the versatility of the second slot.  You can install a second SIM card or an external drive into it.  In most cases, the built-in 16 GB is enough for users to install new applications and store personal data.  In extreme cases, you can use some kind of cloud service.  Therefore, owners often use the slot to install a second SIM card to save on conversations or surfing the Internet. </p><p>  According to users, many positive aspects can be highlighted on the phone Samsung Galaxy A3.  Reviews primarily note a solid metal case and its impeccable quality.  The capacity of 1900 mAh is not the maximum for devices of this class, but, as the owners say, it is enough for 2-3 days of battery life.  Another positive thing users call a processor with 4 cores on board, and even with one of the most advanced architectures today. </p>
