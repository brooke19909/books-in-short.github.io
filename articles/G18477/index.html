Natural-historical park "Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, unfortunately, parks are not very popular.  Nevertheless, green corners in the Russian capital still remained.  For example, the park "Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo".  The map of Moscow contains not so many recreational areas like this one.  Most of these resources are located in <span>residential areas,</span> and not closer to the center.  So it‚Äôs definitely worth visiting the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo park at least once.  How to get to it and what to see there? </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The park is located in the homonymous district in the north-west of Moscow.  You can get to it from one of the three <span>metro stations: Voikovskaya,</span> Sokol, Schukinskaya or Tushinskaya.  It lies between the Leningrad and Volokolamsk highway. </p><p>  <span>Park "Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo"</span> - how to get to it?  This is not difficult, because it is within walking distance from the above metro stations, local residents also often look into this green corner, as there are ponds and beaches, bicycle routes on its territory, and it is very pleasant to walk here. </p><p>  The official address is 5 Voykovsky passage, 2A.  Entrance is completely free, the park is open around the clock. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  This park has three names, so there is often confusion.  In addition to the main one, Pokrovskoye-Glebovo and Glebovo-Streshnevo are also used.  This name eventually passed also to the area where the park is located.  And initially it came from the names of the owners, which will be discussed a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park is about 237 hectares.  On its territory there is a manor and some other attractions of different times of construction.  There are many other interesting things.  So, it's definitely worth a visit.  Moreover, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo park lies not far from large Moscow streets, there are bus and trolleybus stops, a <span>railway station</span> and a subway nearby.  A real piece of nature in the middle of the <span>stone jungle.</span>  So how did he become what he is now? </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Although the correct name is still "Pokrovskoye-Glebovo", another name has taken root much better.  Initially, the village, located on the site of the modern park, was simply called Pokrovskoye.  In 1664, it was bought by Rodion Streshnev, who later became one of the teachers of Peter the Great.  His family was not noble until 1626, until he became related to the royal family.  So the Streshnevs became direct relatives of one of the Russian rulers - <span>Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov.</span> </p><p>  So, when the village was acquired by the new owner, ponds were dug up on its territory, in which they began to raise fish, some household services were built, etc. Over the next 250 years, the Streshnev family built their family nest - a mansion, a refectory, a church were erected , greenhouses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Glebov in the name of the estate appeared after the great-granddaughter of Rodion Streshnev, Elizabeth, married and took a double surname.  The last owner of the estate - Evgenia Fedorovna Shakhovskaya-Glebova-Streshneva - once again rebuilt the mansion, and in this form it has survived to the present day.  After the revolution, all this land and buildings were requisitioned and turned into a sanatorium.  At different times, there was a museum, a holiday home, and even a research institute!  Now the mansion itself is abandoned, it is not being restored, only guarded. </p><h2>  Attractions on site </h2><p>  In addition to the mansion itself, located in the eastern part of the green massif, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo park is also interesting for other things.  So, this is where the spring called "Swan" is located, which is one of the few sources of clean drinking water in Moscow.  It is well-maintained and popular with local residents nearby. </p><p>  In a clearing above the springs you can find the remains of old buildings.  Until 1942, there was a pavilion "Elizavetino", built by one of the owners for his wife.  During the war, it was destroyed. </p><p>  In addition, not so long ago, a dam on the Khimka River, built by beavers, was discovered on the territory.  Oddly enough, it is also very popular among visitors to the park, because in the city of Moscow such things have long been a rarity. </p>

    <h2>  Routes </h2><p>  Few green spaces in Moscow are as large as the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo park.  The diagram shows a huge number of tracks suitable for cyclists, and for those who prefer rollers, and for pedestrians, and mothers with strollers. </p><p>  The longest route covers the entire park and passes by ponds, a ravine, a spring, so that you can see all the most interesting at a time.  Those who are bored with this path go deeper into the forest and explore smaller paths, so there are plenty of options. </p><p>  It is convenient for cyclists that it is easy to get to Strogino and Serebryany Bor from here, so the walk can be continued a little to the west.  In addition, it is easy to go to the Moscow Canal and even look at the work of the locks.  True, this is best done not alone, but with an experienced guide. </p>

    <h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  It seems that Muscovites have long forgotten why parks are needed.  Of course, you can just walk or ride a bike or roller skate on them, enjoying the clean air, surrounding greenery and birdsong. </p><p>  However, the Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo park is also a great place to sunbathe, play volleyball or badminton.  For lovers of extreme sports there is a ravine that cyclists have chosen.  A huge number of amateur athletes train in the park, there are sections on cross-country skiing, hiking, mountaineering and many other activities.  But swimming in Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãponds, unfortunately, is impossible. </p><p>  For those who prefer picnics in nature, special indoor gazebos with benches are equipped.  Although you need to consider that there are a lot of people who want it, so you may have to look for free places.  Arbors are located mainly near the pond, but they are also in the depths of the park.  There is also a cafe, but it‚Äôs rather strange to come to the park to visit them. </p><p>  "Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo" is perfect for both ordinary and outdoor activities.  Near the ponds it is almost always crowded, but if you go a little away from the paths, you can forget that the park is within the borders of Moscow, and just listen to the silence and fall out of the crazy rhythm of life in the capital. </p><p>  There are also disadvantages, mainly they relate to infrastructure.  Water and food can only be bought at the entrance from the Voykovskaya side.  There are no equipped and clean toilets either, which becomes a serious problem if a picnic is planned for the whole day. </p><h2>  Parks nearby </h2><p>  Perhaps comparable in area and resources of recreational areas within walking distance, perhaps not found, except perhaps the already mentioned Serebryany Bor.  From here you can get to the Aleshkinsky and <span>Khimki forests,</span> Timiryazevsky Park, the River Station with its squares, PKiO Severnoye Tushino and the well-known Skhodnensky bucket.  However, it would be better to use transport, since walking along such long distances along busy highways can hardly be called useful. </p>
