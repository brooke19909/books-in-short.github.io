It is located next to a huge national park, so the air here is much cleaner than in other parts of the country.  It is suitable for a quiet and leisurely pastime, so families with young children and elderly tourists often come here.  Most of the hotels here offer budget holidays at low prices.  One of them is the Chaika 3 * complex ("The Seagull" 3 *), the description of which you can read in our article. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel located? </h2><p>  <span>This small three-star hotel is located on the first beach line of the resort of Saints Constantine and Elena.</span>  <span>Distance to the sea is only 40 meters.</span>  <span>The hotel does not have its own stretch of coastline, so tourists usually visit a public sandy beach.</span>  <span>The only downside is the lack of free sun loungers and sun umbrellas.</span>  <span>They must be paid for before each visit to the beach.</span>  <span>Along the coast there is a pier, a small night club, a balneological wellness center and several public pools filled with fresh or mineral water.</span>  <span>Both adults and children can ride on a water slide.</span>  <span>A grocery store is open next to the <span>Chaika</span> hotel <span>("Chaika"</span> 3 *, St. Konstantin and Elena, Bulgaria).</span> </p>
