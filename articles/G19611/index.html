It can be performed independently or with the assistance of realtors.  Many people do not want to spend their time searching for buyers, demonstrating real estate and executing a transaction, therefore they use paid services of a professional intermediary.  But often it is necessary to sell an object at a higher price, which requires communicating with customers on their own.  Therefore, you should figure out how to properly sell an apartment in both cases. </p><h2>  Self sale </h2><p>  If you have the time and desire to engage in all the processes yourself, it is important to understand the correct steps in this procedure. </p><p>  Standardly, the process is divided into stages: </p><ul><li>  preparation of documentation for the apartment for sale; </li><li>  carrying out cosmetic repairs; </li><li>  removal of furniture and things from real estate; </li><li>  search for buyers and demonstration of housing; </li><li>  conclusion of a preliminary agreement; </li><li>  registration of transfer of deposit; </li><li>  the signing of the main contract, which is not required to be registered with the Rosreestr; </li><li>  transfer of keys to the apartment and drawing up a deed of transfer; </li><li>  receiving the remaining money for the apartment; </li><li>  tax payment if the apartment belonged to the seller for less than three or five years. </li></ul><p>  Each stage has its own nuances, and if you really need to decide how to quickly sell an apartment, then it is advisable to set a slightly lower price than the average cost of similar objects on the market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sellmyhousecompare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sell an apartment" class="if uuid-2384180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2384180.jpg"></div><h2>  Preliminary stages </h2><p>  Since it is not planned to contact a realtor, all actions are performed independently by the owner of the object.
