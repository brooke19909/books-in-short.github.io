    <h2>  Kemer Hotels </h2><p>  Tour operators who want to spend their holidays sparingly, besides seeing a lot of attractions and returning home with purchases, are advised to choose the three-star hotels of this resort.  With this arrangement, even despite the low category of the hotel, tourists are guaranteed accommodation in comfortable rooms with good service.  In any Turkish hotel, regardless of its stardom, there is always a pool, including for children, as well as the most necessary services that are needed for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  If the choice of tourists falls on Turkey, in particular on Kemer, then, considering three-star hotels, one should not expect that they will be on the first line of the sea.  It is naive to expect check-in in luxurious rooms. </p><p>  Simple but comfortable rooms, a certain remoteness from the beach, not very developed infrastructure - all this, in general, creates certain inconveniences that characterize three-star hotels.  Nevertheless, many Russians choose this option for relaxation, having a great time by the sea, surrounded by mountain slopes, breathing wonderful coniferous air, not limiting yourself on excursions, and gladly visiting many local attractions.  One of such establishments, where you can relax economically and at the same time well, is the Ares City Hotel 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ares City Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1013092.jpg" width="600"></div>
