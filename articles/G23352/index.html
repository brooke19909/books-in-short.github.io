In hotels, both the exterior and decor of luxury rooms are designed in the style of cities - trendsetters.  For example, in the hotel-park "Europe" in Belgorod, suites are called "Milan", "Florence", "Rimini", etc. </p><p>  Las Vegas already has its own Eiffel Tower, in Brussels - Mini-Europe Park with models of castles and other monuments on a scale of 1/25.  And in Freiburg, Germany, there is an entertainment complex "Europe Park", where you can relax and see miniatures of famous buildings, from which thousands of kilometers are separated. </p><h2>  What does an entertainment center include? </h2><p>  In the park you can find not only slides.  There are more than 50 shops, 7 hotels and a campsite, there are cafes and restaurants serving national cuisine, spa centers, a golf club and rental offices. </p><p>  The complex is known for costumed and theatrical performances, various thematic shows.  In the Spanish zone, one can see how knightly fights take place, in the Italian one - the Venetian carnival, and in the Russian one there is a puppet theater. </p><p>  Even in this block, the attention of tourists is attracted by master classes by potters and other artisans in the ethnographic village.  The complex also has its own version of the English Globus Theater. </p><p>  The 4D-cinema located in the complex is also popular, where films about animal life are shown for children.  Of particular interest to young guests are the Chocolate Land zone, the railway (it is arranged differently in each mini-country), and the Dinosaur Kingdom, created on the basis of the film Jurassic Park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Television shootings are constantly conducted on the territory of the complex, and broadcasts are recorded.
