An ethnographic museum, crafts workshops and a man-made lake distinguish this housing estate from among others. </p><h2>  Why are residential complexes so popular? </h2><p>  Because life in them flows in a sense in a closed cycle: everything necessary for everyday comfort is provided from the beginning.  The houses have everything: new communications, high-quality communications (including good Internet), parking, permanent security, shops and pharmacies, gyms and beauty salons, parks and squares, ponds and playgrounds. </p><p>  A place for a residential complex is usually chosen in places that are closed from the winds and weather by natural barriers.  So, the residential complex "White Dew" (Novosibirsk) is located on the banks of the Ob River. </p>

    <p>  Beautiful views of the coast play the role of natural background, and the proximity of large water softens the microclimate and purifies the air.  From here to the Bugrinsky bridge is only 4.5 km.  The new openwork structure is perfectly visible from anywhere.  You need to leave the complex only to work, to visit, to the theater, to an exhibition or to a concert.  The convenience of living in such a place will be appreciated more than others by those whose mobility is somewhat limited: mothers with babies and <span>elderly people.</span>  However, for workers it is much more convenient to know that you don‚Äôt need to worry about anything when you come home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Can everyday housing be recreational? </h2><p>  The word "recreation" is of Latin origin, and it means "restoration".  The term "recreational" is used relatively to the human environment in our country relatively recently, and the residential complex "White Dew" (Novosibirsk) is one of the best examples.  The use of this term means that it brings together the natural factors and efforts of builders in order to organize the most useful outdoor activities of a tired person during a working day.  An environment has been created in which, inevitably, a restoration of forces takes place. </p><p>  Something similar could still be found in Europe - in the same Spain, for example.  There, in the middle of the residential areas, there are swimming pools and the most comfortable squares, and you can completely relax right next to the house.  It is these associations that cause White Dew.  Novosibirsk, already known for its cozy Akademgorodok, continues to introduce various everyday innovations. </p><h2>  Could there be a lake in the city? </h2><p>  In the residential complex "White Dew" (Novosibirsk) they answer: yes!  Builders talk about it so confidently, because the lake in the city is man-made.  All calculations have long been carried out and approved.  The most remarkable thing is that the artificial lake harmoniously fits into the existing landscape: it is located in a natural lowland.  The length of the reservoir is 70 meters, and the width is exactly half that - 35. </p>

    <p>  The lake will not be a simple body of water, but a complete ecosystem.  A duck house will be found near the water, and different types of fish will be found in the lake itself.  Moisture-loving shrubs will grow on the shore, and the pavilions will decorate the surface itself.  Small fountains will freshen the air.  With the onset of cold weather, it will be possible to skate on the lake.  If enough snow falls, there is a place for skiing on the banks.  Living in such a place is a pleasure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing estate or sightseeing facility? </h2><p>  Both that, and another - so it will be fair to say about the White Dew housing estate (Novosibirsk).  Reviews of people who have been here are definitely enthusiastic.  The fact is that in this place they began to hold peculiar meetings, or ‚Äúecological picnics‚Äù.  The Ecological Museum will find its place here.  The basis was the log structure of the early XX century.  The log hut was located on the territory of the dairy until it began to interfere with the development of the enterprise.  The structure was dismantled according to logs, but it was preserved. </p>

    <p>  The city authorities decided to move and collect the log house in a new place, in the park of the residential complex.  It is planned to recreate the atmosphere of that time.  The creators of the ethnic town want to place here mini-workshops of folk crafts, as well as a small zoo or eco-farm.  Everyone who wants to live in nature will be able to do this by settling in a hotel located here on 30 seats.  Plunge into life, which was a reality only a century and a half ago, most likely many will want. </p><h2>  How many floors can a house have? </h2><p>  Scientists have long proved that the 3-4th floor is optimal for a person.  This retains at least a visual connection with the earth, and the <span>composition of the air</span> differs little from that which we breathe on the street.  With an increase in the number of storeys, the amount of oxygen in the inhaled air decreases, moreover, a person feels discomfort due to separation from the earth. </p>

    <p>  The recommendations of scientists were taken into account during the construction of the village of "White Dew" (Novosibirsk).  The photos, which show solid <span>brick houses,</span> fully confirm this.  Natural building materials do not interfere with the natural effects <span>of the Earth's magnetic field,</span> and this is the basis of normal life.  Everything is close to nature - not only natural stone, glass and wood were used, but even the brick has a natural yellowish color.  All this is complemented by an almost perfect ventilation and air conditioning system that supports the desired microclimate. </p><h2>  Safe living environment </h2><p>  This is how one can characterize the village of White Dew (Novosibirsk).  A child of a conscious age - even from the age of 5 - you can safely let go of walking alone.  The village is closed to strangers, all residents and guests go through security.  A well-functioning video surveillance system allows you to view any corner of the territory.  It is important that there are no dangerous places for kids: no abandoned buildings, gates or open hatches. </p>

    <p>  The staff of the village is tested when applying for a job.  Approaches to a river or artificial lake are never left unattended.  But the main thing is not even that.  Kids are extremely curious, and in the village there are comfortable playgrounds.  Children have something to do, so they do not need to wander aimlessly around the territory.  All this makes the cottage village "White Dew" (Novosibirsk) an almost ideal place for a full-fledged family life. </p><p>  Life is made convenient and safe by little things; this is what the main attention is paid to in the village.  It is convenient to get to the village by any transport.  The air here is much cleaner than the city, there are all the benefits of civilization.  The local silence and smells of nature call back all who have already been here. </p>
