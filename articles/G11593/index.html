Perhaps he is the best in Southeast Asia.  Unlike the democratic <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="11" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Pattaya</span> , this resort is considered the most respectable in Thailand, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="66" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">but</span> this does not mean that it is impossible to find budget hotels here.  On the island there are many <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="42" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">three-star</span> hotels <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="7" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar">with quite</span> acceptable service.  These include, for example, Meir Jarr 3 * (Thailand / Phuket).  Of course, they will not appeal to very demanding tourists, but for people who come to rest not for the sake of the hotel, but for the sake of entertainment and the sea, this is the most suitable option.  So feel free to contact the travel agency and arrange a tour to Meir Jarr Hotel 3 *.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="34" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">Believe me</span> , in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Phuket</span> you will have something to do, and do not <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="43" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">have to</span> spend all day in the room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meir jarr 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2136119.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  As on any island, there are a lot of beaches, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="67" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">but</span> not all of them are equally good.  Closer to the boundaries of hotel complexes, the water is not always clear, on the beaches it is crowded, noisy, crowded, but in less crowded places tourists can find beaches with crystal clear water, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="46" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">with</span> such an azure hue that you can’t <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="47" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">understand</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">where the</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="44" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">sky</span> ends and <span data-annotation-idx="1" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">where</span> the sea begins.  The nature here is incredibly beautiful and pristine, you can completely break away from the bustle of the city and enjoy your vacation.  Such beaches are located very close to Meir Jarr Hotel 3 *, and having rented a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="13" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">bike</span> , you can take a ride along the coast in a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">matter of</span> minutes and choose a part of the coast that you like for sunbathing and swimming in the sea.  By the way, it is better to rent a moped at the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="10" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">bike</span> rental point in the hotel, since here you will not be asked to leave a passport as a deposit (as street tenants do), you only <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="48" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">have to</span> leave a certain amount as a deposit.  At the same time, in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are entertainment centers, including those of an intimate nature, in no way inferior to those that can be found in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="14" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Pattaya</span> .  This can often be found on <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Karon Beach</span> .  It is there that <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="49" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">young people</span> strive.  But the beach <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="29" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> Kamala <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="30" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> is <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="50" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">perfect</span> for respectable tourists: here the entertainment is more solid, for example, you can witness some enchanting show or a jazz concert. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meir jarr hotel 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2136118.jpg"></div>

Imagine only: precisely because access to the island has become more accessible, in just a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="4" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">couple of years</span> this tourist destination has become considered one of the most popular and popular in Southeast Asia. </p><h2>  Air gate </h2><p>  The airport itself is located in the north of the island, and if you move further north from it, you can see how Phuket connects to the mainland through giant bridges - <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="16" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Thepkrasattri</span> and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="17" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Sarasin</span> .  The latter is a pedestrian and peculiar symbol of these places, and cars of different brands rush along the first, bringing here mainly local tourists.  There is a ferry service between the island and the mainland resort of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="18" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Krabi</span> .  Some, having arrived in Phuket, first stop at one of the local hotels, and then take the ferry to <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="19" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Krabi</span> and spend the second part of their vacation there.  In short, if you bought a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="52" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">ticket</span> to Meir Jarr Hotel 3 * (Phuket), then you will first need to fly to Bangkok, and then transfer to <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="53" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">a</span> local airline, and in just a few minutes you will reach the island in a chic setting spend your unforgettable vacation.  By the way, from <span>Phuket airport</span> to the Meir Jarr 3 * hotel can be reached by car in 40 <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> 45 minutes.  The hotel itself provides tourists with a transfer for a fee, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="68" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">however,</span> if you are traveling on vacation to Thailand on a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="54" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">package tour</span> , the travel agency serving you <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="55" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">will</span> arrange the transportation from the airport to the hotel, and the price will be included in the price of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="20" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">package</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meir jarr 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2136113.jpg"></div>

This means that Meir Jarr 3 * is located on the second beach line.  In the immediate vicinity there are huge shopping centers where you can make a wonderful shopping and enjoy delicious food, fresh fresh <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="23" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">fruits</span> and exotic fruits in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="22" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">food courts</span> .  Nearby there is also a great variety of entertainment centers, nightclubs and even hot spots.  A 10-minute drive from the Meir Jarr 3 * hotel is the Thai boxing stadium, and anyone who is not indifferent to martial arts must visit one of the matches.  A fascinating sight guaranteed!  The coolest feature of this hotel, which is considered its hallmark, is the rooftop pool, which offers incredible beauty of the sea landscape.  Many tourists prefer to spend their holidays here, sitting comfortably on sun loungers and enjoying tasty drinks in the pool bar.  Many tourists in their reviews of Meir Jarr 3 * say that they often relaxed and sunbathed by this pool, rather than on the beach, which had to go for about 10 minutes. However, there are tourists for whom real <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="24" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">relaxation</span> is possible only on the coast, in sea water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meir jarr hotel 3 phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2136114.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Room Description and Service </h2><p>  All rooms in the hotel, regardless of category, are equipped with modern furniture, comfortable beds, wardrobes, tables, armchairs or chairs.  Of course, all rooms are air-conditioned.  Without this, there is no way in Thailand: because of the constant heat and suffocating humidity, you can simply suffocate, especially if the body is not used to such conditions.  Some of the rooms, as already noted, have balconies or terraces, while others are missing.  All rooms have a bathroom with shower, washbasin, towels, hairdryer and a minimum set of toiletries (soap, shampoo, toilet paper).  The suites have a jacuzzi.  Among the equipment of the rooms <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="39" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">are</span> plasma TVs with satellite channels, a telephone with direct international dialing, a safe for storing valuables, a minibar (also known as a refrigerator), an electric kettle.  The beds are very comfortable, bed linens are changed often - every other day, towels if necessary - daily, rooms are also cleaned every day. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  At the entrance to the hotel, guests are invited to pack their belongings (if it's winter, then winter outerwear, which is definitely not needed here), pack in a suitcase and hand over to the luggage storage room.  Tourists can also use the laundry and ironing services, or they can request an iron for ironing in the room.  There is also a currency exchange point, although the rate is overvalued, therefore it is better to perform currency conversion operations outside the hotel.  There is free parking for cars rented either at the hotel itself or at rental <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="26" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">services</span> .  At Meir Jarr 3 * there is also a tour desk, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="6" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">contacting which</span> you can sign up for one or more interesting routes and really <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="64" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">(under the guidance of a guide)</span> get acquainted with local attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meir jarr hotel 3 phuket reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2136109.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When applying for a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">tour package,</span> you can choose one of several food options: breakfast only (BB), half board (HB) or full board (AL).  However, they should warn <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">that</span> most tourists note <span data-annotation-idx="1" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">that the</span> food at the hotel, although fresh and quite tasty, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="70" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">is nevertheless</span> monotonous, <span data-annotation-idx="2" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">which</span> , of course, is not quite to the liking of the guests.  In addition, Thai cuisine is not suitable for everyone, although, you must <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="71" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">admit</span> , it is quite tasty and, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">most importantly</span> , healthy.  And yet, many of the guests take breakfast only, and for the rest <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="56" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">of the</span> meals they go outside the hotel, where they eat tasty and varied food.  The hotel, including the rooftop pool, has several bars where you can enjoy refreshing as well as invigorating drinks.  There is also a coffee shop on site, serving very good oriental coffee. </p><h2>  Entertainment Infrastructure </h2><p>  As noted above, the biggest entertainment for guests of the Meir Jarr 3 * hotel (see photo in the article) <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="40" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">is a</span> magnificent pool on the roof of the building with a wonderful panoramic view of the sea.  This corner is the most favorite vacation spot for most tourists.  Here, on comfortable sun loungers, they are ready to spend almost the whole day and even late evening.  After all, in the pool bar you can enjoy very tasty drinks and snacks.  The other most visited place in the hotel is the massage room.  Massage is almost twice as expensive here as in other places in the city.  But the service cannot be compared: everything is in perfect condition, very clean, so you can not be afraid to catch some kind of infection.  There are no other attractions, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="72" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">such as a</span> fitness club or spa. </p><h2>  Hotel compliments </h2><p>  For the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="57" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">three</span> categories of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="28" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">tourists,</span> the Meir Jarr 3 * administration has prepared pleasant surprises, which are usually called compliments.  So, the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">newlyweds</span> belong to the first category.  Upon presentation of a marriage certificate for the last few months, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="59" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">newlyweds</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="60" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">will be</span> presented with a beautifully decorated room with pink petals and swans on the bed, as well as a fruit basket.  The second category includes birthday people.  They also have a surprise in the form of a shaman or a bottle of another wine.  Well, the third category of guests worthy of a compliment are those guests who have stayed here more than once.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="9" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar">When</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="33" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">driving, they are</span> also <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="61" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">waiting for a</span> bottle of wine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meir jarr 3 pics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2136108.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Meir Jarr Hotel 3 * (Phuket): reviews </h2><p>  Among the comments of guests about this hotel you can find both positive and negative, but the first more.  For example, if someone writes that the room was untidy at the hotel during check-in, and then they began to clean the room normally, then what <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="62" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">does</span> this indicate?  Yes, that our impatient tourists asked them to check in as early as possible and did not even want to wait for the room to be cleaned.  And to write about it in the comments <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="73" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">means</span> to be misleading.  Or someone writes that breakfasts were very scarce but tasty.  Why compare Thai to Turkish breakfast?  Look at the Thais, because you can judge by them that they do not accept excesses in food.  Too much breakfast for them - not normal.  But all vyingly praise the location of the Meir Jarr Hotel 3 * we are considering and the gorgeous pool located on its roof. </p>
