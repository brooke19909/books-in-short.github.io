    <p>  The villa is literally surrounded by greenery, located in one of the most picturesque regions of the resort, which is why it attracts the attention of vacationers. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The villa has 22 rooms of various categories: standard double, studio apartments and four-bed apartments.  If everything is clear with double rooms, then the remaining categories will probably raise a number of questions.  Studio apartments are chic rooms for families with children or groups of friends.  The room has two separate bedrooms, each of which has a private balcony, as well as a bathroom, a living room and a dining room with a kitchen.  Four-seater apartments are similar in layout and arrangement to studio apartments, but have one obvious and undeniable advantage - they are facing the coast, due to which a stunning view of the sea opens from the balcony. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are small, but they have everything you need for a comfortable stay: a kettle with a set of dishes, a plasma TV with satellite channels, air conditioning, a refrigerator.  By the way, as for the TV: tourists will find two Russian channels and will be able to watch their favorite shows and TV shows.  Appliances in most rooms are working properly.  The only thing that raises complaints from vacationers is the condition of furniture, plumbing and textiles.  Some sheets have worn out by an order of magnitude: old stubborn spots and holes are visible, it would not hurt to replace them with new sets.  The furniture in the villa is also new, sometimes it creaks, the doors of the closet may fall off, but all this is trifles.  The rooms have tiled floors, which, of course, is convenient from the point of view of practicality and cleanliness of the room, but tourists with young children would like to see a carpet or even a small <span>bedside rug</span> on the floor <span>,</span> creating an atmosphere of home warmth and comfort.  The bathroom has a small but reasonably comfortable shower: no problems with the supply of hot water have been detected, sometimes a faucet leaks, resulting in a puddle on the floor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you are looking for a great place for your vacation with a small but well-kept garden surrounded by greenery, you should like Villa Suzana 3 * <span>(Budva, Montenegro).</span>  Photos of tourists confirm that the courtyard is really luxurious - there is a lounge and barbecue area, as well as a spacious green lawn, ideal for children's games. </p><p>  The hotel has no pool, which for some vacationers is a drawback.  Do not forget that you go to the sea, especially since from the villa to the coast only 5-7 minutes walk.  The pool may be needed only in the cold season, in the season it will certainly never become a worthy alternative to sea water. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of accommodation at Villa Suzana 3 * (Budva, Montenegro) includes meals of the selected category.  Most often, tourists stay on half board, which includes breakfast and dinner.  Breakfasts are built on the buffet system, do not impress with their variety, but hardly anyone will remain hungry.  Breakfast includes all kinds of eggs, toasts, with jam, cold cuts, cheese, pastes, breakfast cereals, milk and yogurt.  For dinner - light soup, the second one to choose from, fresh pastries, tea, coffee, juices. </p>
