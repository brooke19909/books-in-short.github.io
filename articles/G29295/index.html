And it is often better to do this not at home, where you still have to do some household chores, but in some hotel or holiday home.  Due to the fact that the tourism business is flourishing more and more, not only in certain resort places, but also near ordinary cities, today it is not at all necessary to travel far from home to have a great rest. </p><p>  In recent years, outside the city of Moscow, a large number of places have appeared, perfectly suitable for relaxation.  You can find all-inclusive hotels in the Moscow Region with a swimming pool, various spa services and other entertainments, or you can choose a simpler and cheaper option. </p><h2>  A variety of vacation spots in the suburbs </h2><p>  It‚Äôs good that any Muscovite has the opportunity to relax right in the suburbs.  Such a vacation will save on train or plane tickets, because you can get to any hotel outside of Moscow by your own car, public transport or taxi.  And the travel time will be very short, which will not let vacationers get tired of the road. </p>

    <p>  Vacationers like this place primarily because of the price.  However, they are depressed by the very small size of standard rooms, the remoteness of many buildings from the parking lot and the location of the restaurant in a separate building, which is not very convenient, especially in cool weather and with children. </p><h2>  Mistral (hotel and spa) </h2><p>  Want to visit a 5 star hotel?
