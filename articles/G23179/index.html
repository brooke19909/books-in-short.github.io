No wonder tourists called this hotel a paradise on the Red Sea. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  <span>Hotel 4 *</span> Magawish Village Resort is one of the first resort complexes in Egypt, which was designed as a tourist village.  Given that most travelers visit Hurghada precisely for the Red Sea, this hotel is simply an ideal place, because it has its own beach, which is 2 km long.  The hotel is also famous for its picturesque views of the famous island of Magawish. </p><p>  Particularly close attention at the 4 * Magawish Village Resort is given to all sorts of entertainment.  They are so numerous and diverse that both lovers of imposing and leisurely pastime, and those who cannot imagine their life without exotic and extreme sports can find something suitable for themselves. </p><p>  The hotel has a rich history and established traditions, because it was built back in 1979.  But this should not scare away tourists, because more recently (in 2011) the hotel was completely renovated. </p>
