    <h2>  Device niche </h2><p>  All characteristics and parameters clearly indicate that the flagship smartphone is the Sony Xperia Z5.  A review of its specifications proves this once again: an impressive amount of memory, the most efficient central processor, one of the best touch displays to date, and very high-quality cameras.  All this allows this smartphone to compete with any other flagship on equal terms.  Of course, such a device cannot be cheap.  As a result, the cost of this smartphone is quite solid. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Very modest equipment at this flagship smartphone.  It includes: </p><ul><li><p>  Actually the "smart" phone with a built-in and non-removable battery. </p></li><li><p>  Charger with current output of 1500mA. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord. </p></li><li><p>  Brief instruction manual of the device. </p></li></ul><p>  This list lacks a wired stereo headset with high sound quality with a 3.5 mm plug (FM radio does not work without it), an external memory card (32 GB is good, but an additional 200 GB is even better), a cover and a protective film for the front panel of the device (to protect the gadget from possible damage).  Exactly the same equipment and other models in this line of devices - "Xperia Z5 DUOS" and "Sony Xperia Z5 Compact."  A review of the other models of this manufacturer indicates that almost any smartphone model of this Japanese manufacturer in this regard is no different from the flagship. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  In terms of design, the current flagship of the Japanese company is not very different from its predecessors.  The front panel is almost entirely occupied by the touch screen, which is protected by the latest generation of shock-resistant glass "Gorilla Eye".  The bottom of the display is reserved for the control panel.  Therefore, the lower strip of the panel is not occupied by any control element, but on top, as expected, is the earpiece, the manufacturer‚Äôs logo and a miniature peephole of the front camera.  There are also sensor windows.  All the main control buttons are neatly grouped on the left edge: locking the device, adjusting its volume and controlling the camera.  On the opposite side of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone is a slot for installing SIM cards and an external drive.  The micro-USB port is displayed at the bottom, and a wired audio port and a small hole for the noise canceling microphone are located on top.  On the back cover, in addition to the main camera and its LED backlight, there is also a company logo - manufacturer of Sony and a line of smartphones - Xperia.  The side faces of the device are made of metal, and the back cover, like the front panel, is made of Gorilla Eye glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  One of the most productive chips installed in the Sony Xperia Z5.  A review of its technical parameters indicates the presence of the Snapdragon 810 from Kualkom.  It consists of 8 computing units, which are divided into 2 clusters of 4 cores.  The first cluster is energy efficient.  It consists of 4 "A53" architecture modules that are capable of overclocking to 1.5 GHz.  This is enough to run most applications.  If the user launches a resource-intensive application, then a more productive cluster is included in the work, which also consists of four blocks, but they are based on the more productive architecture ‚ÄúA57‚Äù.  However, their maximum frequency can be 2.0 GHz. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics Accelerator and Display </h2><p>  A review of the Sony Xperia Z5 phone in any design indicates the presence of the Adreno 430 graphic accelerator developed by Kualkom.  This is one of the best video chips to date, which can really boast a phenomenal level of performance.  The largest display diagonal in the Premium model is 5.5 inches.  At the same time, it has a resolution of 2160x3180 and a pixel density of 806. While the Xperia Z5 model boasts a screen with a diagonal of 5.2 inches.  In this case, the resolution is 1080x1920, and the pixel density is 424. Even the display of the Compact model is 4.6 inches.  As a result, the resolution in this case is also reduced to 1280x720, and the pixel density is already 319. At the heart of all the touch displays of the models of this line of smart phones is a matrix based on the IPS technology.  This nuance provides high quality images on the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  All models of the Xperia Z5 line are equipped with 3 GB of RAM, except for the Xperia Z5 Compact version, which boasts only 2 GB.  At the same time, system processes after the initialization of the device take up 1.2 GB.  Therefore, in the first case, the owner of the smartphone can count on 1.8 GB of free RAM, and in the second - 800 MB.  The capacity of the integrated drive is 32 GB.  There is also a slot for installing an external flash drive.  Its capacity can be equal to a maximum of 200 GB.  The smartphone also supports OTJ technology.  Only for these purposes, you will have to buy it separately, and only then you can connect a regular flash drive to the device. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Very nice main camera in Sony Xperia Z5.  The review, reviews of this model confirm this - the set of its technical specifications is really impressive.  She has a 23 megapixel sensor.  There is also autofocus with LED backlight and the ability to record in 4K format.  Moreover, the same module is installed in all models of smartphones in this line.  The quality of the photos and videos is really impressive.  The front camera has a 5 megapixel sensor, and this is quite enough for the currently popular ‚Äúselfie‚Äù and video calls. </p><h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  The capacity of the built-in and non-removable battery is 3430 mAh.  Taking into account the output current of the complete charging adapter of 1500 mA, it will take a little more than two hours to charge the battery - 2.28 hours. Given the hardware, one battery charge in the standard mode will last for 12-15 hours.  Well, an increase in the load on the device (for example, the launch of a demanding toy) will lead to the fact that the smartphone can last only 4-6 hours.  Among the other features of this smartphone, we can highlight the presence of a special energy-saving mode, which can significantly optimize the operation of the gadget.  When activated, the device will be able to stretch 2 days on a single charge of the battery. </p>

    <h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  All the necessary wired and wireless methods for transmitting information are implemented in any model of this line of smart phones.  This list includes: </p><ul><li><p>  Full support for all cellular networks that exist today.  This is GSM / 2G (the maximum speed for receiving information is 500 Kbit / s), 3G (in this case, information can be transmitted at speeds up to 63 Mbit / s) and LTE / 4G (the speed in the presence of such coverage can reach 300 Mbit / s).  In turn, a review of the Sony <span>Xperia Z5</span> Dual smartphone indicates that both SIM cards support all existing cellular networks, and all the information given earlier is valid for each of them. </p></li><li><p>  Another important wireless way of exchanging information with the Internet is Wi-Fi.  In this case, the speed will be greater than in the case of 3G, but less than LTE / 4G, and is 100 Mbps. </p></li><li><p>  Japanese engineers did not forget about equipping their flagship device with bluetooth.  It allows you to connect wireless headphones to your smartphone or exchange data with similar devices (for example, music or photos). </p></li><li><p>  Navigation capabilities in this device are implemented using a GPS transmitter and the navigation system of the same name. </p></li><li><p>  To charge the battery and synchronize with a computer, this device is equipped with a wired micro-USB port. </p></li><li><p>  Wired speakers with a microphone connect to this phone using the usual 3.5 mm audio port. </p></li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  A very, very fresh version 5.1 of the Android OS is installed on any Sony Xperia Z5 model.  A review in Russian of its system menu indicates that there is no separate menu for programs.  That is, all installed software is displayed immediately on the desktop.  If you wish, you can move similar applications to a shared folder to save space on your desktop.  In any case, the hardware resources of this device will allow you to install on it a more recent version of Android with the serial number 6.0.  So we expect the appearance of updates that will allow you to change the version of system software from 5.1 to 6.0. </p>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The most modest price tag is for the Z5 Compact.  It can be bought for $ 580.  If you add another 120 dollars, then you can buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Dual.  A review of existing price offers indicates that the average market value today is exactly $ 700.  Well, the Z5 Premium model will cost another 140 dollars more expensive - 840. On the one hand, it is quite expensive.  But do not forget that these are flagship gadgets that, by default, cannot be accessed from a price position. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Z5 Premium has a number of advantages.  A review of user reviews points to these: </p><ul><li><p>  Very productive central processing unit and graphic accelerator. </p></li><li><p>  Touch screen with a large diagonal and high resolution "4K". </p></li><li><p>  A large amount of RAM and a solid capacity of the integrated drive. </p></li><li><p>  Excellent degree of autonomy. </p></li><li><p>  Fresh and current version of the operating system. </p></li><li><p>  Very high quality main camera. </p></li></ul><p>  But there are also flaws in the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium.  A review of owner reviews highlights the following: </p><ul><li><p>  The brightness of the glass surface of the smartphone.  This minus is solved easily and simply with the help of a matte protective film for the front panel and cover.  All this will avoid the appearance of possible prints. </p></li><li><p>  The main problem of this smartphone is the overheating of the central process when executing demanding applications.  On average, its operating temperature is 50-60 g.  And this is quite a lot for this class of devices.  At the same time, if the CPU overheat protection starts to work, then the smartphone will ‚Äúslow down‚Äù due to the fact that the computing modules begin to skip the execution steps of the instructions.  Japanese engineers managed to solve this problem to a certain extent.  But still, when launching the most demanding applications, this moment is fully manifested.  But this is not a purely problem of Sony‚Äôs flagship Z5 line of devices, but all devices on this model of CPU. </p></li></ul>
