Thanks to her, she is able to quickly wake up, gather her thoughts and tune in to a working or a day off.  However, not every coffee will be good, even if it is made from the best coffee beans.  An important role is played by the equipment with which grains are prepared and brewed.  We are talking about a variety of coffee machines with different types of grinding and brewing coffee.  One of the best <span>automatic coffee machines</span> can rightly be considered the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09.  Reviews about her confirm her high quality and ability to satisfy the demands of even a picky gourmet.  What is so special about her? </p><h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  Many users note the compactness and pleasant design of the coffee machine.

The strict lines and black color of the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 coffee machine, the photo of which can be seen below, are suitable for any style of room decoration, since they are the most universal solution. </p><p>  This machine is a full cycle coffee machine.

This ensures maximum saturation and freshness, because grinding is done immediately before cooking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.euronics.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee machine philips 3000 series hd8827 09 customer reviews" class="if uuid-2779575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779575.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of the <span>Philips</span> 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 <span>coffee machine</span> , the only time you need a little intervention is making a cappuccino.  After the coffee brewing cycle is completed, you need to whip the milk with hot steam and add to the freshly brewed drink.  As you can see, everything is very simple and convenient for those who are constantly in a hurry, or who do not want to understand the intricacies of the art of making coffee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advanced grinding system </h2><p>  According to the manufacturer, close attention was paid precisely to the process of grinding coffee beans.  The main task was to achieve uniformity so that valuable coffee could be used to the maximum, and not to throw the lion's share of the raw material into the garbage without revealing its full potential.  Therefore, when developing a coffee machine, it was decided to use ceramic millstones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.al.to" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee machine philips 3000 series hd8827 09 reviews" class="if uuid-2779571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779571.jpg"></div><p>  Such a move allowed not only to achieve uniform grinding of coffee, but also extended the life of the mechanism itself.  According to the manufacturer, in his review of the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 coffee machine, with the new millstones, you can prepare at least 20 thousand cups of aromatic drink, which is enough even for operation in a small office without the risk of quickly wearing the machine. </p><h2>  Different modes </h2><p>  Several varieties of common coffee drinks are available for preparation.  Their list includes classic coffee, classic espresso, cappuccino and espresso longo.  To prepare each of them, you must set the appropriate mode. </p><p>  As mentioned above, all these drinks, except for cappuccino, do not require user intervention in the preparation process.  Moreover, as emphasized in customer reviews of the <span>Philips</span> 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 <span>coffee machine</span> , each of them can be prepared immediately in the amount of two servings, if you plan to drink coffee with someone.  Developers also paid special attention to lovers of drinks with increased strength, allowing them to prepare double classic coffee using the appropriate parameter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For lovers of other types of drinks there is the opportunity to simply collect hot water without coffee, so that later, for example, make tea, but do not use a kettle to warm up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.testsieger.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="philips 3000 series hd8827 09 coffee machine review" class="if uuid-2779574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779574.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional parameters and device settings </h2><p>  From the grinding of coffee depends on its taste.  The same grains can give acidity, bitter taste or have a different strength with a difference in the grinding fraction.  In order for the user to be able to choose the option that suits his taste more, the manufacturer has provided the opportunity to choose the degree of grinding from the five available options. </p><p>  Another important parameter is the volume of dishes in which the finished drink will be served.  If you set this parameter incorrectly, that is, there is a risk of losing a certain amount of the finished coffee due to too small a cup.  Or, conversely, the amount of liquid will be too small, and you will not be able to fully enjoy the usual drink.  The volume of dishes is set by simply pressing the corresponding key.  All controls are indicated by clear pictograms, so there should be no problems with managing and configuring them.  If questions arise, the answers to them can be found in the complete manual for the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 coffee machine, written in simple language. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.varle.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee machine philips 3000 series hd8827 09 manual" class="if uuid-2779573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779573.jpg"></div><h2>  Easy maintenance </h2><p>  Equally important is the regular maintenance of the coffee machine.  This extends its service life and improves the quality of drinks.  In order to clean the brewing group, just remove it in one motion and rinse under running water. </p><p>  The waste coffee container and spilled coffee residues are also easy to remove and clean.

Based on the reviews of the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09, the following positive points can be highlighted: </p><ul><li>  Compactness.  The coffee machine has small dimensions, which, however, in no way affect the functionality or performance. </li><li>  Simple operation.  All buttons are clearly marked, and you can figure out the settings in a few minutes.  The launch of the desired program is carried out with one click and is not complicated by additional operations. </li><li>  Attractive appearance.  Minimalism is adjacent to the harmonious arrangement of controls, and soft lighting makes them stand out and makes the appearance more contoured and strict. </li><li>  Simple service.  Everyone can remove the used coffee and rinse the machine, since this does not require deep disassembly.  Reviews of the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 coffee machine more than once emphasize that for this it is enough to just remove the corresponding blocks and substitute them under running water. </li><li>  Adequate water tank capacity.  Despite its compact size, up to 1.8 liters of water is placed in the coffee machine, which is enough to make coffee throughout the day, even in a small team or family. </li><li>  The presence of different modes.  Everyone can choose a drink to their taste due to the possibility of immediately preparing 4 options. </li><li>  Possibility of whipping with hot steam.

However, the coffee machine has a couple of disadvantages that should also be considered before buying. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elkor.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="philips 3000 series hd8827 09 coffee machine makes cappuccino" class="if uuid-2779577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779577.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  The main drawback is users call the rather strong noise that the technician makes while making coffee.  Its first stage is associated with the grinding of coffee beans, and this process proceeds louder than on devices of other manufacturers.  The second stage begins during the cleaning and washing of the machine in automatic mode after preparing the portion.  Therefore, it is not possible to make coffee quietly in the morning, when the rest of the family is still sleeping, probably it will not work. </p><p>  The second drawback noted in the reviews about the Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 is the mismatch of the declared volume of the tank for coffee beans with real indicators.  Some users complain that instead of the indicated 250 grams, they could hardly load 150 g. However, this is not such a significant problem, since grains can be added as they are consumed by the device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.al.to" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="philips 3000 series hd8827 09 coffee machine specifications" class="if uuid-2779572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779572.jpg"></div><p>  This coffee machine is perfect for home use, as well as for operation in a small office or open space.  She has the necessary set of tools to satisfy the needs of any coffee gourmet.  The Philips 3000 Series HD8827 / 09 coffee machine is superior to any competitor in this price range.  Due to the fact that the preparation cycle is complete and begins with the grinding of beans, coffee always turns out to be aromatic and tasty.  Even a child can carry out maintenance of the machine; it is easy to operate and configure.  And its disadvantages, in spite of their presence, can be omitted, since the positive sides more than cover the existing shortcomings. </p>
