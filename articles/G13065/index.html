    <h2>  Inelastic set </h2><p>  An unusual method of looping, which is performed by a single thread, was found on the Internet.  The advantage of this set is that you do not need to back off a long thread, this set comes from a short one.  And the second is that this Italian set of knitting loops with knitting needles for beginners will greatly facilitate, however, as for professionals.  So let's get started.  The first thing to do is to form a sliding loop.  The second loop must be tied from the first and put it on the left knitting needle.  But the third loop already needs to be tied out not from the second, but from the gap between the first two loops.  This is the peculiarity of this set of loops from a short thread.  Then, just like the 3rd loop, we knit all the others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italian set of loops from a short thread for elastic bands" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44196/1860650.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  This is how a simple set of stitches with knitting needles and Italian.  "Hobbichom" is a store where, unfortunately, you will not find knitting products, here is a paradise for those involved in decoupage.  But in any case, the Internet has a lot of resources offering products for knitters for every taste. </p><p>  In order to master the above method, you need to put a little patience, zeal and time.  And then the loops will be drawn onto the knitting needles as fast as if it was not a skill, but a reflex that arose from the diaper. </p>
