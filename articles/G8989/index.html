    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Chabana Kamala Hotel 4 * is located just a couple of minutes walk from Kamala Beach, which is the best in these parts.  So many tourists think.  Kamala is a source of the beauty of nature and a relaxing atmosphere.  The beach is incredibly beautiful - tall palm trees, picturesquely lined around the perimeter of the coastline, harmoniously combine with turquoise sea water and soft white sand. </p><p>  And there are a lot of attractions worth seeing.  In 7 minutes, for example, you can walk to Phuket Fantasy - this is Disneyland in Thai.  In a third of an hour, it‚Äôs quite possible to get to the little-known, but incredibly picturesque Laem Singh beach, which is located in a small lagoon surrounded by jungle and mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After 3-5 kilometers from the complex there is the famous Bang Tao Temple, Kathu Falls, cable car, modern Plaza Surin shopping center, Kalim Bay, Bliss Beach Club, and a large Tesco Lotus supermarket.  And this is just a small list of interesting places.  By the way, an important nuance - the complex is located just 18 kilometers from <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport.</span> </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  First of all, I would like to note that this hotel is completely new - it opened in April 2016.  It is difficult not to notice the modern and fresh building of five floors - it stands out pleasantly from the general background, but nevertheless successfully fits into the landscape. </p><p>  The hotel is small, it has only 69 rooms.  If we talk about the concept, then this is most likely a boutique hotel, since here special attention is paid to the comfort of the guests, which can be understood not only by the situation, but also by the attitude of the staff towards visitors.  There are few tourists from Russia, by the way.  The main guests are guests from Asian countries.  So there are no Russian-speaking employees at the hotel, therefore, if there are problems of a linguistic nature, it would not be superfluous to bring a phrasebook with you. </p><p>  It is important to note that the hotel so far only offers one-time meals (breakfast).  But nearby there are a lot of shops and cafes with low prices and a rich assortment.  The very center of Kamala is still a favorable location. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Most tourists stay at Chabana Kamala Hotel 4 * (Phuket, Kamala) in order to explore local attractions for one half of their vacation and the other to sunbathe on a paradise beach and enjoy the azure waters.  Because the hotel has virtually no entertainment.  Although there are sun terraces with sun loungers and umbrellas, as well as a deep outdoor pool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But that is all.  Neither the gym, nor the SPA center, nor, especially, the animation.  And in this case, this is a plus.  Firstly, the lack of various kinds of activities pleasantly affects the price.  Secondly, the hotel is quiet even in the afternoon.  In general, this is an ideal place for people who are looking for the most relaxing hotel with the appropriate contingent.  Noisy youth companies here do not rest, as do families with children. </p><h2>  Superior 2-seater "Standards" </h2><p>  This is the cheapest room category in Chabana Kamala Hotel 4 *.  Each superior Standard is an apartment of 28 sq.m.  In terms of beds, guests are given a choice - there are rooms with one large, 2-bedroom, and two separate. </p><p>  All air-conditioned apartments come with a minibar, widescreen plasma with satellite channels, a wardrobe, a fridge, and a bathroom.  There are such necessary trifles as an electric kettle, slippers, linen, towels, hygiene products.  There is even a trempel for clothes and a dryer. </p><p>  Now about the cost of living.  It has been said more than once that located in Thailand (Phuket, Kamala) Chabana Kamala Hotel 4 * pleases with reasonable prices.  So, a week of living in an improved "Standard" for two people will cost only 25-27 thousand rubles.

    <h2>  Deluxe Apartment </h2><p>  These rooms are more spacious and feature more stylish d√©cor.  Each ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù has a living area of ‚Äã‚Äã38 sq.m., as well as a spacious balcony with a picturesque view (pool or mountain).  The space, by the way, is successfully divided into sleeping and living areas.  The latter has a comfortable sofa, which is laid out, and turns into an extra bed. </p><p>  In terms of other amenities, the "deluxe" has everything the same as the "standard".  However, it is more comfortable - we must admit it.  And the price is not very high.  For a week of accommodation with breakfast, two guests will need to pay about 33,000 rubles.  Without them - about 30,000 rubles. </p><p>  The indicated prices vary depending on the tour operator, but slightly - no more than 5%.  However, in any case, it is better to book apartments in advance.  Early booking usually gives you access to pleasant discounts. </p><h2>  The nuances of booking and accommodation </h2><p>  These formalities are also worth noting attention, talking about the Chabana Kamala Hotel 4 * (Thailand, Kamala, Phuket). </p><p>  So, registration of new guests begins at 14:00.  Check out lasts until 12:00.  It is necessary to take this information into account when choosing round-trip flights in order to save yourself from waiting for arrival and departure. </p><p>  The hotel can stay with children, but for placing a child under the age of 12, you need to pay 250 TNV per day (this is about 430 rubles at the current rate).  Extra beds are not available. </p><p>  Also, when making a remote reservation, you will need to provide your credit card details.  Suitable: JCB, "Master Card", "Visa" and "American Express".  Upon arrival, you will need to present the used card with your passport.  By the way, you will need a deposit (which, of course, is returned upon departure) - you can leave either her or cash. </p>
