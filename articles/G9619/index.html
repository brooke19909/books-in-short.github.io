    <h2>  Stylish decor: curtains made from leftover fabric </h2><p>  At all times, handmade was highly valued, and today it is very fashionable to decorate your home with hand-made household items.  Bright and extraordinary things made of various materials will fill the house with comfort and a special atmosphere.  An unusual solution will be curtains created from individual rags of fabric, especially since each house has a large number of them.  This is not only pleasant, but also useful.  Anyway, throwing the flaps is a pity, and not necessarily, because they can find great use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="curtains from the remains of fabric" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1828177.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The principle of sewing patchwork curtains </h2><p>  Getting started, you need to select and draw your favorite pattern.  It can consist of all kinds of elements of different sizes.  When sewing such a product, it is best and most convenient to choose large pieces of fabric, since it is much easier to work with them, while for connecting small parts you will have to make many seams, which, in turn, will make the finished product heavier. </p><p>  For more convenient work, it is best to make a pattern on thick paper without leaving allowances for seams.  Separate elements for convenience are numbered.  And although at first glance it seems that it is very difficult to sew such a product from the rest of the fabric, it is not so. </p><p>  The finished pattern is applied from the back of the fabric and outlined, not forgetting about allowances of about 0.5-1.0 cm. The parts are sewn together facing each other, for convenience they can be swept away beforehand. </p><p>  After all the elements are sewn, the finished curtain must be smoothed.  A cloth from pieces of fabric is sewn to the base or lining - thus the plain-looking side of the underside is hidden. </p><p>  The finished product can be additionally decorated by sewing on the edges of the tape, a beautiful ribbon or twine. </p><h2>  Patchwork: master class </h2><p>  When sewing products using the <span>patchwork</span> technique <span>(patchwork),</span> you can use various geometric patterns you like.  However, the easiest way, especially for beginners, is to cut and stitch rectangles, squares, and triangles.  The main highlight of such products is the exact proportionality of all the details and the ornament itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork master class" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1828178.jpg" width="600"></div>

The protruding corners are carefully cut with scissors.  For greater expressiveness and beauty, it is best to use details of contrasting colors.  In addition, squares made up of flaps can be of different sizes - this will allow you to use as many different pieces of fabric as possible, and geometric patterns will come out more unusual and interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork master class" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1828179.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Padding chairs with</span> leftover fabric </h2><p>  Using the remaining pieces of material, you can breathe life into old things and home decoration.  For example, do-it-yourself shreds of fabric can transform an outdated chair.  First you need to remove the seat and remove the upholstery.  Next, cut a new piece of foam, equal to the old.  Then the prepared piece of fabric (it can be made using the patchwork technique) is placed on a new piece of foam rubber and fixed with a stapler on the opposite side of the seat.  As a result, excess tissue can be cut and glued with glue.  It remains to install a new seat on the chair. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself fabric flaps" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1828181.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <p>  The same can be done with an old stool, if there is one on the farm.  The seat is fitted with foam rubber and a cover is sewn that matches the dimensions of the wooden product.  The case is made in this way: </p><ul><li>  <span>they cut out a template</span> according to the size of the stool, it is necessary to take into account allowances for seams; </li><li>  further along the edges attach the gum; </li><li>  the finished cover is put on a chair where a foam pillow already lies. </li></ul><h2>  Useful items in the interior </h2><p>  You can decorate with the remnants of fabric a wide variety of objects.  With the help of small rags beautiful designer items are sewn, for example, pillow covers will be an interesting option.  Small segments often do not allow you to make a full-fledged thing, but you can use a little trick: to make a cover from strips of silk, cotton, taffeta, etc. </p><p>  When starting sewing, the first thing you need to do is prepare the fabric (wash, bleach and iron).  Then: </p><ul><li>  Measure two parts according to the shape of the pillow or combine them from separate segments.  This can be done using the patchwork technique, a master class on which was presented above in the article. </li><li>  Details are built up on three sides. </li><li>  Pillows from the remains of fabric are decorated with various decorative elements. </li></ul>
