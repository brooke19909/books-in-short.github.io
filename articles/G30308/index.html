A review of the mobile phone will reveal all the important points.  It is unlikely to meet at least one person who does not know anything about this model.  At one time, she was a sales leader.  Initially, it seemed to buyers that the model of the Finnish manufacturer is more suitable for women.  This decision was influenced by a large selection of colors.  However, over time, the mobile phone was boldly called universal, since both the weaker and the stronger sex purchased it with pleasure. </p><p>  As part of this review, not only the characteristics, but also the advantages of the phone will be examined in detail.  It is incorrect to talk about the shortcomings now, because over 10 years mobile devices have undergone dramatic changes. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  It is unlikely that anyone will argue that Finnish products are not only high-quality, but also stylish.  Just look at the packaging of the Nokia 8210 phone. It is small in size, lightweight, made of thick cardboard.  On the front side, the manufacturer posted a very beautiful photo: a guy with a girl against a stormy river.  Nokia inscription in blue and white is located in the lower right corner.  And this is all that is presented on the front side. </p><p>  It will take time to search for information about the phone.  For example, the model name is printed only on the side face.  And we draw the attention of the reader to the fact that the manufacturer used six different languages, among which there is no Russian.  For this reason, we can safely assume that it will be difficult for a domestic buyer to understand the instructions.  However, everything is not so bad.  In the box is a little book in Russian.  We will talk about the information published in it later.  It is important to understand that if there is no Russified instruction in the kit, then the device is ‚Äúgray‚Äù, that is, non-original. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now we will deal with the components.  In addition to the documentation, the box also has a removable battery, additional replaceable Xpress-On panels and a charger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716894.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Acquaintance with the instruction </h2><p>  At present, customers rarely use leadership, trusting their intuition.  But before the first acquaintance began with a study of the instructions.  The book is small, decorated pretty nicely. </p><p>  Before the table of contents there is a section presenting the Nokia 8210. It is called "Quick and Easy."  It summarizes information on how to lock the device, make a call, save the subscriber number and other basic manipulations.  After reading it, you can see the table of contents.  With its help, it is quite easy to navigate the information contained in the manual.  In it you can find the answer to any question that relates not only to working with the device, but also to the use of options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716895.jpg" width="375"></div>

The plastic case is a typical monoblock.  The advantage of the model is a wide range of interchangeable panels.  The buyer can choose one of six copies: saturated green, fresh mint, light yellow, white with a tinge of crystal, mocha and orange with ginger tints.  A little later, a blue version appeared on sale. </p><p>  In the manufacture of the case, the developers refused straightforwardness.  Roundness is clearly visible around the screen.  The upper end is flat, the corners are pointed.  To the bottom, the case acquires straight lines, so near the keyboard it becomes much narrower.  The dimensions of the Nokia 8210 are small, especially when compared with the devices of 10 years ago.  In height, the phone reaches almost 10.2 cm, the width is 4.5 cm. As for the thickness, by modern standards it is quite large - 1.7 cm. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth considering the design of the front panel.  It consists of two parts.  At the top there is a black drop-shaped insert under which a small screen is located.  Above it is a speaker hole and a logo.  At the bottom is the control panel, which consists of four separate and one paired buttons.  Their location is quite original. </p><p>  The back cover of the Nokia 8210 occupies 2/3 of the entire panel.  It depicts the company logo and the castle.  A hole for the strap and a soldered button for adjusting the volume are provided on the left side on the side face.  The connector for connecting the charger and microphone are displayed on the lower end.  The location of the on / off button is standard for devices of the Finnish manufacturer.  For her, a place was chosen at the upper end.  The owners claim that accidental clicking on it can be completely eliminated, since the key is pretty much recessed into the case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210 case" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  The Nokia 8210 displays a graphical display.  Its size is quite small.  When writing an SMS message, only 5 lines are placed on it.  The manufacturer claims that the screen is high contrast.  Owners confirm this information.  When you turn on the phone, as well as during operation, the backlight is activated.  Thanks to her, all information is well read.  On the street, especially in sunny weather, you can see how the screen fades.  The contrast level is reduced, but not critical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210 loses network" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716897.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  <span>The numeric keypad</span> consists of separate keys.  All of them are elegant droplets of small size.  Due to the fact that the designers made them separate, using the phone is quite convenient. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention that the buttons practically do not protrude beyond the general line of the case, which reduces the risk of accidental pressing.  The developers have provided and keyboard lock.  It turns on by successively pressing the left soft key and "*".  To release the lock, the action must be repeated in the same sequence.  To be able to work with the phone in a dark place, the backlighting of the white keys is provided.  According to users, its power is quite enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210 display" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716898.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia 8210: battery specifications </h2><p>  The autonomy of the Finnish mobile phone meets the battery BLB-2.  In its manufacture, lithium-polymer technology was used.  Battery capacity - 830 mAh.  Such characteristics provide 150 hours of standby time, and about 3.5 hours of active conversation. </p><p>  If you study the reviews of the owners, you can be sure that the device will work flawlessly for at least 3 days under intense load.  And only after this period may recharge be required.  Recharging a battery to 100% takes approximately 1.5 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716899.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Phone advantages </h2><p>  Describing the legendary model of the phone, it is necessary to separately highlight its strengths.  No owner has ever noticed that the Nokia 8210 is losing its network.  The signal level is always high.  This unit is in touch even where others are already powerless.  In this criterion, he has practically no equal.  The versatility of the phone can also be safely attributed to the benefits.  It is convenient to use for both a child and an elderly person. </p><p>  According to users, the advantage is the presence of an infrared port.  It is used to transmit data wirelessly.  Also, this model of the device is perfectly synchronized with a PC.  A large number of positive reviews are devoted to ergonomics and ease of use.  It is very convenient to carry it both in a pocket, and in a cover.  Many assure that the most convenient way is a clip.  The only thing you have to buy it yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 8210 battery" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1716900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  When considering a legendary model, it immediately becomes clear that there is no point in comparing it with modern smartphones.  The monochrome Nokia 8210 is inferior to modern phones in all respects. The battery can be called an exception, since the battery life is much longer than that of the "sophisticated" gadgets.  But other nuances influenced such results: a modest display, limited functionality, etc. </p><p>  However, if you use a mobile phone for its intended purpose (calls, messages), then you can fully enjoy the reliability and ease of management.  Surprisingly, even after a decade, it works great and can be used as an additional tube. </p>
