    <p>  The beach can be reached in just 5 minutes.  The beach is covered with soft sand.  The entrance to the sea is gentle.  It is very convenient to swim with children.  The beach on the left side of the hotel has a wide coastline.  Almost no one uses sun loungers, but you need to bring <span>beach towels</span> with you. </p><p>  The sea is wonderful, but there is one danger in it - sea urchins.  There are a lot of them on the pier and on the rocks.  Surprisingly, the locals are not afraid of them and calmly walk on them.  Moreover, they even eat them.  At the end of the beach there are many pitfalls.  It is better to swim in diving equipment. </p><p>  Basically, the bottom is sandy and clean.  Sometimes small fish, beautiful shells and crabs are found. </p><h2>  The main advantages of the hotel </h2>

    <p>  Most domestic tourists recommend the Aqua Mare Bomo Club 3 * hotel.  Reservations in advance are welcome, but not required.  Although in season the hotel is completely full. </p><p>  The city of Kallikratia itself is a good resort with a developed infrastructure.  You can easily get to Thessaloniki and other major cities of Greece.  Shopping and excursions to these places will leave a lot of pleasant impressions. </p><p>  It is definitely necessary to rent a car.  But in Kallikratia no one provides such services, unfortunately.

Perfectly removed, and even laid out of shells still life to you and without money. </p><p>  Mistress Maria is an incredibly creative person.  She thinks all the details of the design herself.  Sometimes at the hotel some elements of the decor change. </p><p>  The evening at the hotel is filled with romance.  Candles are lit in numerous lamps, illuminating everything around with an atmosphere of warmth and comfort.  You will not see this in any five-star hotel in Turkey and Egypt. </p><p>  Those who like parties, noisy events, discos and nightclubs should definitely choose another hotel.  Kallikratia is famous for silence, measured and peaceful.  Here, even in taverns you will not hear loud music.  It is an ideal place for families with children.
