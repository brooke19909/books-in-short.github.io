In this article we will talk about one of them - Shipilovskaya.  Let's start with her brief description. </p><h2>  About the Moscow metro station "Shipilovskaya" </h2><p>  "Shipilovskaya" - station of the southern direction of the Lublin-Dmitrovskaya (light green) metro line in Moscow.  Geographically located closer to the center of the capital Zyablikovo (South Administrative District).  On the light green side, it adjoins Borisovo and Zyablikovo.  The opening date of the station is December 2, 2011. </p>

    <p>  Two lobbies lead to the station: </p><ul><li>  Northern: there are three exits on two sides of Shipilovskaya street. </li><li>  South: two exits on both halves of Musa Jalil street.  There are elevators for lifting and lowering people with limited mobility. </li></ul><p>  The name of the Shipilovskaya metro station, the photo of which you will see throughout the article, was given by a street with exactly the same name.  She found it because of the nearby (less than 2 km) village of Shipilovo in 1966.  This is a rather ancient settlement - it is mentioned in sources dating from the 16th century.  In turn, it got its name from the personal name Shipil or Shipilo, which was not mentioned in the calendar.  In the project, this station was called Borisovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief characteristics of the station </h2><p>  Imagine a brief summary of the Shipilovskaya metro station: </p><ul><li>  Opening hours: 5.40 - 5.50. </li><li>  Closing time: 1.00. </li><li>  Integration with land transport: trolley - 11, buses - night number 5, 765, 711, 704 (704k), 694, 623, 291, 287, 151. </li><li>  Station building company: PJSC Transinzhstroy. </li><li>  Architects: N. Shurygina, N. Shumakov, V. Volovich. </li><li>  Type of station: shallow, single-vault. </li><li>  Type / form of platform at the station: island / direct. </li><li>  Depth of laying: about 10 m. </li><li>  Length / width of the platform: 162 m / 10 m. </li></ul><h2>  Design, architectural style </h2><p>  The metro station "Shipilovskaya", of course, is not as amazing as the "Kievskaya", "Komsomolskaya", "Taganskaya".  This is a laconic, modest single-vault station with an island platform.  Her project was developed in 2008 by a team of architects of Metrogiprotrans under the supervision of N.I.  Shumakova. </p>

    <p>  As conceived by the architects, Shipilovskaya was to form a single whole with the neighboring Zyablikovo and Borisovo in a constructive and architectural concept.  However, in the appearance of the station there is also a special individual feature - its arches adorn the caissons (recesses in the ceiling, arch, inner side of the arch) of an unusual triangular shape.  The underground lobby here, as at many other stations, connect the galleries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Station history </h2><p>  Let's touch on the main milestones of the Chipilovskaya metro station. </p><p>  The history of the object of our story began in 1993-1996.  Then on the eastern side of the street.  Musa Jalil was dug a hundred-meter pit under the station.  Until 1998, various preparatory work was carried out on the site - the opening of Shipilovskaya was planned in 2000. </p><p>  In September 1998, the grandiose construction was completely stopped - the reason was insufficient funding.  For two years (1999-2000) all working machinery and equipment were completely removed from the construction site.  And in 2004, a tunnel shield was raised from the pit - a large-scale prefabricated metal structure that ensures the safety of underground work.  The shield had already completely completed by that time the construction of the tunnel to Zyablikovo.  After extraction to the surface, he was sent to the construction of the subway in Tashkent. </p><p>  Work in the opposite direction was just begun - an identical design passed only 40 meters.  During conservation, this <span>tunneling shield</span> fell into disrepair, rusted.  However, in 2008-2009.  he was able to return to working form - the tunnel was completed. </p>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the support for the excavation pit was not set, it was filled with water, quicksand formed in it, and in some places mud appeared.  Its re-conservation would be pointless.  By the fall of 2008, the foundation pit was buried, and a new one was discovered in almost the same place. </p><p>  In 2009-2010  the construction of the Shipilovskaya metro station has finally gained an enviable pace.  In the middle of summer 2010, Shipilovskaya Street was blocked off due to the construction of the northern lobby.  The movement on it reopened only in November 2011. </p><p>  The discovery of Shipilovskaya happened on December 2, 2011.  The southern lobby became available to passengers only on December 15 - it took time to break in the escalators. </p><h2>  Who built the Shipilovskaya metro station? </h2><p>  Transinzhstroy PJSC acted as the general contractor; the <span>monolithic works</span> were carried out by SMU-3 of the Moscow Metrostroy.  The station hall was built of reinforced concrete-monolith.  In the concreting of the station‚Äôs trays and track walls in large-panel formwork (a structure that imparts a density to the structure), Megaform Al aluminum structures were used. </p><p>  Triangular caissons-light niches presented additional complexity for builders - such a vault is difficult to concrete in a standard way.  The company "Stalform Engineering" for this project has developed a special mechanized mobile formwork unit.  In total, 5 thousand m <sup>3 of</sup> concrete and 750 tons of reinforcement were laid at the station. </p>

    <p>  Although Shipilovskaya is not the most noticeable Mosmetro station, but a rare visitor will appreciate the triangular caissons on the arches, its functional importance cannot be overestimated.  It can be fully attributed to the most long-awaited - the opening of the station was delayed for 11 years. </p>
