    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  An excellent location is what experts say about the Olympus LCD project (Yekaterinburg).  Residents' reviews also confirm the advantageous location.  The place is just great, ideal for families with small children.  Some are scared by the neighborhood with the reinforced concrete plant, but in fact it is so far from the complex that it does no harm to its inhabitants.  Moreover, the exhaust pipe of the plant is directed in the opposite direction, so the smoke from it never reaches residential buildings. </p>

    <p>  The developer really tried and chose an environmentally friendly area for the construction of LCD "Olympus" (Yekaterinburg).  Customer reviews emphasize that even proximity to the roadway cannot spoil the freshness and purity of the air.  It even breathes differently, buyers share their enthusiasm.  For residents of modern megacities, the issue of ecology increasingly comes first.  They are ready to put up with cramped apartments, lack of infrastructure, but live surrounded by vegetation and breathe fresh air. </p><h2>  Type of apartments </h2><p>  LCD Olympus in Yekaterinburg has already become a kind of landmark in the city.  Almost all buyers focus on the apartment.  In our understanding, apartments are understood to mean premises that are not intended for a long stay, which do not make it possible to issue a permanent registration.  Apartment owners pay utility bills as for non-residential, that is - more expensive. </p><p>  What do the reviews tell us?  RC Olympus in Yekaterinburg is a modern construction company, whose managers call typical apartments apartments.  In fact, there is no difference between the two. </p><p>  Buyers say this is a great investment for those who look to the future and keep up with the times.  Some interest holders as soon as they found out about the start of sales of apartments in first-line houses, they immediately drew up a contract - such a profitable offer had not been in Yekaterinburg for a long time.  Residents of the city really invest without fear in housing of the future, and managers simplify the procedure for documenting. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  In today's world, the issue of security is important to everyone.  Parents complain that they can not let their children go for a walk, leave the car in the parking lot.  Here is the way the developer of the LCD Olympus found (Yekaterinburg).  Feedback from equity holders suggests that the territory of the complex is fenced.  Moreover, entry to it is carried out strictly by passes.  Thus, there will be no strangers in the territory, and therefore no reason for concern.  The territory and entrances of the houses will be equipped with a video surveillance system, which will increase the level of security. </p>
