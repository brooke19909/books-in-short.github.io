Someone prefers to do sewing or knitting in their free time, someone likes carburetors and engines more, some do not imagine their life without devoting any free minute to reading.  There are also those who <span>do not mind the soul</span> in flowers and other plants.  It is for people with a similar predilection that floristry exists - a type of art that is currently gaining more and more popularity. </p><p>  The creation of bouquets, compositions, collages from a variety of living, dry or even canned natural materials is now singled out in a separate category of design.  The most commonly used materials are flowers and leaves, as well as all kinds of berries, fruits, herbs, nuts and other components. </p><p>  One of the most attractive advantages of this type of art is that anyone can start to engage in it.  There are even special courses, the so-called floristry for beginners, at which specialists teach skills not just in gathering flowers in a bouquet, but in performing the same from a professional side.  Masters tell students about all the nuances that await them in future work.  To achieve professionalism, creating any composition, it is necessary to take into account many factors, among which the compatibility of different varieties of colors with each other, especially the color effect and storage of components.  A separate stage of floristry for beginners involves the study of floral etiquette and the rules for compiling different types of compositions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modern man has a desire to surround himself with beautiful things.  Floristics for beginners will help you learn how to independently decorate the surrounding space, whether it is your own apartment, or a <span>workplace</span> in the office.  As a rule, all kinds of solemn events can not do without decorations made of flowers, even if they are artificial.  Very often wedding attributes are made out with live compositions: halls, restaurants, newlyweds' cars, visiting ceremonies.  A popularly beloved holiday also does not pass by floristry: New Year's compositions decorate even the most unpredictable corners of the home. </p><p>  Going to one of the acquaintances and comrades for a birthday or other holiday event, in today's society it is customary to present not only a gift to the hero of the occasion, but also a bouquet of flowers, carefully composed by a specialist in the store.  And no self-respecting owner of a flower shop will hire a person who knows almost nothing about this industry.  Floristics for beginners in this situation will become a lifesaver for both the owner and the employee.  Almost every day there are some festive events.  But, unfortunately, no less often someone leaves our world.  Therefore, mourning floristry is just as important as any other.  Composed in accordance with all the rules, the composition is able to explain feelings close to the deceased.  For example, their grief mixed with the deepest respect and love for a departed relative. </p><p>  Whatever the reason, all kinds of compositions created on the basis of various representatives of the plant world, one way or another, accompany a person throughout his life.  Invented in the distant past by women with limited communication from the East, the <span>language of flowers is</span> quite often used at the present time.  Thanks to him, without words you can express love, hatred, recognition, contempt and many more different <span>emotions and feelings.</span>  It is a pity that not everyone understands this beautiful language and often perceive the presented bouquet, sent with negative emotions, as a gift from a well-wisher.  Although more often, of course, flowers speak of high feelings. </p>
