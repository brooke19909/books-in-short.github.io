And most likely, you came across more than one origami scheme (box).  If desired, it will not be difficult to find a photo guide on the manufacture of such a stylish packaging made in the origami technique on the Runet.  For work, you can use decorative paper purchased in a store, or you can decorate office white paper for a printer on your own in any photo editor. </p><p>  Most often, a square origami box comes across, however, it is worth noting that, in principle, any shape is possible.  It is simply a square circuit that is easier to find and easier to implement.  But in general, such a craft as an origami box with a lid can also have the shape of a rectangle, circle or oval, and even a star or a flower. </p><p>  Also, one box, made in the origami technique, can combine at the same time two geometric shapes.  Designer Akiko Yamanashi created an interesting origami scheme that allows you to fold an unusual and elegant box.  This model bears the corresponding name - ‚Äúbox in a box‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBoxInABox‚Äù. </p><p>  It is worth noting that such an <span>origami box</span> will require from you not only desire and patience, but also the presence of certain skills.  If you are new to origami, then you should start with a simpler option.  I‚Äôll try to give the necessary explanations with the help of which you can create your own individual packaging for a gift or for storing household items. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Origami box with a lid is made quite simply.  Creating such a masterpiece will not require any significant costs from you.  As a material, it is quite possible to use almost everything that you have at hand.  You can take a chocolate wrapper, colored school paper or a gift box you bought at the store (depending on what size box you want to make).  One has only to turn on the fantasy and begin to act! </p><p>  To create a box, you need to take two square plain or multi-colored sheets.  The lower part of our masterpiece will be performed in the origami technique.  For her, we need one square leaf.  Add it exactly in the middle - one corner must be combined with another.  Then expand the sheet and fold it in the same way as last time, but combining other corners.  And again, expand the sheet. </p><p>  Now you need to turn our square sheet on the other side and fold it in half.  As a result of addition, a rectangle should be obtained.  Then we lay out and turn the sheet over again.  Then fold it in half again, getting a rectangle, and fold the sheet out again. </p><p>  Next, we need to fold our sheet to the center of the upper left corner.  Similarly, we add the remaining three angles.  When all the corners meet in the middle, you need to fold the upper edge to the middle.  And then similarly fold the bottom edge. </p><p>  Next, you again need to open the folded lower and upper edges.  At the same time, two side triangles are taken out from the center.  The lower and upper edge are again folded to the center.  Now we‚Äôll decompose everything again. </p><p>  Now, according to the existing bends inward, we fold the right corner so that as a result one side of the box is obtained.  After that, the corner sticking out from above must be sent inwards through the existing bends.  As a result, one side is completely ready for us.  Other parties will be doing exactly the same as this one.  We do the same with the second side, while receiving the finished lower part of the box.  Excellent!  You can go to the cover. </p><p>  It is carried out in the same technique as the bottom.  At the beginning, all actions will exactly correspond to the operations that we performed when folding the bottom.  The only difference is that when adding the upper part to the center, you do not need to bring the corner by about 3 mm to it.  We do the same with the bottom. </p><p>  Next, you need to expand the sheet, turn it over and do it again.  All other steps are described in detail above for the bottom.  Performing everything that was done for the first half of the box, you can make a lid.  It will turn out a little more base, which will allow you to calmly close the box. </p><p>  Such an origami box has the shape of a square, but it is quite elegant in appearance and practical to use. </p>
