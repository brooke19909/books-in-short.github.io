But not all tourists come here for such dubious entertainment.  Staying in the center of Pattaya, you can be not only close to the center of nightlife, but also close to many inexpensive and good restaurants with seafood, markets and shopping centers, exchanger with an excellent rate, as well as souvenir shops.  This is a fairly cheap resort, especially compared to others.  You just need to know the secrets here.  For example, using local tuk-tuk, you should not name the place where you want to go.  Otherwise, public transport will be re-qualified as a taxi, and the price will increase accordingly.  But, in principle, it costs immeasurably cheaper than, for example, in Phuket.  The proximity to the transport hub, Woking Street, where all night clubs, go-go-bars and shows are located, Beach Road with its shops, is the main bonus of the Camelot 3 * complex described in this article.  Pattaya hotels rating puts Kamelot in one of the leading places.  Of course, it is incomparable with chic ‚Äúfives‚Äù like ‚ÄúSheraton‚Äù or ‚ÄúRoyal Cliff Beach Terrace‚Äù.  But it is worthy of being located next to the Citin Garden Resort, Areca Lodge, Manita Boutique and Ayyara Palace.  In addition, the unique location, reminiscent of a quiet oasis in the stormy sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãPattaya's life, gives it a lot of advantages relative to other hotels.  Camelot Hotel Pattaya 3 * reviews were called incomparable for lovers of various travels.  After all, you can go here with children and families - so many different interesting excursions are ready to offer you local travel agencies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And you can also travel by yourself: transport, as already mentioned, is quite inexpensive here.  In the city itself, you can climb the Buddha Hill or Khao Phra Nam Tak.  On one elevation is the famous panoramic observation deck, and on the other a temple of amazing beauty.  Both hills are located between the center of Pattaya and Jomtien.  And in the north of the city you will find an interesting ‚ÄúSanctuary of Truth‚Äù.  In addition, in the same area are two exhibitions with copies of Thai and Western European architectural masterpieces.  Not far from Jomtien - a unique aquarium in the form of a tunnel.  And having bought a tour on any street, you will see the most beautiful orchid park in Southeast Asia with beautiful landscapes, butterflies, cacti and palm trees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about hotel camelot hotel pattaya 3" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/747385.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The system by which tourists are fed at this hotel is somewhat different from the generally accepted in these places.  Hotel Camelot Hotel Pattaya 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya) offers guests not only breakfast, but also two meals a day and <span>full board.</span>  At the disposal of guests - a restaurant and bar.  Breakfast, although standard for Thailand, but good, hearty.  Sausages, sausage, potatoes with meat, rice with vegetables, chicken and shrimp, several types of soups (including the famous <span>Tom Yam),</span> omelets, scrambled eggs, pancakes, fruits - all this you can taste here.  Dishes in the restaurant offer two types - local and European cuisine.  The assortment of food is large, the portions are good.  But if you paid only for the breakfast room, then you still will not be left out of the way.  The prices in the hotel restaurant are low.  Anyway, the food in Thailand is so cheap that you can buy decent servings of good food from the scooters and eat in your room or on the beach.  In the shopping center "Festival", as well as in the supermarket "Tesco Lotus", there are food courts. </p><h2>  Where to sunbathe and swim? </h2><p>  The Camelot Hotel Pattaya has its own beach with sun loungers and parasols.  True, swimming here, like almost everywhere in the center of Pattaya, is impossible.  Sitting by the sea, enjoying the sunset, even eating is another matter.  But in order to swim, you have to travel to the islands, since the pier is a stone's throw away.  The shortest way to it is through the territory of the Elephant Hotel.  Everyone who wants to lie down on white sugar and splash in the turquoise sea goes on ferries.  At the pier you can buy tickets to the islands at different prices - from sixty to one hundred and fifty baht.  It depends on where you go - to a shared beach, where there will be a lot of people, or to a more secluded place.  If you do not want to travel to the islands, you can use tuk-tuk.  For thirty butts you will be taken to the distant <span>beaches of Pattaya.</span>  They are clean, the water is clear, and there are few people there.  But refreshment near the hotel is not a problem.  After all, the hotel has an outdoor pool with a children's section.  Around it - equipped terrace for sunbathing.  The pool itself is great.  You can swim there not only during the day, but also in the evenings or even at night if you wish.  Filtration in the pool - according to the latest technologies, the water is always clean and warm.  So you can spend time here if you were unable to leave for the islands.  By the way, the hotel gives out <span>beach towels</span> for painting <span>.</span>  Only you need to pass them before seven in the evening, otherwise - a fine.  If the pool is under repair, Camelot has an agreement with another hotel - Caesar.  A free shuttle service is available there.  In the evenings, you can sit by the pool with company: there are tables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Camelot hotel pattaya 3 pattaya" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/747399.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go on an excursion? </h2><p>  In Thailand, and especially in Pattaya, people come with different goals.  Someone - to fry in the sun, someone - for the delights of a night life, and someone - for exotic, adventure and interesting trips.  From the islands where they go to swim and sunbathe, tourists advise Koh Lan.  Moreover, they clarify that there are two beaches, so you need to choose the right ferry in order not to pay extra for a tuk-tuk ride to the sea.  The right boat goes to Tauen Beach.  Almost all vacationers advise against buying excursions from operators and guides, even if you come as an organized group to the Camelot Hotel Pattaya 3 *.  The travel agency, which is full on the neighboring streets, will arrange a trip for you much cheaper and no worse in quality.  Yes, and you can visit almost all local attractions on your own - the Nong Nooch Tropical Garden and elephant and crocodile shows, numerous temples, parks and exotic villages.  And if you drive a bike, then there are no problems at all.  Many go to local islands with overnight stays.  Pattaya is perceived by many as a starting point for traveling to neighboring countries, especially Cambodia.  Although there are some tourists who manage to fly from here to Kuala Lumpur. </p><h2>  Camelot <span>Hotel Pattaya 3 * (Pattaya,</span> Thailand): reviews </h2><p>  Hotel guests are unanimous that this is one of the best accommodation options in this price category.  The vast majority of guests are happy with the rest in it.  It is very good for a budget holiday and a variety of trips.  Despite the central location of the hotel, it is not at all noisy.  Tourists also note the contribution of the hotel to the history of culture: the film "Thai Voyage" was shot here.  Mostly young people and middle-aged people rest here.  Mostly these are travelers from Russia.  They have fun, especially since the price of rest allows, and the quality of service is good.  Therefore, many come here for the second time.  This hotel is especially popular with those travelers who came here to ride around the islands, make excursions, including to neighboring countries.  But when you return, convenience and comfort await you.  Perhaps this is the reason for the popularity of the hotel.  And shopping in Pattaya is cheaper than in other places.  From here you can bring coconut oil, handmade soap, <span>Thai rum</span> and much more. </p>
