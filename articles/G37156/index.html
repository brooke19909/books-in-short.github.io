    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The cozy hotel Hylatio Tourist Village is located in the suburbs of Limassol - the village of Pissouri, next to the bay of the same name.  This place is literally lively: there are many shops with a variety of goods, catering establishments, interesting sights and much more.  Paphos International Airport is 20 km away and Limassol Port is 35 km away. The famous Temple of Apollo Hilatis is 20 km from the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Hylatio Tourist Village is a hotel complex surrounded by a landscaped garden with a large oval pool.  Nearby is a small bowl designed for children.  It consists of two-story houses made in the style of a Greek village, which fully justifies the concept of the establishment: blue and white shades prevail, and the furniture is mainly made of light wood.  In addition, it can be noted that such colors favorably affect the emotional sphere of a person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Small cottages boast their own balconies for residents of the second floor and terraces for those who settled on the first level.  They offer a view mainly of the garden.  The hotel gives all vacationers the opportunity to feel at home, being in a foreign country.  After all, everyone has their own floor or a whole cottage.  Therefore, the complex is called the ‚Äútourist village‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Hylatio Tourist Village APT Hotel (Cyprus, Pissouri) for babies has its own small pool.  It is possible to place a crib in the room.  And the restaurant has a special menu and high chairs for feeding. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Guests can check in, paying only the price of the room, or choose the all-inclusive rate, which implies a higher price for accommodation, but the guest can eat and order drinks in the restaurant and bar at the hotel for free (there are restrictions).  Near the pool runs Apollo.  This is a bar serving a variety of drinks and light snacks.  The Ammos Restaurant specializes in Mediterranean and local cuisine, but only tourists who offer non-all inclusive accommodation are offered only dinner. </p><p>  Hylatio Tourist Village offers self-catering accommodation.  It is possible to buy products in the nearest stores and cook yourself.  And when there is no desire to develop culinary skills, it is worth going to a nearby cafe.  It is noteworthy that the Ammos restaurant prepares dishes with homemade olive oil, spices from the hotel's own garden and products that are purchased from trusted suppliers.  Therefore, the food in this institution is delicious and varied. </p>

    <h2>  Hylatio Tourist Village: reviews </h2><p>  In general, the opinion of vacationers about this hotel is positive.  Almost all the guests were satisfied with their vacation, not at all regretting that they spent it in this place.  But everywhere there are pros and cons.  Indignation at vacationers is caused by paid air conditioning and a hairdryer.  It would seem that the necessary items, for which other hotels do not have to pay, are not in the public domain in this hotel complex.  Other tourists complain that in this village there is absolutely nowhere to go.  Like, she is very small, and all the shops that are nearby are useless. </p><p>  But there are more positive reviews.  Most often, guests praise the dishes in the restaurant, which the cooks get very tasty.  The delight of large and small guests is caused by the garden - this is a beautiful area, planted with various greens and many flowers.  Multicolored, bright and juicy, this area is exactly what it is nice to admire and where you want to relax.  The general conclusion about the hotel is as follows: an ideal place for a relaxing pastime. </p><p>  The average cost of the tour is 43 thousand rubles for 7 nights.  This price may vary depending on the type of accommodation, the selected room and the duration of the reservation.  But this money is nothing compared to what impressions you can get from living in this hotel! </p>
