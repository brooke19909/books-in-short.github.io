Examples of New Year's compositions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You may already have heard the phrase ‚Äúsweet design,‚Äù but you still don‚Äôt know what it is.  In fact, this beautiful expression refers to the recently become popular compositions from various sweets, sweets and corrugated paper.  Other materials can be used as additional decoration, for example, floral ribbon, artificial moss, beads. </p><p>  . </p><div class="photo" data-original="indulgy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="suite design master class" class="if uuid-3019971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3019971.jpg"></div><p>  Very often, products created using the technique of sweet design are gifts.  They are used as decoration of a festive table, replacing bouquets of fresh flowers.  What is a suite design?  You can call it the art of making bouquets, only using confectionery instead of living plants.  From sweets you can create not only flowers, but also various fruits, nuts, animals. </p><h2>  How to choose materials for suite design </h2><p>  Making a DIY gift on any topic using sweet treats and a little imagination is not so difficult.  But first you need an idea.  The most relevant topic now is the celebration of the New Year.  New Year's design made of sweets, Christmas decorations and tinsel is an option for those who want to try to create a decoration without experience in needlework or with a child.  For the manufacture of the composition, you can use not only sweets and corrugated paper.  Natural materials related to winter and holiday themes will also look great.  You can take any candies to create crafts.  But most often needlewomen prefer sweets of a round shape or ordinary lollipops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Compositions from sweets: ideas and materials </h2><p>  Try to introduce a New Year's suite design.  What could it be?  Christmas wreath, decorative tree or some unusual composition from various decorations?  If you stop on a wreath, think about what elements it will consist of.  As a basis, you will need branches or a finished blank, which can be purchased at a needlework store.  For additional decoration, you can take real pine and fir cones, dried slices of oranges and tangerines, spices of an unusual shape, for example, cinnamon and star anise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="explore.lindtusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year's design" class="if uuid-3019976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3019976.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a Christmas tree from sweets </h2><p>  Christmas tree can be decorated using only one round candy.  As a basis, thick cardboard is suitable, which must be rolled up into a cone and secured with tape or using a hot glue gun.  The main thing is to be careful in the process of work so as not to burn yourself on hot elements. </p><p>  If you arrange the candies in a wrapper of gold and silver foil in a spiral, very tightly to each other, it is easy to get an unusual and beautiful decorative Christmas tree.  If desired, you can use Christmas toys made of foam or plastic.  It is easiest to fix sweets with glue or scotch tape.  After the holiday, and maybe during, sweets can be separated from the base, unfold and eat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.brit.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="design gifts" class="if uuid-3019980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3019980.jpg"></div><h2>  Sweet design: a workshop on creating nuts </h2><p>  When creating jewelry and compositions, you can do only sweets.  But usually for corrugated design and bouquets of sweets, corrugated paper is used as the main means of creating petals and leaflets for flowers.  It is convenient to use because of the unusual folded texture.  By stretching and straightening these folds, you can change the shape of the paper and create various bends that mimic the structure and shape of natural plants.  With its help, you can make hazelnuts.  They will also need round candies. </p><p>  For the top of the nuts you need: </p><ol><li>  Cut strips of paper with a width of 1.5-2 cm and a length of 5 cm. Here everything depends on the diameter of the candies themselves, so it is better to focus on them. </li><li>  Fold each of them several times and cut on one side so that a triangle forms. </li><li>  Each strip is slightly stretched to the sides in those places where the bases of the triangles are located. </li><li>  Use a glue gun to apply a little glue to the edge of the tape and candy.  Wrap the ribbon around the candy, stretching it a little. </li><li>  By folding paper, form leaflets.  Add glue if necessary. </li></ol><p>  From corrugated paper, you can also create spruce branches if you cut them on one side with a small fence, and then twist around a stick or long skewer.  You can find out more about what this suite design is by looking at examples of works by various masters.  It is often impossible to guess that intricate compositions are made of plain paper with folds and candy hidden under it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="explore.lindtusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweet design gifts" class="if uuid-3019974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3019974.jpg"></div><h2>  Basket with snowdrops using the technique of sweet design </h2><p>  Sweet design, what is it, no matter how pure creativity is?  Using this technique, you can create a variety of compositions on any topic.  For Christmas decor, ordinary flowers from sweets are also suitable if they are decorated in an unusual way, for example, placed in a fabulous sled or surrounded by snowy cones.  You can use fabulous motifs and embody the plot of "12 months" by making a basket of snowdrops from sweets.  For each color, you need only 3 round petals, a round lollipop and a stick for fastening.  It can be decorated with corrugated green paper.  Ribbons, beads and artificial spruce branches are suitable for additional decoration of such a basket. </p>
