At the moment, there are many manufacturers on the market who offer pretty good speakers.  But we need the best.  In this regard, floor magnets Magnat are very interesting.  She is rightfully considered one of the best in her class.  And its segment is exceptionally premium.  We will consider the most interesting and advanced models from this company.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.magnat.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor acoustics tycoon" class="if uuid-2919661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919661.jpg"></div><h2>  Magnat Company </h2><p>  The German company began its journey in 1979 with the release of premium speakers.  Her first speakers were called All Ribon 10. And they made a splash in the world of sound.  Prior to this, not a single floor acoustics sounded so high quality.  From this moment begins the ascent of "Tycoon" to Olympus.  In the eighties of the last century, the company was closely engaged in the production of car speakers, having achieved certain successes in this field.  A bit later, magnate amplifiers began to appear.  Both automotive and conventional.  The company produced both audiophile versions on lamps and traditional models with transistors.  However, it was precisely the floor-mounted acoustics Magnat that were most in demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="skinflint.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor acoustics magnate shadow 207 reviews" class="if uuid-2919670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919670.jpg"></div><p>  In modern realities, the company is not shy about experimenting and introducing new technologies.  For example, the manufacturer released a unique ‚Äúcombo‚Äù amplifier, which has lamps (for processing sound) and transistors (for amplifying it).  An unprecedented solution was the introduction of wireless technology in this amplifier with support for high-quality AptX profile.  Nobody has thought of this yet.  Nevertheless, the company‚Äôs hallmark is the floor magnate Magnat.  It was she who brought the company fame in due time.  Now we will analyze some of the most interesting options from the company's lineup and choose the best. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whathifi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor acoustics magnate quantum 677" class="if uuid-2919664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919664.jpg"></div><h2>  Magnat Shadow 207 </h2><p>  Premium acoustics "Tycoon Shadow 207" has a chic appearance and the same sound quality.  And this <span>speaker system</span> is simply incredible power (for its size) - as much as 340 watts.  In this case, the range of reproduced frequencies ranges from 22 hertz to 48 kilohertz.  This is the main feature of high-end acoustics.  It is worth noting that even at maximum volume, the speakers do not distort the sound in any way.  But this is provided that all the rest of the equipment is of the corresponding class.  Floor acoustics "Tycoon Shadow 207" has an excellent design.  The case is quite thin (which is strange for speakers with such power).  All speakers are covered with a protective net in the color of the case.  The case itself is made of high-quality MDF and coated with excellent veneer with excellent polishing.  Acoustics fits perfectly into any interior.  But it looks most spectacular with bare speakers (without a protective grille). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Positive feedback about Magnat Shadow 207 </h2><p>  What do those who have already purchased floor acoustics "Tycoon Shadow 207" say?  The reviews are mostly positive.  Newly made owners enjoy sound of unrivaled quality.  However, it is noted that in order to achieve the maximum effect, it is worthwhile to ‚Äúconjure‚Äù over the placement of speakers, since not at every point in the room you can hear the correct sound.  But this is true for any speaker system.  The owners of these speakers did not dare to twist them to maximum volume.  But even what they decided on was enough to understand that this acoustics does not distort the sound under any conditions.  Also, many speak positively about the appearance of the speakers.  The premium design of high-end acoustics is the norm. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  However, there were those who found the flaws.  Floor acoustics Hi-Fi "Tycoon Shadow 207" is very expensive.  Therefore, all and seek out flaws.  However, in this case there was only one.  And he does not affect the sound quality in any way.  It's about the speaker casing.  The fact is that the coating turned out to be glossy.  Naturally, it collects fingerprints at the speed of light.  Owners are unhappy that they often have to wipe the speaker system.  But a logical question arises: why touch the speakers at all after they are already installed in their places?  In any case, this drawback does not affect the sound quality in any way.  So, you can not consider it a drawback. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor acoustics tycoon 1000" class="if uuid-2919666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919666.jpg"></div><h2>  Magnat Quantum 677 </h2><p>  And these are already columns from the budget segment (yes, there are some).  Floor acoustics "Tycoon Quantum 677" has a fairly high power (350 watts) and a wide range of reproduced frequencies (from 20 hertz to 50 kilohertz).  This was previously unattainable in budget speakers.  All speakers are arranged in strict sequence.  The tweeters are cooled using a special liquid, which helps to avoid sound distortion.  Each speaker has two low-frequency speakers, which allows for incredible bass depth.  And the acoustics themselves look pretty good.  The speakers are made in a simple style and fit perfectly into any interior.  The case itself is made of high-quality MDF coated with matt veneer.  Great option.  The speakers are covered with protective screens.  Although without them, the speakers look much more brutal. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Magnat Quantum 677 </h2><p>  Floor acoustics "Magnate Quantum" is one of the best in the budget segment.  That is exactly what those who managed to acquire it think.  Users note the excellent sound quality in tandem with amplifiers from the "Marant" and "Yamaha".  However, the sound source and connecting wires also play a large role here.  It‚Äôs better not to regret money for them.  Then these speakers will sparkle.  It is worth mentioning such a comment: to swing these speakers, you need a fairly powerful amplifier.  And indeed it is.  The owners of this acoustics also liked the design.  Particular praise was given to the coating of the walls.  It is not glossy.  And this is also an advantage.  Some users claim that they managed to turn the volume to maximum, and now they need to change the windows in the apartment.  Well, quite possibly.  The power reserve of these speakers is enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skinflint.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor acoustics hifi tycoon shadow 207" class="if uuid-2919673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919673.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There <span>are</span> almost no negative reviews about this <span>speaker system</span> .  Just some audiophiles are unhappy with the mid frequencies that the speakers give out.  Say, they are inexpressive.  Well, what did they want from a budget speaker system?  So consider this a disadvantage is not entirely correct.  After all, the rest of the column cope with a bang.  If you want more powerful mid-range frequencies, then you should turn to high-end speaker systems.  A lot of them.  But they are very expensive.  As an option, the floor-mounted speaker system "Tycoon 1000" (Supreme Monitor line) is suitable.  For the price it is even cheaper than 677, but differs in more moderate characteristics.  At the same time, it provides the highest sound quality (especially when listening to rock, metal, symphonic music and other compositions with a clear rhythm).  But audiophiles and this option will not work.  Nevertheless, reviews about the 1000th model are extremely positive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pricechecker.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="floor acoustics magnate shadow 207" class="if uuid-2919668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2919668.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the floor acoustics "Tycoon" of various models.  What can be said as a conclusion?  These <span>speakers</span> are among the best in today's market.  They provide the highest sound quality and superior design.  True connoisseurs of quality sound will be happy with the purchase.  Moreover, the Magnat‚Äôs arsenal has quite interesting budget models that will not break through the perceptible gap in the family budget. </p>
