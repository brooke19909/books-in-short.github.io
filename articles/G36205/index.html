    <h2>  History of A Coru√±a </h2><p>  In ancient times, this land was inhabited by Celtic tribes.  In the second century BC, the settlement was conquered by the Romans and turned into a major trading port.  In the X century, during the reign of King Bermudo II, a fortified fort was erected here.  Since then, A Coru√±a has become the country's most important port city. </p><p>  The history of the city is inextricably linked with the sea.  From these shores the Roman legions set off to conquer Britain.  In 1588, the legendary Spanish Invincible Armada left La Coruna port on its last voyage.  After her death, the city was captured by English pirates, led by <span>Francis Drake.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the 17th century, the port of A Coru√±a became the most important center of trade for Spain with the New World.  The city was occupied in 1809 by the army of Napoleon, but pretty soon liberated by the British army, commanded by General <span>John Moore,</span> who died during the liberation. </p><p>  Currently, the city of La Coru√±a in Spain maintains the status of a major port of importance for the country.  In addition, several industries are successfully developing here: shipbuilding, oil refining, textile and food. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain city of la coru√±a" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1793427.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The climate in the city, as, however, in all of Galicia, is temperate marine.  It is characterized by not too sultry summers and mild winters.  In other words, tourism favors the weather.  Spain is famous for its mild and comfortable climate, and this city is no exception.  February is considered the coldest month.  At this time, the thermometer does not rise above +3 ¬∞ C, the warmest month is August, when the air warms up to +22 ¬∞ C on average. </p><p>  In winter and autumn, the weather is unstable, often strong winds blow and heavy rainfall falls.  Summer is sunny and arid, with precipitation at this time quite rare.  The most comfortable visit to the city is from May to September. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  for some reason, they bypass La Coruna, preferring the <span>beaches of Ibiza</span> or the <span>architecture of Barcelona.</span>  And completely in vain.  Many simply don‚Äôt know what to see in A Coru√±a.  This city is actually a wonderful resort in which a beach holiday is combined with an informative one, because there are many interesting and memorable places and natural monuments. </p>

    <p>  The city stretches along the coastline of the Atlantic coast.  It is a huge beach that is its main natural attraction.  Being on the beach, vacationers can see several architectural monuments of the city.  On the one hand is the Riasor Stadium - the site of the Deportivo football club, on the other - the National Museum of Technology and Science. </p><p>  La Coru√±a in Spain can be called a technological city, because until now it replenishes the budget to a greater extent through its own production.  Do not neglect the fact that this is the second largest port of Galicia after Vigo.  From here, products are sold that are produced in Galicia and the surrounding provinces.  Nevertheless, the city seeks to improve its status not only among its residents, but also in the eyes of the world community. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For several centuries, the city has been the shadow of the capital of Galicia - Santiago de Compostela.  And only in 2010 managed to slightly shake the greatness of the competitor.  It was then that the organizers of the largest music festival in the country allowed La Coru√±e to broadcast satellitely.  The next step to leadership was the opening of a museum of science, which prophesied the glory of the American Museum of Guggenheim (New York). </p><h2>  A Coru√±a in Spain: Attractions </h2><p>  For travelers who prefer leisurely walking during sightseeing, A Coru√±a is a real find.  Of course, it is preferable that one of the guides show you the local beauty. </p><h2>  Maria Pete Square </h2><p>  In La Coru√±a, unlike many <span>Spanish cities, the</span> main square is not called Plaza Mayor, but Maria Pita square.  She was named after the local heroine defender, who, together with the men, opposed the British Armada in <span>1589.</span>  For her courage and heroism, King Philip II granted her a life-long pension and allowed her to export mules to Portugal.  A statue of Mary with a spear in her hand rises above the square opposite the city hall. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Coruna Spain Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1793429.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  This is not the oldest building in La Coru√±a (Spain).  It was built in 1912.  But it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful in the city.  Inside the majestic building today, in addition to the city hall itself, there is a clock museum, as well as a pinacoteca, which presents the works of the best Galician painters. </p><p>  Visit the art gallery, which presents portraits of all the mayors who ruled the city at different times.  They are made by many craftsmen and in a different manner.  From Maria Pita Square, as a rule, tourists begin acquaintance with the old part of the city. </p><h2>  Old city </h2><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLa Coru√±a in Spain is famous for its exquisite house facades, many of which date back to the early 19th century.  Of particular interest to tourists is the wide Avenida de la Marina.  Glazed balconies that face the harbor protect homes from piercing winds.  They gave La Coruna a second name - the ‚Äúcrystal city." </p>

    <p>  Another attraction of the Old Town is the ancient Romanesque church of Santa Marya del Campo (XII century).  Today in its building is a museum of sacred art, which presents various works.  Here is another very beautiful church - Santiago, built at the beginning of the XIII century.  Unfortunately, in 1651 it was destroyed by an explosion and later rebuilt.  No less beautiful is the monastery of Santa Barbara, built in the middle of the 15th century.  It is located on the square of the same name. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather la coruna spain" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1794739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Picasso House Museum </h2><p>  For five years a boy lived in this house, who was destined to become a brilliant painter.  The Picasso House Museum is a typical mansion in Galicia, which to this day has been preserved almost in its original form.  The museum presents reproductions of the youthful works of the great master, as well as a unique collection that consists of only four works of his father - a professor, artist, and teacher at the A. Guarda Institute, where Picasso later studied. </p><p>  Despite his very young age, Picasso, living in this house, already worked a lot: he painted portraits for a local magazine and even sometimes painted caricatures. </p>

    <h2>  Hercules Tower </h2><p>  This is the oldest Roman lighthouse in the world, which has survived to this day.  It is under the protection of UNESCO.  According to legend, the tower was built by Hercules himself after the completion of the tenth feat - victory over Gerion.  Researchers believe that the lighthouse was built at the end of the 1st century AD.  But what is especially surprising, the lighthouse is still operational and is a great pride of the inhabitants of the city, its image can be seen on the coat of arms of A Coru√±a. </p><p>  You can climb the 55-meter tower by breaking 242 steps.  A stunning view of the city opens from above.  Near the lighthouse, the Spaniards created a sculpture park in which you can see the figure of Haronai, a wind rose with Celtic inscriptions. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Do you know where the longest embankment in Europe is?  That's right, in A Coru√±a.  Its length is thirteen kilometers, and it goes around almost the entire city.  Along it are installed the original bright red lights, which are made in the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  Considering the drawings that are applied to their foundations, you can get acquainted with the history of the city.  For example, at the Hercules Tower the images remind of the Roman period in the history of the city, at the School of the Arts on lanterns you can see sketches in the style of Picasso, and at the oceanarium - drawings on the theme of the underwater world. </p><h2>  A Coru√±a in Spain: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists consider their trip to this Spanish town a success.  Many liked the fact that there aren‚Äôt as many tourists here as in other Spanish resorts.  It is quite easy to find a hotel that meets your needs and financial possibilities.  Travelers also liked the opportunity to combine relaxation on a well-kept beach with a sightseeing beach.  There are many interesting sights that you must see with your own eyes. </p>
