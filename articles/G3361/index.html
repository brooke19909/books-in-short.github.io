  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Abiotic environmental factors and their impact on living organisms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Abiotic</span> environmental <span>factors</span> are determined by climatic conditions, as well as soil and water. </p><p>  <strong>Classification</strong> </p><p>  There are several classifications of abiotic factors.  One of the most popular divides them into such components: </p><ul><li>  physical factors <span>(light, temperature,</span> barometric pressure, humidity); </li><li>  chemical factors (composition of the atmosphere, mineral and organic matter of the soil, pH level in the soil and others) </li><li>  mechanical factors (wind, landslides, water and soil movements, terrain, etc.) </li></ul><p>  Abiotic environmental factors significantly affect the distribution of species and determine their range, i.e.  geographical area, which is the habitat of various organisms. </p><p>  <strong>Temperature</strong> </p><p>  Particular importance is given to temperature, since this is the most important indicator.  Depending on the temperature, abiotic environmental factors differ in thermal belts, which are associated with the life of organisms in nature.  It is cold, temperate, tropical and <span>subtropical zones.</span>  The temperature, which is favorable for the life of organisms, is called optimal.  Almost all organisms are able to live in the range of 0 ¬∞ - 50 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Depending on the ability of <span>living organisms to</span> exist in different temperature conditions, they are classified as: </p><ul><li>  eurythermic organisms adapted to the conditions of sharp temperature fluctuations; </li><li>  stenothermic organisms that exist in a narrow temperature range. </li></ul><p>  Organisms living mainly where the continental climate prevails are considered eurythermal.  These organisms are able to withstand severe temperature fluctuations (dipterous larvae, bacteria, algae, helminths).  Some eurythermal organisms can fall into a state of hibernation if the temperature factor ‚Äútightens‚Äù.  Metabolism in this state is significantly reduced (badgers, bears, etc.). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stenothermic organisms can be both among plants and animals.  For example, most marine animals survive at temperatures up to 30 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Animals are divided according to their ability to maintain their own thermoregulation, i.e.  constant body temperature, on the so-called poikilothermal and homoothermal.  The former can change their temperature, while the latter, it is always constant.  All mammals and a number of birds are homeothermic animals.  Poikilothermic include all organisms, except for some species of birds and mammals.  Their body temperature is close to ambient temperature.  During evolution, animals belonging to the homoyothermal have adapted to defend themselves from the cold (hibernation, migration, fur, and more). </p><p>  <strong>Shine</strong> </p><p>  Abiotic environmental factors are light and its intensity.  Its importance is especially great for photosynthetic plants.  The level of photosynthesis is affected by the intensity of <span>solar radiation, the</span> qualitative composition of light, and the distribution of light over time.  However, bacteria and fungi are known that can multiply for a long time in complete darkness.  Plants are divided into photophilous, heat-tolerant and heat-loving. </p><p>  For many animals, daylight hours are important, which affects sexual function, increasing it during the long daylight hours and depressing during the short daylight hours (autumn or winter). </p><p>  <strong>Humidity</strong> </p><p>  Humidity is a complex factor and represents the amount of water vapor in the air and water in the soil.  The lifespan of cells, and, accordingly, of the whole organism, depends on the level of humidity.  Soil moisture is affected by the amount of precipitation, the depth of water in the soil and other conditions.  Moisture is necessary for the dissolution of minerals. </p><p>  <strong>Abiotic factors of the aquatic environment</strong> </p><p>  Chemical factors are not inferior in importance to physical factors.  A large role belongs to the gas <span>composition of the atmosphere,</span> as well as the composition of the aquatic environment.  Almost all organisms need oxygen, and a number of organisms need nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or methane. </p><p>  Physical abiotic environmental factors are the gas composition, which is extremely important for those living creatures that live in the aquatic environment.  In the waters of the Black Sea, for example, there is a lot of hydrogen sulfide, which is why this basin is considered not very favorable for many organisms.  Salinity is an important component of the aquatic environment.  Most aquatic animals live in salty waters, fewer in freshwater, and even less in slightly brackish water.  The distribution and reproduction of aquatic animals is affected by the ability to maintain the salt composition of the internal environment. </p>
