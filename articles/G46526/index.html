    <p>  Of course, even this price may seem rather high.  But the hotel is worth the money - it is worth looking at reviews about it, which are very supportive.  Almost all the eulogies about this hotel are justified. </p><p>  Judging by the numerous enthusiastic reviews, this place captivates with the beauty of nature.  In addition, travelers are attracted by the magnificent panorama of the sea, which can be observed from the windows, and, of course, a measured, relaxing holiday. </p><p>  Rest in this place and service leave only positive memories of the holidays. </p><p>  Apartments for sale are also offered here.  Their price starts from 58 thousand euros.  This, in principle, is even less than the cost of an apartment in a large Russian city. </p><h2>  Hotel Santa Marina 4 (Turkey) </h2><p>  It so happens that a hotel with a certain name can be not only in one country, but also in others.  This often happens with hotels that belong to the same network. </p><p>  There may also be a slight difference in the name of the hotel itself, which, in principle, is rarely paid attention to.  Therefore, when booking places on various sites, it is necessary to indicate not only the name of the hotel, but also the country where it is located. </p>

    <p>  Dry cleaning and laundry services are also available.  To communicate with your family, Wi-Fi is used (Internet access 24 hours a day). </p><p>  Tourists visiting the beauty of Turkey by car will enjoy free parking at the hotel. </p><p>  Since the hotel has a lot of Russian-speaking public, hotel workers who directly contact travelers can speak Russian.  Of course, they do not own them ideally, but understanding them is not difficult. </p><p>  Guests with children can use the services of a highly qualified babysitter.  They also have a safe playground and a special entertainment room. </p><p>  The restaurant and bar offer excellent local cuisine.  The hotel operates on all the familiar all-inclusive systems. </p><p>  But still this is a fairly calm hotel for measured relaxation.  There are no night discos here.  Basically, all animation ends at 22 o‚Äôclock.  Therefore, the hotel is more suitable for those who want to enjoy the dimensionality and even some laziness while living here. </p><h2>  Accommodation prices </h2><p>  Many people choose this place also because Santa Marina Hotel 4 Antalya is located in close proximity to the magnificent pebble-sandy beach of Konyaalti.  It is incredibly clean.  You can stroll along it slowly among palm trees or enjoy some cocktail in a cafe on the coastal line. </p><p>  The price for an ordinary double room starts from 1800 rubles per day.  In principle, for two it is not such a fabulous sum for a wonderful stay in Santa Marina Hotel 4 (Antalya). </p><p>  Reviews about this hotel are pretty good.  Of course, some may speak negatively about the hotel.  The reason is that vacationers, most likely, simply made a mistake with the choice, perhaps they wanted to relax in some more dynamic place. </p><p>  In fact, the service of this place deserves the highest praise. </p><h2>  Great vacation in Crete </h2><p>  Ammoudara is a small village in the prefecture of Heraklion (Greece).  The village is located on a beautiful sandy beach.  Along the main street there are numerous restaurants, souvenir shops and, of course, hotels, and one of them is Santa Marina Hotel 4 (Crete). </p>
