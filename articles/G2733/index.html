Patong, the most vibrant and popular beach of Phuket, is about 1 kilometer from the 3 * <span>The Natural Resort</span> hotel (the hotel is located on the third coastline).  If you walk, it will take 15-20 minutes of a leisurely step along the busy city streets past numerous shops with exotic fruits and souvenirs, as well as shops with everything you need.  Approximately the same time will take the road to the most famous major shopping center Jungceylon.  Here you can eat delicious seafood, which will be cooked right in front of you the way you yourself want, to buy fruits and other goodies.
