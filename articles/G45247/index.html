The island of Corfu is part of a vast archipelago belonging to this power, and at the same time it is considered a place where the traditions of the leading countries of Europe are mixed.  The reason was both history and geopolitics, and even the locals themselves, who never considered themselves purebred Greeks.  About why you should definitely visit this mysterious place, what wonders await any tourist there - read in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece korf island" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/264056.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous island of Corfu is located "at the entrance" to the <span>Adriatic Sea, which</span> is why since ancient times it has been the cause of endless disputes between countries that have access to these waters.  The original owners of these lands were Greeks, but after they were pressed by the Romans, they were followed by other Italian ethnic groups.  In the Middle Ages, both the French and the British dominated here.  During the Second World War, the Germans took power, and only in peacetime Greece began to own this region.  The island of Korfa, therefore, was able to reunite the traditions and beliefs of all those peoples that once reigned here, and especially imbued with Italian culture.  Getting here, every tourist almost immediately becomes convinced that this is far from Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece corfu island vacation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/264054.jpg" width="600"></div>

This region is built up with typically Italian houses and temples.There are chic palaces with massive columns, similar to those that were mainly built in Italy.  There is one more aspect on which the state of <span>Greece</span> ‚Äúcloses its eyes‚Äù <span>.</span>  <span>The island of</span> Korfa "speaks" in a very specific dialect, in which two fundamentally different languages ‚Äã‚Äãare mixed - Greek and Italian.  Even people living on the mainland, coming here, cannot thoroughly understand what the islanders speak to them about. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece corfu island prices" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/264055.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <p>  The charm of these lands is that it is not Italy yet, but not Greece either.  <span>Corfu</span> Island <span>, the rest of</span> which is paradise beaches, endless excursions, and sightseeing, has a length of only 65 kilometers.  But, despite this, you can enjoy its expanses endlessly, discovering more and more new horizons.  Here, two defense fortresses were erected by the Venetians - Old and New, in the capital Kerkyra there is an imperial palace, erected in honor of Elizabeth of Austria.  There are also buildings of the ancient Byzantines, who also dominated these lands for a short time. </p><p>  Arriving here, everyone begins to understand that it is not as simple as it seems at first glance Greece.  Corfu Island (vacation prices, by the way, are quite affordable here, and the travel agency will offer you various options, from bungalows to the most comfortable hotels), it is also famous for its cozy restaurants, which are located mainly near the sea.  This is an ideal place for a <span>honeymoon</span> or for relaxing with kids.  It is advisable to plan a trip with children on an all-inclusive basis.  Having been here, then for a long time you recall the atmosphere left by the ancient ancestors of these places - the Greeks and Romans. </p>
