    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The estate is very picturesque.  She stands on a high hill and seems to hang over a huge pond.  Around the house there is a magnificent park.  The estate is located in the South-Eastern district of the capital.  This is a rare nineteenth-century palace and park ensemble.  Small palladian style villa.  It is surrounded by the magnificent Lublin Park with a picturesque pond. </p><h2>  N. A. Durasov (1760‚Äì1818) </h2><p>  One of the richest people in Moscow of that period.  The grandson and heir to the millionaire Myasnikov.  Owner of the Nikolskoye-on-Cheremshan estates and Lyublino near Moscow.  Nikolai Alekseevich was a holder of the Order of <span>St. Anne, a</span> real state adviser.  Durasov spent a single life, had no direct descendants. </p><p>  After Durasov, the estate was inherited by his sister, Agrafena Alekseevna.  At that time, she was the mistress of Gorky near Moscow.  She married her relative - M.Z. Durasov - Lieutenant General, thus retaining the surname of a kind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor lublin reviews" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464086.jpg" width="600"></div>

The estate was inherited by the daughter of G.P. Godunov - Agrafena Grigoryevna, who later became the wife of Prince V.N. Prozorovsky, adjutant of Prince Golitsyn.  When the estate was inherited by V.P. Prozorovsky, it was already called Lyublino. </p><p>  In 1790, the estate passed into the possession of Countess Razumovskaya, and then - to Princess A. A. Urusova. </p><h2>  Manor Lublino - nineteenth century </h2><p>  In 1800, the estate was acquired by N.I. Durasov, who made it more than all previous owners so that his estate would later become a national architectural and historical monument. </p><h2>  Manor Lublino - the palace of N. A. Durasov </h2><p>  The main building is the famous rotunda.  According to unconfirmed reports, the creator of the project is I.V. Egotov.  There is a version that its author is R. R. Kazakov, and the project was implemented by I. V. Egotov.  In such a tandem, they worked in a neighboring estate in Kuzminki.  The exact date of construction has not yet been established.  Tentatively, construction was completed in 1801, the decoration of the facades continued until 1810. </p><p>  The main house is built in the shape of a cross.  In the center is the rotunda hall, which is surrounded by four equally luxurious halls inscribed in an open colonnade.  There is a legend that in this way Durasov immortalized the cross of St. Anna received for his services to the Fatherland.  But not only this famous Lyublino estate.  The palace of N. A. Durasov included a <span>theater, a theater</span> school, a house for actors, a horse yard that have survived to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Lyublino Palace n a durasova" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464087.jpg" width="600"></div>

The three-story mansion is painted with unique frescoes and decorated with statues.  One of them - "Silence" - received symbolic significance when the revolutionaries robbed the estate. </p><p>  At dinner parties that took place in these halls, many notable people came, including the widow of Emperor Paul the First, Empress Maria Fyodorovna.  Around the Palace there is a garden and park ensemble with a beautiful pond, which is now called Lublin.  Fortunately, the wing, the manager‚Äôs house and the horse yard have survived to our time. </p><p>  In the second half of the nineteenth century, the greenhouse was rebuilt as living quarters.  After 1872, when the Polytechnic Exhibition was held, an exhibition wooden church was moved to the estate.  Unfortunately, in 1904 Lublino Park was destroyed by tornado.  Manor of Durasov, whose owner at that time was N.K. Golofteev, began to rebuild.  Cottages are built on the shore of the pond, which are subsequently leased.  They have not survived to our days. </p><h2>  Lublin in the twentieth century </h2><p>  In 1919, the estate was nationalized.  In different years, the Lyublino estate was used as a school, a house of culture, a police department, during the war years its premises were used as residential.  In the nineties, the main house became a private property, and restoration began, which was completed in 2005. </p><p>  Today in this room is a museum that runs daily from eleven to seventeen hours.  In 2007, numerous tenant enterprises were withdrawn from Lublin Park - a ski club, a private car service, a children's theater studio, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor lyublino marriage registration" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464088.jpg" width="600"></div>
