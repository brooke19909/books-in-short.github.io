  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vacations in the camp "Orange mood"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each time before the school holidays begin, a dilemma arises for parents: what to do with the child - to go on vacation to grandma or take a vacation so as not to leave him unattended?  But what to do for those who do not have such an opportunity?  There is a way out - for example, you can send your child to the Orange Mood camp, located near Perm.  For many years now, every shift has been offered a new cultural and entertainment program that will not allow your child to get bored alone. </p><h2>  Infrastructure camp "Orange mood" </h2><p>  The camp infrastructure meets all standards.  There are sports grounds for playing soccer, basketball and volleyball, a dance floor, a swimming pool and even a bathhouse.  Cozy rooms are designed for 2-5 children, which allows you to maintain optimal order and respect personal space.  The camp is equipped with everything necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãmodern equipment and sports equipment, so that children can relax away from home in the usual conditions for them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="globustk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp building" class="if uuid-3063435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3063435.jpg"></div><h2>  Camp services "Orange mood" </h2><p>  The territory is about 50 thousand m¬≤, and despite such a vast territory, it is under round-the-clock protection.  The perimeter of the camp is fenced, which will not allow outsiders to pass.  In addition, CCTV cameras are located throughout the area.  Additionally, the safety of children is monitored by security guards who will not allow them to go outside the camp alone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The location of the camp "Orange mood" in the countryside allows children to significantly improve their health.  After all, there is not only fresh air, crystal clear water, but also a large abundance of greenery.  Despite the fact that the camp is surrounded by greenery, all types of harmful insects are completely absent on its territory.  This is due to the fact that antiparasitic treatment is carried out systematically around the entire perimeter of the territory. </p><p>  The "Orange Mood" camp is a modern recreation center, but despite this, it does not have internet, and for the whole shift your child will completely get rid of his Internet addiction.  Since the ‚ÄúOrange Mood‚Äù is not just a camp, but also a center for personal development, children here not only relax, but also develop in many ways.  A six-time balanced diet is presented to all vacationers.  The children's menu is tailored to the needs of a growing organism and includes fermented milk products, first and second courses, salads, compote and even dessert.  On a daily basis, fresh fruits are included in the diet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orange-perm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp &quot;Orange mood&quot;" class="if uuid-3063433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3063433.jpg"></div><h2>  Camp Cultural Program </h2><p>  The cultural program of the camp "Orange mood" in Perm is very rich, here you can master acting, media creation, learn art design, dance, drawing and attend master classes that teach needlework.  The daily schedule is so tight that the child simply will not have time to be bored alone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A camp for a shift can take no more than 50-55 children, in the future they are divided into teams of 10-12 people.  This allows children to more easily adapt in the team and express themselves creatively. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kidpassage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun is in full swing" class="if uuid-3063426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3063426.jpg"></div><h2>  Guest reviews and tips </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Orange mood camp (Perm) is very popular among children aged 7 to 16 years, and no wonder, because experienced staff can find an individual approach to each child.  By the way, in addition to the summer shift, in the camp "Orange mood" there is also a winter one, dedicated to the winter holidays. </p><p>  You can book a ticket either directly at the address: Perm, Gagarin Boulevard 30 B, or on the official site of the orange-perm.ru camp.  When you make a voucher, you should always have a medical certificate with you (form 079 / y) and a copy of the medical policy. </p><p>  Children should definitely bring along casual clothes and shoes, a tracksuit, as well as elegant clothes for special occasions.  By the way, in order to capture the brightest moments, you can take a camera or camcorder with you, but a tablet or computer is definitely not needed here. </p><p>  Are you planning your next vacation?  Go for it!  Buy a ticket to the Orange Mood camp for children and your child will remember such a vacation for a long time. </p>
