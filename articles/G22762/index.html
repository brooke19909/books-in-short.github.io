But all models, at least a dozen years ago, were connected by one design feature - wires that interfered and got mixed up at the most inopportune moment. </p><p>  Modern technologies in the face of the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi protocols have allowed to abandon the "leash", making it possible to produce wireless headphones.  But such a solution entailed a significant complication of the design, and in addition to the obvious advantages, some shortcomings appeared.  Here we have a slurred sound, limited battery life, as well as a small reception radius. </p><p>  Of course, high-quality wireless Bluetooth headphones are devoid of the above disadvantages, well, or at least less susceptible to them.  But a good half of gadgets of this kind, as well as the users themselves, have to put up with such features. </p><p>  We‚Äôll try to identify the best <span>wireless headphones that</span> have distinguished themselves by their quality component, good price-to-performance ratio, as well as a lot of positive feedback from users. </p><h2>  JBL T110BT </h2><p>  This is a budget option from a venerable brand.  Wireless headphones from the JBL T110BT series have exactly invested in their category of gadgets for up to 2,000 rubles.  Despite the relatively low cost, the model turned out to be surprisingly high quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flipkart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl headphones" class="if uuid-2390552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390552.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews on the wireless headphones of this series, they sound very good and have decent battery life.  But at maximum volume, overloads are already felt and the tracks begin to merge into cacophony, so you should not get carried away with bass. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The T110BT is a great <span>wireless headphone for your phone</span> and sports.  The gadget received all the significant advantages of this form factor - good sound insulation, modest size and very low weight.  The battery with the control panel is low enough not to strain the user with its weight. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the synergy with Apple devices.  Wireless headphones when connected to the "apple" gadgets show the real battery charge.  In general, it was the rejection of the classic ‚Äújack‚Äù in iPhones that made such a headset noticeably more popular. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  In addition, the T110BT is a <span>wireless headset with microphone.</span>  The characteristics of the latter are not so hot, but the interlocutor‚Äôs speech is quite legible, and the conversations themselves have a minimal effect on the battery charge. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, the model was a success.  With a more than adequate and affordable price tag, JBL wireless headphones offer a very good return.  And for a good half of domestic consumers, these are two especially critical factors.  Also, many note the excellent work of wireless headphones with Apple-devices. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  good sound; </li><li>  support for A2DP functionality; </li><li>  a decent indicator of battery life; </li><li>  wide reception radius; </li><li>  quite adequate cost for the available characteristics. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  control LED is too bright; </li><li>  cacophony at maximum volume. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 1900 rubles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Koss BT190i </h2><p>  These wireless headphones have a very original design.  But the model boasts not only one attractive look.  Here we have a reliable mount in the ears, intuitive and convenient operation, as well as excellent moisture protection.  So the gadget can be called sports with full confidence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picstop.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones koss" class="if uuid-2390553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390553.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by consumer reviews, there are no complaints about the sound quality.  In addition, these wireless headphones picked up awards at last year's thematic exhibitions, and independent ones.  And that says a lot. </p><h2>  Gadget Features </h2><p>  But there is a fly in the ointment, which is inherent in all sports models.  The pay for light weight and modest size was the autonomy of the device.  The maximum that you can squeeze out of the gadget is 3.5 hours of work.  In principle, one training should be more than enough.  Moreover, the model will not interfere with the conquest of the peaks, like other long-playing with large dimensions. </p><p>  Headphone pros: </p><ul><li>  very good sound; </li><li>  moisture protection; </li><li>  reliable fastening; </li><li>  clear and convenient operation; </li><li>  original appearance. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  comparatively short battery life. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 3000 rubles. </p><h2>  Logitech Wireless Headset H600 </h2><p>  This model was developed specifically for fastidious gamers who need not only high-quality sound, but also the presence of an intelligent microphone to communicate with the team.  The eminent developer did an excellent job.  The model received a lot of positive feedback from popular subject magazines, as the best option in the mid-budget segment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mipcequipos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Logitech headphones" class="if uuid-2390556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390556.jpg"></div><p>  Wireless headphones calmly catch the signal within the apartment and transmit sound in proper quality.  Judging by user reviews, they have no complaints about ergonomics, sound or a microphone.  The model will also be a great help for call center operators, where focus, ‚Äúinternal‚Äù silence and high-quality communication are important.  The case has a convenient microphone mute button and an accurate volume control. </p><p>  For picky music lovers, as well as those who appreciate surround and exceptionally clear sound, this is not the best option, and the price, in fact, does not meet such requests.  Well, for gamers and ordinary PC users - this is a great solution. </p><h2>  Headphone Features </h2><p>  It should also be noted that the build quality of the model is at a very high level: there are no backlashes, creaks, crevices or crunches here.  This is a solid model that will last you more than one year, especially since the Logitech brand has always been distinguished by quality products and the same after-sales service. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  very good sound output; </li><li>  high-quality microphone; </li><li>  excellent ergonomic indicators; </li><li>  good soundproofing properties; </li><li>  convenient and intuitive control on the case; </li><li>  nice looking appearance; </li><li>  more than adequate price for the available characteristics. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  not for lovers of pure and surround sound in high quality. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 5000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã160 </h2><p>  This model has shown its best side in tandem with the TV.  If the kids in the next room or a neighbor with a puncher do not let you calmly watch TV, then this model will come in handy.  The gadget produces surround and clear sound at the output and copes well with low frequencies, even at maximum volume. </p><div class="photo" data-original="symphonyhifi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones for tv" class="if uuid-2390555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390555.jpg"></div><p>  It should also be noted that the bluetooth receiver (base) involves connecting other wireless headphones, and not necessarily from the same brand.  Users speak very well about the model and its capabilities.  The only thing owners sometimes complain about is the management that is not very clear and convenient, which takes a lot of getting used to. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound output; </li><li>  ergonomic design; </li><li>  the ability to connect other headphones from third-party manufacturers to the receiver; </li><li>  the presence of neodymium magnets in the design. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  management can not be called understandable and convenient. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 9000 rubles. </p><h2>  Beats Powerbeats 3 Neighborhood </h2><p>  The manufacturer positions the product as wireless headphones for the iPhone.  The model will be a great option for fans to walk along the city streets to their favorite compositions.  The series received four original colors: ‚Äúblue wave‚Äù, ‚Äúburgundy cherry‚Äù, ‚Äúgray asphalt‚Äù and the defiant ‚Äúgreen moss‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.virginmegastore.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone for iphone" class="if uuid-2390559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390559.jpg"></div><p>  The model feels great not only paired with an iPhone.  Powerbeats 3 is a wireless headphone for Apple devices from different segments, whether it‚Äôs an apple watch, an iPad, an iPod or a computer running the Mac OS operating system. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the battery life indicators.  The manufacturer achieved excellent results, which exceeded the mark of 12 hours without recharging.  And this despite the fact that wireless headphones for Apple-devices can not be called heavy or with a massive design.  The model turned out to be quite sporty, convenient and practical in many ways. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  As for sound quality, judging by the reviews on wireless headphones for Apple devices, there are no questions here.  The sound at the output is excellent - clear, surround and without regard to the maximum volume level.  Owners also have no complaints about device ergonomics: the model sits perfectly and does not remind of itself without unnecessary necessity.  In short, the Powerbeats 3 Neighborhood series are the best wireless headphones for Apple devices. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  great sound; </li><li>  thoughtful design with superior ergonomics; </li><li>  full synergy with devices from Apple; </li><li>  long battery life; </li><li>  a variety of color schemes of a series. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  the cost is a bit overpriced for an exclusively branded product (Apple only). </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 14 500 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Level U Pro </h2><p>  These Samsung wireless headphones flaunt on the brand‚Äôs main website on the neck of a beautiful runner in the sports accessories section.  The model has an original design, where all the main controls are located on the rim along with a capacious battery.  This solution significantly increases the ergonomics of the product along with practicality, and also gives it an attractive appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dice.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung headphones" class="if uuid-2390558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390558.jpg"></div><p>  The designers of the venerable brand went their own way to improve sound quality over wireless protocols.  In this particular case, new codecs of the UHQ-BT class were used, which allowed to significantly increase the quality indicator of all frequencies. </p><p>  But this solution has its own downside.  Only the latest mobile gadgets, which, incidentally, are for the most part produced by Samsung itself, can decode such ultra-high quality.  The latest generation of devices has received support for this codec, but the rest of the devices work only with the aptX class. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Users are very positive about the capabilities of brand new headphones.  Here, the exceptional ergonomics of the product, and long battery life, and intuitive controls, and most importantly - excellent sound quality.  Of course, not everyone can afford the latest generation of mobile gadgets, but in the good half of the cases special firmware helps, where the new codec is included. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wireless headphones samsung" class="if uuid-2390557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2390557.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, the list of amateur firmware authorized by Samsung is on the company's official website.  So you can arrange this whole enterprise without any problems, having basic knowledge of managing the Android platform, well, or 500-600 rubles in your pocket for a service center. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  ultra-high sound quality; </li><li>  excellent ergonomics of the gadget; </li><li>  convenient and intuitive controls; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  the ability to connect an additional sound source. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  not all mobile gadgets have a new UHQ-BT codec (in some cases, it is solved by firmware). </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 15,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  When choosing a wireless headphone, it is clearly out of place to pay attention to the maximum range of devices.  The latter, as a rule, is possessed by models that operate at ultra-high frequencies from 863 to 865 MHz.  But they are less protected from interference, so here we have a stick at both ends. </p><p>  Also, be sure to consider the scope of the devices.  The best wireless option are headphones that work through bluetooth protocols.  Wi-Fi technology is good for other purposes, but it has not proved to be the best in transmitting high-quality sound.  Nevertheless, in the role of a stationary tool, for example, in models for TV - this is a very good option. </p><p>  And of course, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that good quality just can‚Äôt cost a penny, so buying frank junk from no-name manufacturers from the Middle Kingdom is a waste of money. </p>
