    <h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  Primera Suit Hotel 3 * belongs to the category of small city hotels.  Tourists often call it family due to the fact that the owners of the hotel and most of the staff are members of the same family.  This creates some kind of especially warm atmosphere, which is celebrated by almost all guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is considered new, it was built in the 2000s.  Fifteen years later, a major renovation took place in it.  Now guests are greeted by simple rooms with no frills and pathos, but with a pleasant atmosphere and excellent working equipment.  In the reviews, vacationers often note that the hotel complex fully lives up to expectations, and in some moments even more corresponds to the four. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel is small, it is only two and a half thousand square meters.  But tourists do not create a feeling of emptiness and confined space, because literally at every step shrubs, flowers and trees are planted.  And the hotel staff carefully monitors the order and cleanliness.  In the comments you can find information that from the very early morning until late at night, the staff washes, cleans and cleans something.  This indicates a special attitude of the owners to their guests. </p><p>  The rating of the Primera Suit Hotel 3 * complex can be found if you look at the contingent of guests.  More than half of them are Turks, a quarter are Europeans (mainly Germans) and another twenty-five percent are our compatriots.  Experienced tourists argue that the hotels in which the Turks rest themselves always provide a high level of service and delight in cleanliness. </p><p>  The hotel is represented by one five-story building, which housed rooms of different categories.  Especially pleasing to families with kids are apartments.  They are equipped with a small kitchen, which may well come in handy while relaxing with the baby. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Alanya beaches </h2><p>  Primera Suit Hotel 3 * complex (Turkey, Alanya) is built on the second coastline, so tourists will have to walk to the sea.  However, those who chose this hotel for rest did not regret it at all, because several beach areas were available to them at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To the city beach, which is closest to the hotel, walk about fifteen minutes.  Moreover, the path runs through the picturesque streets with cozy cafes and family shops.  The sand on the municipal beach is very shallow, and entry into the water is ideal for young children.  In addition, the promenade in this part of the city is considered the most party place, many tourists after visiting the club go to the beach to refresh themselves. </p><p>  If you are ready to go a little further, then you can offer the famous Cleopatra beach.  A lot has been written about him in advertising booklets and guidebooks, so we won‚Äôt dwell on his beauties in detail.  It is municipal, so tourists have to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  On average, a pair of umbrella + deck chair will cost you one hundred and seventy rubles.  It is always quite crowded and fun.  The infrastructure of the beach area allows you to spend at sea all day without experiencing problems with finding drinks and food. </p><p>  For those who do not want to pay for sunbeds, there is an alternative - club beach.  Hotel guests are taken there free of charge, but it is located at the very end of Cleopatra.  At your service will be all the infrastructure needed for relaxation, and even a swimming pool with a hookah zone.  A small bus takes tourists about once an hour, and its schedule is pretty easy to adapt.  The last flight leaves the beach at the hotel at six in the evening. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the hotel area is very modest, you should not expect that you will have a lot of fun in the walls of the hotel.  This complex is worth choosing for those tourists who are ready to explore the country on their own and move around all the time. </p><p>  On the compact territory there is a swimming pool with a dedicated area for children, two <span>bars, a restaurant</span> and a cozy playground for kids.  Near the pool, mainly foreigners gather, so there are not enough sun loungers for everyone.  They are best taken immediately after breakfast.  Twice a day, the slide turns on, it works for about an hour. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Guests do not complain about the level of service at Primera Suit Hotel 3 * in reviews.  On the contrary, they note the friendly attitude of the entire staff, the cleanliness and instant response to any request.  However, they still write that the Turks occupy a certain privileged position in the hotel.  They are always more loyal to them than to foreigners. </p><p>  Wi-Fi works fine throughout the hotel, but in the evening, when the network is congested, there may be a decrease in speed. </p><p>  The hotel has a hairdresser and a small shop where you can buy basic necessities.  Moreover, judging by the reviews, their prices do not differ from the average for the city. </p><p>  Room cleaning always leaves only positive comments on holidaymakers.  They emphasize that even without the tips of the maids, they carefully monitor the order and the rooms look brilliant. </p>

    <h2>  Room characteristics </h2><p>  The hotel has only eighty rooms, they are divided into two categories.  Most of the rooms in Primera Suit Hotel 3 * are economy-room.  These rooms are mainly chosen by companies that prefer to spend time outside the walls of the hotel.  Couples choose apartments.  They are distinguished by a larger area and a dedicated kitchen area. </p><p>  Of course, guests write that the rooms do not impress with their luxurious design.  But everything in them is arranged very conveniently and at home.  All rooms have a TV, fridge and air conditioning.  The latter always works properly and is very conveniently located.  There is also a safe in the room, but you must pay extra for it.  However, many vacationers emphasized in the reviews that the hotel does not need to be afraid of theft, so for a while you can completely do without a safe. </p><p>  Each room has a balcony, our compatriots consider it small and not very comfortable.  However, it is ideal for drying wet clothes. </p><p>  Towels are changed twice a week in the apartment.  The bathroom has a hairdryer and shower.  All cosmetic items are best taken from home; they will not be given to you at the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Guests are invited to all have long loved the all-inclusive system.  Our compatriots rate nutrition by four points.  The main restaurant serves a wide range of dishes, but there are very few meat dishes among them.  Usually, chicken is served only for dinner, fish dishes are also not too common on the table.  But the guests will definitely not stay hungry; daily chefs prepare dainties from vegetables, potatoes, soy and other ingredients.  All dishes are very tasty and do not have time to get bored. </p><h2>  tour cost </h2><p>  The hotel is considered a budget, so rest in it is available to almost every Russian.  The average cost of a daily stay for two does not exceed one thousand three hundred rubles.  This price is shown without a flight. </p><p>  If you are not a fan of buying tickets on your own, then consider buying a tour to this hotel complex.  The cost of a week-long stay for two with a flight from Moscow starts at 19,000 rubles (about 327 dollars). </p>
