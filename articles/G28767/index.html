    <p>  <strong>Battle background</strong> </p><p>  The growing power of the Principality of Moscow, its growing authority and the refusal to pay tribute to the Golden Horde became the main reasons for which the Battle of Kulikovo began.  The date of this battle is 1380.  This massacre has become one of the largest in the history of the Middle Ages.  More than 100 thousand soldiers gathered on the battlefield. </p><p>  <strong>The eve of the battle</strong> </p><p>  The date of the Battle of Kulikovo is 1380, in the fall of which the main forces of Mamaia began to cross the Volga, slowly moving to the Oka River, where they were to meet with the Allies.  Russian troops concentrated on Kolomna.  September 6, they reached the Don, at night moved to the other side and began to prepare for battle. </p><p>  <strong>Fighting</strong> </p>

    <p>  The date of the Kulikovo battle is not just numbers, because people who defended their homeland at the cost of their lives took part in this battle.  Russian soldiers were built in the traditional three-line order.  The Watch Regiment was the vanguard of this formation, the Forward was located behind it, and the Big One was placed in the center, whose flanks covered the regiments of the Right and Left Hands.  Trying to predict the course of the battle, the Russian commanders left the Ambush, which consisted of the best equestrian squads, from the eastern side of the Left Hand regiment.  Mamaia's troops were also located in a linear order.  In the center they had infantry, and cavalry and mercenaries stood on the flanks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that the date of the Battle of Kulikovo fell in the autumn of 1380.  In the morning at 11 o‚Äôclock on September 8, the battle itself began.  The first to attack were the Horde cavalry and infantry.  After the first onslaught of the enemy, the Russians suffered huge losses and retreated to their main forces.  At first, ours suffered considerable losses, the regiment of the Left hand was almost defeated.  Then there was a real threat of the encirclement and direct destruction of the Russian troops, but the <span>culmination of this</span> battle took the people of the Golden Horde by surprise. </p>

    <p>  <strong><span>The root of the</span> battle</strong> </p><p>  The entry of the Ambush Regiment into the battle completely changed the course of the battle.  For Moscow ratification, this was a signal for the offensive.  Mamai and his army fled, but they were chased by Russian cavalry until deep darkness.  The victory over the Golden Horde was complete and unconditional.  The threat of the destruction of Russia and all the consequences that would impossibly change the life of Russian people were eliminated. </p><p>  <strong>Battle results</strong> </p><p>  The date of the Battle of Kulikovo is not just numbers.  This battle once again proved the heroism of our people, their patriotism and love for the motherland.  Despite the victory in this massacre, its price was too high.  A week they gathered and buried all the dead Russian soldiers in <span>mass graves.</span> </p><p>  The Battle of Kulikovo is an important event in the history of our country, which once again proved the inflexibility of the Russian people.  To the 500th anniversary of this battle in the village of Monastyrshchina, a stone temple was erected in memory of the fallen soldiers in honor of the Nativity of the Virgin. </p>
