    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The 3-star Iris Beach Hotel is located in the small resort town of Cyprus - Protaras.  This place is often chosen by people who want to live in a calm and fairly quiet environment, but at the same time have the opportunity to quickly get to the mass of entertainment that Ayia Napa has, the distance to which is about ten kilometers from the hotel.  This path can be overcome both by taxi, and on regular shuttle buses and buses.  As for the air harbor, the airport closest to the hotel is located in Larnaca.  The distance to it is 64 kilometers.  Thus, after landing at the airport, the journey to the hotel will take about an hour.  Be sure that on the way to Iris Beach 3 * you won‚Äôt be bored, because you can admire the beauties of Cyprus.  Since most tourists come to this island mainly for a beach holiday, the distance of the hotel from the beach plays a big role.  As for the Iris Beach Hotel (Protaras), the distance from it to the nearest municipal beach is only a hundred meters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Iris Beach Description </h2><p>  This hotel is one of the youngest in Protaras.  Iris Beach (there is a photo of it in the article) is a four-story building, on the ground floor of which there is a gym, as well as a sauna and a jacuzzi.  In total, the hotel has 72 rooms - 18 on each floor.  All of them are standard doubles, small, but very comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are new and modern.  Each room has a balcony with views of the sea, the hotel pool or neighboring hotels.  Since the hotel is located near the carriageway, it is sometimes quite noisy during the day.  However, in the evening the town calms down, and guests of Iris Beach (Protaras) get the opportunity to sleep in silence.  The hotel area, although small, but there is a restaurant, outdoor pools (adult and children), a sun terrace, a pretty garden, a bar and parking.  In general, this hotel is perfect for a quiet budget family vacation.  If you want fun and entertainment, then you can always go to Ayia Napa, which can be reached in just twenty minutes by bus, minibus, taxi or rented car. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Posting Rules </h2><p>  Like most other hotels around the world, Iris Beach (Cyprus) has a check-in and check-out time.  So, according to the rules of the hotel, the arrival of arriving travelers is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, the administration is always trying to meet the needs of tourists, and even if you arrive earlier than this, everything possible will be done here so that you enter your room immediately.  True, sometimes this is impossible, because in the midst of the tourist season, when the hotel is completely full, there may simply not be any free rooms.  In this case, you can leave your things in the storage room and relax by the pool, go for a walk in the surroundings or rush straight to the beach.  As for the day of departure, you should release your number and hand over the keys before noon.  If you have pre-paid the full cost of the trip to your travel agent, then when leaving the hotel you should pay only for the use of additional services.  If you booked a room yourself, then when you return the keys, you must make full payment for your stay at Iris Beach.  You can pay here either in cash or with a plastic card "Visa", "Mastercard" or "American Express". </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  Since this hotel is also oriented towards a family audience, guests who come to rest with children of all ages are only welcome here.  Moreover, at the hotel for the youngest travelers there is a children's pool and a playground, as well as a games room.  You can place a baby up to two years old in a crib in your room.  This service is free.  Older children and adults can also be accommodated in extra beds.  However, in this case, this service will cost you 19 euros per night.  At the same time, keep in mind that each room can only have one child or an extra adult bed.  You should also inform the Iris Beach (Protaras) administration in advance of the need to provide such a service and receive confirmation from it. </p><h2>  Pets Allowed </h2><p>  At this point, you should definitely pay attention to those people who can not imagine a trip abroad without the company of their four-legged pet.  So, unfortunately, the three-star Cypriot hotel Iris Beach does not allow guests with pets on its territory.  Therefore, you will either have to find another hotel belonging to the Pets Friendly category or leave your four-legged friend for a vacation at home. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The room rate includes breakfast.  They are held in the restaurant from 8 to 10:30 in the morning.  <span>Continental breakfast</span> offers a fairly wide selection of dishes and products: scrambled eggs, sausages, cheeses, yogurts, cereals, muffins, bread, tea, coffee, etc. Throughout the day there is also a bar where you can order alcoholic and soft drinks.  In addition, you can have dinner in the hotel restaurant.  However, most tourists prefer to have lunch and dinner outside the hotel, as numerous cafes located near the Iris Beach offer a very wide selection of delicious local and international dishes at affordable prices.  If you want to save money, you can buy inexpensive products (bread, pastries, cheeses, sausages, fruits, vegetables, yogurt, etc.) in a large supermarket located just two stops from the hotel. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  As we already said, the Iris Beach 3 * hotel (Cyprus), although it is only a hundred meters from the very shore of the sea, does not have its own beach.  Most of them here, by the way, are municipal.  The best beaches in the vicinity of Protaras are located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFig Bay.  This place is called so due to the fact that there is a grove of <span>fig trees.</span>  The beaches here are clean and sandy.  They are equipped with everything necessary for an excellent holiday: comfortable sunbeds and umbrellas, equipment for water sports and entertainment.  In addition, there are many restaurants and bars where you can have lunch or just a snack, as well as treat yourself to your favorite drinks. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Iris Beach Hotel has a very small territory, there are two outdoor pools.  One of them is intended for recreation of adult guests, and the second is shallow and designed for the smallest tourists.

There is also the opportunity to spend time in the TV room.  In the evenings, you can sing karaoke or dance at the disco. </p><p>  As for entertainment for the youngest travelers, in addition to the children's pool, Iris Beach also has a playground, as well as a mini club. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Iris Beach 3 * hotel (Protaras) is small, there is everything necessary for a comfortable stay of guests.

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  Since the Iris Beach Hotel, located in Protaras (Cyprus) is a three-star hotel, the prices for accommodation in it cannot be called high.  So, a seven-day stay will cost you in the amount of 25 thousand rubles.  If you want to get a room with a sea view, you will have to pay another five thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Since it is very important for many travelers in the process of choosing a hotel to get the opinion of people who have visited the hotels in question, we decided to summarize the comments of our compatriots who stayed at Iris Beach (Protaras, Cyprus).  Just note that most Russians were quite happy with their stay here.  So, in their opinion, this hotel deserves three stars and is worth the money spent. </p><p>  As for the numbers, they correspond to the description.  So, here is a fairly new and comfortable furniture, working equipment, a good view from the balcony.  The only drawback is that there is no hairdryer in the bathroom, so it is advisable to take it with you from home.  They clean the room regularly.  Bed linen and towels are also often changed. </p><p>  The tourists were also quite satisfied with the food.  Breakfast seemed a little monotonous to our compatriots, but no one expected anything else from a sober hotel.  The main thing is that everything was tasty and of high quality. </p>
