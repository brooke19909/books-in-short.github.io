Pyramid at the bottom of the atlantic ocean</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This mysterious region in the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> has long been considered an anomalous zone and a truly eerie place where planes and ships with all the crew go missing.  He gained wide popularity in the 60s, when articles about the cursed triangle, in which paranormal phenomena occur that are not amenable to a clear scientific explanation, are published.  Everyone looking for the Bermuda Triangle on the map will be disappointed: there is no clear location and no boundaries.  It is known that the most mysterious site in the world is located next to the islands, from which it got its name. </p><h2>  Strange finds in the depths </h2><p>  A powerful surge of interest in this place is observed after the report of scientists who discovered strange underwater structures.  It turned out that the mystical and poorly studied Bermuda Triangle has preserved incredible artifacts to this day.  The pyramid, discovered at the very bottom of the ocean by an American expedition using the most modern equipment, surprised with its gigantic size.  Later, unique systems operating on the bottom found another one, several times larger than the Egyptian structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bermuda triangle pyramid" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1088689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Amazing pyramids </h2><p>  Scientists were puzzled by the incredibly smooth surface of the monolithic structure - without the slightest scratches and visible seams.  And the material, reminiscent of glass, of which strange structures consisted, was previously not familiar to specialists who arrived to study the find in the Bermuda Triangle.  The pyramid, to the surprise of scientists, was not covered with algae and shells, which all objects that had been in the water for a long time were overgrown with.  But judging by the photographs taken at the bottom of the ocean, these ancient structures are at least 500 years old.  And they were built using technologies inaccessible to our civilization.  All scientists who took part in the work are inclined to believe that it was these pyramids at the bottom of the Bermuda Triangle that caused the disappearance of ships and their crews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Version One: Unidentified Objects </h2><p>  Opponents of the versions of Americans who called the age of underwater structures immediately appeared.  They explained their position as follows: it is impossible to determine the exact date of the creation of finds from photographs.  However, if you nevertheless admit that the oceanographic expedition was not mistaken, and the pyramids are indeed 5 centuries old, the most obvious version of their creation suggests itself, which says that aliens from outer space put their hand to this.  And there are numerous confirmations of such an explanation in the form of unidentified objects plunging to the bottom of the ocean in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfinds and emerging from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="missing in the bermuda triangle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1088745.jpg" width="569"></div>

    <p>  The answer to this activity can be interpreted unambiguously: underwater pyramids are the base of aliens.  Probably not in vain after such reports, the ominous zone where the Bermuda Triangle shows its anomalous properties was closed, and all information was classified. </p><h2>  Version Two: Lost Atlantis </h2><p>  And many recall the ancient legend of the inhabitants of the <span>legendary Atlantis,</span> who created a repository for their knowledge before the imminent destruction of the state.  And still there are versions of the tall and beautiful inhabitants of the mainland, who went to live on the seabed.  Who knows, is not the mysterious region in the Atlantic Ocean, hiding the pyramids at the bottom of the Bermuda Triangle, their current habitat?  In 1995, American researchers said that the inhabitants of an ancient civilization with advanced technology were of extraterrestrial origin.  Moving into human bodies, aliens used some accumulators of sunlight, the rays of which were destructive, so they had to be handled carefully.  Now these energy crystals are supposedly located at the bottom of the ocean, from where the destructive radiation comes from for all living things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bermuda triangle ocean" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1088734.jpg" width="360"></div>

About 100 pieces of military and civilian equipment are known that mysteriously disappeared in an area called the cemetery of the Atlantic.

    <h2>  The disappearance of ships and aircraft </h2><p>  Back in 1918, an American cargo ship disappeared, following through a diabolical place.  He did not give distress signals, but simply disappeared from the radar along with a large crew.  Various versions were put forward, even the most fantastic ones, but not one of them could explain the reasons for the mysterious loss.  The authorities announced that only the circumstances of the tragedy were known to the sea. </p><p>  In 1945, 5 American Air Force planes disappear without a trace, negotiations with pilots indicate their complete disorientation and a meeting with something that cannot be explained.  Instruments did not work, and experienced pilots could not determine their location, which was very strange.  The last words of the pilots contain a reference to the fact that they are in the <span>Gulf of Mexico,</span> that is, in the opposite direction from the given route. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bermuda Triangle on the map" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1088759.jpg" width="300"></div>  Communication after this was interrupted forever, and the pilots' speech was later called real nonsense.  It is all the more surprising that after 40 years one of the <span>missing planes was</span> found at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico <span>.</span>  No one was able to explain the instantaneous movement of the combat vehicle 700 kilometers, and the authorities signed their complete helplessness.  There were many such cases in the anomalous region, but experts did not give a single explanation for the mysterious disappearances.

    <h2>  Energy complex radiation </h2><p>  One can have a different attitude to the version of scientists about the existence of an underwater energy complex, which supposedly stores the Bermuda Triangle.  The pyramid found at the bottom of the ocean is perhaps its tip.  But it is known for sure that the powerful radiation of this working complex adversely affects objects floating and flying over dangerous water areas, and people under its influence move from the living world to the astral.  It is known about the failure of electronic equipment, so many devices are programmed to automatically turn off when passing through the anomalous zone.  And the absence of algae on the smooth surface of the pyramids found can be explained by the destructive power of the rays emanating from them.  Researchers talk about the terrible threat that the Bermuda Triangle still hides.  The ocean for many centuries hides at its depths the secrets of the most ancient civilizations, not amenable to logical explanation.  Scientists around the world are struggling to unravel incredible phenomena, find new artifacts and try to comprehend them from the point of view of science.  But for now, all their attempts are in vain. </p>

    <h2>  New underwater find </h2><p>  At the end of 2012, the world will find out about the real sensation.  This is a study of a Canadian couple, hired to describe the ocean floor and for a long time working in the region of the mysterious triangle.  The media is exploding with news that scientists have finally revealed the secret of the Bermuda Triangle.  In the underwater pictures taken with the help of a robot, they discovered not only a new pyramid, but also the ruins of an ancient city buried under a layer of centuries-old silt.  The ruined walls of stone houses contain engraved inscriptions in an unknown language, and long tunnels and sand-clogged roads, huge monolithic slabs, sculptures of sphinxes and other buildings of an unknown purpose cannot be a natural creation, these are obviously artificial structures created by people's hands.  Are there only people? .. </p>

    <h2>  World Event: Atlantis Found? </h2><p>  Canadian scientists believe that this city of incredible size was discovered by the Americans back in the 70s, after which an amazing find was kept secret for a long time.  Are the ruins of an ancient settlement related to the disappearance of the mysterious Atlantis?  Scientists confirm the version that large-scale buildings were erected first on the ground, and after a global catastrophe collapsed and went under water.  This is very similar to the story of the legendary mainland that sank many centuries ago, which had no chance to escape from a deep water grave. </p><p>  Canadians explored the Bermuda Triangle using special equipment.  The pyramid, built not from solid blocks, but from huge multi-ton stones, is similar in shape to the Egyptian one, but far exceeds its size.  Scientists reported that large boulders located in rings were found in the ruined city, as in the English Stonehenge - another world mystery. </p>

    <h2>  Traces of Indians, not Atlanteans </h2><p>  Many researchers are skeptical of the statement of Canadians, believing that they did not reveal the secret of the Bermuda Triangle.  According to them, the underwater world preserves the remains of an ancient Latin American culture.  There are versions that this small settlement of the Teotiucan Indians, which went under water, had a strong influence on the Aztec culture.  Research on the ruined metropolis is still ongoing, and scientists hope to discover new facts that can shed light on this mystery in the history of mankind. </p><h2>  Unsolved tragedies </h2><p>  It should be noted that not only the Bermuda Triangle belongs to the anomalous zones in which people disappear without a trace.  Scientists have noted at least ten more such mysterious areas on the world map.  However, this mystical place, to this day, constantly excites the minds, causing great interest both researchers and ordinary people to strange phenomena.  Until the causes and circumstances of all the many tragedies become apparent, these cases will be shrouded in mystery.  Most likely, humanity has not yet reached the level of development that would allow us to clearly understand the nature of the acting forces in an anomalous place. </p>
