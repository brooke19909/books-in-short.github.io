Calangute is one of the small resort towns of this Indian state.  Holidays in this area can not be called aristocratic, so high-quality service can not be expected.  People who seek solitude and peace will not like it here.  But Calangute will become a favorite resort for cheerful, active, restless tourists who want to spend a memorable vacation in a delightfully beautiful place for a moderate fee. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Location of Calangute </h2>

Calangute is located in its center, on the coast of the Arabian Sea.  The beach line passing through the town is about 10 km long and stretches from Sinkerim to Bagi.  The resort has a very good location, because it is convenient to get to any corner of North Goa from it.  It takes less than an hour to get <span>from Dabolim International Airport</span> to Calangute, and it is also 18 km from the capital of the state of Panaji.  From this village it is convenient to get to other beaches and places of entertainment located in nearby towns.

    <p>  Calangute was originally an ordinary fishing village.  Rich citizens came here to rest from the unbearable heat, because the fresh sea breeze always blows on the coast.  In the 60s of the last century, North Goa was discovered by western tourists.  Calangute became a hippy center, for local residents the behavior of foreigners was both frightening and interesting, so people came from nearby villages to look at the visitors.  Over time, the village turned into a pretty town with developed infrastructure.  Today it is a popular Indian resort for a budget holiday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Resort Climate </h2>

Calangute lives almost all year round at a temperature of about 30 ¬∞ C, fluctuations are possible at 5 ¬∞ C in both directions.  Despite the warm weather, it is not recommended to come here from May to October, because at this time the rainy season begins, and sunbathing on the beach does not work out properly, and it is not very convenient to look at local sights under endless rains.

    <p>  From November to April, sunny weather prevails, the air is very dry, and the rainfall is minimal.  At this time, the temperature rises to maximum values ‚Äã‚Äã- 35-37 ¬∞ C.  April is considered the hottest month of the year, so tourists who can‚Äôt tolerate high temperatures are not recommended to go on a vacation to Goa at this time.  Calangute is most attractive from November to early March.  The temperature is stable, and the sea is cleared of long rains. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Calangute beaches </h2>

Goa (India) boasts many convenient and clean coasts, but in this resort town they are the most crowded.  Wave lovers will like the sea in Calangute, because it is rarely calm here, but you will not find it too raging.  The descent is gentle and very convenient for both adults and children.

Goa receives various reviews from travelers, because for those who are looking for a quiet place for meditation, they are unlikely to like the resort, where you can‚Äôt freely take a step.  In Calangute, the beach has a huge number of <span>cafes, bars, restaurants,</span> shops with all sorts of things.  In addition, barkers and sellers constantly go, whose impudence can only be envied. </p><p>  But here no one will be bored, the locals will not deprive anyone of their attention and allow plenty of bargaining, reducing the price by almost half.  In the afternoon, you can engage in water activities: parasailing, windsurfing, water skiing.  More relaxed tourists will be invited to do yoga, meditation, use the services of a massage therapist. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2>
