    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Very close to the coast is the "Imereti" hotel (Sochi).  Reviews about beach vacations, however, are not entirely enthusiastic.  The reason is that the coast opposite the hotel is a marina.  This feature of the location does not bother tourists in Imeretinsky out of season, but tourists are not happy in the summer.  They can walk 1.5 km to the nearest beach.  The hotel organized a small free shuttle service to the beach, but it has only 15 seats, and it runs only once every half an hour. </p><p>  The beach itself is also not suitable for everyone.  Coverage here is large and medium pebbles.  Entry into the water also with stones.  Entrance to the sandy beach - 200 rubles each.  All guests of the Imeretinsky complex are wearing bracelets upon arrival.  For those who settle in the main building - white, for the rest - orange.  On the beach, for owners of white bracelets, everything is free.  The owners of orange bracelets for a sunbed pay 200 rubles.  Those who do not have bracelets pay 400 rubles for a place under the Sochi sun.  On the beach there is a lot of entertainment, shower, toilet, bar. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  After the Olympics, the resort of Sochi, <span>Imereti Bay</span> , became unusually popular <span>.</span>  The hotels here are all new, equipped and equipped with modern furniture, appliances and electrical equipment.  Service and services in them are offered at the European level.  Room prices are also not far behind European ones.  In the Imeretinsky hotel, a standard category room is off season and costs from 5000 rubles per day, and the price can change every month.  Children are welcome here from any age.  Up to 5 years, the child lives free of charge if he is not provided with a separate bed and meals.  After 5 years, for an extra bed a child needs to pay 700 rubles a day, and an adult - 1,500 rubles a day. </p><p>  Imeretinsky Hotel is a smoke-free area. </p><p>  There are conditions for recreation for people with physical health problems.  For them there are rooms, convenient ramps for wheelchair access / check-in, spacious elevators. </p><p>  The hotel has a wonderful rule - a special congratulation to the newlyweds and those who have a birthday. </p><p>  The check-in at Imeretinsky is held from 15:00, the check-out is until 12:00. </p><p>  The hotel can be paid in cash and by credit card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Imereti Bay hotels" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/973705.jpg" width="563"></div>
