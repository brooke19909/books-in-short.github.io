    <p>  This land was famous for fertile lands and an abundance of sun.  A huge dam was built near the capital Mariba, which provided the earth with water, turning the barren desert into a blooming oasis.  Initially, this state served as a kind of transshipment point.  It was here that goods came from Hadramaut and went on to Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia.  In addition to profits from transit trade, Saba received income from the sale of his incense, which was very much appreciated. </p><p>  The Sabei civilization is one of the oldest.  Even in the time of Solomon, this state was ruled by the <span>Queen of Sheba.</span>  But there is no documentary evidence of this fact, besides mentioning it in the Bible. </p><h2>  Isle </h2><p>  What is a subwoofer?  It is also the name of the island located in the Caribbean Sea, which belongs to the archipelago of the Lesser <span>Antilles.</span>  He is the most remote possession of the Netherlands.  From the point of view of geography, the island is the peak of Mount Sineri volcano, there are no rivers or other natural reservoirs on it.  The western part of the island is completely covered with cacti and thickets of dry shrubs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Its exact opposite is the east of the island.  He is surrounded by greenery.  Treelike ferns, oleanders, orchids and hibiscus delight tourists with their lush flowering.  More than 60 species of birds nest in the eastern forests, and lizards and frogs hide at the foot of trees. </p><p>  At first, the <span>island of Saba was</span> inhabited by Arawak tribes (about 1300 years ago).  Columbus, during his first trip, saw this land, but could not land because of its rocky shores.  And only in 1640 the first colonists from Holland arrived on the island.  During the Napoleonic Wars, it belonged to the British, who returned it to Holland only in 1816. </p><p>  According to the latest census, the population of the island is about two thousand people.  The official language is Dutch (Dutch), but English is also very common in everyday life.  The main source of income for the island is tourism.  Over a year, more than 25 thousand guests visit it. </p>

    <p>  A local attraction is Huancho Irauskin Airport with the world's shortest runway.  Only three types of aircraft are allowed to land on it.  This airport is one of the ten most dangerous in the world. </p><h2>  River and village </h2><p>  What is a subwoofer?  This is a small river in the Leningrad Region, which is the left tributary <span>of the Luga River.</span>  Its length is only 90 km.  Saba originates from the southwestern part of Lake Krasnogorsk and flows into the Luga at 102 km from its source.  The river has nine tributaries. </p><p>  Saba is also a village in the Leningrad region, which belongs to the <span>Luga region.</span>  It is located on the banks of the river of the same name. </p><h2>  What is the meaning of this mysterious word? </h2><p>  Saba is the 34th <span>surah of the Qur'an</span> consisting of 54 verses.  It tells that Allah always helps those who rely on him, give examples.  Thus, Allah softened the iron in the hands of David, and Solomon helped subjugate the genies, who built several altars and temples on his orders.  Very few were grateful to Allah for his help.  Initially, Saba‚Äôs inheritance was beautiful, but its inhabitants became proud and did not thank Allah, for which they were punished. </p><p>  The sura itself forbids boasting of her wealth and children, and those who do this are strictly condemned.  Since only good deeds pleasing to Allah can bring people closer to him, but not greatness, glory and wealth. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know the meaning of the word saba.  As you can see, many interesting places are named that way.  If there is an opportunity and desire, be sure to visit them. </p>
