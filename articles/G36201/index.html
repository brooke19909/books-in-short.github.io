Since the budget is usually limited, tourists have to look for more acceptable options for how to get cheaply to Bali, Turkey, Egypt and other countries that have long won fame for popular resorts around the world. </p><h2>  Mini paradise for travelers </h2><p>  A small island at the junction of the Pacific and Indian oceans is popular with tourists because of its unusual climate - here from June to October there is heat, and from November to March - humidity and tropical thunderstorms.  Experienced travelers know how to get to Bali cheaply, which is why they usually relax here 2-3 times a year, since it is quite difficult to find such an atmosphere of relaxation and high-quality service. </p><p>  Some of those who once visited here even decide to move, which is why the island's population over the past 100 years has increased by a quarter and currently stands at about 4.2 million people.  A large number of hotels are located here, music and religious holidays are constantly held, sculpture and painting museums are open, so everyone can find entertainment to their liking. </p><h2>  How much does a ride cost? </h2><p>  Flights to this island are far from all corners of Russia.  As of August 2018, residents of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Ufa, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and Vladivostok have the opportunity to go on a trip.  However, one cannot say that they are lucky for cheap tickets to Bali - for example, for Muscovites the minimum price for the trip will be 40 thousand rubles, residents of the Northern capital will have to pay at least 38 thousand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="02varvara.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to bali cheap" class="if uuid-2764316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764316.jpg"></div><p>  Residents of the regions will have to pay a much higher price for a flight to Bali, it is quite possible that first they will have to get to the city from which regular flights are made there.  It is much easier to fly from Vladivostok or Irkutsk - the distance to the island from there is much less, and the minimum cost of a round trip is 28-30 thousand rubles for one passenger.  To calculate the approximate price of a one-way ticket, it is enough to divide the above amounts in half. </p><h2>  Flying through Qatar </h2><p>  This method is only suitable if you will purposefully track stocks in certain areas.  Some, thinking about how to fly cheaply to Bali, choose a route through Qatar.  This choice is largely due to the fact that local airlines have a fairly large number of flights to the Asian island.  However, there is a flip side to the coin - price. </p><p>  Promotional offers are often opened here in the season, when discounts on tickets can reach 40-50%, but in normal times the cost of a round-trip flight in the economy class along the Doha ‚Äì Bali route is 45-50 thousand rubles.  Not the most profitable option, but if you are lucky to find a ticket at a discount, the flight will be as comfortable as possible for you and you will receive first-class service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Or maybe fly through Dubai? </h2><p>  Another option that is suitable only with discounts and last minute packages is a flight through the UAE.  There are rather expensive plane tickets here at normal times, Bali does not cost anyone cheaply, however, 40 thousand for a flight from Dubai Airport to Denpasar in both directions is a little expensive for tourists who want to reduce their own expenses to the maximum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbcnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fly cheap to bali" class="if uuid-2764317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764317.jpg"></div><p>  The only reason justifying such an expensive price is comfort and high-class service.  Almost all flights between Bali and the UAE are operated by Emirates, which invests enormously in the quality of its service.  The company uses ultramodern liners, so the road will seem easy and enjoyable to you.  In order not to miss the sale of tickets in the direction you are interested in, it is worth periodically monitoring the official website of the airline. </p><h2>  Is it profitable to fly through China? </h2><p>  If you went through a bunch of options on how to get to Bali cheaply, then the method of transplantation in Guangzhou was probably considered.  We can‚Äôt say that it is very profitable, since a round-trip ticket from Moscow to China will have to spend about 30 thousand rubles, and from Guangzhou to Denpasar - another 18. In this case, it remains only to rely on the availability of promotional offers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some people prefer to travel through Hong Kong, and there is a certain logic to this.  There are often discounts on the route connecting this city with Moscow, sometimes tickets can be purchased for 8-10 thousand rubles.  From Hong Kong to Denpasar and vice versa, you can fly for 18-20 thousand rubles, in total, the trip will cost 26-30 thousand rubles and will save a lot. </p><h2>  We use stocks </h2><p>  Since the prices for flights are quite high, but I want to fly cheap to Bali, tourists constantly monitor last minute deals that sometimes appear with large tour operators.  If you are lucky to get one of them, then you can fly to an Asian country for only 25-30 thousand rubles, and in some cases, much cheaper.  Such offers can most often be found at Arab and Asian airlines, for example, Thai and China Southern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.staralliance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap bali tickets" class="if uuid-2764325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764325.jpg"></div><p>  However, according to experienced tourists, this method is not suitable for all travelers.  Since last minute packages are formed if there are unsold airplane seats on this route or hotel rooms not bought, tour operators publish them 1-2 days before departure.  In the shortest possible time, not everyone can postpone all their affairs or take time off, which is also a problem.  On the other hand, if you went on vacation without buying tickets in advance, there is a risk of waiting for vouchers for the action from tour operators and not going anywhere at all. </p><h2>  Wrong tariffs: you can see the whole world! </h2><p>  Reflecting on how to get to Bali cheaply, few people take into account the presence of very budgetary methods in the form of erroneous tariffs.  They represent round trip options, while the cities of departure and arrival are different.  For example, you can fly from St. Petersburg to Jakarta, and fly back to Rome for 17 thousand rubles.  At the same time, it will be much cheaper to get to Jakarta from the island, liners of local low-cost airlines run between the two cities in minibus mode. </p><p>  Of course, there are also pitfalls here.  When building such complex routes, you must immediately make detailed calculations to understand whether they are really more profitable than direct ones.  In addition, it may be difficult to apply for a visa and other documents - the rules for entering Bali can radically differ from those in any other country.  You will have to clarify all this yourself and long before the planned trip. </p><h2>  Fast and cheap: where to start? </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt know how cheap it is to fly to Bali, but you want to go there, you can use the following methods: first get to any other city located in Southeast Asia, and then use local low-cost airlines.  Experienced travelers argue that through such a scheme, you can save up to 15-20 thousand rubles, which is a very tangible increase to the budget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap way to get to bali" class="if uuid-2764327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764327.jpg"></div><p>  For example, you can first go to Bangkok, the cost of a round-trip flight will be 20-25 thousand rubles.  If you manage to get a last minute voucher in this direction, then you can save even more.  The main feature is that they usually don‚Äôt fly to Thailand in the summer, but to Bali, on the contrary, this can save some of the money put off for vacation.  The cheapest way to get to the island is from Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, so when planning a trip, pay attention to the cost of tickets to these Asian cities. </p><h2>  What to do after arriving in Asia? </h2><p>  If you decide to use the cheapest way to get to Bali and fly to one of the cities of Southeast Asia, the next step is to search for low-cost airlines.  As a rule, the latter organize small flights within individual states, and the cost of the flight depends on the number of passengers.  Therefore, planes are usually packed to capacity, and it is best to buy tickets in advance. </p><p>  In Asia, the most popular low cost carriers are Wings Air, Air Asia, Lion Air.  For example, an economy class ticket for a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar <span>(the capital of Bali)</span> in one direction can be purchased for only 2-2.5 thousand rubles.  It is quite profitable to purchase tickets to the island, being in the Philippines, Cambodia, Singapore and Thailand, their cost will be 40-60 dollars.  From China, Japan, South Korea and India it is much more expensive to fly - the ticket price there fluctuates around $ 90. </p><h2>  How to save money when traveling from the capital? </h2><p>  If we talk about how to get to Bali cheaply from Moscow, then the route through Kuala Lumpur will be most optimal here.  The cost of a round-trip flight will be 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äãthousand rubles, while the quality of service will be consistently high.  You can also visit the capital of Malaysia itself - the city is quite pleasant and interesting in terms of historical features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asiaexchange.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap bali" class="if uuid-2764328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764328.jpg"></div><p>  A round-trip flight from Kuala Lumpur to Bali will be 4,500-5,000 rubles.  Thus, the total cost of the flight from Moscow to Denpasar will be about 30 thousand rubles.  Meanwhile, the lowest price for tickets on a direct route is 40 thousand, by simple calculations it becomes clear that you win about 10 thousand for each traveler, while still have time to look at Malaysia.  And if you go to Asia from the neighboring Russian regions - Vladivostok, Irkutsk and Khabarovsk, ticket prices will be even lower. </p><h2>  What do experienced travelers advise? </h2><p>  Those who often go on holiday abroad know very well how to fly cheaply to Bali, and willingly share their knowledge with others.  In their opinion, first you need to decide for yourself what exactly you like: immediately fly to the island or grab a couple of other cities unknown earlier on the road.  Based on this, you can plan the route of your trip and the corresponding budget, it is also recommended to immediately postpone part of the funds for unforeseen accidents.  For example, if suddenly you need to urgently fly home, you will have to buy tickets urgently, and they are expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap bali plane tickets" class="if uuid-2764330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764330.jpg"></div><p>  Some tourists advise against using Chinese airlines, in their opinion, the service of such carriers leaves much to be desired.  But if the cost of the trip plays an important role, such operators will still have to be considered, since their ticket prices are an order of magnitude lower than market prices.  To find the most advantageous offers, experienced travelers recommend subscribing to air carrier pages on social networks and periodically monitor emerging promotions. </p><h2>  What do tour operators recommend? </h2><p>  According to those who sell packages to heaven on our planet, it‚Äôs much easier to purchase tickets a few months before the intended trip.  Since all calculations are made in foreign currency, the likelihood that the cost of the flight will change is quite high.  Advance purchase will insure yourself against unpleasant situations and spoiled vacations. </p><p>  According to them, one of the cheapest ways to get to Bali is to buy last minute packages.  However, there are situations when a client who buys tickets refuses a trip a few days before departure.  In this case, the tour operator has the right to return only part of the amount, however tickets remain unclaimed.  It‚Äôs far from always possible to announce the availability of a last-minute voucher on time, which is why travel agents recommend that travelers periodically contact the agencies and check for tickets for flights of interest. </p><h2>  What to fear? </h2><p>  The desire to fly cheaply to Bali or to any other resort city is so strong that some tourists go to great lengths to fly out of the country.  There are a huge number of communities in social networks in which users can buy tickets and tickets to different directions from each other.  Such an exchange is far from always always successful, therefore it is necessary to be especially careful when transferring your passport data and finances to strangers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to bali cheap" class="if uuid-2764331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2764331.jpg"></div><p>  If you are traveling as a "savage", try to purchase tickets only at official representative offices of airlines, especially if you are outside of Russia.  Tourists have repeatedly reported cases of sales of fake tickets for flights that they purchased abroad in dubious organizations.  Be sure to check the correctness of the information specified in the travel documents, then you will be able to avoid a lot of problems and enjoy the trip in plenty. </p>
