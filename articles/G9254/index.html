Holidays have already made a noise, and winter with its snowdrifts and ice has already managed to "reach" to the very liver.  And how do you want to find yourself on a snow-white beach, which is caressed with a quiet rustling azure wave, under the hot sun among the lush tropical greenery.  There is nothing easier: we buy a ticket, collect a suitcase, send <span>an</span> air kiss from the <span>window of the airplane to</span> snowy penates and depart to the south.  Where to relax in February at sea, this article will tell. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in February at sea" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/282742.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the last month of the calendar winter, early spring is already taking over in some places.  A short flight in 3-4 hours, and you are already in Egypt.  Choosing February for a vacation, you have two pluses and one minus.  The advantages include a noticeable drop in prices, since everyone who has celebrated numerous New Year and Christmas holidays with great fanfare has already moved out.  It also becomes significantly warmer compared to January - the coldest month of the year, the winds stop blowing and the corals of the Red Sea begin to bloom.  And the lack of winter Egypt - pretty cool water - only +20 degrees.  Recent political events in this country have not affected resorts and will not overshadow your <span>vacation at sea.</span>  February 2014 promises to please tourists with more democratic prices than before. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Approximately the same climatic conditions are observed <span>in the United Arab Emirates.</span>  In the capital of Abu Dhabi in the Persian Gulf, in the emirate of Sharjah on the shores of the Indian Ocean, the daily air temperature does not drop below +24 degrees.  But the sea here can also be cold - up to +17 Celsius.  Therefore, those who like to splash in the warm waves should look for where to relax in February at sea, a little to the south.  Fortunately, there is plenty to choose from. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="February where to go to the sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/282734.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are countries on our planet where winters (in our understanding) never happen.  The change of seasons is expressed only in the fact that in the summer months tropical showers are added to the heat.  Therefore, in winter there is nothing to fear from rains.  Considering where to relax in February at sea, choose Thailand.  There is a high season at this time.  In the capital of Bangkok, +32 is constantly constant during the day, but on the coast, and especially on the islands, cool sea breezes always soften the heat.  The Andaman Sea and the <span>Gulf of Thailand are</span> not only warm, but even almost hot: + 26-28. </p>

South Vietnam and Cambodia have recently been competitors to the "Land of Smiles."  In the Maldives, winter is called the “Iruvai” period when favorable monsoons blow.  The sea is calm, the weather is cloudless and dry.  Even at night, the air temperature does not drop below +25.  Secluded atolls, colorful fauna of coral reefs, excellent service - what could be better?

    <p>  India will delight those who choose February as their vacation time.  Where to go to sea in this big country?  Choose the state of Goa.  It stretches along the coast of the Arabian Sea and is conditionally divided into the southern (more comfortable and, accordingly, expensive) and northern (youth, affordable) parts.  The water temperature in the last winter month is about + 27 ° .  Even further south - on the island of Sri Lanka - the warmest.  The same ideal conditions for a beach holiday are observed in February and in Mexico, the <span>island states of the</span> Caribbean - Cuba, Dominican Republic. </p>
