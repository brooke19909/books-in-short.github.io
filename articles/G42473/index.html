Tourists planning a vacation, of course, are interested in which part of the coast is most attractive.  After all, it depends in which area you should choose a hotel.  According to tourists, the best place to relax on the island is the beach "Freedom" (Phuket).  It will be discussed about him in our article. </p><h2>  Beach description </h2><p>  Freedom Beach (Phuket) is one of the most inaccessible places on the island, but also the most beautiful stretch of coast.  Perhaps in its location lies the reason for its attractiveness.  If this beach were more accessible, it would have long lost its natural charm and charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Beach Phuket" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Freedom Beach (Phuket) has a length of about 300 meters and is located in a closed bay in the Muang area, three kilometers from Patong.  Despite its inaccessibility, it fully justifies the name ‚ÄúFreedom Beach‚Äù.  The snow-white coast is surrounded by hills covered with jungle.  It enchants people with its pristine beauty, recalling that there are still exotic places in the world that are not touched by a person‚Äôs hand.  Here you can hide from the problems and worries of the modern world, enjoying peace and tranquility under the monotonous splashing of waves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Freedom Beach (Phuket): how to get there? </h2><p>  Every tourist who reads reviews of such a paradise, certainly has a desire to visit it.  However, it is worthwhile to understand that the coast is surrounded by jungle and private estates, and therefore quite logical questions arise: where exactly is Freedom Beach (Phuket), how to get to this amazing place on foot? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket beach how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727233.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In fact, there are only two ways to get to this section of the coast.  The first one is a walk from Patong.  On the very outskirts of this beach there is parking for bikes (its cost is 100 baht per vehicle) and parking for cars.  You can get to Patong by any means of transport and leave it here while you travel. </p><p>  Experienced tourists caution that the apparent proximity of Liberty Beach is very deceiving.  You will have to walk about a kilometer on foot, winding along various paths and intricate paths.  There is no direct access or hiking trail.  You need to understand that the whole path will run through the tropical jungle.  In addition, to get to the beach "Freedom" (Phuket), you still have to climb the hills. </p><p>  When you reach the cherished place, do not relax.  After all, there is still a way back.  In general, experienced vacationers do not recommend getting here on foot.  It is very tiring and unsafe.  In addition, such a walk is definitely not worth taking children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sea way </h2><p>  As you can already understand, the first method is acceptable only for extreme people.  But the second option is the most popular among tourists.  But at the same time, this method is quite expensive, although this does not stop people who want to get to the beach "Freedom" (Phuket). </p><p>  How to get from Patong to its coast?  Of course, on the boat.  Local residents have long traded in transporting unlucky tourists to the paradise beach.  It should be understood that each carrier can offer you its price, and you, in turn, have the right to bargain.  The prices of local residents can vary greatly, and at what price you should agree, you decide.  On average, Thais ask for one thousand baht or more per trip.  As a rule, 1,500 baht is a reasonable price, but some may request a large amount. </p><p>  Please note that the owner of the boat doesn‚Äôt care if you travel by yourself or by company, you will have to pay the full amount.  Therefore, it is worth considering this moment and heading to the coast with a company or looking for travel companions already in Patong.  On average, no more than eight passengers are placed on one boat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Beach Phuket Photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727235.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Boats moor in the south of the beach, anchoring a few meters from the shore, so you will have to get to land by water.  Sometimes in the summertime the process can be prevented by strong ebbs and flows.  The rest of the time there are no problems.  All the time while you are relaxing on the coast, your water taxi will be waiting for you to deliver back to Patong. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Coastal infrastructure </h2><p>  If you are relaxing on the island of Phuket, <span>Freedom</span> Beach must be on the list of must-see places to visit.  Despite all the difficulties on the road, you will not regret that you decided to see the incredible beauty of this place.  After all, this is a wild corner of nature, in which you will not be disturbed by the screams of people, the noise of scooters, obsessive sellers of goods, etc. Here you can find unity with nature and the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="freedom beach phuket reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727237.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the beach is known as a wild place, it still has its own infrastructure.  Its entire territory is conditionally divided into three parts.  The average is reserved specifically for longtail parking.  The second belongs to the hotel, and the last (where there are many stones) is suitable for people who want to relax in the wild. </p><h2>  Cost of services </h2><p>  Since the beach "Freedom" <span>(Phuket), the photos of</span> which are presented in the article, is a private territory, you will have to pay for using the infrastructure.  In general, local prices are no different from those that can be seen on the other beaches of the island. </p><p>  There are several cafes and restaurants on the coast, offering tourists Thai dishes.  The cost of one serving ranges from 100 to 200 baht.  In addition, the beach has a toilet, shower, rental masks.  Entrance to the coast also costs 100-200 baht.  Payment is charged for the passage of private property.  Renting a deck chair will cost about 240 baht. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Freedom Beach freedom beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727223.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is also a hotel on the beach where you can rent a room if you want to stay longer in this beautiful place.  As a rule, tourists are attracted by incredible sunsets.  Renting a room will cost about 1,500 baht. </p><h2>  Is there any entertainment on the beach? </h2><p>  Freedom Beach is the only place on the whole island where there are no jet skis and bananas that do not allow tourists to simply swim and enjoy the sea.  However, this does not mean that there is absolutely nothing to do on the coast.  Just in this paradise of entertainment a little less, and they are all more relaxed. </p><h2>  Photo and snorkeling </h2><p>  For those who do not think vacation without photo sessions, there is a staircase leading to the hill.  At an altitude is an observation deck with a magnificent view.  Here you can take stunning photos.  Pictures taken on the coast resemble shots from films about the wild jungle and uninhabited islands in the ocean.  What your selfies will be like depends only on your imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom beach Phuket How to get there on foot" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727224.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you are bored with being idle on the beach, you can sit in one of the local cafes.  In addition, the southern part of the beach is the best place for scuba diving.  By renting a mask, you can dive deeper and admire the coral reefs, colorful schools of fish.  For vacationers on the coast, volleyball and football courts are equipped. </p><h2>  Freedom Beach (Phuket): reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists visiting Freedom consider it the best beach on the whole island.  Of course, walking on the coast on foot is dubious, since you have to overcome many steps and paths, and the return path is even more difficult, because you have to go up all the time.  For this reason, experienced vacationers recommend boat trips from Patong.  If you go to the beach from land, you need to pay 200 baht for passing through a private area.  Arriving on the coast by sea, you pay only the cost of the boat. </p><p>  "Freedom", according to guests, is an incredibly beautiful place.  A wide strip of sand, tall coconut palms and a turquoise sea - this is the hallmark of the beach.  Relaxing in such a heavenly place is an incredible pleasure.  Many tourists do not rent sun loungers, but prefer to sit on the sand in the shade of palm trees.  A huge advantage of the coast is the lack of a noisy crowd and the usual rich infrastructure inherent in any beach.  Here you can truly relax and enjoy your vacation.  Unlike all the beaches on the island, Freedom is a very clean place.  The creaking sand underfoot without dirt and cigarette butts is not a dream, it is a reality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Freedom beach how to get from patong" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1727225.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  According to vacationers, prices in local cafes and restaurants are significantly overpriced, so tourists prefer to take food with them.  And the rest, staying at Freedom is associated only with positive emotions associated with swimming in the purest warm water and contemplating the most beautiful landscapes of the wild. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Recently, the beach is becoming increasingly popular among vacationers.  But still there are not so many people here as in other parts of the coast of Phuket.  And the reason for this is difficulties with the road.  Only the most persistent tourists can get here.  Freedom Beach is a place worth visiting to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãall the beauties of beautiful Phuket. </p>
