The coming year is dedicated to the symbol of the sheep.  Everyone is trying to buy toys, cards, souvenirs with this symbolism.  But you can create a gift with your own hands.  We suggest today to learn how to make a sheep with your own hands in different variations. </p><h2>  What gifts can I make? </h2><ul><li>  Trinkets.  Beautiful charms will be made of beads.  Sheep can be made voluminous or flat.  In the latter version, on a sheet, draw an image, count the beads, weave with a fishing line and a needle, connecting the rows like Easter eggs. </li><li>  Magnets.  Embroidered, beaded or stitched sheep, New Year's plots look great on the refrigerator.  You can make unusual toy magnets.  To do this, sew small lambs, and glue magnets on your legs, then the lamb will be able to change the position of the legs. </li><li>  Clothing.  Scarves, mittens, <span>hats, socks</span> can be decorated with lambs in the style of the Norwegian pattern.  If you <span>knit for children,</span> then you can create colored lamb. </li><li>  Souvenirs (needle beds, biscuits, krugulik, ziguga).  Find any patterns for cross-stitch with a New Year's plot, embroider and give an unusual shape to a souvenir. </li><li>  Origami.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Stuffed Toys.  Use pehora, yarn with pompons to knit toys for sleeping.  You can sew them from felt.  Tilda's lambs are especially unique (sheep‚Äôs stencil should be made in advance for them). </li><li>  Postcards.  Any material is used (paper, beads, accessories, paints, fabric, threads) to create lambs.  Postcards can be made flat, voluminous, with a surprise, decorative. </li><li>  Christmas decorations.  Knitted or sewn lambs can hang on the tree and delight the eye with bright colors (for this, use glitter paints). </li><li>  Covers.  Bags, cosmetic bags, cases for mobile phones can be sewn, knitted, embroidered with New Year themes and presented to any person, regardless of gender or age.  Covers in the form of a volumetric lamb are especially original, that is, the head of a lamb is knitted, stuffed and sewn to a purse.  Also, do not forget to sew on such a sheep and legs. </li><li>  New Year's symbol can be represented in any version.  The main thing is that the gift is useful and practical.  You can create an entire composition.  For example, bead trees, and under them a flock of sheep. </li></ul><h2>  The original craft: a sheep from cotton buds </h2><p>  Such a lamb can become an element of a volumetric postcard, Christmas tree decoration or an independent souvenir.  To create it, we need: </p><ul><li>  white cardboard; </li></ul><ul><li>  cotton buds; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  felt-tip pens; </li><li>  ice cream sticks or half clothespins; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  How to make a sheep do-it-yourself from cotton buds?  From cardboard, cut a large oval for the body and a small oval for the head.  Cut cotton buds almost under a cotton base, only leave centimeter segments for the ears.  One sheep can take more than a hundred cotton buds.  Tape the body in a circle with cotton scraps so that the sticks are not visible.  Then the illusion of curls is created. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Then do the head.  To get started, glue the ears, and then a few bangs in the form of bangs.  Draw with a felt-tip pen the eyes, nose and mouth, stick to the body.  If the lamb is for a postcard or a Christmas tree toy, then cut off the wooden sticks from the ice cream in half and glue it from the wrong side of the body. </p><p>  You can decorate the crafts with white cardboard or paste them with cotton swabs, creating a voluminous product.  Adding halves of clothespins can give the sheep stability.  Also on the wrong side you can stick white cardboard with New Year's greetings. </p><h2>  Christmas tree toys: do-it-yourself sheep </h2><p>  Small crafts are suitable not only for souvenirs, but also for decorating the Christmas tree.  Consider a master class on creating a miniature sheep.  The following material will be required: </p><ul><li>  <span>copper wire</span> for the body, legs; </li><li>  cork or float; </li><li>  Super Moment glue; </li><li>  <span>jute twine</span> or any other thick rope; </li><li>  wool of white and black colors; </li><li>  paper clips for the ears. </li></ul><p>  It is not difficult to make a craft for a sheep, but patience is required, since the work is jewelry.  From the cork you form the head of a sheep.  Pierce it with a wire, the end of which is bent to fix the position.  From other identical wire segments, make paws with part of the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Attach them to the wire going from the head and solder them (in extreme cases, you can wrap a thin wire in the style of a ganuteli).  Wrap the neck with the body with twine, increasing the desired thickness.  Then tightly wrap the head, paws, body with black wool, smearing the surface with glue. </p><h2>  Making curls </h2><p>  We continue to consider how to make a sheep with your own hands.  Bend the legs of the sheep to give a stable position.  Ears are made of paper clips or any wire.  Wrap with black thread, connect it in a loop and ‚Äúincrease‚Äù the volume with wool.  Leave the small ends of the wire to glue them and stick them in the head. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts sheep" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/587998.jpg" width="340"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Now make curls.  To do this, wrap white wool on a fork or metal plate, as when creating pompons.  On one side, fasten with a plain thread so that when cutting the other end, the threads do not scatter.  Cut the second edge with a clerical knife.  Lubricate the resulting bundles with glue and paste over the entire body with the head. </p><p>  If necessary, trim the sheep‚Äôs hair with scissors.  Glue your eyes on the face (on sale you can find ready-made running small eyes or use wooden beads).  You can move away from the classic version and make colorful lambs. </p><h2>  Felt sheep </h2><p>  Such toys can be used for trinkets, Christmas tree decorations, decorative souvenirs.  From white felt you cut the body, tail, legs, head with ears, and from black material - curls and flowers.  Instead of felt, you can take any other bulk material. </p><p>  You start the work from the head, sew the parts and insert the synthetic winterizer.  You can use a solid filler on which you cut the same stencil of a sheep and stitch all layers.  Embroider the mouth immediately, sew the eyes, curls.  Then work on the torso.  First, sew decorative flowers on it.  Then sew the details of the body, sewing in the right places the legs and tail.  Do not forget to fill it with a padding polyester.  This is a variant of a whole sheep, but how to make a small colored lamb? </p><p>  Cut from felt two parts of the body (like a round cloud), head, ears (like droplets), curls (like an oval cloud).  Four oval strips for legs, one detail for the nose (heart).  Sew the head in, sew in the ears, fill it with padding polyester, then attach curls on top.  Glue the nose, embroider the eyes and mouth.  Next, sew the body by inserting the legs.  Fasten your head from above and decorate with a bow and the same ribbon. </p><h2>  Lamb-tilda </h2>

    <p>  Children love the Tilda sheep because of their simplicity and softness.  As a rule, terry cloth is taken for fur, and linen material for limbs and face.  At the moment, there are many patterns, but you can create it yourself.  The easiest option is to make the sheep for the New Year, like a chrysalis.  Let's consider in detail how to do this: </p><ul><li>  Sew paw details.  Sew a linen pattern from one edge.  Fill with padding polyester. </li><li>  Sew the body of fur fabric.  Sew hands and feet.  Fill with padding polyester. </li><li>  Sew the head in three parts: two terry and one round linen face.  Sew on your eyes and ears, embroider your nose, draw cheeks with acrylic paints.  Fill with padding polyester, fasten to the body. </li><li>  Sew a skirt of colorful shreds and put on a sheep. </li></ul><h2>  Bead lamb </h2><p>  How to make a sheep from beads?  Today you can find a lot of patterns for weaving lamb both voluminous and flat from beads and beads.  Flat ones are sketchy and more suitable for key rings or postcards.  Goats are weaved from head down, and sheep from the back of the body to the head.  Then just the parts are connected together and get a denser product.  In this technique <span>(brick weaving),</span> you can make colorful animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a sheep from beads" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/574121.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  But voluminous sheep look more natural.  The very first option is to braid a ball and a bead for the body and head.  The braid resembles weaving strawberries.  Make loops for curls.  Ears also weave a loop. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt know how to weave with beads, then you combine two techniques (this will be the second method).  For example, sew a head with a body from a fabric and a filler, and sew curls and legs with beads.  Get original souvenirs.  You can also combine crochet with beadwork.  For magnets, lamb is embroidered on a canvas, trimmed and a magnetic tape is glued on the wrong side. </p><h2>  Postcards and panels </h2><p>  It is very easy to create greeting cards.  The easiest way to stick the finished blanks for cards is applique.  On the outside, decorate the plot with beads, threads or other materials.  Children like to glue a Christmas tree of pompons on a card and decorate them with paper balls, stars. </p><p>  If you want to make a card yourself, then bend the cardboard in half.  Scissors form the size and edges of the postcard.  On the outside, apply a schematic drawing, glue and a bead base or thread (it is better to take wool, chop finely and stick it).  For the postcard, the first craft <span>(a sheep from cotton buds) is</span> suitable <span>,</span> which is glued to a cardboard base. </p><p>  If you paint white thick cardboard, and make the foreground or main details voluminous due to paper applications, beads, threads and other materials, you get the basis for the panel.  Just insert the plot into the frame without glass and hang it on the wall.  For example, you can do topiary. </p><h2>  Panel options </h2><p>  Cut the foam ball in half and glue it on cardboard.  Draw a trunk, a fence or a vase.  Cut along the bottle of yogurt, wrap with multi-colored threads, stick to cardboard.  Glue the ball with flowers, pompons, decorative elements. </p><p>  From foam balls, you can make the head and body of a lamb, which you glue over with pompons or beads.  Or paste a finished animal created in origami style onto cardboard.  Volumetric sheep is inserted into the frame without glass. </p><p>  Preschoolers will use another gift option.  Print <span>the lamb pattern.</span>  Coat it in places where the coat should be with a thick layer of plasticine.  Then wind the balls of napkins, crepe paper or foil.  Attach them to the plasticine.  You can paint the head and legs with gouache or also cover with plasticine. </p><p>  If the balls are not large, then the craft can be put under the glass.  Otherwise, buy special plasticine, which quickly hardens and is not exposed to temperature effects.  Creating such crafts is as simple as making a sheep out of paper, but the result will be more interesting. </p><h2>  We embroider a sheep </h2><p>  Depending on the plot and size, the New Year symbol can be represented as a picture or a souvenir.  Consider several gift options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a sheep craft" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/574033.jpg" width="319"></div>

    <ul><li>  Needle box.  Embroider two identical squares, process the edges with a seam ‚Äúback needle‚Äù.  Further along these stitches you connect two embroideries among themselves.  Sew a loop in the middle, stuff the product with a synthetic winterizer, and drag decorative brushes along the edges.  It turns out a beautiful needle-souvenir.  It can be used as a decoration for a car. </li><li>  Magnet.  Embroider the lamb pattern, cut off the excess canvas, work on the edges.  Glue the tape.  The result was an original sheep with their own hands. </li><li>  Biscorn.  Embroider two squares with New Year's patterns.  Also, the edges are sewn with a ‚Äúback needle‚Äù seam, only you begin to sew parts from the middle.  That is, the edge of one embroidery is applied to the middle of the other half, drag the needle through the stitches.  For decoration, you can string beads.  Fill with sintepon biscorn, sew to the end of the edge.  Decorate the middle of the product with a button, drag a loop. </li><li>  Sachet.  Such embroidery can be decorated in the form of a candy or a bag filled with aromatic herbs. </li></ul><h2>  Stuffed Toys </h2><p>  We offer to consider how to make a sheep with your own hands a small size (with a palm).  Such toys can become a decorative element in the home, car or developing children's rugs.  For the master class you will need the following material: </p><ul><li>  felt; </li><li>  two beads; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  satin ribbon; </li><li>  synthetic winterizer; </li><li>  knitting threads in the form of balls; </li><li>  black and brown floss. </li></ul><p>  On felt, schematically indicate the body of a lamb, depicting an oval head, legs, tail.  Sew parts, cut the fabric so that when turning out there is an even seam.  Fill with padding polyester, sew up the product. </p><p>  Now with the threads matching the knitting, you take a bump, sew the ends of it and sew it in a lump to the sheep, starting with the head in a circle.  Then sew the ears from the stitches of the satin ribbon.  All threads, knots, ponytails are hidden under the "wool".  Next, sew the beads on the muzzle with a black thread, and embroider a nose with a mouth with a brown floss, bring the thread to the middle of the back and make a loop.  It turned out a beautiful fluffy sheep with your own hands! </p>

To do this, take knitting threads: cotton of three different colors and yarn with fibers or lumps for wool.  Start knitting a sheep from the muzzle. </p><p>  Crochet a circle, forming it into a hexagon.  Then knit without increase, getting a hat, like an acorn.  Then narrow the number of loops to form a long pumpkin with a wide end.  Having finished knitting the muzzle, fasten the thread with bumps and knit wool on the head.  Crochet from cotton to create ears, sew them.  Eyes are made of beads, and the nose and mouth are embroidered with a ‚Äúlittle game‚Äù. </p><p>  Knit from threads with cones the body is oval or round.  Separately, make front and hind legs, adding multi-colored cotton.  Finish their knitting with bumps.  Sew limbs and head to the body.  Stuff all parts of the body with a synthetic winterizer.  The result was a bright sheep with his own hands. </p>
