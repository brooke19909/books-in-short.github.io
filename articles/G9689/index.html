This is due to the activities of the guests of the capital, hotel services, their location and reviews of those who have already stayed there before.  But even if two hotels have approximately equal conditions for customers, then one of them will still be more successful.  Today we will try to reveal the reasons for this using the example of the Hotel Voyage Gallery.  Moscow is a city of spoiled tourists who will choose only the best.  A group of budget travelers is not considered by us today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel gallery voyage moscow" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1802836.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The first thing that guests note is the incomparable interior decoration.  Even at the entrance you understand that you are in a real fairy tale.  Exceptionally selected colors, decor items - everything is so in harmony with each other that it does not cause a feeling of congestion.  The work of the staff is the second point that I want to pay tribute to.  No customer complained of a lack of attention or a rude attitude.  People do not just do their work, they live it, and it is immediately felt. </p><p>  The third big plus is the location of the <span>hotel</span> .  The whole <span>center of Moscow</span> is within walking distance if you stay here.  Whatever the purpose of your visit - entertainment, a business trip or a serious study of cultural and historical values, this will play into the hands. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Hotel "Gallery Voyage" can hardly be called a budget, but the price is quite adequate, given the highest level of service.  Here you can not worry that the number will not meet your expectations.  Any questions that arise can be instantly settled with the administration.  You will be transferred to another number, quickly troubleshoot and apologize.  Therefore, if you like a perfect vacation, then this is the perfect choice. </p>
