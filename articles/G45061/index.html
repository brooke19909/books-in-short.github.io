  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY costumes - cheap and cheerful!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few people believe that creating <span>children's costumes</span> with their own hands at home is not only possible, but also quite simple.  But, in fact, today you can make impressive carnival costumes with your own hands, without making a lot of effort for this and without spending almost any money. </p><p>  The first thing that should not be forgotten is the fact that in order for the character to "come to life" and become convincing, the created costumes with their own hands should be selected taking into account the nature and natural data of the person who will wear these costumes.  A very important point is the person‚Äôs ability to enter the role, that is, his ability to feel himself the character he portrays.  It is also necessary to take into account <span>age-related features,</span> for example, costumes of animals and birds, as well as flowers, will not look too appropriate for children of middle and especially older school age.  Among other things, fancy dresses should be endowed with brightness, colorfulness and expressiveness in form.  Before you start making New Year's costumes with your own hands, you need to accurately imagine the image of that character, which should be the result.  In other words, you need to highlight the most characteristic features and try to strengthen, even exaggerate.  For example, the nose of the sorceress needs to be made much larger than natural, and the scarf should be pulled over the eyes, etc., etc. - a fantasy, if you want to make costumes with your own hands, perhaps the best assistant. </p><p>  To facilitate the task of inventing a costume, you can use reproductions of paintings, illustrations, drawings and caricatures.  Costume production begins with the preparation of patterns.  In the case when there are drawings of patterns they need to be increased - this will be helped by a grid or graph paper.  If there is no pattern drawing, and only an image of the finished product is available, it is necessary to find a pattern that is suitable for the style, and make the basis, and adjust the size already when trying on.  To transfer patterns to material, <span>carbon paper is used,</span> which is superimposed on the material, the pattern is laid on top, then the outline is drawn with a hard pencil.  For the manufacture of costumes with your own hands, a wide variety of materials that are found in every home will do.  It is only necessary that the materials used in the work, by their character, i.e. density, or, conversely, lightness, color and pattern, correspond to the conceived together.  You will also need materials that imitate natural ones well - for example, animal hair, flower petals, etc.  You can use anything you like: clothes, <span>ski suits,</span> as well as rags of fabric and much more. </p><p>  For the manufacture of volumetric and planar forms, cardboard is very suitable.  Separate parts for the pattern are made from cardboard, which are then to be glued together.  To make the joint practical and durable, teeth or strips are cut out on one of the parts to be glued at the joint, which are then bent.  Do not forget that, by gluing individual parts of the costume, the teeth should be placed inside the manufactured part. </p><p>  To decorate do-it-yourself costumes, many seemingly useless materials are used, such as colored braid, threads of wool, ribbons and rags of fabric, corrugated paper, Christmas tree braid, gown, glass beads and buttons, pieces of stanioli, etc. .P.  Using these materials, you can achieve various effects.  For example, embroidery perfectly imitate colored braid or wool sewn with a pattern;  ruffles, ruffles and flowers are easy to make from corrugated paper, and precious stones can be easily replaced with glass beads and buttons. </p>
