    <p>  Bari is a large city in Italy, located on the Adriatic coast.  Norman Castle is one of the main attractions.  It is located near the Cathedral dedicated to Saint Savin. </p><p>  The palace is a trapezoidal fortress that used to overlook the sea, but over time the water receded.  The history of the castle is fascinating.  At first there was the residence of the daughter of Isabella of Aragon.  Then, in the 19th century, the castle turned into a prison, and later became a barracks.  During all this time, the building was rebuilt and reconstructed many times.  Today, the fortress is a museum of casts, and copies of the most valuable Apulian sculptures are stored here.  And the real Norman interiors were preserved only in the Roger Hall. </p><p>  You can visit the Norman Castle any day from 8:15 to 17:45, only on Sunday - until 13:00.  Entrance costs from 5 to 9 euros. </p><h2>  Valentino Palace (Turin) </h2>

    <p>  Valentino Castle is located in northern Italy, in the city of Turin.  In the Middle Ages, it belonged to the Savoy dynasty.  In those days it was a fortified fortress, but now it is difficult to believe in it already.  After all, the castle is least like a fortress.  In the 17th century, it was rebuilt in the French style with elements of Italian Baroque. </p><p>  Today, the palace houses the Faculty of Architecture of the Polytechnic University of Turin.  The castle is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  And you can visit it absolutely free. </p><h2>  Magic palace </h2>

    <p>  The Magic Castle is a place located in the west of Sicily, on the slopes of Monte Cronio.  The structure is the work of not only man, but also nature.  Around it are spread olive groves and thickets of almond trees. </p><p>  A magic castle is thousands of sculptures in the shape of heads that the artist carefully carved out of stone.  His real name is Filippo Bentivena, but the locals called him only as Filippo Day Testi (Philippe Golov). </p><p>  The artist lived in the 20th century, and sculptures were created in the years 20-60.  But from them it blows old and mysterious.  Each head is a separate character endowed with its own personal traits.  Filippo wanted to be a nobleman in dreams, so sculptures are his subjects. </p><p>  The magic castle as a tourist attraction has been operating since 1974. </p><h2>  Medici Riccardi Castle (Florence) </h2>

    <p>  The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is located in Florence.  This is one of the largest and most significant buildings of the Renaissance.  It is also the first building in Florence itself in the Renaissance style. </p><p>  The appearance of the castle can be called modest.  This is due to the fact that Cosimo the Elder, for whom the palace was erected, believed that there was no need to provoke envy, therefore the initial architectural plan with grandiose designs was rejected.  But the interior turned out truly luxurious. </p><p>  After the Medici, the castle passed into the possession of the Riccardi family, which introduced changes in the appearance of the palace and almost doubled it.  Then, in 1814, the palazzo moved to the Loren family. </p><p>  Since 1871, the castle became the property of the city.  Now there are guided tours and various exhibitions, and to this day there is the Riccardian Library. </p><p>  You can visit the Midi-Riccardi castle on all days except Wednesday, from 9 to 19. Admission is 7 euros, children from 6 to 12 years old will go for 4 euros, but people with disabilities and their accompanying tickets do not need tickets. </p><h2>  Castles in Italy.  Rome </h2>

    <p>  The Castle of the Holy Angel is almost two thousand years old.  It was built from 135 to 139 as the mausoleum of Hadrian.  In addition to the emperor himself, his wife is buried here, as well as emperors Antonino Pius with his wife and three children, <span>Marcus Aurelius</span> with his children, Septimius Severus with his wife and children, Geta, Caracalla.  In addition, throughout its history, the castle also managed to visit the vault, the residence of the popes, as well as the prison. </p><p>  The palace got its name thanks to the vision of an angel to Pope Gregory the Great in 590.  In this regard, there is also a corresponding sculpture, which was first wooden, and then marble with bronze wings. </p><p>  Today, many tourists visit the castle with an excursion to see the Military History Museum with the Secret Archive, Treasure Hall, papal apartments, Paul III balcony, Clement VII room, Alexander VII courtyard and more than 50 rooms that form a labyrinth. </p><p>  You can visit the castle every day from 9 to 19:30 for 10 euros. </p><h2>  Rivoli Castle </h2>

    <p>  Rivoli is a small town near Turin.  But it attracts tourists with its <span>ancient castle of</span> impressive size with the preserved spirit of antiquity.  It is believed that the palace was built in the 9-10 century.  But in various documents, he began to appear only in 1159. </p><p>  In the 11th century, the external and internal appearance of the castle undergoes changes associated with the internecine struggle of bishops.  But even despite the necessary restoration, the Rivoli Palace is the only building of the region of the same name of the time, preserved to this day. </p><p>  In the castle was the Savoy Gallery, containing a large number of masterpieces of painting.  But after the French attack, the exhibits were lost.  The room turned into a barracks.  Over time, the castle was converted into a library. </p><p>  From the time of the Second World War until 1970, the palace was not used in any way, it seemed that they had forgotten about it.  Only in 1974 it was restored again, and in 1984 the Museum of Modern Art was opened here. </p><p>  Rivoli Castle is open for tourists from 10:00 to 17:00 on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and on weekends it is open until 19:00.  Admission for adults and children from 12 years old is 6.5 euros, and children under 12 years of age and people with disabilities have free access. </p>
