How to sew a giraffe from a fabric with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sewing soft toys with your own hands is not only useful, but also incredibly exciting.  Even if you have never tried your hand at this needlework, be sure to try to sew at least a small craft.  As a material for work, you can use old things from the wardrobe or scraps of fabric left from sewing clothes.  Beautiful and bright toys are obtained from felt sheets.  Now on sale you can buy them in a variety of colors.  Although they are small in size, they are quite suitable for the details of a soft toy. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to sew a toy giraffe according to the pattern.  You can draw it yourself or take as an example the options below.  The one-piece giraffe and the option consisting of separate parts look interesting.  If this is your first time making a soft toy with your own hands, first sew a small craft, for example, a keychain on keys from a felt sheet.  A synthetic winterizer is usually used as a filler, but artificial wool is also suitable for a small animal. </p><h2>  Giraffe pattern </h2><p>  Before you begin, you need to think over the drawing and draw it on a sheet of cardboard.  If you do not have artistic talent, then use the scheme below.  Just redraw the picture on a sheet of cardboard and cut it along the contours with scissors.  You will get a great template for a giraffe pattern.  Next, you need to put it on the selected fabric and circle it with a chalk or a simple pencil.  Before you cut the part along the contours, step back from the edges of 0.5 cm, making allowances for the seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.sina.com.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="giraffe pattern" class="if uuid-3189636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189636.jpg"></div><p>  If the giraffe‚Äôs figure is flat and consists of only two identical patterns, then one template is made.  For a volumetric toy, tailoring contains many elements.  In the sample giraffe pattern in the photo above, it is clear that 7 details need to be cut.  We need 2 identical ones for the body, 1 element is sewn from the bottom of the abdomen and 4 parts for the ears, 2 parts for each.  The figure of a giraffe in the pattern differs from other animals only in a long neck.  If you have a finished pattern, for example, a horse or a dog, then use it, just extend the neck line a few centimeters up. </p><h2>  Key ring </h2><p>  A small, long-necked creature can be sewn from felt.  This is a great DIY craft material that many craftsmen love.  To sew such a giraffe from felt, as in the photo below, prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  Sheets of felt turquoise and white. </li><li>  A needle with a thread of black color (for beautiful decorative seams, floss thread is often used). </li><li>  Inner filler.  It can be a synthetic winterizer or artificial cotton. </li><li>  Metal keyring. </li><li>  Satin or rep ribbon, matched to the tone of the craft. </li><li>  Pattern drawing made on thick cardboard. </li><li>  Sharpened chalk or marker. </li></ul><p>  The figure of a giraffe for such an easy craft can be drawn by any person, even a schoolboy.  For the body, two identical details of a turquoise color are cut out according to one pattern.  A similar figure is prepared from a thin sheet of synthetic winterizer and placed between the felt blanks.  So that the synthetic winterizer does not peek around the edges of the pattern and does not come out between the seam threads, it is cut out without allowances on the sides, but by moving the scissors clearly along the contours of the pattern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hobbycraft.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="giraffe keychain" class="if uuid-3189547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189547.jpg"></div><p>  Further details are sewn with an external decorative seam over the edge.  Do not forget to immediately insert a loop of tape on the top of the head to thread the metal ring.  It remains to cut the oval to form the muzzle and sew it onto the lower part of the giraffe's head.  The remaining small parts are embroidered with black thread.  That's it, the giraffe keychain is ready, you can put on the keys! </p><h2>  Finger theater character </h2><p>  A flat giraffe toy can be made without an internal filler.  The size of the craft should be slightly larger than the thumb.  To show the finger theater of the hero, fairy tales are put on the phalanx, therefore when stitching two parts of the body between themselves from the bottom, they do not stitch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finger theater figure" class="if uuid-3189669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189669.jpg"></div><p>  It turns out a small pocket.  The main work is done on sewing and decorating small details - horns, spots on the entire body of the beast, the image of the nose and eyes.  It is most convenient to sew the characters of theatrical performance from sheets of felt.  Crafts are bright and colorful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Small toy with a pattern </h2><p>  Children love small soft toys that you can take with you on the road, put in a backpack or under a pillow in a dream.  Such a small version of the craft, as in the photo below, will surely appeal to the child.  How to sew a giraffe from felt sheets, you already know.  Let's look at another example of a soft toy with a tail, a large head and a muzzle, made in the form of a white felt applique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a giraffe" class="if uuid-3189686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189686.jpg"></div><p>  To redraw the pattern on a sheet of cardboard is not difficult.  Ears, an oval of the muzzle and horns are drawn immediately on the main template.  Then they are pasted over with carved elements of other colors.  So, horns can be black or brown, muzzle - white.  The spots are cut out of arbitrary shape, and then simply glued to the craft.  What is convenient for working with felt?  It is not only pleasant to the touch, but also warm and soft, but also perfectly cut with scissors, stitched with thread and glued with hot glue. </p><h2>  Pattern of parts </h2><p>  A soft toy can be made not only one-piece, but also made up of individual elements.  The drawing below shows patterns for the body, legs, ears and horns.  You will need to cut several elements at once: </p><ul><li>  2 pieces - for the body; </li><li>  8 pcs  - for paws of a giraffe; </li><li>  4 things.  - for the ears. </li></ul><p>  The same for thin horns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unleashapp.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="giraffe from parts" class="if uuid-3189660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189660.jpg"></div><p>  This craft is sewn of cotton fabric, specially selected polka-dot material, so as not to stick spots on the body of the animal later.  For hoofs, pick up either a contrasting fabric or in harmony with the main background.  As a filler, stock up on synthetic winterizer, but not sheet, as in flat felt crafts, but resembling cotton wool. </p><h2>  Sewing toys </h2><p>  First of all, you need to make the correct cutting according to the pattern proposed in the article.  All details are cut with allowances for seams about 0.5 cm wide. Elements of the figure are sewn along the seamy side of the sewing machine or manually with tight stitches.  Leave a small filling hole. </p><p>  Then the workpiece is turned on the front side and filled with padding polyester.  To fill the entire inner part to the end, you will need a thin rod.  With its help, the filler is pushed into the farthest pockets of the workpiece.  When the body part of the soft toy of the giraffe has acquired the necessary shape, the seam is sewn to the end with internal neat stitches. </p><p>  The paws of the animal are attached to the body with buttons.  On the outside of the neck, attach a strip of felt diced with noodles, ears and horns. </p><h2>  1-piece giraffe </h2><p>  From cotton fabric, it is easy to make the following version of the craft according to the pattern proposed below.  In total, cutting consists of two elements that are sewn along the wrong side around the entire perimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece giraffe" class="if uuid-3189664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189664.jpg"></div><p>  A small filler hole is left at the level of the tail of the giraffe.  To form it, you can use satin or crepe thin ribbons woven with a pigtail, and silk lace will look good. </p><h2>  Big toy </h2><p>  You can sew a large giraffe from the fabric with your own hands according to the following pattern.  The photo below clearly shows what parts the body, stomach and tail consist of.  In the sample, they are tailored from blue flannel, as are the outer parts of the ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.printstopolkadots.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cutting fabrics according to the pattern" class="if uuid-3189587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189587.jpg"></div><p>  The hooves, horns and inner parts of the ears are represented by a different, light shade.  It is easier to sew a large soft toy than to mess with small bends of fabric.  This craft can be put to the child in bed as a pillow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.printstopolkadots.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="soft toy" class="if uuid-3189584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3189584.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs easy to sew soft toys according to patterns; the main thing is to try and want to please your baby.  By this principle, you can make any animal or fairy-tale hero.  Have a good start! </p>
