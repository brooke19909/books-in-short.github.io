Pentax 645Z was able to offer functionality unique to mid-format cameras.  Moisture-proof housing, screen sighting, <span>video capture,</span> not to mention the extremely wide sensitivity range, 27-point phase-AF system and high performance.  And, of course, he has incredible detail and a very large bright viewfinder.  Maybe it's time to say goodbye to the full frame? </p><h2>  Pentax 645Z, Pentax 645D: comparison </h2><p>  In early 2010, Pentax launched the 645D, a mid-format digital SLR camera that has been under development over the previous five years.  Perhaps it was too long, but, nevertheless, the time was not wasted in vain.  The 645D outperformed its rivals Nikon, Canon, and Sony with a sensor area of ‚Äã‚Äã2/3 a larger full frame, unique appearance, and shallower <span>depth of field.</span>  At the same time, the camera has become much more affordable than analogues of other medium-format manufacturers, such as Phase One and Hasselblad, while remaining strong enough to be used in the field. </p><p>  The reason Pentax, for the first time since its purchase of Ricoh, was able to offer the camera at a more attractive price than others, is quite simple.  Most of the 645D's developments can be used in the mass production of APS-C DSLRs, while Phase One and Hasselblad do not sell consumer SLR cameras - the design costs are borne exclusively by their medium format products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  While the Pentax has always lacked (and still lacks) a full-frame digital SLR camera, the 645D has become desirable for enthusiasts and original enough to attract pros for whom resolution and format are more important than high-speed capture.  And by 2010 standards, the resolution was really great.  The 645D struck with unprecedented detail, indistinguishable by the eye. </p><p>  Like the medium-format film cameras in whose footsteps she walked, the 645D was not intended for the mass market.  Its market niche has decreased even more since the time of film machines, but, nevertheless, this model was important for the company, like its successor Pentax 645Z. </p><p>  The camera has much in common with the Ricoh flagship APS-C SLRs, and thanks to the 4 years of development since the launch of the 645D, there was no shortage of new features. </p>

    <h2>  Sensor and processor </h2><p>  The most important feature was the all-new 51-megapixel CMOS sensor paired with the PRIME III image processor, first introduced in K-3.  The 645Z also inherits its SAFOX 11 27-point autofocus and 86,000-pixel color measurement system. </p><p>  The new Pentax 645Z image sensor has an extremely wide (by the standards of mid-format cameras) sensitivity range, reaching ISO 204,800.  Screen sighting and Full HD video shooting were also absent from the predecessors.  Performance has taken a big step forward, at least compared to other mid-format cameras.  This is not a sports camera yet, but its speed is almost 3 times faster than the 645D.  And post-processing time has decreased by more than half. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lens correction </h2><p>  Like its predecessor, the Pentax 645Z Lenses correction function allows you to correct distortion and lateral <span>chromatic aberration.</span>  In addition, it became possible to correct peripheral illumination and diffraction.  The function works with DA645, D FA645 and FA645 lenses, but not with A645 or adapted 67 lenses. </p>

    <h2>  New opportunities </h2><p>  The camera boasts a larger, tilting LCD panel with a higher resolution, all the more useful given the new on-screen viewing feature.  Shutter life was doubled to 100,000 shots.  Therefore, photos taken by Pentax 645Z are cheaper than pictures of their predecessor. </p><p>  The manufacturer equipped its camera, like the K-3, with a high-speed USB 3.0 port and a UHS-I-compatible slot for a Secure Digital memory card and a Pentax Flucard slot for remote wireless control, including on-screen viewing.  It is possible to shoot 4K-video, however, without sound.  But Full HD-video is accompanied by stereo sound recorded on-board microphone or external, with automatic or manual adjustment. </p><p>  Outwardly, the camera is quite squat, its depth is especially great.  It is very likely that the camera will attract attention when shooting, so it is not suitable for those who want to go unnoticed.  But shooting landscapes, nature, objects will allow you to create absolutely amazing pictures.  Although the size of the camera exceeds the typical sizes of professional DSLR cameras, its weight corresponds to devices with a smaller sensor, such as the Canon EOS 1D X. By the standards of medium format, the model is relatively compact and lightweight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Type of full face </h2><p>  Seen from the front, the Pentax 645Z is very similar to its predecessor.  The most noticeable difference is the brand new silver badge on the prism of the viewfinder, which was black.  But if you look under the outer shell, the case will be completely different.  Depth increased by 4 mm, and weight - by 71 g. The camera is not small, but not too large, as one might think by looking at the photo. </p><p>  The height and width of the Pentax 645Z is not much different from the typical full-frame D800 cameras Canon EOS 5D Mark III or Nikon.  The device is slightly narrower and shorter than the professional Canon EOS 1D X or <span>Nikon D4S</span> cameras <span>,</span> largely due to the lack of a portrait grip. </p><p>  645Z loses in comparison in depth and weight.  A medium format sensor, so much needed in other areas, requires a much larger module to accommodate the mirror.  This additional depth is 25-35 mm.  Weight is about a quarter more than the D4S, and is 1.55 kg in the assembled state. </p><p>  But this is a small fee for a sensor increased by 2/3, compared to a 35 mm full frame.  On the plus side, there is sufficient space for external controls specifically designed for use with gloves.  The frost-resistant design of the case also does not interfere with shooting in extreme conditions.  In addition, due to the presence of 76 seals, the design is resistant to weathering and dust. </p><p>  There are no questions about the professional performance of the case.  It is made of cast aluminum, the outer shell is made of magnesium alloy, without a hint of polycarbonate. </p>

    <h2>  View from above </h2><p>  When viewed from above, you can find several differences between the Pentax 645Z and 645D.  Three new user modes appeared on the control disk to facilitate access to previously created settings groups.  The line of buttons on the left side has also been redone.  SD replaced AF and lock, and the order for moving the bracketing forward was also changed.  There is also a new stereo microphone, the two holes of which are located on the sides of the viewfinder, and the speaker is a little further on the right side of the case. </p>

    <h2>  Rear end </h2><p>  The changes on the back of the 645Z are related to the new LCD monitor.  The display became 3.2 inches larger diagonally and acquired a tilt mechanism for viewing above head, at waist level, or low off the ground. </p><p>  A number of buttons, which used to be under the display, disappeared, and their 4 functions went to the navigation buttons.  They are also used to adjust the position of the AF point, as in the <span>Pentax K-3.</span> </p><p>  The button column to the right of the LCD has become a square cluster in the right rear of the camera.  One of them, the Delete button, has acquired a video recording function.  And since the AF point selection is now located elsewhere, the disc to the right of the viewfinder that was previously used for this now serves as the Still / Movie control dial. </p>

    <h2>  Side panels </h2><p>  The left side of the 645Z case lost a composite video output, instead of which a new 3.5 mm stereo microphone jack appeared.  The remaining ports are located under one rubber plug.  The USB connector has now become USB 3.0 SuperSpeed, and the location of the ports has changed.  There are also 2 Secure Digital Card slots, one of which is compatible with UHS-I. </p><p>  The wire terminal of the recreation center, previously located under the cover on the rear panel, is now located in the handle.  This is a logical step, given the lack of space elsewhere.  If you shoot using the remote control, you do not need to hold the camera. </p>

    <h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  On Pentax 645Z, the photos are excellent, with absolutely breathtaking detail, especially at basic sensitivity.  A wider range of the latter is very convenient, allowing you to make 11 x 14-inch prints up to ISO 6400 and 4 x 6 ‚Äùprints up to ISO 51,200. As is usual with Pentax cameras, color reproduction at default settings is sometimes inaccurate, but very unlikely so that the user of the professional camera leaves the factory settings. </p><h2>  Pentax 645Z: photographer reviews </h2><p>  Users positively appreciate the huge resolution and detail of the camera, its high photosensitivity, the presence of a durable waterproof housing and a large, bright viewfinder.  Photographers note a good and fast operation of autofocus in low light conditions, device performance, long battery life and the ability to shoot Full HD-video. </p><p>  The complaints are cumbersome due to the design compared to APS-C or full-frame digital SLR cameras, the tendency to image defects, the concentration of AF points near the center of the frame, and the lack of suitable waterproof and digitally optimized lenses.  And the unusual appearance attracts the attention of passers-by. </p><p>  A camera without a lens has been available since June 2014 at a price of 625-646 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The size and price of the Pentax 645Z suggests that this camera is not for everyone - many will be satisfied with a smaller APS-C sensor or a full-frame camera - but its insatiable craving for details has allowed it to stand out.  Those who regularly print photos of very large sizes and need maximum detail should stop at the 645Z - a medium format camera that impresses with its quality and affordability. </p>
