Then you need to visit the resort of Makadi Bay.  Here you can enjoy sunrises and sunsets, see the amazing underwater world and the busy life of the inhabitants of <span>coral reefs.</span>  Makadi Bey is one of the newest resorts in Egypt, it is located 18 kilometers south of Hurghada on the Red Sea, surrounded by desert dunes. </p><p>  In the resort of Makadi Bay, hotels built mainly in the Arabian style stand on a deserted deserted coast, there are no settlements nearby.  Shops, discos, restaurants and bars, all this infrastructure is in abundance right on the hotel territory, beyond it there is only a desert.  Such an arrangement of Makadi Bay hotels will undoubtedly appeal to those who are attracted by a relaxing holiday by the sea, high-quality service and who do not want to be close to the hustle and bustle of such a large and lively resort as Hurghada. </p><p>  Makadi Bay hotels are located along the sandy beach, their territory is adjacent to the sea.  More than 15 hotels have already been built on a secluded shore and construction of others is ongoing.  The beach stretches along the entire resort, it is large and sandy, but the sand is mixed with quite a lot of shells.  In some places, you need to enter the sea carefully due to the presence of shells, small stones and dead corals at the bottom.  The sea near the resort is full of diverse marine life, there are two underwater coral reefs.  Those tourists who want to have fun and plunge into the noisy crowd can easily reach Hurghada in a matter of minutes.  In addition, you can take advantage of the excursion program and visit the historical places of Egypt.  Go to Cairo to see the pyramids and visit the eastern bazaar or visit Luxor, all these excursions can be booked with tour operators right at the hotel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews of Makadi Bay hotels suggest that they provide the highest level of tourist service.  All hotels have a 4-5 star class, there are simply no three-star hotels here, many well-known chain hotels are represented among them: Sol Y Mar, Swiss Inn, Le Meridien, Iberotel.  Most of the resort's hotels operate on an all-inclusive basis.  Several friendly hotels Sol Y Mar Makadi Sun 4 *, Sol Y Mar Makadi Star &amp; Spa, Sol Y Mar Club Makadi 4 *, Sol Y Mar Makadi Marine 4 * and <span>Iberotel Makadi Oasis Family Resort 4 *, Iberotel Makadi</span> Oasis 4 *, located together, form a large single hotel complex.  It includes themed restaurants - Samakino fish restaurant, Sofra Egyptian restaurant, Nino`s <span>Italian restaurant</span> , Cafe Blue cafe, as well as a disco, a beauty salon, a hookah room and a billiard room.  There is a bank with a currency exchange and a shopping gallery with shops selling gold, souvenirs and products. </p><p>  Makadi Bay hotels also include two Azur hotels - Royal Azur 4 * and Club Azur 4 *.  A few years ago, the Makadi Serena Spa 5 * and <span>Sunrise Royal Makadi</span> Resort 5 * hotels opened.  The comfortable Le Meridien Makadi Bay 5 * is located completely separately.  This hotel has an unusually large territory and its beach is one of the best in the resort.  Only when settling in it, vacationers need to take into account that some buildings are already very deep in a large territory and you will have to make kilometer walks to get to the sea and restaurants. </p><p>  Coral reef diving is very popular in Makadi Bay.  Ideal conditions for <span>scuba diving</span> and windsurfing enthusiasts are created on the coast, and the mountains protect it from gusty winds and sandstorms.  Makadi Bay hotels help lovers of a wide variety of relaxation find something to their liking.  In addition to beach recreation and marine entertainment, there are tennis courts, boutiques, evening discos and nightly shows, the list is pretty long.  Oriental complacency and hospitality of the local staff, a fabulous atmosphere of relaxation, sweets and local wines will make your trip to Makadi Bay unforgettable. </p>
