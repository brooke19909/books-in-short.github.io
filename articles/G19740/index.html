It is interesting and at the same time scary to observe that our descendants are versed in technology much better than us.  Increasingly, a situation occurs when parents call their children to help turn off the protective functions on some technique, which are designed to protect it from the intervention of the little ones themselves. </p><p>  Such a craving for electronics can not be stopped in the bud, because when children grow up, it will surround them everywhere.  But to allow uncontrolled use of new products would be wrong.  In order not to be afraid for your child, the PlayPad 3 children's tablet was developed, the reviews of which we will now consider.  How is it unique and what distinguishes it from ordinary tablets?  Let's examine everything in order. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  From the technical side, the tablet is not particularly stand out.  It is installed, depending on the configuration, not very productive Allwinner or Rockchip processor with two cores of 1.2-1.6 GHz.  It works in tandem with 512 MB of RAM.  To store the OS, system and program files, as well as a small amount of user files, a built-in flash memory of 4 GB is provided, which, if desired, can be expanded using a standard microSD drive, the volume of which, in turn, can reach 32 GB.  This will be enough to download a fairly large number of educational cartoons in case you suddenly have problems with the Internet. </p>

    <p>  A Wi-Fi module is provided for connecting to the network.  Information is displayed on a display with a diagonal of 7 inches and a resolution of 1024x600 pixels.  There is a main camera with which your child will be able to take pictures, even if not of the best quality.  With a front-facing camera, he will always be able to chat with friends and relatives via video. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Looking at this data, we see the PlayPad 3 budget employee in front of us. Its characteristics are very mediocre.  What is its feature? </p><h2>  The main positive aspects of the tablet </h2><p>  Among the highlights of this tablet, thanks to which it can be positioned as a children's device, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Shockproof housing.  The back cover of the tablet is made of soft plastic and is additionally rubberized.  There are no toxic substances in the materials that could harm the child.  But do not forget that only the case is shockproof, so immediately after the purchase, think about protecting the screen, otherwise the PlayPad 3 display may not last long. </li><li>  Good autonomy.  In minimum load mode, the battery lasts up to 10 hours.  In the mode of watching movies or games, the operating time is about 3-5 hours. </li><li>  The display is made using special technology, which has a minimal effect on vision, so even prolonged use of the tablet will not lead to bad consequences. </li><li>  The parental control features, which we will talk about a little later, allow you to set restrictions for the child so that he does not see anything superfluous through the PlayPad 3 children's tablet. Reviews often praise this feature. </li></ul>

    <p>  This game format allows you to more deeply interest the child and help him learn a lot. </p><h2>  Parental control </h2><p>  After starting the children's shell, you can close it only after entering the password.  Inside it, access to the Internet is limited, and the child can only get to certain sites from a list that can be edited independently.  He will also be able to use YouTube‚Äôs video hosting, but only videos from certain channels will be allowed to view. </p><p>  An application store from Google is not accessible from the children's shell, but there is its own market with development and educational programs and games.  The child will be able to freely install applications from there within the free memory of the device, almost like on a regular tablet. </p>

    <p>  When you turn off the child mode, you find yourself in the standard interface of the Android system, which is no different from most other devices.  You can work with it like with a regular tablet.  There are no restrictions.  The PlayPad 3 children's tablet, the reviews of which we will now analyze, recalls its purpose only in a bright case.  Therefore, when giving a tablet to a child, always make sure that the blocking of inappropriate content is turned on. </p><h2>  Tablet customer reviews </h2><p>  Remember that the developmental tablet for children PlayPad 3 is positioned as an inexpensive device.  Therefore, one should not expect too high results from him.  Among the positive aspects, users primarily note a high-quality case that can survive in children's careless hands.  Many people like the learning functions of this gadget. </p><p>  However, a large number of users complain about the poor build quality and components.  As a result, warranty cases occur quite often.  It is worth noting that the manufacturer is worried about its reputation and makes warranty repairs or even replacement of devices without any problems.  But nevertheless, the fact is not very pleasant, since failure of the child, even if for a while, of his favorite toy, especially such as the PlayPad 3 children's tablet, can be a disappointment. </p>

    <p>  Reviews highlight several more important flaws.  Among other disadvantages, the hardware that is not very productive for today is noted and, as a result, the system slows down.  But given that the tablet is primarily a toy, and its price is not too high, everything falls into place.  If you want to give your child a nice gift, this tablet will be just right.  In this case, just do not expect that it will last a very long time.  As a rule, toys do not live long. </p>
