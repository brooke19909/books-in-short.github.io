For almost every product selected, gum is needed.  Many people think that this is the most boring part of creating a new product.  But this is not so.  <span>Knitting an elastic band with knitting needles</span> can be no less fun than creating a complex pattern.  The main thing is to try to get acquainted with their diversity and choose the one that you like. </p><h2>  About gum - honestly </h2><p>  Knitting an elastic band with knitting needles is a combination of front and back loops.  These loops form vertical stripes, due to which stretching is carried out. </p><p>  In the gum, convex lines are formed by facial loops, in concave - by purl.  Products that are tied with an elastic band are able to fit tightly.  In this case, you should carefully consider the choice of yarn.  If you select the wool, you must understand that the product will be elastic, stretching elastic.  If you buy cotton threads, then the elastic will be even and flat.  A tight-fitting sweater knitted from improperly selected yarn will not fit the figure well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting elastic" class="if uuid-2995522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995522.jpg"></div><p>  Usually gum is knitted with needles that are one, two or three sizes smaller than those that are necessary for the pattern of the main fabric.  A nice pattern is obtained by combining a simple elastic band with lace, braids and even crossed loops.  But changing the length of the finished product, which is tied with an elastic band, is particularly difficult, because everything will vary depending on the width of the product is compressed or stretched.  As a result, if the instruction does not provide any other recommendation, it is best to measure half-stretched rubber bands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple and familiar </h2><p>  A feature of a simple rubber band can be called the alternation of front and back loops.  They fit one above the other in accordance with the provided pattern. </p><p>  To tie a simple rubber band, you need to dial an even number of stitches (knit one front, then one wrong side, and so on until the end of the row).  Knit the second row in the same way as the first.  If the craftswoman for some reason scored an odd number of stitches, the first in the row of the loop must be tied to the front, and then alternate one wrong side and one front to the end of the row.  In the next row, knit the first stitch on the wrong side, and then, in turn, one front and one wrong side - to the end of the row. </p><h2>  About double in a nutshell </h2><p>  If knitting a double elastic band begins with knitting needles, then the craftswoman knows that in the end a rather elastic fabric will be obtained.  It will have very clear convex and concave lines.  The rapport is simple: two front and two purl loops. </p><p>  In order for knitting an elastic band with knitting needles to be correct, it is necessary that the number of loops that are a multiple of four participate in knitting.  In each new row, the rapport will be repeated from the beginning to the end of the row.  For balance, at the end of each of the knit rows, you need to connect the number of stitches that is a multiple of four (as already mentioned), plus two stitches.  At the beginning of the first row, knit two facial loops.  And then already begin work on the rapport - two wrong loops, two front loops - and so knit to the end of the row.  Start the second row with knitting two purl, then two facial, two purl - and so on to the end of the row. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  They say she came to us from England </h2><p>  Knitting can be truly fascinating.  English gum has long been a classic needlework.  From the outside, this is one of the most interesting types of gum.  One of the conditions is that an odd number of loops are involved in the work. </p><p>  By the way, if in some product it is mentioned that it must be knitted with a patent elastic band, this means that English elastic should be used with knitting needles.  The knitting pattern (get acquainted with it on the example of 1x1 gum) is as follows: </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gum Knitting Pattern" class="if uuid-2995529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995529.jpg"></div><p>  It is necessary to dial the number of loops, which is a multiple of two, plus two more loops. </p><p>  First row.  Knit elastic 1 x 1: one front, one wrong side.  And so on until the end of the row. </p><p>  Second row.  The front loop knits the front loop, yarn, remove the wrong loop without knitting it, the thread remains behind the knitting.  So repeat to the end of the row. </p><p>  The third row and all subsequent.  Knit the front loop with a yarn, make a crochet, remove the wrong loop from the wrong side, leave the thread behind the knitting. </p><p>  Here it turns out the English gum knitting.  The knitting pattern explains in detail all the actions.  Therefore, difficulties should not arise. </p><h2>  Fashion hat </h2><p>  Knitting hats with elastic knitting needles has become popular in recent years.  They are warm, comfortable and fit easily on two knitting needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For a head volume of 50 cm on knitting needles, dial 92 loops, of which two will be edging.  Most often, the caps are knitted with two-by-two elastic bands, that is, two loops - front, and two - wrong. </p><p>  Knitting hats with an English rubber band with knitting needles should also not cause difficulties, because in the work we will apply the method of making gum in the way described just above. </p><p>  The first edge in each row is removed not knitted, and the last is always wrong.  So the edges of the caps are flat.  Thus, knit several rows, so that in height it turns out about twenty centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.varagesale.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted cap" class="if uuid-2995557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995557.jpg"></div><p>  After this, you can begin to make the reduction on the top of the head.  To reduce one row, the front loops are knitted in the usual way, and the wrong ones - two together.  So, the number of purl loops is halved.  Now knit four more rows according to the drawing, how the loops go.  And after that - make another decrease row: knit the back loops in two together.  If the craftswoman does everything right, then it should turn out like this: one facial, two wrong together, one facial, two wrong together, and so on until the end of the row.  According to the drawing, one front loop and one wrong side are obtained. </p><p>  We continue to decrease.  Remove the hem and knit the first loop.  Now knit three loops at once.  Next, knit the next chain, and after it three loops together.  There will be no more reductions. </p><p>  Assembly caps.  On a plastic needle, collect all the loops on a thread.  Tighten them well and make a knot.  After stitching the cap on the side.  Hide unnecessary strings in a knitting fabric.  Turn out the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="luciafontaine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted cap" class="if uuid-2995549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995549.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting hats with English rubber knitting needles is carried out in a similar way.  Only the picture will be slightly different. </p><h2>  Gum french </h2><p>  Knitting is one of the most productive types of needlework.  <span>French gum</span> looks very impressive, so the craftswomen often use it to knit skirts for girls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="luciafontaine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting elastic" class="if uuid-2995799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995799.jpg"></div><p>  Type on the number of stitches, which is a multiple of four, plus three stitches.  Tie two front, two wrong.  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that in this case it is not so easy to knit facial loops.  First, knit a second facial loop, then the first one.  In the second row - when the wrong side is tied, the front loops are knitted in a simple way, and the wrong ones in the other. </p><h2>  Gum Italian </h2><p>  Knitting gum with knitting needles in the Italian manner will not cause the craftswoman much trouble.  The main thing is to do everything according to the formula of the pattern, which is one-sided. </p><p>  On the knitting need to dial the number of loops, a multiple of four. </p><p>  First row: ‚Ä¢ two wrong, two front, * two wrong. </p><p>  Second row: ‚Ä¢ two facial, two wrong, 'two facial. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-2995561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995561.jpg"></div><p>  Third row: ‚Ä¢ two purl, two oblique (first knit the second loop for the back wall, then the first), two purl. </p><p>  Fourth row: 'two front, two wrong stitches (first knit the second stitch on the wrong side, and then the first stitch),' two faces. </p><p>  Fifth row: repeat the pattern from the third row. </p><p>  Knitting will help to create all this beauty.  English gum has already been discussed above.  I must say that, despite the fact that it is quite popular among craftswomen, there is another option that is often used in various products. </p><h2>  Eraser Macedonian </h2><p>  Macedonian gum is a pattern designed due to the corrugation of the canvas for children's skirts, jumpers for kids and for adults.  But on the collars and cuffs the elastic will not look: the fabric is loose.  But for a hat or a snout, it will be quite appropriate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.womansweekly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfortable knitting needles" class="if uuid-2995778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/2995778.jpg"></div><p>  On the knitting needles, dial the number of stitches, which will be a multiple of 4, plus one stitch for symmetry and plus two edge stitches. </p><p>  First row.  * 3 front eyelets, 1 wrong eyelet *, 1 front eyelet. </p><p>  2 row and all the rest - in knitting repeat 1 row. </p>
