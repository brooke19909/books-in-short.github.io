Where to relax at sea in Russia?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vacations are just around the corner.  Where to go with the whole family so that your vacation will be remembered for a long time and not be too burdensome for the family budget?  It is not necessary to take into account European countries and exotic islands, there are more than enough places to relax in Russia. </p><h2>  Pros of relaxing at home </h2><p>  There are a lot of them: </p><ul><li>  Domestic travel is always cheaper than traveling abroad. </li><li>  You do not need to apply for a visa, which means you will save time and money. </li><li>  There is no language barrier, you can freely speak your native Russian. </li><li>  The presence of comfortable resorts and resorts, not inferior to European. </li></ul><p>  For example, you can get to Anapa from almost any part of Russia by train, paying about 4000 rubles.  About 500 rubles a day can go to a modest room for living.  Meals - of course, not in a restaurant, but in their own cooking - will take another 2,000 rubles.  Total, a seven-day trip to the sea costs about 10,000. And there are a lot of options for where to relax at sea in Sochi, Anapa, Gelendzhik, Tuapse, Novorossiysk. </p><h2>  Choose a route for travel </h2><p>  Thinking about where to relax in Russia should begin in advance, because this country is truly vast.  What do you prefer: to lie on a golden beach under the hot sun, wander through the endless forests, conquer the snow-capped peaks?  Maybe you like water activities: rafting, paragliding, windsurfing and diving?  Or do you want to take a quiet and informative tour with your family?  Having decided on your wishes, think about which time of the year is more suitable for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Russia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/395504.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, November is considered one of the most budget months for tourism, summer excitement is falling, far before winter holidays.  If you are going to relax with your child in Russia, then the Black Sea coast at this time of the year will surprise you with the warm sea and mild weather, which is nice to make excursions to unique grottoes and waterfalls.  In the summer months, air temperature reaches 35 degrees. </p><p>  Ski resorts in the Caucasus (Dombay) in November are already waiting for their visitors.  <span>The forests of Karelia</span> and the magnificent nature of the Altai Mountains at this time are especially mysterious, as if it freezes in anticipation of winter. </p><p>  Not only November is so diverse.  Russia includes three climatic zones, so every month spent in different parts of the country will show you its unique charm. </p><h2>  Economical rest, weekend tours </h2><p>  If you are thinking about where to relax in Russia, and at your disposal only a few days, then this is a great budget option.  Very popular with the older generation are excursions along the Golden Ring and visits to ancient cities: Vladimir, Suzdal, Kostroma and others.  Another destination may be a vacation in the sanatoriums of the Moscow Region or Altai (the famous Belokurikha). </p><p>  Do you like outdoor activities?  Then the places where to relax in Russia, simply can not be counted for you.  Ski resorts near Moscow, small hiking tours along <span>the Katun River,</span> visiting waterfalls and unique lakes.  Rafting, cycling and horseback riding - for everyone there is relaxation for the heart. </p><h2>  The most relevant - beach holidays </h2>

The majestic forests, hiking for mushrooms and berries, as well as relaxing on the beach will give you great memories for many months.  This option is well suited if you are looking for a cheap place to relax in Russia.  Only 18 km from Petrozavodsk - and you find yourself on the sandy beach of Lake Onega. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where in Russia it is inexpensive to relax" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/395516.jpg?1399984501764" width="538"></div>

    <h2>  Budget option - rest on the Volga </h2><p>  The name of this river is inextricably linked with Russia.  Forming hundreds of branches, she preserved the wonderful world of islands with pristine nature.  Thousands of species of birds, animals and fish live here.  If for various reasons you can‚Äôt decide where to relax at sea in Russia, then enjoy a beach holiday on the banks of the Volga. </p><p>  The Vasilievsky Islands, a section of the Saratov reservoir, are very popular.  Great fishing, walks through shady forests, endless strawberry glades - all this you will get without any extra costs.  You can use the services of numerous recreation centers along the banks of the river or put up a tent and spend your holidays in harmony with nature. </p><p>  Rybinsk Reservoir (Yaroslavl Oblast) is another budget holiday option.  Tourism here is not very developed, so low prices for accommodation, always free beaches, excellent fishing, a bonfire and delicious barbecue in the evening. </p><p>  Cruise vacations are gaining popularity today.  And the countless number of rivers, seas and lakes in Russia provides a rich choice of route. </p><h2>  Extreme lovers </h2><p>  You can have a good rest in Russia not only by warming your sides on the beach or admiring the beauties of a cruise ship.  The Ural and Caucasus mountains invite you to spend an exciting vacation, skiing or trying yourself as a climber.  The most famous resorts are Krasnaya Polyana, Elbrus region, Dombay.  With a more modest budget, you can make a trip to Altai, with the subjugation of the majestic Belukha. </p><p>  It is difficult to answer unambiguously where you can relax in Russia.  Each corner of the vast country is fraught with many unique places, monuments, corners of untouched nature.  That is why tour operators have developed such a large number of foot, horse and bike trips, each of which covers only a small route with its own charms.  Fashionable destinations for tourists (especially those with medical restrictions on the degree of leisure activity) are jeeping and snowmobile safaris and ATVs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Russia" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/395507.jpg?1399983861748" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  This is only a small part of those places where you can relax in Russia.  A resident of each individual city will boldly call you another dozen beautiful places.  This is an amazing country with unusually beautiful nature.  There is not enough time to list how many reserves, reserves and natural parks it is fraught with.  And if comfortable tours with accommodation in luxury hotels are almost on an equal footing with holidays abroad, then, having put on your sneakers and taking a GPS-navigator, you can go hiking on your own chosen route.  Needless to say, this will give a lot of positive and will not undermine your budget! </p>
