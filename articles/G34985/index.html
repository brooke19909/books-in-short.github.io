Many years of standing in apartment lines and wandering around garrisons did not at all guarantee the receipt of the coveted square meters by the time of departure for a well-deserved rest. </p><h2>  Soft loan program </h2><p>  Today the situation is fundamentally different.  Using a funded mortgage program, a soldier can acquire personal housing after several years of service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosvoenipoteka how to find out how much the account" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1418272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each month, the state transfers a certain amount to the soldier‚Äôs account, which increases every year.  After 36 months, sufficient capital is accumulated to make the down payment on the mortgage.  Control and accrual of funds is carried out by an organization called Rosvoenipoteka.  How to find out how much the account has accumulated at one time or another?  The answer to this question is very important.  After all, such information allows you to correctly assess your financial situation and determine the willingness to purchase housing. </p><h2>  The procedure for accumulating funds </h2><p>  So, you have a military mortgage.  How to find out how much the account has accumulated at a certain point, we will tell a little lower.  Now let's talk about the rules by which funds are accumulated: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Monthly money is credited to the personal account of the participant in the funded program. </li><li>  Transfers are made until the soldier has a mortgage loan.  After this, the funds begin to flow already to the account of the financial institution. </li><li>  You cannot get money on hand.  And you can use them only for the purchase of housing. </li><li>  Only those who are registered can participate in the program. </li><li>  The accumulated funds can be used no earlier than 36 months from the moment of registration. </li><li>  A program participant can purchase housing at a higher cost than provided.  In this case, he will cover the difference from personal savings. </li><li>  The bank in which the <span>mortgage registration</span> is planned must be accredited to participate in the program for the military. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, not every soldier may decide to purchase housing even under the Rosvoenipoteka program.  How to find out how much is in the account, is it enough for the first installment?  Is it worth the wait until more money accumulates?  We will try to answer these questions below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out how much is in the account by registration number" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1418271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Formation Rules </h2><p>  The conditions under which the accounts of participants in <span>the NIS</span> state <span>system</span> are formed are spelled out in the Decree of the Government of Russia.  According to the document, the beginning of the formation of the amount of accumulations in the account of the program participant is considered the moment of occurrence of the grounds for entering the army man in the register.  At the same time, it does not depend on the date of entering the information or on exactly when the personal savings account was opened.  The amount of savings consists of two flows: state contribution, monthly coming from the budget, and income from investments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first part is established by law and is growing annually.  If in 2005 the amount of charges amounted to only 37 thousand Russian rubles, in 2015 the amount reached 245 thousand 880 rubles.  Moreover, annually (except for 2016), contributions are indexed as inflation increases.  Therefore, they cannot be less than last year. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="military mortgage how to find out how much is in the account" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1418270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to a few more points.  Firstly, in the case when a soldier voluntarily leaves the armed forces without having served in the army for 10 years and has not had time to exercise the right to purchase housing on a military mortgage, all accumulated funds are subject to return to the state budget.  <span>The personal account</span> is closed.  Secondly, if the apartment was nevertheless bought, and the soldier resigned without having served the cherished 10 years, he is supposed to return all the money received.  The term is set at the discretion of Rosvoenipoteka.  It depends on the solvency of the borrower and the amount of debt.  At the same time, housing remains in the ownership of the former army officer.  And the rest of the amount due for him, he will have to pay on his own. </p>
