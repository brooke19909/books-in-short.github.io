Complex simple language</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When choosing a new gadget for yourself or as a gift, you first of all pay attention to its technical characteristics, in which you can find the word "core".  After that, the user, who is not very versed in technology, wonders why the cores are needed in the phone and how much they affect its performance.  When searching for the answer to this question, search engines give out a lot of sites with abstruse, scientific information, which is not so easy to understand.  In this article, we will dot all the i, answering the urgent question that worries many people: what is the core in the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/repurpose-old-smartphone-apps-accessories-smart-home/"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone core" class="if uuid-3134537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123310/3134537.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Once the processors had only one core, but the technology does not stand still, and are improving every day.  That is why now it is often possible to meet phones both quad-core and eight-core, and in some cases you can even stumble upon sixteen-core devices.  And yet, what is the core of the phone?  At the time of single-core processors, the problem of overheating of the device arose due to the heavy load on the only available core, so the engineers decided to expand the capabilities of the processors to eliminate this problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtogeek.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.howtogeek.com/367931/htg-explains-how-does-a-cpu-actually-work/"><img itemprop="image" alt="why do you need kernels in the phone" class="if uuid-3134550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123310/3134550.jpg"></div><h2>  The need for multi-core </h2><p>  Several cores in the process are necessary, first of all, for the distribution of work among themselves.  They are like a small close-knit team, where each core is a responsible employee.  Distributing all tasks among each other equally, each of them does not carry out too much work, which means that it avoids overvoltage.  Translating this into the language of technology does not overheat.  Thus, giving a brief answer to the question of what the kernel is in the phone, we can safely say that this is part of the system that is entrusted with a number of tasks that are necessary for the device to execute at the user's command. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fraedom.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.fraedom.com/1876/5-disruptive-technologies-changing-shape-banking/"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the core in the phone" class="if uuid-3134527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123310/3134527.jpg"></div><h2>  The differences between the quad and eight core processors </h2><p>  Now we can consider a more interesting question, which requires a deeper immersion in the technical side of the issue.  Are processors endowed with eight cores really twice as powerful and efficient than processors with only four "workers."  Each core of mobile phones with a quad-core processor does the same job, but why doesn‚Äôt the same thing happen when it comes to eight employees. </p><p>  It turns out that eight-core processors were introduced not at all to increase efficiency, but to save the device.  In fact, these devices have two processors with 4 cores each, but one of them is more powerful, which means that it consumes more energy, and the other, in turn, consumes less energy, works less efficiently.  For basic tasks running on the device, use a weaker processor for less power consumption.  If the processes that need to be performed are rather complicated for him, then his fellow man takes the reins of government. </p><p>  We hope this article gave you a detailed and detailed answer to the question of what the core is in the phone, and besides this, you received new useful information and began to better understand the so-called hardware of smartphones. </p>
