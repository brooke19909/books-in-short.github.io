    <p>  Achilles was a hero.  And initially, not even thanks to his actions.  Just the heroic fate of Achilles was destined already at birth.  Indeed, according to Greek myths, the offspring that appeared as a result of the connection of immortal gods with mortal people became a hero.  He himself did not possess immortality, however, he could count on the patronage of heavenly relatives and, as a rule, possessed outstanding abilities, mainly fighting ones. </p><p>  Achilles' mother was the sea nymph Thetis, and her father, Peleus, who reigned over the Myrmidonians.  Therefore, often in the "Iliad" the hero is called Pelid (which means the son of Peleus).  The not-so-ordinary marriage between an earthly man and an immortal nymph is also explained in myths.  Thetis was raised by Hera, and when Zeus tried to seduce the young nymph, she, in gratitude for the care that his legal wife showed to her, refused the voluptuous Olympian.  In punishment, Zeus gave Thetis a mortal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Achilles heel </h2><p>  Time passed and Thetis and Peleus had children.  To check whether they are immortal or not, Thetis lowered the newborn into a cauldron with boiling water.  So the first six sons died.  The seventh was Achilles.  It was his father who saved him from the unenviable fate of his brothers by taking his son from his wife in time.  After this, Thetis leaves her husband and returns to live at the bottom of the sea.  But she continues to closely monitor the life of her son. </p><p>  According to another myth, Thetis lowered little Achilles into the waters of the sacred Styx, flowing in the kingdom of Hades.  This gave the child invincibility.  Only the heel - the place for which his mother held tightly - remained vulnerable.  From here comes the steady expression "Achilles' heel," which conveys the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa person‚Äôs weak spot. </p><p>  After the departure of his wife, Peleus sends his young son to be brought up to the centaur Chiron.  He feeds him with the bone marrow of animals instead of breast milk.  The boy grows up and diligently comprehends the science of gun ownership.  And according to some reports, the art of healing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Achilles in mythology" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1491124.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Visiting Lycomed </h2><p>  Chiron, who, among other things, possessed the gift of a fortuneteller, tells Thetis that if her son avoids participating in the upcoming Trojan War, then he will have a long life.  If he goes there, the Greeks will win, but Achilles will die.  This prompts Thetis to send her son to another island - Skyros, and hide him between the daughters of Tsar Lykomed.  For greater safety, Achilles lives there dressed in women's clothing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This behavior seems somewhat unusual for a hero who craves immortal glory.  However, it is worth remembering that at that time the young man was barely fifteen years old.  It was by the time described by Homer in the Iliad that Achilles had become a mature, experienced warrior.  After all, the siege of the impregnable city lasted twenty years.  And all this time the Greeks did not sit idle in place.  They attacked nearby cities and ravaged them.  In the meantime, it was a young man.  Brave, but obedient to the instructions of his divine mother. </p><h2>  Meeting with Odysseus </h2><p>  Meanwhile, a chain of events leads to the collection of troops for the war against Troy.  Priest Kalkhant declares that if Peleus's son does not participate in the campaign, the Greeks will face a crushing defeat.  Then the Achaean leaders hastily equip Odysseus and send him after Achilles to the island of Skyros. </p><p>  Understanding that to go against immortal celestials by brute force is more expensive for himself, Odysseus resorts to cunning.  He appears to be an ordinary wandering merchant and enters the Lycomedes palace.  Having laid out his goods in front of the daughters of the king, Odysseus lays among the jewels and richly decorated weapons. </p><p>  At the appointed time, the people of Odysseus, on his orders, gave an alarm.  All the girls rushed in all directions, only Achilles was not taken aback.  This betrayed him.  The young man grabbed a weapon and ran towards imaginary enemies.  Declassified by Odysseus, Achilles agrees to join the military campaign and takes with him his beloved friend Patroclus, with whom they grew up together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Achilles is" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1491140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Iphigenia Sacrifice </h2><p>  And now the huge Greek fleet, which now includes the Myrmidon squad on fifty warships under the leadership of Achilles, is advancing to Troy.  In all the unfolding events, the immortal inhabitants of Olympus also participate.  Moreover, some of them support the Trojans, and some are on the side of the Greeks.  As a result of the next tricks of the gods supporting the defenders of Troy, the Greek fleet, immobilized by the absence of a fair wind, stands off the coast of the island of Aulida. </p><p>  Kalhant makes another prediction: a fair wind will blow only if Agamemnon, the leader of the Greek army, who started a campaign against Troy, sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia.  This did not bother the father.  The only problem he saw was how to get the girl to the island?  Therefore, messengers are sent to Iphigenia with the message that she was married to Achilles and must come to Aulida for the wedding.  The description of the portrait of Achilles, the hero of ancient Greek mythology, does not leave her indifferent and the girl arrives on the island for a wedding.  Instead, it falls directly onto the altar. </p><p>  One version of this story claims that Achilles himself did not know anything about the insidious plan.  And when he found out, he rushed with arms in his hands to defend the deceived princess.  But earlier myths narrate that Peleus' son did not show any sentimentality, because he himself was eager to quickly sail to Three.  And if the gods demand sacrifices, then who will argue with them?  In fairness, it is worth noting that Iphigenia was still saved.  True, not a hero, but the <span>goddess Artemis,</span> who replaced the girl with a doe. </p><h2>  Meeting with Amazon </h2><p>  But be that as it may, the sacrifice was set off, and the Greeks arrived safely at Troy.  Thus began a long siege of an impregnable city.  As already mentioned, Achilles was not idle.  He became famous at the very beginning of the war, gaining glorious victories over the surrounding cities and surrounding islands, one after another.  According to <span>Greek mythology,</span> Priam‚Äôs son, who was later killed by Achilles, did not meet with the impudent and successful invader during this time.  And Achilles continued to hone his weapons skills. </p><p>  In one of the next raids, Achilles enters into a battle with the Queen of the Amazons Pentiselia, who at that time was hiding on the mainland from the revenge of her tribesmen.  After a difficult struggle, the hero kills the queen and, having tucked the helmet that hid the entire upper part of the face with the end of the spear, throws him off the woman.  Struck by her beauty, the hero falls in love with her. </p>

    <p>  Nearby is one of the Greek warriors - Tersit.  According to the unflattering descriptions of Homer, a very unpleasant subject.  He accuses Achilles of lust for the dead and pokes her eyes with a spear.  Without thinking twice, Achilles turns around and with one blow to the jaw kills Tersit. </p><h2>  Briseid and Chryseid </h2><p>  In another campaign, the Greeks capture Briseis, which Achilles retains as a concubine.  In mythology, it is described that a young woman is not at all burdened by her position.  On the contrary, she is always loving and tender. </p><p>  At this time, Agamemnon also enjoys the fruits of raids.  Among other things, he, as a share of the spoils, is presented with a beautiful girl Chryseid.  But her father comes to the camp, begging to let her daughter out.  Agamemnon taunts him and kicks him out in disgrace.  Then the inconsolable father prayed for help to Apollo and he sends an epidemic to the Greeks.  All the same soothsayer Kalkhant explains the cause of the misfortunes and says that the girl must be released.  He is ardently supported by Achilles.  But Agamemnon does not want to give in.  Passions run high. </p><h2>  Discord with Agamemnon </h2><p>  In the end, Chryseyid is still released.  However, the vengeful Agamemnon, with bitter anger, decides to take revenge on Achilles.  Therefore, in compensation, he takes Briceis from him.  The furious hero refuses to continue to take part in the war.  From this moment, events begin to develop rapidly, as the Iliad describes it.  The duel between Achilles and Hector is inexorably approaching.  As well as the tragic denouement to which he will lead. </p><h2>  Achilles inaction </h2>

    <p>  Greeks lose after defeat.  But the offended Achilles does not succumb to anyone's persuasion and continues to remain inactive.  But once the defenders of Troy pushed the opponents to the very shore.  Then, having heeded the persuasion of his friend Patroclus, Achilles agrees that he leads the Myrmidons into battle.  Patroclus asks permission to take the armor of a friend and receives them.  In the ensuing battle, Hector, the Trojan prince, mistaking Patroclus in the armor of Achilles for the famous hero, kills him.  This provokes a duel between Achilles and Hector. </p><h2>  Duel with Hector </h2><p>  Upon learning of the death of Patroclus, heartbroken Achilles intends to brutally take revenge.  He rushes into battle and sweeps away one after another all the mighty warriors.  The characterization of Achilles that Homer gives him in this episode is the climax of the hero's entire life.  It was a moment of immortal glory, about which he so dreamed.  Alone, he turns the enemies back and drives them to the very walls of Troy. </p>

    <p>  In horror, the Trojans are hiding behind the strong walls of the city.  All but one.  Noble Hector is the only one who decides to repulse the son of Peleus.  But even this battle-hardened warrior is horrified at the approach of his fierce enemy and takes to flight.  Achilles and Hector Troy circled three times before they met in a mortal battle.  The prince could not resist and fell, pierced by the spear of Achilles.  Having tied the corpse to his chariot, he dragged Hector's body to his camp Achilles.  And only the genuine sorrow and humility of the inconsolable father of Hector, King Priam, who came to his camp unarmed, softened the heart of the winner, and he agreed to return the body.  However, Achilles accepted the ransom - as much gold as Tsarevich Troy Hector weighed. </p><h2>  Hero's death </h2>

    <p>  Achilles himself dies during the capture of Troy.  And here it is not without the intervention of the gods.  Apollo, who disdains the mere mortality of him, invisibly directs the arrow fired by Paris, Hector's younger brother.  The arrow pierces the heel of the hero - his only weak spot - and is fatal.  But even while dying, Achilles continues to hit many more Trojans.  His body carries Ajax out of the thick of the battle.  Achilles was buried with all honors, and his bones were put in a golden urn along with the bones of Patroclus. </p>
