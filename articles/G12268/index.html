    <p>  Let's try to identify and systematize some tips on how to buy a good cheap refrigerator and what you should pay attention to first of all.  So, let's start with general recommendations that apply to all models without exception. </p><h2>  Do not chase news </h2><p>  First of all, focus on the technical capabilities of the future refrigerator, and not on its year of manufacture.  At the cost of new items always overtake cheap refrigerators of past generations, and it is not a fact that a fresh modification will be more functional or thought out technically, so first of all we leaf through the instructions and look for the best option for our needs. </p><h2>  Refuse unnecessary and unclaimed functions </h2><p>  If you need a refrigerator so that it freezes and cools your products, then buy this unit.  There is no need to pay extra, for example, such things as a crushing ice, which you will use several times a year, and the built-in LCD screen on the front panel of capacities will not add to your unit.  Try to get rid of this kind of excess - get rich, then the TV on the door of the refrigerator will be affordable for you and in joy, and now we choose a cheap refrigerator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Do not neglect used units </h2><p>  On sites such as Avito or Hand-to-Hand, one can sometimes come across very worthwhile options.  <span>The range of goods</span> on such resources is extremely wide, and you can buy a large or small refrigerator cheaply without any problems.  This method may be suitable if the goods are needed very urgently, and money for the purchase, as always, is not so much. </p><h2>  Sales </h2><p>  If time is more or less tolerated, then as one of the options you can offer to wait for the next season of sales or advertising campaigns, the benefit is that large retail outlets conduct them almost every week.  In this case, one can save a lot of money by buying, for example, cheap two-chamber refrigerators at the price of single-chamber refrigerators, etc. </p>

    <p>  There are a lot of resources that sell household appliances, and every day it becomes more and more, so it is extremely difficult to choose a decent option.  Let‚Äôs try to sort through the shelves of the most venerable online stores, one way or another distinguished by the quality of both the delivered goods and the service, thereby answering the question of where the refrigerators are cheaper and how to purchase them with the greatest benefit. </p><h2>  "El Dorado" </h2><p>  The Internet version of the famous Eldorado store is not much different from the one in real life, except that the assortment is a bit wider, and there is a wider range of prices, which means there is plenty to choose from. </p>

    <p>  And sometimes you can stumble upon a cheap <span>refrigerator for a summer</span> house or a home for a practically <span>bargain price,</span> so the Eldorado option is one of the most promising in terms of quick and inexpensive purchase of the right product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Range </h2><p>  On the Internet shelves you can find refrigerators from a variety of manufacturers, from venerable brands to the local "consumer goods".  There are models for cottages or hotel rooms (about 4 thousand rubles).  Such a <span>small refrigerator will</span> cheaply and angrily decorate your kitchen until you save up for something more impressive, like the five-chamber Hitachi for 150 thousand rubles.  But these two options are extreme, for a more specific case, you can find a model in the middle price range. </p><h2>  Registration and payment </h2><p>  Forming a basket and subsequent placing an order will not take much time or nerves, as is the case in offline realities.  You can pay by credit or debit card of any bank that supports the standards of "Visa" and "MasterCard."  Monetary relations between the customer and the store are only upfront (full prepayment), but there is an option to checkout on credit.  ‚ÄúEldorado‚Äù ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù bank on credit issues was and remains ‚ÄúRussian Standard‚Äù, but there are other options to choose from if you are unlucky with this bank. </p><h2>  Delivery </h2><p>  After the formation of the basket and subsequent payment, the goods are sent to delivery points.  Customers who are in cities with over one million people, as a rule, receive their goods the very next day, in other cases they have to wait 3-7 days from the date of payment.  Due to the strong and healthy competition of courier services, delivery prices are not as high as before, and they do not deliver cheap single-chamber refrigerators for more than 400 rubles (within the city limits, excluding floors). </p><h2>  Promotions and sales </h2><p>  One of the most sought after and well-publicized promotions is Utilization.  That is, when replacing used equipment with a new one in the store, you get a good discount.  It is a good option to buy a mini fridge for yourself cheaply and get rid of a broken unit. </p>

    <p>  Sales are conducted, albeit often, but on a very narrow range of products.  The range of participants is small, but decent discounts.  For example, the model of the Indesit brand with two cameras, which costs about 20 thousand rubles on weekdays, at the time of the action you can ‚Äúgrab‚Äù for 12,999 rubles, that is, get 40% of the cost, which is very good for a limited the budget. </p><p>  Promotions and sales are constantly held in anticipation of holidays or high-profile events, such as the New Year, March 8 or the birthday of the same Eldorado.  Therefore, if you closely monitor such events, you can save a pretty good amount by buying a cheap refrigerator of good quality (it‚Äôs better to subscribe to the electronic mailing list). </p><h2>  Enter </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the Inter resource belongs to the owner of the Svyaznoy group of companies, Maxim Nogotkov.  This means that we will have the simplest selection process along with the further purchase, because the first brainchild of Nogotkov still pleases fans of mobile gadgets and stationary devices with its availability and unpretentious online shopping process. </p>

    <p>  The price of refrigerators at Inter may not be the most bargain ones, but the site is working quickly, without fail, and the quality of service is always at its best. </p><h2>  Range </h2><p>  As in the case of Eldorado, the Inter store has a wide range of prices for each specific case.  You can find a cheap refrigerator for 3.5 thousand, and models for 110 thousand rubles can also be caught.  Search by name, characteristics and prices is very convenient.  All results of the issue appear on the screen without delay and without any transitions to additional pages. </p><h2>  Order and payment </h2><p>  The formation of the basket with the subsequent payment is very fast, and the process will be clear to any user who is more or less familiar with the Internet.  Payment is carried out using Visa or MasterCard bank cards, and it is not necessary to make an advance payment, as was the case with Eldorado, couriers have all the necessary equipment to settle accounts with the buyer on the spot.  Loan offers are presented by numerous partner banks, so there are plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  Delivery </h2><p>  The store has its own courier delivery line, which is a very significant advantage, since in case of delays or some unforeseen situations, the online store will not blame the third party, but will only answer to the customer in one person.  The cost of delivering bulky cargo does not exceed 500 rubles in the city (excluding elevation to the floor). </p><h2>  Promotions and sales </h2><p>  <span>The PayPal payment system has</span> entered into a partnership agreement with the Inter store, and now any buyer who paid for goods through this system will automatically receive a discount of 300 rubles. </p><p>  An untimely (so far) promotion ‚ÄúGifts is a matter of technology‚Äù is held, where products from the LG brand, including a cheap refrigerator, can be bought at a discount from 500 to 3000 rubles, which is good news.  There are many other interesting offers, but they do not belong to the refrigeration segment (although it‚Äôs worth looking at these offers). </p><p>  In general, the more such a plethora of Internet resources, the better for us, buyers, serious and healthy competition affects lower prices and improves the quality of service, so look, study and be sure to read reviews on those stores that interest you.  In order to see a more complete assortment of prices, rather than goods, you can use the Yandex Market or a similar offer from Mail.ru. </p><h2>  Sales in household appliances and electronics stores </h2><p>  As one famous shopping enthusiast used to say: "There is no better time for shopping than sales time."  As a rule, in stores dealing with household appliances, sales are tied to holidays and events, and not to seasons, so the most attractive discounts can be snatched before the New Year, February 14 and 23, March 8 and September 1 - get ready for sales in advance. </p>

    <p>  Before deciding where the cheapest refrigerators are, it will be useful to walk around the holidays and discounts on shops, comparing and writing down prices so that you can compare them with sales and then understand if you are being fooled or not by claiming a discount of 50, or even 75%  Unfortunately, such unscrupulous "discounters" are very common, misleading their customers by significantly increasing the base price of the goods, and then making a "good" discount. </p><p>  It will not be superfluous to find out whether discounts are summed up during promotions and various sales.  Sometimes store shelves can be full of attractive offers: there is a discount, there is a discount, and here is a gift to boot.  But in fact, it may turn out that only one choice is available to the buyer, that is, all these offers are not summarized in any way.  Ask about this nuance in advance with sellers in the store.  It is also worthwhile to clarify whether any gifts promised for the purchase of large household appliances are possible, and if so, are they available. </p><h2>  Discounted equipment </h2><p>  Discount store appliances can only in two cases, other options include only the purchase of used items. </p><ol><li>  The model is outdated, not in demand among customers and just takes place in the warehouse. </li><li>  In the technique there may be any defects of a different nature.  Here you can close your eyes to small scratches or dents that appeared when storing or carrying from place to place, that is, flaws that do not affect the operation of the device. </li></ol><p>  Before buying a discounted product, be sure to specify why the cost was reduced, and how things are with the warranty period.  If a small defect does not affect the operation of the refrigerator, then why not buy it, and you can close the scratches with a beautiful magnet. </p>
