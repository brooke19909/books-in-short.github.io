Its occurrence is associated with late tax payments.  This situation entails a number of problems.  For example, a person can be fined, so it is important to know everything about checking debts.  There are many ways to cope with the task.  We will talk about all the possible layouts further.  This is not the most difficult task of all the real ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="investingclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax ID Number" class="if uuid-2319993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2319993.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to go for help </h2><p>  Where to find out tax arrears?  Every taxpayer should know the answer to this kind of question. </p><p>  Today, verification can be carried out: </p><ul><li>  personally; </li><li>  through the Internet. </li></ul><p>  And which organizations offer information about the debts of the population?  For example, you can submit the appropriate request to: </p><ul><li>  Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  MFC; </li><li>  FSSP. </li></ul><p>  Through the Internet, verification is also carried out.  This is the option most often used. </p><p>  How to find out tax arrears without TIN or with it online?  It is proposed to use the following resources: </p><ul><li>  "Government services"; </li><li>  website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  FSSP service of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  page "Payment of public services"; </li><li>  any online banking; </li><li>  virtual wallet. </li></ul><p>  As practice shows, to solve the problem is not difficult.  The main thing is to follow some instructions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kudavlozitdengi.adne.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Government Services and Taxes" class="if uuid-2319971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2319971.jpg"></div><h2>  What may be required </h2><p>  What data is useful for conducting a citizen tax audit?  The answer depends on how the idea is implemented. </p><p>  Ideally, the reviewer should know: </p><ul><li>  Full name of a potential debtor; </li><li>  date of birth of the inspected; </li><li>  the city in which the debtor lives; </li><li>  INN </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is needed.  Often, services offer to find out tax arrears for TIN.  If a person personally applies to these bodies, he needs to bring his TIN or passport with him. </p><h2>  No extra documents </h2><p>  How to find out tax arrears?  The first option guarantees a minimum of trouble, but you can not always use it. </p><p>  It is proposed to find out the amount of debt, as well as the name of the late payment, by studying the tax notice.  Such documents are sent out a month before the deadline for transferring money to the Federal Tax Service.  Repeated notifications are sent after the formation of the debt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zakon-auto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check tax online" class="if uuid-2319972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2319972.jpg"></div><h2>  Appeal to the Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  Now consider the previously proposed options.  You can find out the debt (transport tax or any other - it doesn‚Äôt matter) directly through the Federal Tax Service.  Such information is not provided by telephone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A citizen will need: </p><ol><li>  Take along your passport and TIN. </li><li>  Go to your local tax registration office. </li><li>  Ask employees if the applicant has a tax debt. </li></ol><p>  Within a few minutes, the citizen will be informed of the need to transfer funds to the state treasury, if the corresponding obligation has not yet been fulfilled.  At the Federal Tax Service, you can immediately ask for a payment for payment and close all debts. </p><h2>  Bailiffs to help </h2><p>  It is proposed to find out tax arrears of a legal entity (or ordinary citizen) through the FSSP.  Typically, information is received by the appropriate government agency with a significant delay in payments. </p><p>  You will have to act in the same way as in the case of applying to the Federal Tax Service.  The difference lies in the fact that until the person has opened the paperwork, information about the debt will not be displayed in the FSSP database. </p><h2>  Government Services and Checks </h2><p>  Find out tax arrears for taxpayer identification number offers a convenient and simple service "public services".  With its help, citizens will be able not only to learn about the need to replenish the state treasury, but also to carry out the appropriate transactions. </p><p>  First, consider the most common way.  It is available to users who have registered on the portal of public services and filled out a profile in the profile. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FSSP and verification" class="if uuid-2319970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2319970.jpg"></div><p>  To see tax debts, you must: </p><ol><li>  Open gosuslugi.ru. </li><li>  Log in to the appropriate portal. </li><li>  Go to the "My Account" block. </li></ol><p>  Here you will see not only the amount of the debt, but also the purpose of the payment.  The user can pay taxes or generate and print payment orders for their further use. </p><h2>  "Public services" - method ‚Ññ2 </h2><p>  There is another answer to the question of how to find out tax arrears.  To do this, you will again have to use the service "State services". </p><p>  To verify tax data, you need to: </p><ol><li>  Go to the State Services website and enter your profile. </li><li>  Go to the "Service Catalog". </li><li>  Click on the inscription "FTS". </li><li>  Click on the line "Find out your taxes" - "Get ...". </li><li>  Fill out the form that appears on the screen.  The user will have to indicate the full name of the person being checked, his TIN and the region in which the person lives. </li><li>  Click on the "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  In a couple of minutes, data on all available tax arrears will appear on the screen.  In the specially designated fields you can see why money is being charged. </p><h2>  "Payment of government services" and a quick check </h2><p>  Do you want to know tax tax arrears without registration on various sites?  Almost instantly, it is proposed to do this on the service "Payment of State Services".  Verification is completely free. </p><p>  Guidelines for using the corresponding web resource are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Visit oplatagosuslug.ru page using any browser. </li><li>  Click on "Taxes". </li><li>  Set the way to search for information.  For example, "By TIN". </li><li>  Enter the TIN of the person being verified. </li><li>  Click on the Find control. </li></ol><p>  Interested in transport tax?  You can find out a person‚Äôs debt in the field of tax payments in the described way.  All available debts to the Federal Tax Service will appear on the computer display. </p><div class="photo" data-original="legalmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment of government services" class="if uuid-2319973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2319973.jpg"></div><h2>  Online Wallets </h2><p>  The next simple method of data retrieval is the use of any payment systems on the network.  For example, Yandex.  Money </p><p>  Working with this online wallet involves the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Log in to Yandex. Wallet. </li><li>  Go to the "Goods, services" section. </li><li>  The choice of the service "Taxes". </li><li>  Indication of TIN of a citizen. </li><li>  Clicking the button that starts the database scan. </li></ol><p>  Quick, easy, convenient.  Thus, you can instantly find debts and close them without leaving your home.  The transaction takes 2-3 business days. </p><h2>  "My Account" and the website of the Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  How to find out tax arrears?  Another trick is the use of a ‚Äúpersonal taxpayer account‚Äù.  It will have to be made in advance. </p><p>  After the corresponding account appears with the user, he will need to: </p><ol><li>  Go to nalog.ru. </li><li>  Log in to "My Account". </li><li>  Go to the "Accrued" section. </li></ol><p>  This ends the action.  All unclosed taxes and debts will be displayed in the corresponding menu item. </p><p>  If desired, the user can find the service "Check your taxes" on the website of the Federal Tax Service in the block "Services".  The offer works in the same way as in the State Services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.taxinspections.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal account on the website of the Federal Tax Service" class="if uuid-2319990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2319990.jpg"></div><h2>  Bailiff site </h2><p>  To find out information on taxes through the website of bailiffs, the user needs: </p><ol><li>  Open the fssprus.ru service in a browser. </li><li>  Select "Services" - "Bank of Record Keeping". </li><li>  Indicate data about the potential debtor. </li><li>  Press the "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  As already mentioned, this technique does not always work.  Therefore, it is used in exceptional cases.  Often, you can use the service "Payment of public services" to implement the task. </p>
