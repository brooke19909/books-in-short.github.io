  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Welcome to Negril in Jamaica</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Jamaica, or rather Negril in Jamaica, is a place on the edge of the world, which is decorated with a beautiful coastline.  Negril was once an ordinary fishing village until it was chosen by hippies in the early 1970s.  Free morals youth settled in local families or slept on the beach.  Often had crazy parties on the beach, which gave this place a reputation for something laid-back and at the same time inaccessible to ordinary people. </p><p>  Of course, in 40 years Negril has changed, the island‚Äôs infrastructure has grown, additional places to visit have appeared, but one thing has remained unchanged - the spirit of freedom and happiness that the first settlers of the 70s brought.  The local population carefully protects the island‚Äôs precious ecology, which is why Negril remains the place for improvised reggae concerts and psychedelic sunsets. </p><p>  Both geography and character Negril Jamaica can be divided into two parts.  In the north, Seven Mail Beach is about 7 km long and the West End is a part of the island for those with a hippie culture.  The steep cliffs that plunge into the azure ocean, palm trees and white sand.  From all this species, it is instantly breathtaking, and the incredibly beautiful nature of Negril conquers from the first minute. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stashyourbagblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Negril beach" class="if uuid-2575050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2575050.jpg"></div><p>  The resort developed an active and environmentally conscious spirit under the guidance of local residents, as a result of which the Negril Marine Park was created in order to protect the environment of Negril.  The park includes a coastline, mangroves, sea waters, coral reefs and is divided into eight zones.  A worthy example to follow in other resort countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Things to Do in Negril </h2><p>  This island is famous for its reggae culture, therefore themed performances are often held here, DJs play dance music in the bars, you can also hear live jazz performances.  Parties usually last until late at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="southbaybeachclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Negril Beach Seven Miles" class="if uuid-2577355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2577355.jpg"></div><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  In addition to the nightly fun, Negril will offer the tourist an active holiday.  Diving and snorkeling are very popular in Negril in Jamaica, there are extensive sea reefs and rocks, grottoes, which are ideal for beginners.  The sea in most cases is very calm, so visibility often exceeds 30 meters.  Most dives are in water from 10 to 23 meters.  Some objects will be of interest to more advanced divers, this is Tron Cave, where you can meet sharks, octopuses, barracudas and rays, or Deep Plain, where the remains of a Cessina aircraft lie under water at a 21-meter distance.  Corals settled in and around the aircraft, attracting an abundance of fish. </p><h2>  Climbing </h2><p>  If you are looking for adrenaline, then why not jump from a 10-meter cliff into the ocean?  There are 3 cliffs at Rick's Cafe to jump: 3 meters, 7 meters and 10 meters.  Even if you are not ready for such jumps, this is a great place to spend a day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.go4travelblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Negril hotels" class="if uuid-2577358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2577358.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned earlier, Negril's waters are usually calm, which is ideal for many water sports.  Along the beach there are many places where you can rent sea kayaks (about $ 20 per hour, this is about 1240 rubles), water skiing (25 dollars (1.5 thousand rubles) in 30 minutes) or a boat (15 dollars - 930 rubles .). </p><h2>  Sunsets </h2><p>  There is no doubt that the best sunsets in the Caribbean in Jamaica in Negril.  Rest in the evening here is associated with a "solar show", which pleases the guests of the resort.  We recommend lingering a few minutes after sunset and see a magnificent palette of colors in the sky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gettingstamped.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset negril" class="if uuid-2575027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2575027.jpg"></div><p>  The photos here are magnificent, the white sand and the turquoise waters of Negril Beach are especially well combined.  Jamaica itself is immersed in greenery, which gives complete unity with nature.  If you are lucky enough to spend a honeymoon in Jamaica, there is nothing more romantic than sunset on the beach. </p><h2>  Negril, Jamaica: hotels </h2><p>  West End is more inclined to boarding houses, and there are also hotels in the rocks.  Seven Mile Beach is occupied by upscale all-inclusive hotels or standard hotels scattered along the beach further south.  A lot of hotels that amaze with their emancipation. </p><p>  Hedonism ii.  This hotel is only for adults, there are only 280 rooms, known for its crazy parties and private beaches: for those who prefer to sunbathe naked, and for conservatives there is a standard beach. </p><p>  Sandals Negril Beach Resort and Spa.  This hotel is suitable for honeymooners.  A calmer hotel allows you to enjoy the relaxation and nature of Negril. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sandals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sandals hotel" class="if uuid-2575040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85776/2575040.jpg"></div><p>  Sunset at the Palms.  When you are at this hotel, you seem to fall into the jungle - mixed Thai style and African decor with environmental materials delight.  The hotel has a sports center, tennis court, swimming bar and a romantic restaurant serving first-class cuisine. </p><h2>  Do not forget about good manners </h2><p>  Jamaica is a very laid-back country, but no one has canceled good manners.  Upon arrival, you will notice that people always say ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù to the guests of the island.  The type of clothing that is recommended for visiting a particular place is always indicated on the door of the establishment.  Remember that beachwear is appropriate only on the beach.  Also, Jamaicans are fairly straightforward, so do not be surprised at their manner of communication during the conversation. </p><p>  The high season in Jamaica is the beginning of the year, between mid-January and mid-April.  At this time, the largest number of tourists, but this makes the vacation unforgettably fun and allows you to break away like never before in life. </p>
