  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Keyboard for tablet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unlike netbooks, tablets are, by definition, flawed in text input.  The standard <span>touch keyboard</span> for the tablet, which developers are constantly trying to somehow improve, is still very inconvenient.  Especially when comparing it with traditional <span>input devices.</span>  A lot of complaints come from users who are accustomed to <span>computer keyboards</span> ; it‚Äôs the most difficult for them to adapt to the way text printing that the tablet offers. </p><p>  If you do not believe it, then just try typing on a regular keyboard, and then on the keyboard of your tablet.  The drop in the usual typing speed, as well as the difficulty in switching from numbers to letters and vice versa, will immediately become obvious to you.  These keyboards provide undeniable advantages: the fingers rest firmly on them, there is a good return when pressed, the keys do not slip, a blind typing method is possible. </p><p>  I must say that tablet manufacturers are aware of this problem and gradually all major market players have begun to develop devices that can correct the situation.  Some decided that the best option is a simple, small keyboard for the tablet, others have created entire docking stations combined with a keyboard, an additional battery, as well as other options that expand the capabilities of the tablet.  There are even versions with a speaker and a microphone, such keyboards can be used as a telephone handset when making calls from a tablet via 3G or Skype. </p><p>  A tablet computer with a keyboard immediately gained both supporters and opponents.  And while the former have the main argument - a significant increase in convenience and speed, the latter - the increase in weight and dimensions of the device, almost equalizing the device in these parameters with netbooks, from which tablet manufacturers are trying their best to distance themselves for obvious reasons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the devices themselves, there is already a keyboard for the android tablet, designed to finally close the question of typing, it is called AlphaUI.  It is fixed on the back of the tablet with a diagonal of 5-7 inches.  The device with the connected AlphaUI does not look like a laptop, since the keys are located on the back side so that, clasping the tablet with your hands, the user can conveniently type.  Moreover, both the typed text and the keyboard are displayed.  It takes a couple of days to get used to this device, but then the print speed grows very significantly.  In fairness, it should be noted that this device will not replace a full keyboard. </p><p>  The first built-in keyboard for the tablet was demonstrated with the Asus Eee Pad Slider.  When folded, the tablet looks like any other, except that it is slightly thicker, but if you move its upper panel back, the keyboard will appear, while the tablet screen rises at an angle to the base, for more convenient operation. </p><p>  It should be noted that the docking station for the Android tablet is a more complex device than the netbook keyboard, since its integration with the OS is much more difficult than in the case of Windows devices. </p><p>  For example, Asus Eee Pad Transformer, in it certain buttons are reserved for the Android OS, so there are buttons "Home", "Search", "Menu", "Turn on Bluetooth", brightness buttons, and others.  In addition, the docking station usually provides such functionality as connecting to a PC, USB-connectors, and of course, helps to charge the tablet. </p><p>  It seems to me that the ongoing debate about whether a keyboard is needed for a tablet, or is it a completely useless waste of money, will sooner or later subside by itself and users themselves will decide the fate of these devices.  If they are bought, they will survive, if they stop, it means they will die off naturally, as hundreds of other <span>useless inventions</span> have already disappeared from the market <span>.</span> </p>
