    <h2>  Where were the games held? </h2><p>  The territory of Greece of the Antiquity was a lot of independent states, competing with each other.  This rivalry concerned not only the military and economic spheres, but also the field of culture.  Each more or less powerful state sought to hold bright, spectacular holidays dedicated to the local patron gods.  These festivals, as a rule, were accompanied by sports competitions, and sometimes, as, for example, in Delphi, also by competitions of musicians and poets. </p><p>  The Isthma Games were held in Corinth - one of the strongest and most developed states of Antiquity.  The venue was a narrow bridge between the Peloponnese and the mainland.  <span>This isthmus</span> in ancient times was called Isthmus (now the Corinthian Isthmus). </p><p>  The competition took place every two years next to the temple of Poseidon - the patron saint of Corinth.  From this it is clear to which god the Isthmian games were dedicated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legends and myths of the Isthmian games </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Olympic Games in antiquity were more popular, many myths were associated with the Isthmian. </p><p>  According to one version, the beginning of these games was laid by Poseidon himself, who argued with Helios for the right to patronize the lands of Corinth and Argos.  As a result, the <span>god of the seas</span> lost the argument, and only Isthm remained in his power.  But in order to compensate for his defeat, Poseidon held equestrian competitions, because, as you know, this god usually rode in a chariot.  Since then, the Isthma Games have always included this type of competition in the program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which god was the Isthmian Games dedicated to" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39888/1100595.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <p>  In another myth, Sisyphus, the king-founder of the Isthma Games, revived <span>sports competitions</span> in Istma.  He did this in honor of the miraculous salvation of his young nephew, to the aid of whom Poseidon came. </p><p>  There is also a version according to which Theseus is considered the founder of these games.  One of his exploits was the victory over the robber Skyron, whom he threw into the sea.  The robber turned out to be the <span>son of Poseidon,</span> and Theseus as a redemptive victim organized sports competitions. </p><h2>  Real story </h2><p>  The Isthma Games in Ancient Greece received the status of a national holiday during the reign of the Corinthian king Periander, presumably in 582 BC.  e.  The second "curator" of these competitions was the state of Argos, although later they began to organize their own games there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="King - Founder of the Isthma Games" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39888/1100596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Representatives of other regions of Ancient Greece, with the exception of the Eleys, the organizers of the Olympic Games, also had the right to attend the Ismian Games.  They once disrespectfully treated young Periander, and because of this they were not allowed to enter Istm. </p><p>  Corinth was a wealthy state, so the games were held on a grand scale.  The winners of the competition, in addition to a wreath of ivy and pine branches, received valuable prizes established by other policies, such as Athens.  Such "commercialization" of the competition was condemned by many, because the games were considered sacred, and athletes who came from all over Greece sometimes even forgot to which god the Isthma Games were dedicated. </p><p>  Nevertheless, competitions were popular even during the <span>Peloponnesian War</span> and after the destruction of Corinth. </p><h2>  Sports program </h2><p>  The central place at the games was occupied by chariot races, in which four horses were harnessed, in memory of the competitions held by Poseidon himself.  Horseback riding was also held, although they were not so popular in ancient Greece. </p><p>  Of the athletic competitions can be called running, fist fighting, wrestling and pankration - an analogue of modern combat without rules.  There were different age categories in which athletes could perform: boys, boys and men. </p><p>  The winner was awarded a palm branch, a wreath and often a considerable cash or valuable prize established by the participating states. </p><p>  Among the winners of the Isthmian games were mythical characters.  For example, Castor won the run, his twin brother Polidevk won the fist fight, and Hercules defeated all rivals in the pankration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Isthmian Games in Ancient Greece" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1100710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Competitions of musicians and poets </h2><p>  The Isthmian games in Ancient Greece also included competitions of flute players and kyfared - masters of the game on a popular musical instrument in the antiquity - kifar. </p><p>  Along with the musicians, poets also performed, and not only the quality of the verses themselves was evaluated, but also the artistic talent of their performer.  According to legend, once even Orpheus himself participated in the competitions of kifared and, of course, became the winner. </p><p>  The competition, which lasted several days, ended with awarding and honoring the winner who received a wreath from ivy and pine branches (later - from celery) and a palm branch.  Although poetry and music competitions were no less popular than sports, their winners were not supposed to have valuable prizes, at least there is no mention of them in historical sources. </p><p>  The decline of the Isthmian games is associated with the spread of Roman rule and the general enthusiasm for gladiatorial battles.  The last mention of them dates back to the 4th century AD. </p>
