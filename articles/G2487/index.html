What is hidden behind this mysterious abbreviation?  This is a self-regulatory organization, which inherently represents a non-profit association.  It consists of entities united by one common activity or profession.  Knowing the definition, you can decide whether to join the SRO.  If so, the information below will not be redundant for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.psarougarden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="join sro builders" class="if uuid-3018652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018652.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of SRO </h2><p>  Self-regulatory organizations have a considerable number of advantages, thanks to which they become quite popular among Russian businessmen. </p><p>  Joining an SRO for a company gives you access to closed orders.  For example, provides an opportunity to participate in government tenders.  In addition, the fact of belonging to an SRO increases the status of the company by an order of magnitude, increases the trust of potential customers, and so on.  Such advantages are especially relevant for those who work in the field of construction, engineering and audit. </p><p>  For its participants, the SRO provides legal support, as well as protection of interests. </p><h2>  How are self-regulatory organizations created? </h2><p>  The answer to this question will help to better understand the features of their functioning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, SROs are created according to two principles. </p><ul><li>  <em>Regional.</em>  In accordance with this principle, companies that carry out the same activity and are located in the same region are united. </li><li>  <em>Industry.</em>  This principle of formation of SROs implies a combination of companies with a common specificity of activity.  For example, among construction companies, only those involved in road construction can be distinguished. </li></ul><p>  Virtually any non-profit organization has a chance to obtain SRO status.  For this, at least one hundred builders or fifty managers in the field of design or engineering surveys should be recorded in its composition. </p><p>  To register an SRO, you first need to create a non-profit organization, and then recruit the required number of members.  A compensation fund is also required.  After that, you can contact the relevant state authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gevetec.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do i need to join" class="if uuid-3018656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018656.jpg"></div><h2>  Membership </h2><p>  This question is especially relevant for those who are interested in how to join the SRO. </p><p>  There are two types of membership in such organizations. </p><ul><li>  <em>Mandatory.</em>  This option is provided for companies that manage the safety of capital construction, energy audits, heat supply, and audit. </li><li>  <em>Optional.</em>  This option is provided for organizations involved in advertising or management. </li></ul><p>  So, as you might have guessed, the type of <span>membership in a self-regulatory organization</span> depends on the activities the company is engaged in.  For example, joining the SRO of builders is the responsibility of everyone who works in this field. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can find out if your activity is included in the list of mandatory from the relevant laws to which it obeys. </p><h2>  In what areas do SROs exist? </h2><p>  How to join a self-regulatory organization?  While some are looking for the answer to this question, others have long become members of such professional communities and appreciated all their advantages. </p><p>  So, let's find out in which areas there are self-regulatory organizations. </p><ul><li>  Fire safety. </li><li>  Carriers. </li><li>  The medicine. </li><li>  Construction. </li><li>  Collectors. </li><li>  Microfinance organizations. </li><li>  Food and processing industry. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wimbergerhaus.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="join sro designers" class="if uuid-3018657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018657.jpg"></div><p>  Self-regulatory organizations exist in various fields.  Organizations that join the SRO get more trust from potential customers.  In fact, such an event takes them to a new level of activity.  That is why such actions should not be neglected. </p><h2>  How to join SRO? </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to clarify who is available to join a self-regulatory organization that is appropriate to the professional activity being performed. </p><p>  So, registered enterprises having the legal status of IE, OJSC, LLC can join SROs in construction or another field.  In addition, you must meet the requirements of a particular self-regulatory organization to which you plan to apply. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In each organization, the requirements may differ; they should be specified additionally.  However, among the conditions the following are often found. </p><ul><li>  The presence of education, experience and professional experience with company management. </li><li>  Availability of qualifications and a certain number of employees with higher or secondary specialized education corresponding to the specialty. </li><li>  The completion of specialized continuing education courses and the availability of relevant certificates. </li><li>  The presence of property owned by the company. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.schlecht-shl.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SRO organizations" class="if uuid-3018660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018660.jpg"></div><h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  Joining the SRO of builders is not as easy as it might initially seem.  Even the law sets forth the minimum requirements that must be met by a company applying for membership in a self-regulatory organization. </p><p>  For example, the following criteria apply to construction and design firms: </p><ul><li>  the presence of three employees with diplomas of higher education or five employees with secondary vocational education; </li><li>  when using computers - licensed software; </li><li>  certificates confirming that each employee took advanced training courses at least once during five years; </li><li>  individual entrepreneurs require higher education in their specialty, as well as experience in conducting professional activities for at least five years. </li></ul><h2>  Required documents </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fk-general.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sro construction usher" class="if uuid-3018663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018663.jpg"></div><p>  If the need to join the SRO of designers or representatives of other professional activities is beyond doubt, it is time to provide information on the list of required documents. </p><p>  It is worth noting that their specific list can also be determined by the conditions of a self-regulatory organization, of which one or another company plans to become a member.  As a rule, such conditions are specified directly on the SRO website or through the websites of intermediary companies that provide paid services for collecting the necessary documents. </p><p>  The approximate list of documents required to enter the construction SRO may consist of the following items: </p><ul><li>  A statement listing the specific list of work that the company plans to carry out. </li><li>  Constituent documents, which include the contract, as well as the charter of the organization.  In order to join the SRO of cadastral engineers or something else, you need to transfer not the originals, but copies of the above documents.  However, you first need to certify them with a notary for a fee. </li><li>  The order on the appointment of the head, certified by the seal. </li><li>  Extract from the register.  It is possible that the SRO will also require copies of the TIN and PSRN.  It is better to prepare these papers in advance. </li><li>  Documents confirming payment of fees. </li><li>  Documents confirming compliance with the requirements of the SRO.  It is quite difficult to formulate an exact list.  This can be employee work books, as well as diplomas confirming the availability of professional education in a specialty, etc. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bierduempfel-dental.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction sro enter" class="if uuid-3018665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018665.jpg"></div><h2>  Order </h2><p>  If you plan to enter the project SRO, it will be useful to know how this happens. </p><ul><li>  First of all, you need to decide on the direction of a self-regulatory organization depending on the type of activity.  For example, different SROs have been created for builders and designers. </li><li>  Choose a specific self-regulatory organization.  It is advisable to give preference to proven SROs with more than three years of experience.  In accordance with the law, both the self-regulatory organization and the company entering into it must be registered in one region. </li><li>  Prepare the required package of documents and submit it to a self-regulatory organization for consideration.  This is the longest stage on the path to joining the SRO.  The whole process can take about a month.  You can use the services of intermediary companies that are ready to collect documents for a fee.  Representatives of SROs can consider documents for thirty days.  If you make a positive decision, then after three days the company can begin to fulfill orders. </li><li>  SRO invoices, including entrance fees and compensation fund contributions. </li><li>  Obtaining a certificate confirming entry into a self-regulatory organization. </li></ul><h2>  Contributions </h2><p>  This is a mandatory fee for those who plan to become a new member of a self-regulatory organization.  Minimum expenses on average range from ninety to three hundred and seventy thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kramerundkramer.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="enter into project terms" class="if uuid-3018668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3018668.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the exact amount of contributions is difficult to name, since it consists of several components. </p><ul><li>  Entrance fee.  It is entered once by new participants. </li><li>  Contribution to the <span>compensation fund.</span>  This is a kind of stabilization fund, the money from which is paid to the customer, provided that the contractor caused damage to him. </li><li>  Membership fee.  The frequency of their payments depends on the requirements of a particular self-regulatory organization.  In some monthly, in some - annually. </li><li>  Liability insurance.  Such contributions are not practiced in all self-regulatory organizations. </li></ul><h2>  Exclusion from SRO </h2><p>  Do not assume that joining a self-regulatory organization is a one way way.  There is always the possibility that a company may be excluded from its composition.  In what cases does this happen? </p><ul><li>  Failure to comply with the requirements established by the SRO. </li><li>  Irregular transfer of membership fees. </li><li>  Non-payment of the established contribution to the compensation fund. </li><li>  Lack of evidence confirming the admission of at least one type of work that affects the safety of capital construction.  This item is relevant for members of the construction SRO. </li></ul><h2>  Lack of clearance </h2><p>  To perform, in addition to the fact of joining the SRO, the company must have a certificate confirming admission to the performance of a certain type of work. </p><p>  SRO approval is issued in accordance with the rules of a particular organization.  For example, without appropriate access, it is forbidden to carry out work that affects the safety of capital construction projects. </p><p>  There are several types of tolerances.  For example, the construction allows the implementation of the same name, as well as repair work.  Design allows you to develop architectural and construction projects and so on. </p>
