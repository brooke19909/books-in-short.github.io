    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This nice little hotel has a very good location.  So, it is located almost on the seashore, just 1.5 km from the center of the capital of one of the largest resort regions of Turkey - the city of Alanya.  Just an hour's drive from the hotel is located one of the most interesting sights of the country - Manavgat Waterfall.  The ancient Alanya Fortress is just five kilometers from the hotel.  So you can take a pleasant walk to this famous <span>tourist attraction in Turkey.</span>  As for the air harbor, the nearest of them is 125 kilometers from the hotel, in the city of Antalya.  After landing at the airport, the trip to Kleopatra Sahara Hotel 3 * (Alanya) will take about two hours.  But do not worry about this, as the travel time will fly by unnoticed while you enjoy the views from the windows of a bus or a car and listen to the entertaining stories of the guide about Turkey in general and the Alanya region in particular.  Since one of the most important points that people pay attention to when choosing a hotel on the coast of a country is the proximity of the beach, we also cannot help but touch upon this issue.  As for the hotel we are considering, it does not have its own beach.  However, it is located almost on the coast.  The distance from the main hotel building to the nearest municipal beach is only 100 meters.  At the same time, along the way, you will have to cross the roadway and cross the promenade stretching along the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  If you buy a tour to Kleopatra Sahara Hotel 3 * through a travel agency, then most likely you will be taken from the airport to the hotel by bus accompanied by a guide.  If you plan to travel to Alanya on your own, then you will have to worry about transport to the hotel yourself.  By the way, most hotels offer their own transfer services from the air harbor.  However, often they can not be called cheap.  Therefore, we propose to consider more economical options.  So, if you arrive <span>at Antalya Airport,</span> you can get to Alanya by bus.  They go regularly, and one way travel will cost you about five euros.  Travel time will be about two hours.  In Alanya, an intercity bus will take you to the station, located three kilometers from the city center.  From here, the hotel can be reached either by city bus or taxi.  If you plan to travel to other cities of Turkey before arriving in Alanya, you can choose a flight to Gazipasa Airport.  It is only half an hour from Alanya and serves only domestic flights. </p><p>  In addition, you can get to Alanya by sea.  So, ferries from Kyrenia, located in Northern Cyprus, regularly arrive at the port of this city.  The cost of such a trip is 32 euros one way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Alanya Kleopatra Sahara Hotel: photos and description </h2><p>  This hotel was built in 1996.  The last reconstruction was carried out in 2008.  The hotel in question is quite small.  So, it consists of one multi-storey building, which includes 33 comfortable rooms.  The hotel has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã600 square meters.  In addition to the main residential building, there is a restaurant, a bar, an outdoor pool, a sun terrace, a <span>volleyball court</span> and parking.  There is no animation at the Cleopatra Sahara Hotel, so you can relax in peace and quiet.  If you want noisy entertainment, then you just need to go outside the hotel, because in its vicinity there are a lot of restaurants, bars, clubs, shops, souvenir shops, etc. The Kleopatra Sahara Hotel 3 * will be comfortable for both youth and family tourists with children, as well as older people. </p><h2>  Hotel check-in rules </h2><p>  In accordance with the internal rules accepted at the Cleopatra Sahara Hotel, check-in of guests is carried out from 12 noon.  However, this does not mean that, having arrived at the hotel earlier, you will certainly have to expect noon.  If Kleopatra Sahara has free rooms, you will be checked in immediately upon arrival.  However, in the midst of the tourist season, the hotel is one hundred percent full, so if you arrive early, you will have to wait until the previous guests have vacated the rooms and the maids have prepared them properly.  You can shorten the waiting time by going to a restaurant, to the pool or straight to the beach.  As for the departure date, you need to free your room before 11 a.m.  At the same time, when handing over the keys to the reception, you should pay for the entire period of stay at the hotel.  We accept cash and credit cards <span>Visa and Mastercard.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation for tourists with children </h2><p>  Since the Kleopatra Sahara 3 * hotel is positioning itself, among other things, as a family institution, you will be only happy here if you come to rest with children of any age.  At the same time, if you place a child up to three years old on existing bedding or a baby up to two years old in a crib, then you will not have to pay extra for this.  If you are staying in your room for an older child or an adult in an extra bed, this will cost you 10 euros per day.  Moreover, in each room only one extra adult bed or <span>playpen</span> can be installed <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Accommodation with pets </h2><p>  This item will be very important for those tourists who do not want to part with their four-legged pets, even during the holidays.  So, unfortunately, the domestic rules of the Kleopatra Sahara Hotel prohibit pets from traveling on site.  Thus, you just have to either look for another hotel belonging to the Pets Friends category or leave your pet at home for the duration of the trip. </p>
