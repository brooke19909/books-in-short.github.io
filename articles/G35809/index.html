And even despite the advanced cameras of smartphones, phones can never replace a classic camera.  No matter what marketers say.  They are generally not worth listening to, since their task is to increase sales at any cost.  Nothing can replace interchangeable lens cameras.  Therefore, this type of device will never die out.  At the moment, mirrorless models of cameras dominate the market.  It is understandable.  These devices do not require professional skills to work with them.  However, classic SLRs have not gone away.  In this article, we will consider the best cameras with interchangeable lenses.  But first, we‚Äôll figure out how the SLR differs from the mirrorless one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interchangeable lens cameras" class="if uuid-2983615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983615.jpg"></div><h2>  SLR Cameras </h2><p>  These sophisticated devices are designed for professional photographers.  However, some lovers can use them.  Unless, of course, they know what exposure, exposure, focal length and other terrible terms are.  The principle of operation of DSLRs is based on the complex design of the lenses that are in the camera itself.  They transmit the image already to a digital sensor.  This is how the classic SLR works.  Its feature is lenses.  They allow you to achieve maximum quality.  However, in order to cope with such a technique, you need to take special courses.  Well, or take a couple of hundred thousand photos without any lessons.  Then mastery will come.  These cameras traditionally top the rating of interchangeable lens cameras.  Even despite the growing popularity of mirrorless models.  Knowledgeable people will never choose the latter, if there is an opportunity to buy a high-quality DSLR.  And in this they are right.  But enough about these cool cameras.  Let's move on to simplified models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mirrorless cameras with interchangeable lenses" class="if uuid-2983618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983618.jpg"></div><h2>  Mirrorless cameras </h2><p>  These devices were invented relatively recently.  They combine the ease of operation of simple digital soap dishes and the ability to use a top-end lens from some professional Nikon.  Of course, in this case, the technology is used much more advanced than in conventional soap dishes, but there is one principle: these cameras do not have lenses.  The image from the lens here immediately hits the digital matrix.  These cameras have a number of advantages over DSLRs: they are much smaller in size, much easier to use and great for traveling.  However, professionals are not yet striving to switch to mirrorless.  Since the quality will not be the same anyway.  However, these are also cameras with interchangeable lenses.  And therefore it will be necessary to consider them in this review.  However, enough lyrics.  Let's move on to the review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldwidecameraexchange.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interchangeable lens rating" class="if uuid-2983621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983621.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 1.  Nikon D750 Body </h2><p>  Opens our SLR rating (which was expected).  Nikon interchangeable lens camera.  This model is very actively used by both professionals and amateurs.  And despite the fact that the camera comes exclusively.  Without a lens.  The manufacturers had the expectation that beginners would definitely not buy this device, and professionals and advanced amateurs have long had their own set of favorite lenses.  I must say that this approach allows you to filter out those who cannot afford this device.  Nikon D750 Body is the most affordable professional-grade full-frame SLR.  It has a high-quality CMOS sensor with a resolution of 24 megapixels, a bright viewfinder, a rotary screen, a Wi-Fi transmitter and the ability to record directly to two memory cards.  And the camera can shoot high-quality Full HD video.  A real find for both professional and amateur.  This is clearly one of the best interchangeable lens cameras.  However, we will move on to the next participant in the rating. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amateurphotographer.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony interchangeable lens camera" class="if uuid-2983625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983625.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 2.  Canon EOS 1200D </h2><p>  And again a SLR!  A camera with interchangeable lenses from Canon is a great option for beginners and advanced enthusiasts.  It copes with shooting in any conditions.  However, it has one drawback (like all SLR cameras) - quite heavy.  Nevertheless, this is one of the few full-frame DSLRs that can please a beginner.  This unit has an advanced (and well-established) CMOS matrix with a resolution of 18 megapixels.  But despite this, the camera is able to produce excellent detailed and clear pictures.  And with a top-end lens, she will not have a price at all.  Many professionals choose products from Canon.  True, those are a class higher and much more difficult in terms of management.  And this model is just suitable for a novice photographer.  The main thing is to learn how to manage it (which is not difficult at all) and acquire a couple of good lenses for all occasions.  Then you can try yourself in real photography, and eventually go to a higher level.  But we were distracted.  We continue the review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ukdigital.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras" class="if uuid-2983627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983627.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 3.  Olympus OM-D E-M10 Kit </h2><p>  But this is a mirrorless camera.  It is she who leads the rating of mirrorless cameras with interchangeable lenses.  This camera is much simpler than mirrored prototypes and therefore sells better.  This is a great chance for a novice photographer to join the world of great photography.  After all, this camera, although it has toy dimensions, but the price and characteristics are not toy at all.  In some respects, it even surpasses DSLRs (for example, sensor resolution).  However, the notorious CMOS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot here.  Dimensions do not allow.  And the rest of the characteristics are pretty good.  The rich fleet of interchangeable lenses for this camera is especially pleasing.  In general, this particular model belongs to the best cameras with interchangeable lenses from Olympus.  Some photography experts also support this view.  In any case, this camera allows you to get very clear, detailed and color-correct shots.  With the naked eye, it is impossible to distinguish a picture from this camera and a photo taken by an advanced DSLR.  Therefore, it is recommended to purchase this camera to begin with.  Moreover, it costs less than the cheapest DSLR.  However, we continue to consider other cameras. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.photographyblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony alpha interchangeable lens camera" class="if uuid-2983631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983631.jpg"></div><h2>  Number 4.  Sony Alpha A6000 Kit </h2><p>  Top mirrorless, which even professionals in the field of photography do not shy from using.  The <span>Sony Alpha A6000</span> Kit interchangeable lens camera features superior technical features and a rigorous vintage design.  This camera has a high-quality matrix with a resolution of 24.3 megapixels and a huge selection of interchangeable lenses.  Also, the camera can write video in Full HD format with progressive scan and a speed of 60 frames per second.  Not all DSLRs are capable of this.  That is why professionals like to use this device.  However, the principle of camera control is so simple that a novice can handle it.  At the moment, this is the best-selling compact camera with interchangeable lenses.  And even despite the rather high cost, many people buy it.  Moreover, the quality of products from Sony is well known throughout the world.  This mirrorless camera will be an excellent tool for creating masterpieces.  It provides amazing quality pictures.  Sharpness, sharpness and color depth - like on the best DSLRs.  Definitely this camera deserves attention.  However, let's move on to other models.  They also have a lot of interesting things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fujifilm interchangeable lens cameras" class="if uuid-2983637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2983637.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 5.  Fujifilm X-H1 </h2><p>  This mirrorless camera can rightfully be called the flagship.  And her price hints at it.  This is one of the best interchangeable lens cameras from Fujifilm.  Many professionals prefer it, and not some cheap DSLR.  And for such a choice there is every reason.  This camera has an APS-C sensor with a maximum resolution of 24.3 megapixels.  But these are trifles.  In fact, the camera is much cooler.  It has the option of optical stabilization, burst mode, the ability to record video in 4K with progressive scan and a speed of 60 frames per second.  And she can write Slo-Mo at a speed of 120 frames per second.  The crown of everything is lightning fast autofocus.  There are also a huge number of manual settings.  This camera is the best of interchangeable lens cameras.  However, the price of this miracle of engineering is appropriate.  It is understandable.  Such an advanced camera cannot cost a penny.  In any case, this camera is a great option for both professionals and beginners.  The pros will find here everything he needs, and the beginner will easily figure out the controls. </p><h2>  No. 6.  Nikon D3300 Kit </h2><p>  And again Nikon.  In general, cameras from this manufacturer have proven themselves both in professional and amateur circles.  These interchangeable lens cameras do a great job of taking photos under any conditions.  And the <span>Nikon D3300 Kit DSLR is</span> vivid proof of this.  It has a high-quality CMOS sensor with a resolution of 24 megapixels, a matrix cleaning system, a special port for connecting a microphone, the ability to record video in Full HD at 60 frames per second, a convenient viewfinder, an excellent display with excellent detail and much more.  But the main advantage of the device is high-quality images with excellent depth of field and excellent color reproduction.  By the way, the D3300 is the lightest camera in its segment.  Many novice photographers choose it for that purpose, so that the hand gets used to the heavy camera.  This camera was released a long time ago - in 2014.  But still it is number one for those who are just entering the world of high-quality photography.  And so it will be for a long time.  However, we will move on to the next representative of professional and semi-professional cameras. </p><h2>  Number 7.  Sony ILCE-7RM3 </h2><p>  A cool reportable mirrorless camera that can plug all the above cameras together into a belt.  This Sony interchangeable lens camera has very cool features and an equally cool price.  This camera has on board a full-frame CMOS-matrix with a resolution of as much as 42 megapixels.  This is an incredible amount.  It is not surprising that the camera can work with huge reportage lenses.  The camera can write 4K video at a speed of 120 frames per second and with progressive scan.  This camera can be used by professionals in any field.  The capabilities of this camera are enough for all existing tasks.  It is worth noting that not everyone can afford it.  Therefore, it is not very suitable for beginners.  Not every aspiring photographer is ready to lay out about 230,000 rubles for a mirrorless (albeit cool) one.  For many, this is an unbearable amount.  Therefore, it can be used mainly by professionals.  It is much lighter and more compact than DSLRs of this class, and this can play a decisive role in choosing.  However, let's move on to the cameras easier.  Not as cool as the terribly expensive brainchild of Sony. </p><h2>  Number 8.  Panasonic Lumix G5 </h2><p>  Rating cameras with interchangeable lenses would be incomplete without a product from Panasonic.  This company is known for its quality cameras.  And now she has released a rather interesting mirrorless.  This camera is based on a Live MOS sensor with a maximum resolution of 24.3 megapixels.  The camera can shoot video in Full HD at a speed of 30 frames per second.  Great result for a mirrorless camera.  But that is not all.  This camera provides the highest quality photos in all shooting conditions.  Professionals, of course, will not use this camera, but amateurs may well begin to create masterpieces.  And then it will be possible to move on to a more serious technique.  Although the beginner of this camera is enough for a long time.  This unit is assembled very soundly.  Traditional Japanese quality.  In its manufacture, only high-quality materials were used.  Among cameras with interchangeable lenses, this one looks pretty good, although it has taken one of the last places in the ranking.  But this is not because it is bad, but because exclusively professional models are valued today.  And this ‚ÄúPanasonic‚Äù is not like that. </p><h2>  Mirror or mirrorless? </h2><p>  The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems.  In principle, it all depends on the personal preferences of the user.  If he feels that he can easily cope with a full-frame SLR camera designed for professionals, then let him get it.  But the trouble is that there are few.  Yes, and travel often has no time to mess with a bunch of settings.  Because now mirrorless are gaining popularity.  They are able to produce high-quality images with minimal user involvement in the shooting process.  Isn‚Äôt it a charm for a novice photographer?  But it‚Äôs worth buying a SLR at least in order to understand how to use it.  This knowledge will definitely not be superfluous. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, above we examined the best cameras with interchangeable lenses.  Among them are both the legendary models of SLR cameras and completely new mirrorless models.  All of them provide high quality images.  But some of them are used by professionals.  The choice entirely depends on the user's requests.  If he wants to be professionally engaged in photography, then above are very interesting models for the implementation of his plan.  The rest will find many interesting models in the camp of mirrorless cameras. </p>
