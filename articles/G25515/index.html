    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Now in the city there are only about 90 thousand inhabitants.  Once upon a time, 60% of the population were Jewish families.  However, times and customs changed.  Most of the locals left for permanent residence on the "promised land." </p><p>  For centuries, the city absorbed the culture of various civilizations.  The mentality of the Polovtsy formed the influence of different cultures: Scandinavians, Balts, Russians, Jews.  Through the ancient settlement, the river ‚Äúfrom the Varangians to the Greeks‚Äù passed along the river, which affected the development of international relations and the culture of local residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Polotsk Hotels" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/836648.jpg" width="600"></div>
