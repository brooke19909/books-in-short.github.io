    <p>  Silk painting has been one of the most popular hobbies in Europe for many years.  Demanding perseverance, such a hobby can give real masterpieces.  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  any motive you like; </li><li>  a piece of silk of the appropriate size and neutral color; </li><li>  paints for work on <span>silk fabrics</span> ; </li><li>  contour pen for transferring a picture to a material; </li><li>  varnish for fixing paints; </li><li>  frame for painting on silk; </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  frame for the final decor of the work. </li></ul><p>  First of all, you need to pull a piece of silk on the frame.  Then you need to transfer the pattern to the fabric using a special pen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thoroughly dry the circuit.  Drying the first lines makes it possible to more clearly draw each element.  After the contours are fixed, you can proceed to the most interesting thing - coloring.  Having completed this stage, it is also necessary to wait for the complete drying of the material.  After that, the picture is removed from the frame and the excess material is cut off.  The finished work must be fixed on a cardboard sheet and inserted into the frame.  Everything, an exclusive New Year‚Äôs panel, made with your own hands, is ready.  Such a decoration, by the way, can be a great gift. </p><h2>  Christmas panel from salt dough </h2><p>  From such fairly ordinary products that are available in absolutely every home, you can create real works of art!  In addition, even a child can perform a New Year's <span>panel of salt dough</span> , so do not forget to attract your children. </p><p>  In order to prepare a mass for such a panel, you will need only four ingredients: 1/2 cup flour and salt, 1/4 cup plain water and 1 tablespoon of any vegetable oil. </p><p>  So, we mix all the dry ingredients, add oil and pour cold water in a thin stream.  Knead until the mass for the future panel becomes homogeneous and elastic. </p>

    <p>  We begin to sculpt.  The selected motif must be printed in full size and put under the glass.  At the last, it is necessary to model each of the elements of the future panel.  Leave to dry completely (this will take several days).  After the panel has dried, it can be glued to the cardboard base, painted with paints and inserted into the frame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New Year's panel from scraps of fabric </h2><p>  You can create a unique decor element with a thematic plot without spending significant funds on the purchase of materials.

    <p>  If you don‚Äôt like to sew, you can use the fairly common foam-based patchwork technique.  To work, you will need: </p><ul><li>  a foam sheet 2.5-3 cm thick; </li><li>  motive (avoid drawings with very small elements); </li><li>  the cloth; </li><li>  sharp clerical knife; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  The technique is simple: we transfer the motif to the foam, cut each line of the contour with a knife to a depth of 1.5-2 cm, insert a fabric of the corresponding color into the slots (we cut the patches to fit the size of the element, leaving a few centimeters to keep the fabric firmly on the foam) .  Lubricate the edges of the material before putting them into the foam.  All!  New Year‚Äôs panel, made with your own hands from improvised materials, decorates your wall.  Children can be involved in creating panels, in particular, at the stage of filling out the <span>contours of a drawing.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The embroidered New Year's panel </h2><p>  You can also make a Christmas <span>panel on the wall.</span>  The product embroidered in any technique will look great.  Naturally, embroidery with a counted <span>cross</span> is considered the simplest <span>.</span>  However, even the most elementary New Year‚Äôs motif will sparkle in a new way if you experiment with the thickness of the thread or if you make part of the picture half-cross.  You can also embroider only a part of the drawing printed on the canvas, which will add volume and expressiveness to the work. </p>

    <p>  After you have prepared all the necessary details, do not be lazy and process the edges.  This rather time-consuming procedure will give the product a finished look, but if you do not have time for this kind of work, do not despair.  Due to the fact that the material does not crumble at all, your New Year‚Äôs felt panel will last quite a long time and without any overcasting. </p><p>  A product made of such material will look great in a children's room. </p><h2>  Panel with lighting effects </h2><p>  Most ordinary people in vain believe that creating a Christmas panel with your own hands (the photo you see in our article) is very difficult, especially if there are light elements.  Of course, to make such a decor from scratch will only be possible for the stronger sex.  However, women can try their hand, decorating the wall decorations already at their disposal with various garlands, the most important thing is that the outlet or power element is located nearby. </p><p>  If nevertheless a decision has been made to independently design New Year's light panels, stock up on all the necessary details and, preferably, an accurate description of at least the work on connecting all the electrical elements. </p><h2>  Papier mache panel </h2><p>  Papier-m√¢ch√© is an amazing section of applied creativity, which opens up enormous prospects for us.  It gives a wide scope for imagination of both kids and adults.  When you create a Christmas panel with your own hands, the photo of the sketch can be removed in the far box. </p><p>  Today, papier-m√¢ch√© lovers can conditionally be divided into two types: those who acquire mass in the store, and those who cook the paste themselves. </p><p>  As a <span>New Year's decor,</span> you can use papier-m√¢ch√© balls.  By collecting several balls in a bunch and adding a bow, you can easily decorate the front door. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is easy to make a relief picture of papier-m√¢ch√©.  Sculpt elements of such a decor should be on a glass surface, where they will remain until completely dry.  Then all the parts are glued to the substrate and painted.  As a basis for such a picture, take a sheet of cardboard, which can later be fixed in a frame. </p><h2>  New Year wreath panel </h2><p>  You can decorate the walls or the front door with New Year wreaths very beautifully.  This simple enough element will bring a fresh stream and add a festive mood. </p><p>  In order to make a wreath of Christmas tree branches, you will need: </p><ul><li>  branches of various conifers (preferably thin); </li><li>  ring - the basis for a wreath with a diameter of 20-25 cm; </li><li>  wire. </li></ul><p>  Branches should be cut into pieces about 5-6 centimeters long, assembled into small bouquets.  Using wire, fix the Christmas tree blanks on the ring, placing them so that the base is not visible.  Garnish with flowers or artificial berries of viburnum. </p>

    <p>  You can decorate a ring not only with branches of conifers.  A wreath made of moss will also look great.  You can decorate such a panel-wreath with bows or any available natural material. </p><h2>  Thick cardboard panel </h2><p>  New Year‚Äôs wall panel made of thick cardboard is the pride of the owners of the house.  Of course, it is desirable to involve children in the manufacturing process, but imagine how much joy there will be when the work is finished !!! </p><p>  Cut out the main large elements from thick cardboard (it can be a Christmas tree or Santa Claus, a round dance of animals near a forest fir tree or something else).  Decorate the main details with smaller ones cut out of colored paper. </p><p>  When preparing this decor, do not forget that, in addition to traditional colored paper, you can buy velvet paper, corrugated and self-adhesive, as well as colored foil in shops for goods for children or for creativity.  Combining various textures in one panel, you will achieve the relief of the finished product. </p><p>  On such a panel, you can also stick small hooks for hanging small sweet gifts or make a Christmas calendar out of it. </p><p>  As you can see, it is very simple to make your holiday even brighter, richer and more memorable.  For this, you will not need almost anything except a small amount of free time, appropriate mood and imagination. </p>
