    <p>  This small city is located south of Venice, and to get into it, you need to get to the Venetian Square in Rome and take the bus.  Or anyone can pay for a boat ticket that will take him to the island. </p><h2>  Chioggia City: Description and History </h2><p>  Chioggia in Italy is called the second Venice or the sister of Venice, because he literally grew up on the water.  The city is connected to the mainland by a bulk dam, it covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã185 km <sup>2</sup> , and only 50 thousand people live in it. </p><p>  Chioggia appeared during the time of the Roman Empire, although at one time it became a victim of barbaric invasions.  In the original version, when the Etruscan people settled here, this place was called Clodia.  After this, the names changed several more times - Cluza or Clugia. </p>

    <p>  The city of Chioggia in Italy has been considered a major port for many years.  Every year, ships that came from the south of the country stopped here.  It was also an important fishing port, and the rule of the territory passed from one hand to another.  The history even mentions the Battle of Chioggia.  At first, this city was in the power of the <span>Genoese Republic,</span> then a battle broke out over this territory with the rulers of Venice, who recaptured Chioggia in 1380.  Since then, it has been ruled by <span>the Republic of Venice.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No wonder Chioggia in Italy, whose photo is striking in its beauty, resembles Venice.  It has the same architecture, the same canals and bridges, but only the area is much smaller and there is no such influx of tourists. </p><p>  It is interesting that the city was destroyed in the 9th century, but it was rebuilt again, because rich deposits of salt were found here. </p><p>  Another important event that occurred at this place is the appearance of the Virgin Mary.  You can see paintings and small postcards with her image everywhere, they are sold as souvenirs in all shops of the city. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Chioggia is a small city that is far from the first in terms of population.  There are much fewer tourists, but life is in full swing from morning to late evening.  This is not the most popular tourist destination, but people come here daily to see this wonderful place, enjoy the atmosphere, and feel how the poor Italians live. </p>

    <p>  There are many beaches in the resort of Sottomarina, they are all covered with fine sand.  The large sandy beach is divided into parts where everyone can find something to do.  Someone prefers to bask in the sun, someone can rent a water scooter or skis or do their favorite thing - kiting. </p><p>  The beach stretches for kilometers and is actually divided into several parts, each of which has its own name, for example Bahia del Sole, Bagni Vianello or Playa Punta Canna.  Of course, all these beaches are not as high as in the Maldives, and this must be understood from the beginning.  But you can always sunbathe, admire the sea and taste fresh sea fish. </p>
