    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  For twelve years the metro station "Strogino" was designated on the diagram as being under construction.  The point, of course, is not that the work process dragged on for such a long time.  In the early nineties, the country was gripped by an unprecedented economic crisis, as a result of which the further construction of new metro stations in the capital became impossible. </p><p>  The metro station "Strogino", according to the original plan, was to be part of the <span>Filevskaya line,</span> indicated in blue on the diagram.  But in 1993, the construction was postponed indefinitely.  When, after more than a decade, they returned to the project, <span>Moscow</span> looked completely different in the north-west <span>.</span>  <span>Metro</span> "Strogino", "Volokolamskaya", "Myakinino" decided to include in the blue line, thereby providing underground transport for residents of new areas.  However, the houses located in the vicinity of the station discussed in this article were built before the new millennium.  The area in which the Strogino metro station is located will be described later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The opening took place on New Year's Eve.  For two years, the Strogino metro station was the terminal on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.  In 2008, the construction of the next station of the blue branch, Myakinino, was completed. </p>

    <h2>  Krylatskoye - Strogino </h2><p>  Travel time from one station to another in the Moscow Metro is an average of three minutes.  But there is an exception.  The train from Strogino to Krylatskaya travels for almost eight minutes.  Passengers using the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line are aware of this feature.  But why is there such a great distance between these stations?  Few people think about this. </p><p>  The fact is that between the "Strogino" and the "Krylatskoye" is located the "Trinity-Lykovo".  This is a technical station that is currently used only by subway employees.  It is also called "promising."  That is, it is possible that someday it will be open. </p><p>  Near the station "Trinity-Lykovo" is the village of the same name.  Subway construction can only be resumed if there is a housing estate that can provide the subway with the required number of passengers.  But representatives of the metropolitan authorities recently compiled a list of villages to be demolished.  Trinity-Lukovo was not included in this list.  We will return to the metro station "Strogino".  What streets do you leave from this station? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
