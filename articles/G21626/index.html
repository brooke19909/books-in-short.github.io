    <h2>  A bit from the history of the bank </h2><p>  Initially, the bank was created as a mutual financial institution.  At its base, quite influential and wealthy personalities took part, among which was the Georgian billionaire Ivanishvili and a businessman from Russia - Vitaly Malkin.  Later, DBK Russian Credit Bank changed owners. </p><p>  From a mutual organization, he grew into a joint stock company.  Later, the legal form of ownership has not changed, but the fate of the bank has repeatedly changed. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúPotholes and potholes‚Äù on the road to fame </h2><p>  From the very beginning, fate was not favorable to this financial organization.  Therefore, throughout the entire time in the activities of the institution regularly a variety of obstacles arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It all started in 1998, when Russia was hit by the waves of the global financial crisis.  During this period, DBK Russian Credit Bank ceased to be liquid, which is why it quickly went under the wing of ARCO (an organization that is the prototype of a modern deposit insurance agency). </p><p>  In 2000, the bank underwent restructuring, which ended in mid-2003.  At the same time, ARCO released the slightly ‚Äúfledged‚Äù financial institution into free float.  At the same time, the size of the authorized capital was increased to almost two billion rubles.  Later, several more unstable situations were observed in the fate of the bank, but he still managed to overcome the peaks of the crisis. </p>

    <h2>  Period of financial stability and success </h2><p>  During the period of financial stability, ‚ÄúRussian Credit‚Äù attracted deposits of the population in national and foreign currencies, placed precious metals and carried out various banking operations. </p><p>  Moreover, this financial institution has five new representative offices, over 56 operational and 80 auxiliary offices.  For example, the organization‚Äôs representative office was in Barnaul, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod.  In Chelyabinsk, the Russian Credit Bank was also opened.  The license of this financial organization made it possible to carry out various monetary operations, including the issuance of loans and attracting deposits from the population. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What people say about Russian Credit Bank: reviews </h2><p>  If you believe the numerous reviews of individuals, the bank itself was pretty good.  Many users liked the fact that in almost every region there was a representative office of the bank.  This meant that there was no need to go anywhere and look for the addresses of Russian Credit Bank. </p><p>  All branches were located in the central regions, and they could be found using the official website of the organization or by calling the hotline.  For example, the bank‚Äôs main office was in Moscow on <span>Salvador Allende</span> Street 7. In Ufa, the bank‚Äôs representative office was located on 131/1 Internatsionalnaya Street. </p><p>  In addition to its convenient location and rather impressive retail network, the bank was famous for its qualified staff and high level of service.  According to users, online support deserved special praise. </p><p>  All answers were provided very quickly, professionally and exclusively in the case.  To solve any situation, it was not at all necessary to personally come to the Russian Credit Bank.  Addresses of the organization‚Äôs site were quite enough.  It was on it that one could find out information about the nearest terminals, ATMs and contact customer support. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What did the depositors say about the bank? </h2><p>  People who made deposits in Russian Credit Bank spoke about it exclusively on the positive side.  The organization was loyal to its customers and valued them.  Therefore, deposits were returned under the contract, on time and in the right amount. </p><h2>  How did the bank's problems end? </h2><p>  In 2013, the bank experienced certain financial difficulties.  And this is after many years of calm in the financial field.  Another year he somehow managed to survive, however, for this he had to unite with CJSC M Bank.  But even this simple trick did not help keep the financial organization afloat. </p><p>  In mid-July 2015, her license was revoked.  So the bank ‚ÄúRussian Credit‚Äù stopped its main activity.  User reviews about this organization help to understand how shocking this news was.  Many users did not believe it and even came to the nearest bank branches personally.  However, when they saw the announcement of the revocation of the license, they returned back. </p>

    <h2>  What are the reasons for revoking a license? </h2><p>  Among the reasons that led to the revocation of the license of the Russian Credit Bank, the regulator called the following: </p><ul><li>  Violation of several federal laws and regulations related to banking. </li><li>  Maintaining a high-risk credit policy. </li><li>  Providing inaccurate data. </li><li>  Regular violation of reporting deadlines. </li><li>  Financial instability and ‚Äúholes‚Äù in the portfolio of liquid assets. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, the management of the organization, according to the regulator, repeatedly made warnings.  However, no measures were taken to neutralize and normalize the situation. </p><p>  Starting from July 24, 2015, a temporary administration began to operate in the bank.  Three months after the beginning of its management, the bankruptcy of the organization was announced and payments by the Russian Credit Bank began.  The beginning of the implementation of insurance payments was once reported in the Agency for insurance of deposits of the population, the press and other media. </p><p>  So, depositors of Russian Credit Bank living in Bashkiria were able to receive their compensation starting from August 7, 2015. </p>

    <h2>  Unpleasant lawsuits </h2><p>  However, just before the payments by Russian Credit Bank, a lengthy and unpleasant trial began.  The fact is that the leadership of the bankrupt bank was accused of deliberate ruin.  At the same time, the representatives of the DIA acted as the plaintiff.  According to preliminary data, the damage caused to depositors of the bursting bank amounted to about 66.8 billion rubles. </p><p>  The case of intentional bankruptcy was considered on July 28, 2016.  The most interesting thing is that, in addition to allegations of false bankruptcy, the leadership of the former bank was accused of intentionally stealing the property of a credit institution.  The criminal case itself on the above charges was opened on November 14, 2016.  But, as it turned out, it was not the only one. </p><h2>  Other litigation </h2><p>  If you pay attention to some reviews about the bank "Russian Credit", it becomes clear that the above claim was not an isolated case.  In December 2015, a criminal case was opened regarding the theft of funds against the head of the credit organization Russian Credit. </p><p>  In September 2016, a certain Motylev (the former owner of Russian Credit, Globex and M Bank) was accused of embezzlement of bank funds allegedly issued in the form of loans to individuals. </p><p>  Later, the former banker <span>Anatoly Motylev,</span> to whom numerous accusations rained down, disappeared.  According to some reports, he took stolen money offshore.  After he disappeared abroad, complaints and suits rained down in a Moscow court. </p><p>  In December 2016, it was decided to arrest the businessman in absentia.  Even later, the entrepreneur and the financier-schemer were put on the international wanted list.  However, a decision on his case has not yet been made.  Although, according to some reports, the wanted fraudster still lives and peacefully resides in London. </p><h2>  Multiple Theft Damage </h2><p>  According to our information, Motylev is suspected of embezzlement of more than 700 million rubles.  Moreover, if we talk directly about the bank ‚ÄúRussian Credit‚Äù, then we are talking about the amount of 126 billion rubles.  It was this money that was stolen by a fraudster and transferred to the accounts of foreign banks under the auspices of offshore companies. </p>
