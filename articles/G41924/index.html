One can talk endlessly about its sights.  The Burukshun estuaries, representing a whole system of various water bodies, are a real natural asset.  In Stavropol, the largest number of <span>temples, churches</span> and chapels are located, which were repeatedly restored after the hostilities.  Each visitor must strive to approach the "Cold Spring" and lay flowers with him in memory of the dead. </p><h2>  Route Features </h2><p>  As it turned out, Krasnodar and Stavropol are two similar cities, with identical culture, nature and architecture.  Perhaps for this reason, the inhabitants of each of them make a trip to another city.  The route between them, if you look at the map, represents one solid line.  The total distance is approximately 299 km.  This is a relatively small distance, which can be overcome with several modes of transport. </p><h2>  Car </h2><p>  The distance from Krasnodar to Stavropol does not exceed 300 km, so it will not be difficult to overcome it by personal transport.  Asphalt was recently updated along the entire route and bright markings appeared, which makes the trip easy and comfortable.  Between these two cities there are two settlements (the city of Ust-Labinsk and Kropotkin).  If you wish, you can stop here to relax, have a bite and refuel your car.  If you move from one point to another without stops, breakdowns and traffic jams, you can make a move in just 4 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar Stavropol distance" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1900877.jpg" width="600"></div>

A trip on this type of transport can be made only with transfers.  Most passengers prefer a flight through Tikhoretsk station.  This is due to the fact that there will be the shortest period of time between the departure of one and the arrival of another train. </p><p>  In general, the total travel time is about 8 hours.  As a rule, in most cases, night moving is carried out.  That is, at 21.00 the train leaves from the railway station of the city of Stavropol, located on the street.  Vokzalnaya, d. 5, and already at 5.00 he arrives in the glorious city of Krasnodar.  Tickets for it can only be bought at the box office.  The approximate cost, taking into account the transplant, will be 1100 rubles. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2>
