This is a very important point for some tariff plans.  Indeed, quite often, users complain that they do not know how much more they can talk for free per day.  And for this reason, they are unable to replenish the account on time and calculate the replenishment amounts.  And it is precisely this kind of uncertainty that sometimes prompts customers to change tariffs, or even the operator at all.  Checking the remaining minutes (MTS) is not so difficult if you know a few interesting tricks.  They will certainly help even the most picky user. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the remaining minutes on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867750.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  Well, if you‚Äôre thinking <span>how to find out the rest of the minutes on MTS,</span> then you can try to resort to the most simple and common scenario.  This is a personal visit to the office of your mobile operator with a request to inform about the balance.  Yes, this is far from the most convenient approach, but it is effective. </p><p>  The thing is that customers are not particularly fond of going to mobile phone stores.  Sometimes you can spend a lot of time there to get an answer to your question, which will take several minutes.  Nevertheless, ignorance of certain functions and numbers, as a rule, pushes us to visit these cellular offices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to find out the remaining minutes of ‚ÄúMTS Smart‚Äù (or any similar tariff), take your mobile phone, as well as your passport and get poisoned to your operator.  Inform the office worker about your intentions to check the remaining minutes of the conversation on the phone.  Now state your number, after which (if necessary) provide passport data.  After a few minutes, the operator will tell you the rest of the minutes.  Super MTS or any other tariff - this is not important anymore.  The main thing is that you will get an accurate and correct answer to your question. </p><p>  But, as already mentioned, not everyone likes to go to mobile communication offices.  And for this reason, we will try to answer how to find out the rest of the minutes on MTS using other methods.  Which ones?  Let's get to know them soon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="check the remaining minutes mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867751.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  USSD team </h2><p>  Another rather interesting approach that can be used to achieve our current goal is the use of USSD commands.  They are usually known to a small circle of users.  And for this reason, in most cases, this scenario develops in the background. </p><p>  If you are interested in how to find out the remaining minutes on MTS using USSD commands, then grab your phone and dial * 111 * 217 # on it, and then click on the ‚ÄúDialer‚Äù button.  You will begin sending the request.  After you have to wait a while, processing will take place, and you will receive an SMS notification in which our remainder will be written. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In principle, this is a very good way, especially if you don‚Äôt really want to go to mobile communication offices.  Only here there is one small drawback - request processing.  Sometimes it simply does not happen due to network outages.  And then you just sit and wait for an alert that will never come to you.  Not a very good result, right?  Then let's think about how to find out the rest of the minutes on MTS using any other methods. </p><h2>  Station wagon </h2><p>  So, there is another rather interesting approach.  It is universal and suitable for checking minutes, as well as for receiving information about the rest of free messages and Internet traffic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the rest of the minutes mts smart" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867752.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  This scenario is somewhat reminiscent of the previous one.  We, as last time, will have to use a special USSD command.  Which one?  Dial * 101 * 1 # on your mobile, and then wait for an answer.  The system will inform you the remaining free minutes, messages and Internet traffic. </p><p>  This is a very convenient approach for solving this question.  Only not every user knows it.  Yes, and to learn everything at once, as a rule, is not particularly required.  Thus, we have a few very interesting and at the same time simple methods that will help you cope with the solution of the task. </p><h2>  Call </h2><p>  The rest of the minutes of MTS (Russia) can also be checked using the most ordinary call to your operator.  But how can we realize the task set before us today?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><p>  Just take your mobile phone and dial 0890 on it. Now wait until the operator answers you, and then tell him about your intentions.  As a rule, after that you may be asked for passport data.  This is necessary to verify the rights to the number.  After all, the service of a SIM card is carried out only with the consent of its owner.  But in fact, to be honest, they ask for passport data extremely rarely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the rest of the minutes super pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867753.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  After you complete this step, you will be informed about the remaining minutes on the phone.  That's all the problems are solved.  Only this method is not so good as it might seem at first glance.  The thing is that now when you call the operator, you can be redirected to the answering machine.  And to get the necessary data from him or to contact a live operator, you will have to spend a lot of time with a voice robot.  Not a very good prospect.  And so we will try to use with you other ways of solving the task set before us. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Well, if you want to understand how to find out the rest of the minutes on MTS without unnecessary problems, then you can always resort to the help of the Internet.  More precisely, the official website of the operator and the so-called personal cockpit on it. </p><p>  Go to the page, and then go through authorization there.  Then you will be taken to your personal account, where we will work.  There it will be necessary to find the "Services".  Look for "Find out the rest" or something like that in them.  If you click on the line we need, then you will see an inscription with the remainder of the free minutes.  That's all.  As you can see, so far there is nothing difficult.  You can check the rest of the MTS minutes with another method.  Which one?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  Assistant </h2><p>  All MTS clients receive a special application for the phone with a SIM card.  It is called MTS service.  With its help, you can easily and simply deal with the question posed before us today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest minutes mts russia" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867754.jpg" width="500"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To get started, go to the appropriate application, and then select the "services" section for us.  Now, as in the case of your personal account, look for something like "Remaining minutes" there.  After that, you can safely send a request, and then look at the result that appears.  As you can see, there is nothing difficult in our question.  The main thing is to know where and in what sequence to click, as well as where to turn for help. </p>
