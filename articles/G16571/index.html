The easiest way to tie a crochet for a girl is because the technique does not require high qualifications, and the pattern is beautiful and original.  In order for the product to turn out to be of high quality and fashionable, it is necessary to choose the right material and its color.  Beginning needlewomen need to find a simple scheme for themselves. </p><h2>  What threads and tools are suitable for a summer beret </h2><p>  To tie a good summer crochet for a girl, initially it is worth choosing the right thread.  Since the item is intended for use in the warm season, the material must meet the needs. </p><p>  The best option for making a summer headdress for a girl, and even a crochet, will be 100% cotton.  Such a thread is environmentally friendly and will allow the scalp to breathe.  The only drawback is that it is easily deformed and quickly burns out. </p><p>  Another option will be thin acrylic.  This yarn holds its shape well, usually has bright and lasting colors.  For children, this material will be ideal. </p><p>  The hook should be selected in accordance with the thickness of the yarn.  If you plan to create an air pattern, then the number of the hook should be greater than the thickness of the thread.  The best option would be a tool with a stainless main and plastic handle. </p><h2>  Crochet Headgear Techniques </h2><p>  You can crochet a girl for a girl using several techniques.  The easiest option for beginners will be knitting in a circle.  It is enough to form it and knit according to the pattern, gradually making additions to give shape to the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second possible option would be knitting in parts.  Beret fits into the sectors from which the finished product is then formed.  Here you need certain skills and the ability to calculate loops according to the scheme. </p><p>  You can create a beret that will have one back seam.  Typically, such models are extravagant hats.  Knitting according to this pattern is not very difficult, so the option is quite acceptable for beginner needlewomen. </p><h2>  The easiest crochet pattern for a summer beret </h2><p>  To create a beret for a girl of 1.5-2 years old, you will need 100 grams of yarn.  For such a model, 100% cotton would be an ideal option.  To make the pattern smooth and accurate, you should choose a hook number 1.5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yarnspirations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the easiest takes" class="if uuid-2902841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2902841.jpg"></div><p>  How to crochet a girl for a girl?  A description of the sequence of actions is presented below.  The result is a product with simple motifs.  The work consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Dial a chain of 4 air loops (VP) and close in a circle. </li><li>  The 2nd row is knitted with crochets (CCH), making 2 stitches in one. </li><li>  3rd row knit 2 CCH in one loop of the previous row. </li><li>  The entire 4th row is knitted as follows: 1 magnificent column (PS) with 3 air loops alternately. </li><li>  Next, 9 wedges are formed: 2 PS in the arch of 3 VP, 2 VP are knitted between the PS;  2 CCHs are knitted in the next arch.  This alternation is carried out to the end of the row. </li><li>  To increase the number of CCH, you need to knit 2 PS in the PS, and knit the arch of 2 VP into the arch of 2 VP. </li><li>  In all subsequent rows, the number of CCHs increases by 2 loops in each of the wedges.  So 8 rows are knitted, until in each of the wedges 18 SSN are obtained. </li><li>  The next three rows knit without adding to the wedges. </li><li>  From the 17th row, the decrease begins.  It is necessary to knit together 2 CCH, which are located near the PS. </li><li>  2 other rows knit without reduction. </li><li>  Until the 28th row, there is an alternation of decreases and ordinary knitting, as described above. </li><li>  From the 29th to the 36th rows, you need to knit in single crochet columns (RLS). </li></ol><h2>  How to decorate any summer beret </h2><p>  You can use several different decoration options.  When choosing a decoration method, it is worth considering the features of the pattern and the general appearance of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="in.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to decorate a summer beret for a girl" class="if uuid-2902837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2902837.jpg"></div><p>  Options for decorating a summer beret: </p><ul><li>  Embroidery on a pattern with beads or beads looks beautiful. </li><li>  If the pattern is larger, then embroidery can be done using sequins. </li><li>  You can use ready-made stickers and embroideries, which are sold in needlework stores. </li><li>  Satin ribbons and tows should be used to form embroideries or appliqu√©s. </li><li>  Pompoms and hanging elements made of yarn or textile are an original and simple decoration. </li><li>  You can decorate a beret for a girl and crochet knitted ornaments.  Using the tool, it‚Äôs easy to tie flowers or butterflies. </li></ul><p>  You can use several decoration options as part of decorating a single beret. </p><h2>  Openwork takes for girls </h2><p>  When creating a crocheted beret for a girl, fashion trends should also be considered.  The most popular pattern is "pineapple".  The product will turn out delicate and light in appearance.  For such a beret, it is worth using a cotton thread. </p><p>  Knitting starts from the crown and is done in a circle.  You need to dial 5 VP and close in the ring.  Ring to tie the CCH in the amount of 24 pieces.  Knit the next row so that after each 2 CCH, 1 VP is additionally knitted.  The 3rd row is knitted in the same way as the previous one, but 2 VP are already formed. </p><p>  Next, you need to knit in accordance with the pattern, which represents the main pattern called "pineapple".  The number of openwork pineapples depends on the volume of the baby‚Äôs head.  After the main pattern, an edge is formed that will wrap around the head.  It can be knitted, depending on the desire, CCH or RLS.  An ideal option for a summer headdress will be a pattern of arches of air chains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for knitting a pineapple pattern" class="if uuid-2902822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2902822.jpg"></div><h2>  Floral motifs for summer headgear. </h2><p>  It will turn out to be beautiful crocheted for a girl, if you use floral motifs.  There are many options and patterns for knitting a summer headdress, but you should choose patterns that will form 1 large flower, which will be the top of the beret.  This option will be the most holistically and beautifully look on the baby. </p><p>  To add charm to the product, it is worth choosing cotton threads with double mercerization.  Yarn will give the headdress a unique ebb in the sun, and the thread itself will not be deformed as much as ordinary. </p><p>  An easy-to-follow daisy scheme is shown below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="id.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for beret flower" class="if uuid-2902848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2902848.jpg"></div><p>  When the upper part of the beret is ready, it is worth tying the bezel.  For the manufacture of this element, you can use the simplest schemes.  Just knit sn.  To further tighten the bezel, you can create a lapel for an elastic band or tape.  Thus, it will be possible to control the degree of head contraction with a beret. </p><h2>  Takes from the "fans" </h2><p>  If the girl is 2 years old, she takes it with a crocheted crochet, it can be made very original, so you should pay attention to the fan pattern.  The height of the product for a 2-year-old baby should be at least 19 cm, and the diameter of the bottom should be 14.5-15 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ahabolivia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fan pattern" class="if uuid-2902888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2902888.jpg"></div><p>  To work, you need to dial 90 loops or another number multiple of 6. An elastic set of loops is often used so that the rim does not cut into the skin.  Next should knit 3-5 rows of CCH.  After that begins the scheme of the ‚Äúfan‚Äù. </p><p>  If you adhere to the specified knitting scheme, then you will be able to make the product quickly and without errors.  Decreases are also made in accordance with the instructions of the scheme.  At the end, the last loops are pulled together with a thread. </p><h2>  Beret mesh for summer use </h2><p>  The simplest version of the pattern for making a crochet beret for the summer for a girl will be a mesh.  This beret needs to be knitted, starting with the rim.  It is worth weaving a chain of VP that will correspond to the circumference of the baby's head.  Knit a few rows CCH. </p><p>  Next, a spacious part of the beret fits.  It is necessary to knit a grid, namely, to create arches of 5 VP, which are attached through 3 loops of the previous row.  This creates volume.  The next row fits in the same way.  In this case, the arch is fixed in the third loop of the arch of the first row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beret net" class="if uuid-2902852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2902852.jpg"></div><p>  After obtaining the required volume, the loops are reduced by the same method - the arch will consist of 3 VP.  The last loops are pulled together with a thread.  The back is closed with a seam. </p>
