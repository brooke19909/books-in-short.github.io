In March 2017, the BQ 5059 Strike Power went on sale.  Reviews about him were in most cases positive.  In this article, we will consider some features of the device, its characteristics, and also study user feedback. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This smartphone comes in three different colors: golden, silver and black.  The design is simple, except for an unusually ‚Äúthick‚Äù case.  But there were reasons for this, which will be discussed later. </p><p>  At the top of the front panel are located earpiece, sensors and a camera.  Below the standard buttons are ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  On the back of the camera is located in the upper corner, which is a bit unusual.  Next to it there is a flash for pictures in low light.  The whole panel is made of metal.  The edges of the device are made of plastic.  Under the cover there are two slots for SIM cards and an SD card.  The battery is not removable. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display in the device is 5-inch, IPS, using OGS technology.  The resolution is 1280 by 720. In general, the image is clear, with good viewing angles.  The screen is a bit blind, and the bright rays of the sun will make the user peer at him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Computing power is provided by <span>MediaTek MT6580</span> with 4 Cortex A7 cores with a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  This is not a bad processor; it is supplied for the production of mid-range devices.  For the graphics in this chip meets the popular accelerator Mali-400 MP2, which comes with most modern smartphones. </p>

    <p>  As for memory, there is not so much RAM - 1 GB.  With the active work of applications, there will almost always remain about 300 MB, or even less, as follows from the reviews of the BQ 5059 Strike Power.  The internal memory is declared 8 GB, but only half will be available.  It supports the expansion of this volume to 64 GB due to memory cards.  In general, the performance is high.  The Antutu test issued 24500. Which is very good for the price category of a smartphone. </p><h2>  Communication and Interfaces </h2><p>  The device can work in networks no higher than 3G level.  When covering 4G large areas, this is a small but annoying minus of the smartphone.  There is Bluetooth for connecting to other devices, and Wi-Fi for wireless networks.  Positioning and positioning are handled by the integrated GPS module. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Probably the most amazing part in the smartphone is the battery.  Here he really has a huge amount of charge - 5000 mAh.  Given the fact that the processor is quite economical, and the screen resolution is not that big, the device will be able to work in active use for about two days, with optimization and longer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The main camera has 13 megapixels.  In the front - 8 MP.  Which is pretty good with the original budget of the device.  To work with them there is a regular application from Google.  As users noted in their reviews of the BQ 5059 Strike Power, there may be slight blurring in the pictures in low light. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The operating system is Android 7.0.  She is here, as they say, "clean", that is, without any proprietary shells and interfaces.  There are several affiliate applications and other software that, if necessary, can be easily removed from the system. </p><h2>  BQ 5059 Strike Power <span>Review Reviews</span> </h2><p>  In most cases, the responses are positive.  Of course, there are those who are unlucky with a particular party, but it happens with any device. </p><h2>  Positive comments </h2><p>  Smartphone reviews BQ 5059 Strike Power praise the screen and overall assembly.  As a result of good assembly - excellent durability of the device. </p><p>  Of particular note is the magnificent battery.  With good software optimization, it can last up to 3 days, as one of the users wrote in his review of the BQ 5059 Strike Power smartphone.  If you use the phone at all only for calls and SMS, then the charge may last for a week. </p>

    <p>  The sound of the external speaker is sufficient; in a noisy street, the call cannot be missed.  The conversation is also good, the voice of the interlocutor is heard clearly, without distortion. </p><p>  Although the main camera does not have a clear 13 megapixels, many liked it, judging by the reviews on <span>the BQ</span> 5059 Strike Power <span>phone</span> .  One of them noted that immediately after the purchase it is better to put the camera in the ‚Äúhonest‚Äù 8 MP mode. </p><p>  In terms of performance, most modern games and applications run with ease.  ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù 3D games can be tried on medium graphics settings.  And with the skillful organization of background applications, 1 gigabyte of RAM should be more than enough. </p><p>  In general, you can summarize and highlight the main advantages of a smartphone: </p><ul><li>  capacious battery; </li><li>  good performance; </li><li>  two slots for sim cards; </li><li>  conveniently lies in a hand; </li><li>  strength; </li><li>  cameras with a small budget; </li><li>  good sound speakers; </li><li>  fresh software. </li></ul><h2>  Negative <span>Phone</span> Reviews for <span>BQ</span> 5059 Strike Power </h2><p>  Negative feedback is mainly due to poor assembly.  But there are also patterns. </p><p>  Someone in a review of the BQ Mobile BQ 5059 Strike Power indicated that 3G is scarce.  With the modern development of LTE technology and global distribution, it would be possible to include it in this smartphone. </p>

    <p>  Some have certain problems with the software.  For example, frequent freezing of third-party widgets. </p><p>  The touch screen also can not always please with its sensitivity.  There are incorrect operation during operation or ‚Äúphantom‚Äù touches. </p><p>  Navigation is also not implemented at the best level.  Satellites may not be located for 4-5 minutes.  Stability also let us down, judging by the reviews of the BQ 5059 Strike Power Black Brushed, you can lose touch even in fine weather for no apparent reason. </p><h2>  Main competitors </h2><p>  One of the first ones to pay attention to in a suitable price range and similar specifications is Xiaomi Redmi 4A.  On average, its price can be higher by 1000 rubles.  At the same time, the screen exactly copies the display parameters of the article‚Äôs hero.  The memory in "Redmi" is twice as much, both operational and built-in.  At the same time, it is possible to connect to 4G networks.  The battery is not so capacious and has 3120 mAh.  Otherwise, it is an absolutely identical BQ 5059 smartphone. </p>

    <p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy J2</span> Prime also costs 1,000 rubles more.  Has the same screen size of 5 inches.  However, its resolution is an order of magnitude lower - 960 by 540 points.  Cameras are noticeably smaller in megapixels, but in terms of quality of shooting they can surpass the BQ 5059. There is support for 4G.  The processor in this smartphone is more productive, although the number of cores is the same - 4. But the frequency is higher - 1400 MHz.  The internal memory is identical, but the operational memory overtakes the BQ 5059 by 500 MB.  Pumped up the battery - here it is only 2600 mAh.  On average, this unit will lose significantly in the autonomy of the BQ 5059. </p><p>  ZTE Blade A510 will cost the same amount as the BQ 5059. True, a number of characteristics he has lower.  For example, the version of ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is older by 1 and not such a capacious 2200 mAh battery. </p>

    <p>  But the device has the ability to work in LTE networks and carries a good camera on itself.  As regards performance, this is not the most budget 4-core processor.  Otherwise, the parameters of the competitor and the monitored device are similar. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Characteristics and reviews of the BQ 5059 Strike Power showed that this smartphone will certainly be appreciated by people who are constantly traveling and traveling.  Its autonomy will allow using it not only as an entertainment center with active use, but also as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù. </p><p>  Performance, of course, does not reach the top flagship solutions, but for playing medium games and launching a few simple applications this will be enough.  Photo enthusiasts will appreciate cameras as an easy way to quickly take a bunch of pictures of acceptable quality.  Professionals will be a little disappointed with the blurriness and incorrect color reproduction. </p>
