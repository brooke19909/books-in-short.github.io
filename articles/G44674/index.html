How to knit a women's cardigan?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Women's sweater with knitting needles is knitted from wool, mohair, cotton.  Choosing the right pattern, you can create a summer and winter version of clothing for home, work, business meetings and romantic dates.  Let's consider in the article several knitting patterns of stylish women's pullovers for different weather, in each of which any beauty will look elegant and feminine.  But first, let's pay attention to fashion trends. </p><h2>  What sweaters are in fashion today? </h2><p>  Hand-knit products are still relevant today.  The jumper can be decorated with embroidery, pockets, cuffs, buttons, peplum and other decorative elements.  The style distinguish free, fitted, elongated models with sleeves of different lengths. </p><p>  An elongated jumper, like a dress or tunic, is perfect for leggings with elegant long-heeled shoes or <span>knitted boots</span> with flat soles.  The free model is suitable for jeans, and trousers, and for a warm skirt. </p><p>  Knit a female sweater with thin and thick yarn.  In the first case, the model is more delicate and elegant, it fits trousers and a classic shirt and complements the business style.  Elegant airy fishnet sweaters are worn with a skirt over the tops and a beautiful bra. </p><p>  The shape of the cutout models also have their own characteristics.  For example, the classic V-neckline more clearly emphasizes the <span>office style,</span> with a round neck sweaters can be worn over dresses, and unusual multi-faceted pullovers open the neckline. </p><h2>  Openwork female cardigan with knitting needles </h2><p>  The schemes of the summer pullover are given for women 50-52 sizes.  For work, you need 650 grams of cotton, where in a 50-gram skein 75 meters, and 5 mm knitting needles.  The jumper is knitted with a scarf and openwork pattern.  But we check the density of the loops on the scarf pattern.  A ten-centimeter segment should consist of 22 rows and 17 loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted sweater" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/366826.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This jumper is knitted mainly with a scarf pattern in circles according to the pattern: </p><ul><li>  odd rows - front loops; </li><li>  even circles - wrong side. </li></ul><p>  Openwork pattern is presented in two versions.  In the first case, the drawing is ‚ÄúHerringbone‚Äù, in the second - ‚ÄúThe mesh‚Äù.  The rapport of the first pattern consists of 14 loops in width and 6 rows in height: </p><ol><li>  1 wrong loop (IP), 5 front loops (LP), 2IP, 5LP, 1IP. </li><li>  1IP, 2LP, 2 loops, knit together with the front loop (LPVP), 1LP, yarn (H), 2IP, 1N, 1LP, remove the first loop as the face, knit 1 front and throw it over the removed (SLP), 2LP, 1IP. </li><li>  1IP, 5LP, 2IP, 5LP, 1IP. </li><li>  1IP, 1LP, LPVP, 1LP, 1N, 1LP, 2IP, 1LP, 1N, 1LP, SLP, 1LP, 1IP. </li><li>  1IP, 5LP, 2IP, 5LP, 1IP. </li><li>  1IP, LPVP, 1LP, 1N, 2LP, 2IP, 2LP, 1N, 1LP, SLP, 1IP. </li></ol><p>  Next, repeat the pattern from the first to the sixth row the desired number of times.  The result is an elegant women's cardigan knitted with needles. </p><h2>  Scheme of the second pattern.  Start knitting </h2><p>  The rapport of the second openwork drawing consists of 4 rows (designations are taken from the first pattern): </p><ol><li>  1H, SLP, 1H, SLP, 1H, SLP - repeat until the end of the row. </li><li>  All facial loops. </li><li>  HDL, 1H, HDL, 1H, HDL - repeat to the end. </li><li>  All facial loops. </li></ol><p>  Please note that the jumper is fully created on circular knitting needles.  You immediately collect 288 loops for the back and front and knit three rows with a garter pattern.  Then, knit 6 cm with a 4 x 4 elastic band. To make the transition from the elastic to the main pattern smooth, knit all the <span>wrong loops</span> together, then 216 stitches will remain on the knitting needles. Now it‚Äôs important to make the marks separating the front from the back: just stitch the pins and the beginning of the row, and after the 108th loop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Knitting a female sweater is</span> not too difficult.  Next, we knit with a <span>front surface of</span> 7 cm. Before and after the mark, 4 loops on each side should be reduced 4 times every 4.5 cm.  To do this, just knit HDL before the label, and after the label do SLP.  Thus, 200 pins should remain on the knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit female cardigan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/366827.jpg?1396626346269" width="500"></div>

    <p>  At a height of 27 cm, four times on each side of the marks from the marks do 2 loops through 3 centimeters.  Having reached a height of 41 cm on each side, you close the labels by 9 loops, leaving 90 pins on the needles. </p><h2>  Sleeves, yoke and connection </h2><p>  We continue to create openwork sweater for women with knitting needles.  For sleeves on circular knitting needles we dial 62 loops and knit two rows with a garter pattern.  In the 3rd row, close the first 18 loops that define the middle of the seam, and at the same time add 10 loops along the circular row.  Thus, there must be 54 loops on the needles of each sleeve. </p><p>  The coquette is knitted from 288 loops of the back, front and sleeves of the first and second openwork pattern of 46 rows.  Just alternate rapports of 14 and 18 loops to the end of the row.  Decreases are made only in the second openwork pattern: in 4-5, 12-13, 20-21, 28-29, 36-37, 44-45, 46 rows - along the loop on one side;  in the 6-11, 14-19, 22-27, 30-35, 38-43 rows - in a loop on both sides.  Thus, in the last, 46th row, 6 loops remain in the rapport, and 180 loops on the knitting needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then you knit a row with front stitch, decreasing along the row of 68 loops.  Then 112 loops will remain on the knitting needles.  We have almost ready a women's jumper.  Knitting remains to raise the back.  To do this, stretch the thread in the center of the part and knit according to the scheme: </p><ul><li>  7LP on the face, turned the work and pulled the thread. </li><li>  14 IP on the wrong side, turned the product and pulled the thread. </li><li>  21LP on the face, turn the work and pull the thread, etc. </li></ul><p>  Continue knitting in this pattern for up to 70 loops.  Next, 4 rows need to be knitted on all loops with a garter pattern and close the loops at a height of 62 centimeters. </p><h2>  Cross 48-mohair pullover </h2><p>  Now consider how to knit a women's sweater from mohair with knitting needles.  We will need 3 mm knitting needles and angora.  We knit the whole product with the usual facial stitch, based on the density, where in 10 centimeters there are 24 rows of 20 loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's sweaters with knitting needles with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/366833.jpg?1396626469588" width="429"></div>

    <p>  Before we collect from 120 loops with waste thread, then to dissolve it and knit the product in the opposite direction.  Next, we knit 60 centimeters of stitch with the main yarn.  After 25 cm, on only one side - on the face - close each time 10 loops until 40 pins remain on the knitting needles. Close them.  Now return to the front row and dissolve the junk thread.  Knit symmetrically in the same way. </p><p>  You create the back almost the same as before.  Only at a height of 50 centimeters leave 120 loops open.  The sleeves are also knitted 60 cm from 80 p. Now it remains to dissolve the junk thread everywhere and sew open loops of the back and front at the top and bottom for 20 centimeters, and sew sleeves into the middle twenty loops.  At the bottom of the sweater, you need to dial 200 loops and knit a basque for 20 centimeters. </p><h2>  Jumper with braids for the 54th size </h2><p>  For this model, you need 850 grams of wool, where in 50 grams - 60 meters of yarn, 8 mm knitting needles and a No. 6 hook. Such a female sweater is knitted from 2 patterns with knitting needles.  1 x 1 gum patterns will not be considered.  We knit a braid pattern as follows (standard notation, as in the above models): </p><ul><li>  1 row: hem (K), 2IP, SLP, 2LP, remove 2 loops for work, knit 2LP, and then from the auxiliary knitting needles (KZR), 1H, 2IP, 1K. </li><li>  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 rows: according to the drawing. </li><li>  3, 5, 7 rows: 1K, 2IP, SLP, 6LP, 1N, 2IP, 1K. </li><li>  9 row: 1K, 2IP, 1H, remove 2 medicinal products before work, knit 2LP, then from the auxiliary knitting needle (CRC), 2IP, LPVP, 2IP, 1K. </li><li>  11, 13, 15 rows: 1K, 2IP, 1N, 6LP, HDL, 2IP, 1K. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white cardigan female knitting" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/366834.jpg?1396626577937" width="350"></div></li></ul><p>  Pay attention to two things: </p><ol><li>  There should be as many decreases as the yarn over, i.e. the number of loops does not change. </li><li>  Even rows (wrong side) - knit all the loops behind the back wall. </li></ol><p>  The density of the pattern should correspond to the sample, where in 10 centimeters there are 19 rows and 16 loops. </p><h2>  Description of knitting a sweater with braids </h2><p>  Women's sweater with braids for knitting is created according to the standard scheme.  The back of 82 loops is knitted with a 2.5 cm elastic band.  Then evenly add 9 p. To get 91 loops.  Next, knit the main pattern 8 times (120 rows in total).  Then close the armhole on both sides - first 4 loops 2 times, then 2 loops 4 times, 4 times in the loop.  Thus, 71 pitches will remain on the knitting needles, which you close at a height of 65 cm. </p><p>  Before fits in the same way.  Only at a height of 56 cm close the central 15 loops for the neck, knit the remaining sides separately, closing 8 times in the loop from the notch.  Next, at a height of 65 centimeters, close each shoulder of 20 loops. </p><p>  Sleeves are knitted from 42 p. With elastic (2.5 cm).  Also add 5 loops and go to the main pattern, knitting it 4 times.  Then form an armhole, adding on both sides in a loop 9 times in each 6th row.  Thus, it will turn out 67 p. At a height of 45 cm, make a round by reducing 3 loops on both sides 2 times, then 15 times in a loop.  As soon as 31 pts remain on the knitting needles, close them at a height of 62 cm. </p><p>  Next, connect all the details.  Gather loops of a neck and 2 rows knit a front smooth surface.  Using a hook, pull the neckline out of the shoulder seam: air loop, after 2 cm continue rapport: * 5 single crochet in one loop, air loop, skip 4 cm *, end with a connecting post. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's sweater knitting scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/366835.jpg?1396626660176" width="500"></div>
