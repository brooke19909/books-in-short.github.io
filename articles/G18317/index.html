Ideas for the holiday and everyday life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sewing from flaps is one of the oldest ways to create household products.  This is now considered a form of <span>decorative art.</span>  And once upon a time, women gathered pieces of cloth left over from sewing clothes and made of them the most ordinary household items: blankets, rugs, cloaks, tablecloths and napkins.  It is believed that this technique arose from savings.  Fabrics were expensive, so thrifty housewives did not throw away anything, preserving each shred.  At the heart of the method is the art of mosaic - the creation of an integral artistic canvas by means of small pieces of stone or glass, assembled together.  This is what the patchwork outlines. </p><p>  The ideas of this skill came to us from England.  This is the same patchwork (patch means ‚Äúflap‚Äù, and work means ‚Äúwork‚Äù), only assembled in various geometric ornaments, complemented by applique, embroidery, and curly stitch.  Each piece made in this style is a real work of art.  <span>Decorative panels,</span> bedspreads, pillows, bags, wardrobe items and much more, assembled by craftsmen from rags, serve not only for decoration, but also for use in everyday life.  This is what attracts the patchwork.  The ideas for applying this needlework are endless.  First of all, this is the interior.  It is generally accepted that the place is patchwork in village huts or in country interiors.  However, it all depends on the color scheme and ornament.  Muted paints, soft tint transitions, complex ornamental compositions are quite suitable for a room decided in any style: both classic and ultramodern.  And it is not necessary to be limited only to textiles.  Various products made in the style of patchwork will help to decorate the room.  Ideas for <span>decorating furniture</span> and walls are also very interesting.  For example, beautifully selected multi-colored rags glued to drawers and furniture facades will bloom the nursery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Bright pieces of fabric can decorate one of the walls in the kitchen or in the youth room.

    <p>  It is important to consider that the patchwork mosaic in itself is very effective.  Products from it attract the eye and become the compositional center of the room.  Therefore, one should not place too many objects in a similar style in one room.  It will be enough to have one bright spot that harmonizes well with the rest of the color scheme. </p><p>  <strong>Patchwork.</strong>  <strong>New Year's ideas</strong> </p><p>  Fun and bright patchwork will be a great addition to the festive decoration, if you pick up pieces of fabric Christmas colors (red, white, blue, blue, silver and gold, etc.).  In this technique, not only tablecloths and napkins are made, but also Christmas tree decorations.  The simplest is the ball. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patchwork. New Year's ideas." class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2521/284157.jpg" width="600"></div>  For its manufacture, we take two <span>types of fabric,</span> say, plain and with a pattern, gold braid and a brush.  First, make a pattern in the form of an ellipse.  Then, using it, we will cut out even identical details from the fabrics (6 or 8 pieces).  Connect them together, alternating.  Fill the resulting form with cotton or centipon.  Lay the braid along the seams and sew it manually.  The ball will be complemented by a brush sewn from below and a loop.

    <p>  <strong>Patchwork.</strong>  <strong>Kitchen Ideas</strong> </p><p>  Perhaps the most traditional items for the decoration of the kitchen, made in this technique, are potholders and substrate-napkins for plates.  For beginners, this is a great opportunity to master this art.  To make the product beautiful and neat, prepare an iron and smooth each seam, as well as make the necessary patterns from cardboard for cutting fabric.  In the creation of ornaments use squares, triangles, rectangles and rhombuses.  These are the basic geometric elements that make up the multicolor pattern.  It is very important to choose several fabrics that combine with each other, of different colors, but of the same composition.  You will also need a sewing machine, a synthetic winterizer and a one-color lining.  Pieces of fabric are first sewn together, then the finished product is cut off along the edge, giving the desired shape, combined with a synthetic winterizer and lining, trim the edge and quilted by hand. </p>
