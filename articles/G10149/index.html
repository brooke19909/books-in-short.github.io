    <p>  Tourists, in turn, are in a hurry to leave feedback that will help the administration to improve the service and maintenance. </p><p>  The guests of Gagra did not ignore the hotel "Zhoekvara" (4 * hotel, Gagra, Abkhazia).  Reviews of tourists allow us to conclude that the hotel at the start was not quite prepared for the reception of vacationers: flaws in the rooms, there is not everything that is stated in the infrastructure.  Traces of construction were visible everywhere - garbage, unwashed floors and walls.  There are no elementary places to relax on the territory - shops. </p><p>  Complaints of almost all clients about an intestinal infection are a boom.  But apparently, the hotel has nothing to do with this.  Diseases occur throughout Abkhazia.  Intoxication of the body is terrible, as tourists say.  Children are especially affected.  Locals blame Escherichia coli, but swimming in the sea is allowed.  The cause of the mass poisoning of the 2016 season remains unknown. </p><p>  Food at the hotel was not to everyone's liking.  Many complain that there is no declared Caucasian cuisine at the hotel.  The most common dishes are pasta, cereals, chicken, vegetables.  Variety is completely absent, the same dishes every day. </p><p>  You can trace the fact that reviews about the kitchen are improving.  Vacationers who visited the resort in June-July, immediately after the opening, leave negative reviews about food, and tourists in September - completely opposite.  According to them, the food is decent and varied. </p><p>  The hotel has no complaints.  All rooms are new, bright, beautiful.  Very comfortable furniture, decent appliances, high-quality plumbing and repairs.  Some vacationers drew attention to thin walls and poor soundproofing.  And of course, there are indignations in the reviews about the same unfinished repair. </p><p>  Some vacationers complain about the mess when checking in.  Some were in the wrong room, others didn‚Äôt have armor.  Perhaps, at the opening, the administration did not finalize the reservation system and, as a result, problems.  In general, the feedback on the work of the staff is positive. </p><p>  With regard to the location of the hotel "Zhoekvara" (Abkhazia), reviews praise him.  Proximity to the sea is the main advantage of this vacation spot.  And of course, the beautiful <span>nature of Abkhazia</span> pleases tourists.  For this, people go to Gagra. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  A novelty in the tourism business of the near abroad is "Zhoekvara" (4 * hotel, Gagra, Abkhazia).  Reviews of tourists will highlight the following advantages of relaxation in this hotel: </p><ul><li>  beautiful nature of Abkhazia, clear sea; </li><li>  large park area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel; </li><li>  the rooms are comfortable, clean, freshly renovated; </li><li>  Internet throughout the hotel; </li><li>  clean new towels, bathrobe, slippers; </li><li>  hospitable and friendly staff; </li><li>  proximity to the sea, beach; </li><li>  interesting excursions; </li><li>  the cuisine at the end of the season is varied; </li><li>  Good hotel location in the city, proximity to major attractions. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Cons of the hotel, like any vacation spot, of course there are.  Based on the reviews of tourists, we summarize the main shortcomings in the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Unavailability of the hotel to receive guests, construction in progress; </li><li>  at the beginning of the season - a monotonous kitchen; </li><li>  weak pressure of water in the shower; </li><li>  intestinal infections; </li><li>  lack of declared additional services; </li><li>  lack of animation; </li><li>  lack of night clubs (rest is not for youth); </li><li>  poor soundproofing of rooms; </li><li>  no baby food; </li><li>  lack of beach equipment. </li></ul><p>  Based on the negative reviews about the rest in the hotel "Joekvara" (Abkhazia), we can say that they are all non-global and disposable.  Most likely, cons are looming due to late construction deadlines.  As they say, hurry up - you make people laugh.  Or angry.  And so it happened.  All defects are easily eliminated, the main thing is to pay attention to them.  Tourists who are spoiled by All inclusive world resorts may not like everything.  However, in general, the hotel is quite suitable for recreation, especially since there are few hotels that work on this principle in Abkhazia. </p><p>  It is hoped that the diamond resort of Abkhazia will soon wait for proper cutting and will shine like a diamond, as local beauties can and should be admired and enjoyed. </p>
