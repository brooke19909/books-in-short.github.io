    <h2>  To Crimea today </h2><p>  Holidays in the Crimea for many are associated with crowds of people on the beaches and transport problems.  Indeed, direct trains do not go to Crimea at the moment, but the ferry crossing the Kerch Strait will certainly become part of an exciting journey, especially for children.  A comfortable ferry room with comfortable soft sofas, a bar and huge windows that offer magnificent views of the Crimean sea expanses will present a romantic hour of approaching the mysterious land.  Moreover, now without problems it is possible to purchase single tickets Moscow - Crimea, including travel by train, bus and ferry. </p><h2>  There are options </h2><p>  But as for the large number of people who reached out to Crimea after its accession to Russia, this can be avoided.  Crimea is not only the sea.  If you prefer a quiet secluded vacation away from noisy companies and large cities, you will like a place called Sokolinoye in Crimea.  The sea is far enough from it, but you can also visit the Yalta Beach if you wish.  Fortunately, the prices for holidays in Crimea are not the most serious among Russian sea resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea Falcon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54721/2143918.jpg"></div>

Near the hotel there is a beautiful Silver Stream waterfall and the famous youth baths in the Grand Canyon. </p><p>  In the <span>Belbek Valley,</span> in which the hotel is located, begins the Grand Crimean Canyon.  In its central part is the Blue Lake, which is famous for its clear water and beautiful scenery.  You can swim in it - the water in the lake is +10 degrees. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the Grand <span>Crimean Canyon was</span> formed almost 2 million years ago in the limestone layers of the soil under the influence of water erosion.  It originates 5 kilometers from the village of Sokolinoe.  Its depth in some places reaches 320 m, and its length is about 3.5 km. </p><p>  17 km of mountain road lead to the top of Ai-Petri Mountain.  Breathtaking serpentine and stunning views will make the trip to the mountain easy and interesting. </p><h2>  Hippotherapy and air baths </h2><p>  One of the services of the estate is horse riding through the ancient Crimean forests to the nearest attractions.  For example, to <span>Syuyrensky fortress</span> and monastery Chelter-Koba with a unique yew grove.  Of the natural attractions, it is worth noting the Kokkozka River, which originates in Sokolin, and the small grotto of Danilich-Koba. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tickets Moscow Crimea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54721/2143889.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of the historical sights, the hunting house of Prince Yusupov is most popular.  It was built in 1908 at the request of the prince's mother.  And you can get to the Grand Canyon along the Yusupov trail, it is easy and comfortable to go along it, it is difficult to get lost, as there are special marks throughout the trail. </p><h2>  Eagle Flight and Boar Pass </h2><p>  Another interesting place that the estate workers advise to visit is the Eagle Flight plateau.  The plateau got such a telling name because it was chosen by these graceful predators.  Getting to the plateau from the village of Sokolinoe is very easy, they are only 2 km away. </p><p>  You can enjoy the picturesque views and the mountain serpentine after breaking the Bicske pass.  Its other name is Kabaniy Pass, opinions about the origin of this name differ.  Some argue that wild boars live in these places, in whose honor the pass was named, and someone compares a mountain road with a pig's tail.  In the old days, caravans, merchants, and merchants traveling from the <span>Principality of Theodoro</span> to the <span>Baydar Valley</span> and back used this road. </p><p>  To the east of the village is the mystical mountain range Boyko, which travelers called the Crimean Shambhala for the strange things that are happening here.  It is more difficult to get to it than to the rest of the sights, the road leading to the mountain runs through the Grand Canyon, and therefore only submits to avid tourists.  But not very prepared travelers can visit the Karagol canyon: 5 km along an easy-to-walk trail, and you will find yourself in a completely different world with a fantastic landscape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tickets Moscow Crimea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2144239.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A large military base is located on Mount Beden-Kir, whose buildings resemble an observatory rather like eggs of a huge bird, which made a nest in a quiet comfortable place.  These modern buildings successfully fit into the landscape and dilute the natural beauty, they should certainly be seen by connoisseurs of modern architecture. </p><h2>  The number of rooms of the estate </h2><p>  Guests at the Kutler Hotel in Sokolin can choose the right room for a romantic break with a soul mate or for a vacation with a large family.
