    <p>  Thailand is very popular among tourists from all over the world.  For example, Phuket in December is a great place for a fun beach holiday, especially if you want to escape from the winter cold.  So what do travelers say about this hotel?  Is it worth it to stop?  Of course, yes.  This is the perfect place to spend an unforgettable vacation. </p><p>  The territory here is very beautiful, the rooms are spacious, all the appliances in the rooms are working, and there is constant water in the bathroom.  Everything here shines with cleanliness, as maids clean every day, and do their job very well.  By the way, all employees are polite and good-natured, ready to help with any problem - conflicts almost never arise.  As for nutrition, the breakfast is hearty, but slightly monotonous.  You can have lunch and dinner both at the hotel (they cook deliciously here) and outside it (find something cheaper). </p><p>  An undoubted advantage is the proximity to the sea - the beach is very clean, and the sea is almost always calm.  There is another reason why tourists love Thailand (Phuket).  Trips here are relatively cheap, which, of course, can be considered an advantage. </p>
