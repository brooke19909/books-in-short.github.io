On the territory and in the immediate vicinity of the resort there are several good hotels.  Further we will talk about the most popular of them. </p><h2>  Dragos del sur </h2><p>  Puerto de Santiago (Tenerife) features free WiFi throughout the property.  Breakfast is buffet style.  There is a pool, air-conditioned rooms, non-smoking rooms, family rooms.  The hotel has three stars.  All furniture is new, there is a small kitchen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onthebeach.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tours of tenerife from puerto de santiago" class="if uuid-2563848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2563848.jpg"></div><p>  For guests arriving by car, there is free parking.  Within walking distance are cafes and bars, shops. </p><h2>  Globales Tamaimo Tropical </h2><p>  First, the pros and cons.  The positive reviews of Puerto de Santiago (Tenerife) include the fact that this is one of the cheapest hotels in the resort.  Each room has a kettle, fridge, microwave and kitchenware.  Great animators work with guests.  There is a car rental near the hotel, which is very convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onthebeach.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puerto de Santiago Tenerife Attractions" class="if uuid-2563853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2563853.jpg"></div><p>  Cons: in the rooms there is no air conditioning, there is only a regular fan.  There is no beach in the immediate vicinity, the ocean is very far to go.  If you have valuables with you, you can only put them in storage in paid safes.  Free Wi-Fi practically does not work, but paid catches well, but it is not cheap.  It is difficult to find a free place in the hotel for parking a car. </p><h2>  Blue sea lagos de cesar </h2><p>  From the airport to this hotel can be reached in an hour.  It is worth saying a little about this hotel.  Check-in to the rooms is very quick yet, and deliciously feed at the same time.  The staff is smiling and friendly, trying to help vacationers on any issues.  The food, although not very diverse, but very tasty.  Furniture, although not the newest, is in good condition.  The ocean and beaches are within walking distance, walk no more than five minutes.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket and a stop. </p><h2>  Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife </h2><p>  To begin with, if you are going to relax here with older children, then you will find a surprise.  Most rooms, with the exception of superior rooms, do not have a bathroom.  So if you are not ready to take a bath, or smear with sunblock in the presence of your matured children, you need to be very careful about choosing a room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyage-prive.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel and pool" class="if uuid-2563855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2563855.jpg"></div><p>  Otherwise, the hotel has many positive aspects.  The rooms are very spacious, comfortable mattresses, good cosmetic sets in the bathroom, helpful staff, excellent restaurants (albeit quite expensive).  Live music is pleasing, which plays not only in the evening, but also throughout the day.  Absolutely amazing bar on the 16th floor.  Of the minuses: </p><ul><li>  next to the hotel is a large construction site, which greatly spoils the view and creates noise; </li><li>  music in the lobby plays late and prevents you from going to bed early; </li><li>  minor flaws in the room, for example, the complete absence of hooks in the bathroom; </li><li>  lack of a beach with access to the ocean and unrealistically dirty water near the shore. </li></ul>
