  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work insurance and pension: how to prove how to calculate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Work (insurance) experience determines the amount of state payments to citizens of the country when they need them: temporary disability, sick leave, pension, child care.  The essence of such a state policy is that everyone in need should receive support, but to a greater extent it will be received by those who really deserve it through their continuous activities for the good of the state. </p><p>  Hence, the more experience, the better.  However, the law determines a lot of nuances.  If you change jobs, has your work experience been interrupted?  How is the total length of service calculated?  Is it important that he was on a profile, a specialty or not? </p><p>  <strong>The concept</strong> </p><p>  To begin with, what exactly the law puts into the concept of ‚Äú <em>insurance experience</em> ‚Äù.  These are periods of work when your employer makes contributions to your local <span>pension fund</span> from your salary <span>.</span>  It‚Äôs worth making a reservation right away, your work experience will cease to be calculated if you are employed informally or arranged, but the employer (for whatever reasons only he knows) does not make contributions to the PF.  Even if he is caught, by law he is only obliged to pay a fine for such a violation, but not all of the deductions that should have been on your personal account in a pension fund. </p><p>  They also single out the concept of ‚Äú <em>special insurance experience</em> ‚Äù, thanks to which an employee can retire ahead of time (according to the law: men - 60, women - 55).  For example, work in the Far North and other (special working conditions) until 1.01.02.  After this date, work with special conditions is not taken into account.  This is the new legislation on the pensions of Russian citizens.  This policy can be called economical, and it is associated with a lack of funds for the provision of pensions to future pensioners. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>How to count?</strong> </p><p>  The calculation of the insurance period is made by adding up the periods of labor activity, with the exception of the period of study (if it was previously taken into account, now it is not).  But the seniority includes the period of military service, if before it a citizen worked officially.  It also includes a period of caring for a child up to 1.5 years of age, receiving <span>temporary disability benefits.</span>  If you lost your job and couldn‚Äôt find another one by profession, you can get unemployed status in the employment center, and with it the allowance, until you find a more or less suitable place of work.  This period is also part of the experience.  There are more rare cases when your activity can be considered socially useful - caring for a disabled person.  Or the period of justified ‚Äúunemployment‚Äù - bringing to justice of the innocent (if proved).  Full months and years are taken into account. </p><p>  <strong>How to confirm?</strong> </p><p>  The insurance experience is confirmed by entries in the work book.  A lost book can be replaced by a job order, an employment contract, payroll deductions, statements.  Basically, the data is verified with the <span>personified</span> data <span>of</span> citizens as insured persons.  Such records are kept in local pension funds for each working citizen.  In judicial practice, there have been cases where the experience had to be proved by testimony, since the information was lost due to unforeseen circumstances.  For the calculation of special experience, such indications are not accepted. </p><p>  <strong>What does it affect?</strong> </p><p>  The insurance account is calculated by the accountant of the enterprise every time an employee goes on sick leave to assign payments for temporary incapacity for work.  Also, experience determines the size <span>of unemployment benefits</span> and, of course, pensions. </p><p>  <strong>What pension awaits you?</strong> </p><p>  And now the main question: how much do you need to work out to get a decent pension?  A minimum of 5 years of work (namely, insurance experience!) Will provide you with the same old-age pension payment - a living wage.  And if you have worked much more, the pension will be calculated as follows.  About 3 thousand rubles - this is the basic size of the PPP (insurance part of the pension);  plus the ratio of payments to the pension fund for the number of months during which the state agrees to accrue a pension (228 months have been established for today).  Moreover, the amount of contributions in this formula is modified by the time the pension is accrued (inflation and other points are taken into account).  In any case, the pension will depend on the average wage.  Therefore, if the periods of work coincide (2 jobs), choose the one where the official salary was higher for submission to the Pension Fund.  The funded part is added to the pension (those accumulations that you yourself contributed).  So you can get about 7 thousand (with experience of 15 years and in the absence of accumulation).  And with savings - 8 thousand. These calculations are rather crude, but should help the reader to navigate the pension system of Russia and the requirements for seniority ... </p>
