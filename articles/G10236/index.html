    <h2>  The first investment swallows </h2><p>  The very first reviews of Malta Private Investment appeared on February 26 of this year.  Most users liked the beautiful site, the accessible menu and the intuitive interface.  According to them, there was nothing superfluous in it.  And the simplicity of navigation made it easy for beginners to quickly understand the features of depositing money.  And, of course, many were attracted by the long-playing investment plans of the company and the opportunity to return the invested funds after 20 working days. </p>

    <h2>  Strange discrepancies in dates </h2><p>  When the organization’s website was still working, it was possible to read on it what kind of activity Malta Private Investment Ltd. was engaged in.  Based on those data, the organization passed real registration in Malta, where it was registered at: Dragonara Road, St Julian's STJ 3140. In confirmation of this, the site contained a license and a sample agreement, which everyone could easily read.  If necessary, it was possible to download the contract itself.  But, according to users' stories, there were completely no signs of printing on it and no contacts were indicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most interesting thing is that the company was registered in August 2013, and appeared on the domestic market in 2016.  This begs the question, where was this company for three years.  It is possible that it already existed on the Web, but under a completely different name.  But this is only an assumption based on user reviews. </p>

    <h2>  Regarding ease of use </h2><p>  According to user stories, the administration of Malta Private Investment (reviews about this organization were initially exclusively positive) very actively answered questions and quickly responded to emerging problems.  The site itself was translated into two languages: English and Russian.  The organization’s contacts also included communication telephones. </p><p>  The management of the company, as investors say, preferred not to show up.  It did not lead a social lifestyle, did not organize seminars.  They did not have pages on social networks, and on the YouTube channel there was only a couple of video materials. </p>

    <h2>  Delicious offers for customers </h2><p>  A beautiful website, an intuitive menu, and a Russian-language interface are just a small set of tools designed to attract customers.  However, the cherry on the cake was an interesting proposal for investment, which made many investors think.  In particular, Malta Private Investment (prospects <em> </em>  cooperation with this company was promising) offered a single contribution with daily capitalization.  So, the creators of the site promised a profit in the range of 0.75% per day and 16.5% per month. </p><p>  The minimum investment amount also did not bite and amounted to only $ 10 or 500 rubles.  It was possible to withdraw earned money exactly 20 days later.  And if you wish, you could use the extension of the deposit and extend it for an equivalent period.  Isn't it a miracle? </p><h2>  Positive moments in the site </h2><p>  Of the advantages of working with a company’s resource, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  availability of informational basis and ease of use (availability of a personal account, clear menu); </li><li>  Russian language interface; </li><li>  steady growth in popularity on the web; </li><li>  moderation in advertising and marketing policy; </li><li>  short term deposit; </li><li>  the ability to work with several types of currencies (for example, it was possible to invest part of the money in rubles and another in US dollars); </li><li>  rapid administration response; </li><li>  the presence of an online calculator for calculating the yield of a deposit; </li><li>  quick withdrawal of funds, etc. </li></ul><p>  By the way, the withdrawal of funds took place in just an hour or could stretch for 5 working days. </p><h2>  Negative points in collaboration </h2><p>  Among the negative aspects of cooperation with the company, perhaps, we can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  stealth management; </li><li>  lack of any contacts for communication (besides virtual administration); </li><li>  lack of representation in the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  In a word, after the company ceased to exist and disappeared from the Internet, there is nowhere to send complaints to deceived investors. </p><h2>  Malta Private Investment: cheating </h2><p>  Using the successful offers of the company, many investors have invested their money in the hope of making money.  According to the stories of many of them, initially the site regularly paid.  For the same reason, only screenshots and stories about successful payments were found among the reviews.  Later, the company stopped paying dividends, began to delay payments and limited the time for withdrawing cash.  And even then, for many investors, this was the first signal that the company was preparing for a phased departure. </p><p>  However, literally not all users perceived conditional signals.  Many of them continued to patiently expect their passive income and did not suspect anything.  And recently, the company’s website has stopped responding.  It is currently not working.  You cannot contact the administration.  Invested funds, as well as the accrued interest on them, are also impossible to withdraw.  And so Malta Private Investment closed.  Reviews <em> </em>  investment lovers from this time began to flow smoothly into a negative channel.  Many users desperately tried to find a connection with the organization in order to return their investment.  Others spoke poorly about the company and called the creators of the site deceivers and scammers. </p><h2>  Opinions of specialists about the company </h2><p>  According to many experts, the activity of this company repeats the story of the financial pyramid.  Recall that when participating in this scam, depositors are also offered to receive passive income at higher tariffs.  Initially, similar firms are gaining momentum, accepting deposits and paying dividends.  But later, when a cycle of so-called saturation occurs, the pyramid bursts, and the one who did not manage to withdraw money from it remains with its nose.  Therefore, if you participate in such projects, experts say, manage to stop in time and invest only the amount that would be uncritical to lose, or do not invest in them at all. </p>
