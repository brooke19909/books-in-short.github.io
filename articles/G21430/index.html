This is a protected area with picturesque landscapes, eternal glaciers, <span>alpine meadows,</span> coniferous oak forests, <span>bright blue lakes</span> and stormy crystal clear rivers. </p><h2>  Alberta Banff National Park - History </h2><p>  For a long time, the ancient tribes of the Indians lived on the site where the park is located - the Sarsi, Stony, Kutenai, Cain, Siksik.  After the appearance of Europeans, the territory began to be developed, the first railway appeared.  After the completion of its construction, the government allocated a small territory, in which there were hot springs and a cave.  Here it was decided to create a public park.  Two years later, it expanded significantly and was called the Rocky Mountains Park. </p><p>  The rich Europeans who arrived in Canada liked the park.  Wealthy American travelers began mountain climbing in the Rockies under the guidance of local instructors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="banff national park" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/840303.jpg" width="484"></div>

In 1923, the first motorway appeared here that connected Banff National Park with <span>British Columbia.</span>  By that time, the territory of the park was still expanded.  It included Lake Louise, the Bow River, Red Deer and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Banff National Park Photo" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/840304.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  Rivers </h2><p>  Nat  Banff Park is crossed by the Bow River.  It is distinguished by ice water and a very fast flow.  Tourists with experience do not miss the opportunity to ride it in a canoe.  This journey becomes a real adventure, but you must be very careful and, of course, have some experience in such alloys - very cold water, trees that hang over the river itself can be dangerous. </p><h2>  Sulfur springs </h2><p>  From this place, called the Cave and Basin National Historic site, the history of the park began.  Here are the hot sulfur springs.  A real Canadian bathhouse was built nearby (in 1887).  These healing sources were discovered by railway builders.  This served as the main argument in favor of the opening of the national park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many tourists claim that here is a real museum.  Banff is a park where nature has reached the peak of its perfection.  The combination of the beauties of the most picturesque waterfalls, valleys, canyons, mountains and forests for life remains in memory, and the unusual fresh air delights. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  In addition to natural beauties, visitors to the park can admire the animals that inhabit this territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="banff park canada" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/840310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  These are deer, moose, bears.  It is interesting that they are not at all afraid of a person, and they themselves are not a danger to guests.  For several decades of the existence of the national park, they are completely weaned from shooting and hunting.  Therefore, people are friendly.  A striking fact is that when tourists accidentally meet a bloodthirsty and formidable grizzly in the forest, the bear never attacks. </p><p>  Nevertheless, some caution must be observed.  In most national parks, the main cause of tourist injuries is animal attacks.  In Banff, look around before getting out of the car.  When you see a wolf, cougar or coyote, do not approach them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Banff National Park Alberta" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/840311.jpg" width="300"></div>
