Clean air in combination with local scenic views allows you to forget about all the existing problems and enjoy your vacation.  When choosing from a large number of recreational facilities, pay attention to the price and quality of the proposed vacation. </p><h2>  Kryvyi Rih - where is it? </h2><p>  Kryvyi Rih, whose camp sites are famous in Ukraine and the former CIS countries, is located in the Dnipropetrovsk region.  About 640 thousand people live in it, it is here that the development of iron ore deposits is carried out.  The city often hosts various exhibitions, concerts and expositions.  In summer, performances of various musical groups, as well as open-air festivals take place. </p><p>  The city has been destroyed and rebuilt several times in its history, now its total area is more than 410 kilometers and continues to increase.  In the summer it is very hot and arid, so many residents go to camp sites and numerous beaches.  The average summer temperature is 24-26 degrees Celsius, while the amount of precipitation is very limited.  The absolute maximum reached here by temperature is 40.3 degrees Celsius. </p><h2>  "Brigantine" </h2><p>  Campsites of Krivoy Rog, whose photos captivate and attract attention, mainly work in the summer.  This also applies to an institution called the "Brigantine", located near the Karachunovsky reservoir.  Having traveled only 20 kilometers from the regional capital, you will find yourself in a stunningly picturesque place where you can lie on the beach, ride a catamaran, fry kebabs, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  You can get to this camp site by your own car or by using the minibus number 408, which connects Krivoy Rog with the city of Valovoye.  If you use the second option, you will need to go in front of the bridge leading to Kudashevo, and then walk a few meters.  The cost of rest at this camp site is approximately from 100 to 800 rubles per day (depending on the chosen house and a range of services). </p><h2>  "Ruby" </h2><p>  If you want to relax and save money, go to Krivoy Rog.  The hostels located near the city will pleasantly surprise you with the price-quality ratio.  In particular, we are talking about the Rubin base, where you can find rooms of various formats: economy, luxury, etc. The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe recreational institution is almost two hectares, holidays and large events are often organized there. </p>

    <p>  Here, vacationers can take advantage of a large dining room, a Russian bath, a sports ground, gazebos and all other infrastructure.  Two piers function: one is for swimming, and the other is for fishing.  There is a private kitchen where you can leave food in the fridges, there are also gas stoves, sinks, and water is supplied from the well.  The cost of living is from 150 to 1500 rubles per day, here you can also relax with animals, but you will have to pay extra for each day they are near you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Spring" </h2><p>  When choosing a place to stay, pay attention to small private camp sites.  Kryvyi Rih is known for the fact that there are few such institutions here, but all of them are very popular.  In particular, we are talking about a complex called "Spring".  The hostel also operates only in the summertime, while the cost of living is from 50 to 300 rubles per day, the cheapest way is to take a bed in a dormitory room. </p>

    <p>  This recreational institution is suitable for those who want to enjoy a relaxing holiday, there are no cultural events here, and each vacationer is left to his own devices.  There is a sports ground on the territory of the base, a beach and a pier are located nearby, from which you can fish.  In a word, here the price corresponds to the offered quality. </p><h2>  Yacht Club </h2><p>  If you are planning to organize your vacation in Krivoy Rog, camp sites may not be suitable.  Then be sure to look at the Scarlet Sails yacht club, which is located on the Karachunovsky reservoir.  It offers vacationers small yachts that can be used only during navigation, in winter the base does not work. </p>

    <p>  In addition to yachts and related equipment, you can rent a small house here at relatively low prices.  However, the institution has a small drawback: since it is a yacht club, there are no other entertainments here.  However, if you prefer a relaxing holiday and are ready to spend it on the shore of the reservoir, watching the competitions of yachtsmen, then this place will be ideal for you. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  One of the few places in Ukraine, where it is very close to the urban area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camp site, is Krivoy Rog.  Reviews of these facilities will help you get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhether to relax there or not.  Basically, those who have been to these parts speak positively of local camp sites.  Very often people note low prices that are available to everyone.  The service is provided with the highest quality possible, which cannot but rejoice. </p>

    <p>  As a wish, many guests express the view that it is necessary to expand the entertainment program.  Not all vacationers like to spend time in rooms or in the fresh air, watching how others have fun.  They want to be able to go on an excursion, spend time in a bar or, for example, in karaoke.  Vacationers also note that some camp sites have long been in need of repair, at least cosmetic.  The management of organizations is trying to maintain order and cleanliness at the proper level, some of them plan to carry out major repairs in the near future. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you want to visit Kryvyi Rih, camp sites located near the city can be a real discovery for you.  Clean air, sunbathing, a reservoir and a high-quality range of travel services will help you forget about all the problems.  Low prices for vacations are the main advantage of these recreational facilities, but it is best to specify them in advance, as they can change. </p><p>  Please also note that the camps near Kryvyi Rih for the most part do not offer transfer services, that is, you will have to get there on your own using minibuses or a regular taxi.  Therefore, it is best to specify in advance which vehicle you will have to use. </p>
