Koba Dzhugashvili is a thief, a criminal authority, who later became the leader of the Soviet people.  A kind of Robin Hood, raising money for the party.  This version has recently been very common.  There is a percentage of truth in it, but very small. </p>

    <h2>  Who is Koba Dzhugashvili </h2><p>  This is a man who inspired mystical fear throughout the world.  He was the greatest criminal, dictator, and, as Churchill said, ‚Äúan unshakable commander.‚Äù </p><p>  For thirty years, Soviet citizens looked with trepidation at the photo of Koba Dzhugashvili.  The political nickname "Stalin" has become the most important word for every resident of the USSR.  It sounded on the radio, rattled in songs, was invariably present on the pages of newspapers. </p><p>  Koba Dzhugashvili is a person who, having Georgian origin, became the personification of <span>Great Russian chauvinism.</span>  In his youth, he joined the Bolsheviks, and here, slowly, gradually made a career.  At first he was not taken seriously.  Koba Dzhugashvili performed extremely dirty work, including obtaining the necessary money for the party illegally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The revolutionaries of the first wave too late recognized in him a force capable of destroying everything that could interfere with his ascent to the political Olympus.  After all, he was only Koba Dzhugashvili.  Stalin appeared later and, in fact, had little in common with the son of a shoemaker from the Georgian city of Gori. </p><p>  So what is Koba Dzhugashvili?  Koba is a revolutionary nickname.  Dzhugashvili is the surname of a man who was born in 1879, the son of a peasant alcoholic who systematically beat his wife and son.  And also a politician who made a lasting impression on Churchill in 1945 and called Roosevelt "the good uncle Joe."  Koba Dzhugashvili - Joseph Stalin.  However, the following is not about the Generalissimo of the Soviet Union.  Here are the facts from the biography of Koba Dzhugashvili - a revolutionary and a failed priest. </p>

    <h2>  The mystery of Stalin </h2><p>  He plunged his life into impenetrable darkness.  Books about Stalin's childhood and youth began to appear relatively recently.  For many years he was a legend, a symbol of repression, persecution and the era of the camps.  Joseph Stalin personally supervised the regular cleaning of archives.  He surrounded with secrecy everything that in any way related to the early period of his biography.  But even today's researchers, gaining access to once-closed materials, face a mystery.  Dzhugashvili is the most mystical and controversial person in Russian history. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unwritten play about Kobe </h2><p>  Stalin greatly respected the work of good writers, especially those whose works were banned.  He watched the White Guard eight times.  Once, the director of the Art Theater came to Mikhail Bulgakov and offered to write a dramatic work for the anniversary of the ‚Äúleader‚Äù.  The writer hesitated for a while, but nevertheless agreed.  Thus was created a romantic work about young Kobe.  He was received at the theater, officials were delighted.  However, Stalin later banned this work. </p><p>  Who was the customer of the play Dzhugashvili?  Of course, the hero himself of this work.  He later banned the work on the play.  Why did Stalin change his mind?  The fact is that Bulgakov, starting work on this work, did not have any materials.  In Moscow, they simply did not exist.  Then he gathered in Georgia, to the homeland of Dzhugashvili.  Before Bulgakov left Moscow, he received a telegram: ‚ÄúThe need has disappeared.  Come back. " </p><p>  In the thirties there was such a director - Petr Pavlenko.  He made films mainly about Stalin.  One day, a colleague asked him: ‚ÄúWhy don't you make a film about young Stalin?‚Äù  The director harshly cut short his interlocutor and uttered a remarkable phrase: "You should not talk about the sun when it has not yet risen."  Something in childhood and adolescence Dzhugashvili did not fit into the image of the "great leader." </p>

    <h2>  Soso </h2><p>  Stalin did not want to disclose the history of the revolutionary Koba.  After becoming Secretary General, he changed a lot in his biography, including his date of birth.  What could modern historians - researchers with the opportunity to express an independent point of view - learn? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, according to official figures, Joseph Dzhugashvili was born on December 9, 1879.  It was probably no coincidence that he wore boots all his life.  Stalin's father worked for many years at a tannery.  Soso was a weak, painful child.  Catherine, the wife of a shoemaker, always dreamed that her son would become a priest. </p><p>  The family lived not far from the Russian barracks, and perhaps that is why peers called Soso "Russian."  The hero of our story never loved his historical homeland.  About what Georgia is, many years later he said this: "a small territory of Russia." </p>

    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  There is a version that his own father was not an illiterate shoemaker who beat his wife in a drunken stupor, but a certain traveler Przhevalsky.  This man really came to Gori in the late seventies.  His portrait can be found in any encyclopedia.  And this portrait depicts a face suspiciously similar to the face of Joseph Vissarionovich. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that conversations took place before 1953.  That is, when every <span>sane person was</span> afraid to utter an extra word about the ‚Äúleader‚Äù <span>.</span>  Perhaps Stalin approved of such rumors.  He hated his drunken father, in addition, he wanted to have a more noble relative.  After the death of Stalin, even more versions of his origin arose.  According to some historians, all this is nothing more than rumors.  The secretary general's father was a simple shoemaker, and the day laborer was his mother. </p>

    <h2>  Hatred </h2><p>  Beso, that was the name of the villagers of Father Soso, booted boots, drank vodka and beat his wife.  Over time, Catherine learned to repulse a drunken husband.  Beso did not come to terms with this and left for Tiflis.  Mother and son were left alone.  The woman passionately loved her son, but the only method she used in his upbringing was punishment.  Joseph at an early age understood a simple truth: in order to achieve his goal, he had to beat.  By the way, Catherine's son disappointed.  After all, he never became a priest. </p><p>  From an early age, Joseph accumulated resentment for his mother.  The work of the day laborer is difficult and ungrateful.  The woman worked from morning to dawn in order to give her only and beloved son everything in her power.  Poverty, perpetual malnutrition and morbid vanity in the boy gave rise to hatred primarily of wealthy merchants.  And among them there were exclusively Jews in Gori. </p>

    <h2>  Theological Seminary </h2><p>  In 1888, the dream of the mother of our hero came true.  Joseph entered the spiritual school.  Then there was the Tiflis seminary.  Future Stalin was a diligent student.  While his mother cleaned him in the homes of wealthy Jews, he worked diligently.  But, as you know, he did not become a priest.  During the years of study, Dzhugashvili became acquainted with Marxism.  He later joined an underground revolutionary group.  In 1931, responding to questions from the German writer Emil Ludwig, Stalin said that he sought opposition from the strict regime that reigned in the seminary. </p><p>  In the fifth year of study, Joseph Dzhugashvili suddenly did not appear for exams, for which he was expelled.  After that, he worked for some time as a tutor.  In 1899 he was admitted to the Tiflis Observatory. </p>

    <h2>  Revolution </h2><p>  Dzhugashvili joined the Bolsheviks back in 1903.  He took part in organizing a strike of workers in Baku.  In 1905, he first met with Lenin.  These people were completely different from each other.  One was the son of a state councilor, a hereditary nobleman.  Another is the son of a drunken shoemaker, suffering from poverty and humiliation since childhood.  But at the same time, they had a lot in common.  Not only the desire for revolutionary activity, but, oddly enough, poetry, love in literature.  Lenin was read by Turgenev.  Stalin admired the work of banned writers.  Moreover, in his youth he wrote poetry. </p>

    <h2>  Koba </h2><p>  Dzhugashvili, as a true revolutionary, more than once found himself in exile.  The name "Stalin" appeared in 1912.  By that time, he had already become a pretty famous personality in revolutionary circles.  Dzhugashvili more than once justified Lenin's confidence.  He took part in provocative actions, bank robberies.  Dzhugashvili was personally introduced into the Central Committee by Lenin.  He was elected Secretary General in 1922.  From this moment, Joseph Dzhugashvili begins to gradually get rid of his former associates, many of whom once, back in 1912, saw in Kobe just an upstart. </p>
