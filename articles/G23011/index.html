  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hitler's favorite car (photo)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Adolf Hitler is known throughout the world as a dictator of the Third Reich.  He commanded the armed forces during World War II.  There were always many secrets and gossip around this German politician.  But special interest was always aroused by Hitler's favorite car, on which he traveled almost half the world.  It is known that he was even lost for a while, and then again found. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  <span>Hitler's</span> favorite <span>car</span> has a rather interesting story.  So, for the first time the Mercedes model was introduced in 1938 as a new generation car.  The car was so luxurious that it was simply impossible not to love it.  Adolf Hitler also liked the model, and the Reich Chancellor immediately wished to purchase it, despite the fact that this car was the most expensive at that time. </p><p>  All spare parts for the vehicle were made in duplicate, so that the car did not stop on the road for a long time.  In addition, Hitler's car, a photo of which is in this article, could easily be transformed from a limousine to a convertible and vice versa.  The Reich Chancellor liked the car so much that exactly one year later he demanded to make several more models for his subordinates. </p><h2>  Machine description </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mercedes Hitler" class="if uuid-3150092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27807/3150092.jpg"></div><p>  Mercedes-Benz 770K cost about 40 thousand Reichsmarks.  Not a single car had such a high price.  Due to the fact that Hitler constantly drove precisely on this car, they began to call it ‚ÄúHitler-Wagen‚Äù.  It was on it that the politician traveled from Berlin to Tashkent, and from there to Russia, then returned to his homeland, and then again to Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mercedes was not only the most expensive car, but also fast and, most importantly, heavy.  The latter characteristic was justified by the fact that the armor of such vehicles was still far from ideal.  The car body is designed so that the passenger did not need to worry about anything.  And the windows of Mercedes were not only armored, but also had a thickness of at least 5 centimeters. </p><p>  The engineers thought everything through so much that they placed not only the armored back, but also spare wheels, which also had the function of armor.  That is why Hitler rode so quietly among the soldiers and could even drive close to them.  However, he tried not to leave his car, as he reliably protected him from bullets and any attempts. </p><p>  Hitler's personal car, at the request of his driver, was also changed in driving functions.  So that at any moment, for example, during an attack, you could immediately leave immediately.  But nevertheless, this transport also had an unprotected place - an open top. </p><p>  On this transport, which had an engine capacity of 7.7 liters and a horsepower of 230 horsepower, the leader of Nazi Germany always went to ceremonial parades.  There are photographs that were taken in the part of Russia occupied by the Nazis.  But at the same time, his beloved car was not "military", for this there were other Adolf Hitler cars. </p><h2>  Chancellor's cars </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's car, photo" class="if uuid-3149304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116946/3149304.jpg"></div><p>  So, there are cases when the leader of Nazi Germany came to the occupied territories on the sports Horch 930, which was considered a favorite military vehicle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There were other cars used by Adolf Hitler.  For example, Maybach SW35.  Its manufacturer was a friend of the Reich Chancellor, so a new engine was developed for him and the design was updated.  The release of this model was also limited. </p><p>  Another favorite transport of the Nazi German leader was Volkswagen K√§fer.  It was very practical and very inexpensive.  If other cars could be purchased only by senior German officials, then such a car was affordable for any German. </p><p>  In addition, the collection of Hitler was also a Mercedes-Benz G4, which had six wheels.  The interior of the car was quite roomy.  Another car - Mercedes-Benz 24/100/140 PS - was donated to Hitler Ginderburg, the Reich President of Germany.  But the vehicle did not like the Reich Chancellor, and he quickly changed it.  There was also a Bell car in the garage. </p><h2>  Attempts to change the name </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adolf Hitler Cars" class="if uuid-3149324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116946/3149324.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that Hitler‚Äôs favorite car is Mercedes, the leader of the Nazi Germany did not like the name of the company.  He believed that the name of the new type was given to women, and even Hebrew.  Therefore, he did not like it.  He certainly demanded that the company be given a different name, but soon found out that in Spanish the word ‚Äúgrace‚Äù is translated.  Germany had excellent relations with Spain, so the Reich Chancellor no longer required renaming. </p><h2>  The fate of Reich Chancellor‚Äôs favorite car </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's favorite car" class="if uuid-3149031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116946/3149031.jpg"></div><p>  It is known that after some time Hitler‚Äôs car was donated to Pavelic, the Croatian dictator.  But when Croatia was liberated and another person came to power, this car was first nationalized, and then it was presented to Stalin. </p><p>  For a long time, Hitler's car stood in the garage like a trophy.  Joseph Vissarionovich did not ride it, Stalin's limousine was no worse than Hitler's car.  So that the trophy would not stand idle, Stalin presented the Mercedes to the Secretary of Uzbekistan.  But in this country, he did not stay long: spare parts for him could not be obtained.  Then he presented this car to his driver, who decided to make Soviet transport out of it.  He not only replaced all the parts in it, but also turned it into a truck. </p><p>  Hitler‚Äôs favorite car was used now only for agricultural work.  Products on the market for sale were transported on it.  And when he was completely out of order, the new owner of the Mercedes simply threw the car into the steppe, where it stood until 2000.  Only the plates with numbers that are already a bit obliterated from the previous car.  They are currently stored in a special repository. </p><h2>  Car restoration </h2><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's personal car" class="if uuid-3149037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116946/3149037.jpg"></div><p>  In the 2000s, Hitler's car was sought after by a group led by Vadim Zadorozhniy.  Their main goal is the delivery of this transport to Russia.  They wanted to not only track the evolution of the machine, but also get a valuable exhibit.  The delivery process was quite lengthy.  But after the car still ended up in Russia, it turned out that not all the details were in it.  Spare parts were very difficult to find, since there were no more than a hundred of such machines in total. </p><p>  And yet, in some incredible and miraculous way, all the necessary spare parts that were located in different corners of the globe were found and bought.  It took 14 years to fully equip the car.  However, it was only 90% complete.  Currently, Hitler's car is still located at Zadorozhniy, who is engaged in its restoration.  In the world of such machines, there are no more than five. </p><p>  In addition to painting and collecting "native" parts for the car, you will need to further test it in the ride.  If he can travel at least three hundred kilometers, then the restoration was not in vain, and everything was done correctly.  And only after that he will go to the museum. </p>
