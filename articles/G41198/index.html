It is washed by the waters of the Aegean, Ionian and <span>Libyan seas.</span>  Tours to these parts are chosen by those who are interested not only in beach vacations, but also in numerous excursions in Crete.  Locals - the embodiment of hospitality.  Greek cuisine is tasty and satisfying. </p><h2>  Travel Recommendations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="undiscoveredgreece.wanderlust.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea port" class="if uuid-2358130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2358130.jpg"></div><p>  Crete is, without exaggeration, a huge island.  Therefore, traveling from one part of it to another can take a lot of time.  Experienced tourists recommend choosing the location of the hotel when choosing an excursion in Crete.  If it is located to the right of Heraklion, then acquaintance with the sights concentrated on its left side should be postponed.  For this reason, overview programs around the island are rare. </p><p>  Those who have booked a hotel in the central part need not be limited to exploring the Samaria mountain gorge and the Zeus cave complex.  In this case, it is worth spending a little more time and moving away from Malia and Hersonissos. </p><h2>  Interesting near </h2><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The legacy of Venice" class="if uuid-2358129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2358129.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists staying in the eastern regions of the island are offered a variety of excursions in Crete with the following attractions: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Mirabello Bay; </li><li>  palm beach "Wai"; </li><li>  Ierapetra. </li></ul><p>  In the west of the island, travelers can travel to the shores of Lake Kurna, to the areas of Chania and Rethymnon, to the lagoon of Balos.  The central part of Cyprus is traditionally preferred by those who are interested in archaeological and historical monuments of Greece.  The nearest attraction is the ensemble of the Knossos Palace.  In addition, excursion routes in the center of Crete include visits to the ruins of Fest and Grotina. </p><h2>  Guide escort </h2><div class="photo" data-original="serletproject.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete Resorts" class="if uuid-2358131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2358131.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the large distances between the settlements and sights of the island, the choice of individual programs is fraught with considerable expenses.  Traveling in the company of private guides is justified in cases where tourists are interested in the intricacies of the history and life of the island.  There are special programs for such travelers, within the framework of which visitors show Devil's Bay, the village of the dead, El Greco estate, the best tavern in Rethymnon. </p><h2>  Juice itself </h2><p>  To see everything at once, to visit the maximum number of excursions in Crete and Greece, it is recommended to settle in Chania or Rethymnon.  These are large and developed resort cities.  In Heraklion it can be boring, because this is the usual administrative center of the island.  In Agios Nikolaos many become crowded after three days of stay - this is a very small and compact village.  Usually it is visited by tourists staying at the neighboring resorts of Plaka and Elounda. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  There is a choice! </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandinspiration.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Embankment" class="if uuid-2358127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2358127.jpg"></div><p>  A short list of the most popular programs and tours in Crete and Greece: </p><ul><li>  cruise to Santorini island; </li><li>  tour to Elafonissi; </li><li>  Knossos Museum </li><li>  Antique Crete; </li><li>  "Majestic Athens"; </li><li>  "Spinalonga and Agios Nikolaos"; </li><li>  a trip to the lagoon of Balos; </li><li>  "Chania, Kournas, Agriupoli"; </li><li>  acquaintance with Chania; </li><li>  trip to the island of Chrysi; </li><li>  sea ‚Äã‚Äãfishing on a yacht; </li><li>  jeep safari; </li><li>  trekking to Samaria gorge; </li><li>  Pilgrimage tours </li><li>  inspection of the Lassithi plateau and the cave complex of Zeus; </li><li>  "Aquarium, Fodele, Palyany, Heraklion, Knossos." </li></ul><h2>  Boat trip in Santorini </h2><div class="photo" data-original="unnavigated.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wildlife of Crete" class="if uuid-2358132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2358132.jpg"></div><p>  This cruise is designed for one day.
