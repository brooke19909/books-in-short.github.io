    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  It is imperative that the hotel where visitors want to stay is in a favorable location.  That is, not far from the city center, but also in sufficient distance - so that the hotel is quiet and nothing interferes with a relaxing rest and relaxation.  Still very important is the location of the sea nearby.  In principle, while staying in Turkey, it‚Äôs a sin to complain about this, as the sea is within easy reach.  And, of course, it‚Äôs nice when there is where to go for a walk, without going too far from your temporary residence.  So, Infinity <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Turkey)</span> is located right next to the beach.  Near the hotel there are such attractions as the Sarapsa Hani fortress, the square with a tower clock, the Altatinoglu Cultural Park and the Konakli Mosque.  It is to these attractions that visitors pay attention in the first place, since they really are located close. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Complex Features </h2><p>  It should be noted that guests who arrived at Infinity <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> can not worry about the service and level of service, since they really care about their guests.  Both drinks and food in the bars and restaurants of the hotel are included in the price of the booked room.  By the way, one more interesting fact should be noted.  The price even includes some types of entertainment and recreation, taxes and gratuities.  An additional fee may be charged at certain restaurants for meals, for specially ordered dishes or drinks.  The rest is full <span>all inclusive.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Infinity Beach Hotel 4 * apartments are equipped with all modern devices and exclusive amenities.  It should also be noted that all rooms are decorated in an original style and have an interesting design.  This appearance, of course, adds exclusivity to the apartments.  The rooms are equipped with air conditioning, and there is also wireless access to the World Wide Web.  In general, in the apartment there is really everything that you might just need.  <span>A TV, a minibar, a</span> telephone, an electronic light on and off system, and fire alarms are just a small list of the amenities offered.  A service service is working around the clock, so that at any time, guests can turn to hotel staff for help.

    <h2>  Room Options </h2><p>  You should also talk about what accommodation options are available.  There are about a hundred rooms in the hotel‚Äôs room stock, but they are very rarely available.  So if you want to move into this complex, then you should book the apartment a couple of months before the planned date.  So, all rooms are comfortable and modern.  80 out of 100 - standard, accommodation by type 2 + 1 + inf.  Among the eighty rooms, there are 18 apartments with a picturesque view of the sea.  From the rest you can see an equally attractive landscape - it can be a garden, a swimming pool or, in extreme cases, a playground.  If there is a possibility (that is, there are free numbers of one type or another), you can choose the option you like most.  In the luxury apartments there is a 3 + 1 + inf type of accommodation.  Of the twenty rooms - six with sea views, 8 - with a garden landscape, a pool is visible from the windows of the four apartments, and the other two lead to the site.  So, as you can see, there is diversity, and the choice depends only on the preferences of potential guests and the availability of free options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to pay attention to the question regarding how much it will cost to place in certain rooms.  I must say that the Infinity Beach Hotel 4 * hotel has affordable prices.  So, for example, a standard double room will cost 33 thousand rubles per week.  The room, of course, is equipped with everything you need - a balcony, air conditioning, TV, bathroom.  All inclusive, high level of service, a week of paradise relaxation - for only 33,000 rubles for two.  Placing one person in such apartments will cost about 24,000 rubles, so it‚Äôs more profitable to travel together.  When booking, you can indicate your preferences regarding the desired view from the window and beds - it can be two single or one double. </p><h2>  Key nuances </h2><p>  Regarding the reservation, a few points should be noted.  So, the designated check-in time is 14:00.  Leaving is recorded in the afternoon.  Before checking in, guests must leave a deposit - this can be done in cash or by credit card.  You will also need to provide an official identity card, that is, a passport (any other similar document will do).  The minimum age that a potential guest must register for self-registration is 18 years.  Of the nuances that can cause inconvenience to a certain category of people - the fact that the hotel does not allow checking in with animals or guide dogs. </p>

    <h2>  Check in with children </h2><p>  If you want to take a child with you on vacation, then this is the right decision.  The hotel allows children to stay, no matter how old they are.  Moreover, there are discounts on age factors.  For example, if a child is under 12 years old, then he is populated absolutely free.  Also, if the little guest is very young, that is, his age is less than two years, then he will be allocated a crib.  It is also absolutely free, as is his accommodation.  In the event that the child is more than 12, then it will be necessary to pay 70% of the cost of living an adult.  It is worth mentioning that the listed services (that is, the provision of extra beds) must be pre-ordered.  They are not included in the total price, they will need to be paid directly during the stay.  In addition, children on vacation at the Infinity Beach Hotel will be fun and interesting.  There is a playground on site for a great time.  In addition, in Alanya there are many places where you can go with children - for example, numerous amusement parks, dolphinarium, water parks.  And, of course, various cultural and recreational events are regularly held in the city, which will be of interest to both young travelers and their parents. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The administration of the hotel is important that their guests are satisfied with the service.  Indeed, we can say that not all five-star hotels correspond to the level of this complex.  If the guest needs something, he can simply ask the hotel staff his question.  They speak six languages ‚Äã‚Äã- German, French, English, Turkish, Arabic and, which especially attracts the attention of tourists of our country, in Russian.  So visitors, who have some kind of linguistic problems, can not worry - there will be someone to inquire for any reason.  By the way, such an education of staff once again emphasizes the level of service.  In most hotel complexes, workers speak three or four languages, while in Infinity Beach 4 * their number is radically different, and they also speak Russian.  Moreover, if you believe the reviews, which will be discussed later, are pretty good. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  In addition to all of the above, it is worth paying attention to some more features of this hotel.  The hotel offers some other services.  For example, if a person, even while resting, cannot do without a car, he can rent a car directly at the hotel.  If you are afraid to get lost in a foreign country, then you can arrange a transfer from the airport.  There is still a currency exchange on the territory.  Of course, there is a photocopy point (you can also receive a fax) and a laundry room.  The prudent owners of the hotel even placed a souvenir shop on its territory.  It should also be noted the attention of additional services, which include the provision of non-smoking rooms, a separate safe and a wake-up call upon request.  In general, as you can see, they really worry about the quality of rest of the guests.  And this, of course, attracts tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the Alanya Infinity Beach Hotel 4 * as a whole, it is worth noting the attention and comments made by people who have already visited this place.  Undoubtedly, feedback is a very important factor.  After all, people just planning to come to the hotel are interested in knowing the opinions of experienced travelers who have stayed at the Infinity <span>Beach Hotel 4 *.</span>  <span>Reviews are</span> encouraging, it can be said with confidence.  First of all, tourists note the proximity of their own beach - a couple of minutes walk separates the guests of Turkey from the clear sea.  Aesthetes are happy to speak out about the original design of the apartments and claim that it is really nice to be inside - there is no desire to leave the room as soon as possible.  Of course, there is criticism.  Some say that in this place the food is not for everyone, while others, on the contrary, really liked the way the cooks cook in the restaurants and a la carte at the hotel‚Äôs disposal.  Many note a wide variety of alcoholic beverages.  In general, rest at the hotel is a great option for people who value a comfortable and economical vacation and like to spend time at sea and in picturesque places with pleasure.  Judging by the reviews of thyristists, the <span>Alanis Hotel</span> 4 * hotel (Konakli, Antalya) can be compared with it, but this is a topic for a separate article. </p>
