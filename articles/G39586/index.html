However, they will be able to serve for a long time, recalling the donor.  The box in which you present a gift can also be memorable.  So, we decorate the box with our own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  unnecessary sturdy box; </li><li>  photos printed on office paper; </li><li>  pictures on photo paper; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  tracing paper; </li><li>  Scotch. <div class="photo" data-original="www.restorationbeauty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pasting boxes" class="if uuid-3055853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3055853.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Box decor </h2><p>  The decoration of the box begins with the placement of various photographs printed on ordinary A4 office sheets.  You can glue them on ordinary glue, as you like and at any angle, they will serve as a background.  Having glued all 4 sides of the box, bend the extra corners: protruding from the bottom - to the bottom of the box, and from above - inward.  You can decorate the bottom with the same photo or just stick it with a colored sheet of paper. </p><p>  Next, the whole box must be sealed with transparent tracing paper.  It will create the effect of blurry shots, and the background will not attract attention.  After that, decorate the box with pictures printed on photo paper.  In addition, you can decorate it with figures cut out of colored paper. </p><p>  Decorate the box lid in the same way.  Protect the protruding edges with tape. </p><p>  It's just that you can decorate the box with a photo.  This is a great gift wrapping for a birthday, anniversary, wedding anniversary.  In addition, in such a beautiful box you can store photos and postcards - everything that reminds you of the people whose pictures you used to create. </p><h2>  Quick gift decor </h2><p>  If you need to pack a gift, then a box and some wrapping paper will help you.  Agree, unpacking it is more pleasant than looking into a regular gift bag.  There is a certain intrigue in the unpacking of gifts, what is there, behind a bright wrapper. </p><p>  To make a gift box, you will need: </p><ul><li>  box; </li><li>  wrapping paper; </li><li>  Scotch; </li><li>  colored paper; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  scissors. <div class="photo" data-original="www.caughtonawhim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box decoration at home" class="if uuid-3055855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3055855.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Decorate the box with your own hands </h2><p>  Unroll and fold the wrapping paper onto the floor.  Place the shoe box in the center of the line.  Choose a paper size so that it more than wrapped the box and bent inward.  So that the latter does not slip during operation, and the wrapping paper is well held, secure its bottom with double-sided tape.  Cut the corners of the paper.  Wrap the box.  You can also stick pieces of double-sided tape on the sides to make the paper sit denser. </p><p>  Next, we <span>decorate the box with our own hands.</span>  Cut out several geometric shapes from colored paper, such as hearts, balls, and stars.  Next, cut the thread and glue paper figures on PVA glue or hot glue at different distances from each other.  Gently wrap the box around the box. </p><p>  It looks simple and gorgeous.  How nice it will be to receive a gift in such an interesting box. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caughtonawhim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY box" class="if uuid-3055854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3055854.jpg"></div><h2>  Soft box </h2><p>  And in this you can store not only every little thing.  It can be placed in a closet and store various things.  To decorate the box you will need: </p><ul><li>  box; </li><li>  the cloth; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  Yes, it will take a minimum of material, a minimum of effort and a minimum of time to create.  Let's see how to decorate the box with a cloth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box for little things" class="if uuid-3055881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3055881.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoration </h2><p>  Measure the height of the box with a ruler.  Then place it on a piece of fabric, stepping back from the edges of the height that you measured, and another 2-3 centimeters.  Circle the bottom of the box.  Alternately apply the sides to the walls and mark the edges and 2-3 cm of the margin. </p><p>  At the intersection of lines in the corners, make small indents and draw lines with a dotted line.  Cut the part along the lines. </p><p>  Lubricate the box with plenty of glue.  PVA is best suited for these purposes.  Gently glue the fabric to the box, paying special attention to working on corners.  First glue the segments that were marked with a dotted line, and then the walls completely.  So you will not have corners bare. </p><p>  Decorate the box lid in the same way.  On the inside of the edge you can decorate with a satin ribbon - it will hide all the irregularities of the work and complement the overall look. </p><p>  Next, we decorate the box with our own hands at our discretion: use artificial flowers, ribbons, lace, knitted elements and so on. </p><p>  This is how you can get a tender, soft box.  It will serve as an original gift wrapping for your friends and relatives or a cute room decor in which you can hide various little things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freepik.adobe.vip" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to decorate a cardboard box" class="if uuid-3055865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3055865.jpg"></div><p>  These are the options for decorating DIY storage boxes we can offer you.
