    <h2>  Visual component </h2><p>  <span>A small phone looks unusual and even somewhat vintage.</span>  <span>Of its entire model range, it is considered the most practical in size - only 60 millimeters wide, 109 high and 14 in thickness.</span>  <span>And this with a weight of 122 grams.</span>  <span>And comfortably in the hand, and in the pocket does not interfere.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>On the front of the device, in addition to the keyboard, which we will talk about later, there is a screen, a speaker (under which the logo appears) and a small diode that responds to messages and reminds you of the need to charge the phone.</span> </p><p>  <span>At the back, in addition to the charming cover, the camera and the flash are clearly visible.</span>  <span>By the way, the logo is duplicated there.</span>  <span>Nothing more.</span> </p><p>  <span>As for everything else, it is rationally located on the side faces of the device.</span>  <span>Why rational?</span>  <span>Because it‚Äôs ingenious to place the connector under the charger and a standard headset, because dust and debris will clog less.</span>  <span>True, the question arises of the practicality of using headphones, but this is definitely not a disadvantage.</span>  <span>There you can find the voice command key.</span> </p><p>  <span>On the opposite edge, the volume rocker and the camera key feel comfortable.</span> </p><p>  <span>At the top are two buttons - device lock and mute.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  <span>The <span>BlackBerry Bold 9780</span> phone differs from most smartphones in the presence of a keyboard, and from the button - Qwerty-layout.</span>  <span>The keys, as if in waves, diverge from the center.</span>  <span>For full typing, you need to use both hands.</span>  <span>Since the developer is located in Canada, initially the phone is not prepared for the Cyrillic alphabet, which is why as many as five keys have double letters.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Between the keyboard and the screen is a block of control keys.</span>  <span>These include not only receiving and hanging up the call, the menu key and the return button, but also the optical joystick connected to the confirmation button.</span>  <span>Since there is no touch screen, the joystick is the only assistant for navigating the menu.</span>  <span>At first, many do not like him, but after a couple of days all the other devices seem impractical without this thing.</span> </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  <span>The BlackBerry 9780 has a pretty good battery.</span>  <span>Its capacity is 1500 mAh.</span>  <span>With quiet use, it can "live" for about three days without recharging.</span>  <span>If you increase the load to one and a half hours of communication daily, the working time is reduced by half.</span> </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  <span>Phone BlackBerry 9780 is equipped with a TFT-display with a resolution of 480 by 360 pixels and support for more than 65 thousand colors.</span>  <span>If we talk about practicality, then in a touch phone this type of matrix greatly affects the use of a smartphone on a sunny day on the street.</span>  <span>About the screen in the BlackBerry 9780 this can not be said.</span>  <span>Under direct sunlight, the picture does not darken, the sharpness does not decrease.</span>  <span>The diagonal of the screen is only 2.44 inches.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  <span>Despite the claimed 5 megapixels with autofocus and flash, the pictures are of medium quality, but it‚Äôs better not to shoot the video - it's too grainy and fuzzy.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>The camera user interface is pretty simple.</span>  <span>On the left is the snapshot viewing function.</span>  <span>Next, you can find the opportunity to add a location.</span>  <span>In the center is a key that allows you to take a picture.</span>  <span>To the right is the flash setting and a section called ‚ÄúFurnishings‚Äù, which will allow you to take pictures indoors and outdoors.</span> </p><p>  <span>Color rendering is tolerable.</span>  <span>This is justified by the price of the BlackBerry 9780 - at the time of release it slightly exceeded 20,000 Russian rubles.</span>  <span>Now it is much lower.</span> </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  <span>The smartphone has its own BlackBerry OS version 6.0 system.</span>  <span>This version is more refined and optimized for an optical trackpad (joystick).</span>  <span>For the comfort of use, this operating system can hardly be distinguished from the usual Android or IOS.</span> </p><p>  <span>Excellent built-in software suggests that the Canadian developers of BlackBerry 9780 and other models wanted to create phones that would be more like computers.</span>  <span>This conclusion can be made by seeing the multitasking device, which is very easy to use.</span> </p><p>  <span>The system interface is clear and ergonomic.</span>  <span>The device has tips that will help you to quickly master this miracle of technology.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Calendar and contacts </h2><p>  <span>Although BlackBerry 9780 programs work seamlessly and without failures, many were delighted with the calendar and contacts.</span>  <span>As for the first, it is very convenient and practical.</span>  <span>You can create a note in a few clicks.</span> </p><p>  <span>The contacts in the smartphone perfectly emphasize the status of the device.</span>  <span>Its purpose is for business people.</span>  <span>Accordingly, everything is at the highest level, starting with synchronization with a computer and other devices, ending with a large number of lines for notes and information about the person in contact.</span> </p><h2>  Messaging system </h2><p>  <span>Up to 10 mailboxes can work on the device at the same time.</span>  <span>For each of them on the desktop, you can create a separate icon.</span>  <span>Moreover, all letters are "pushed" into the device itself for each period set by the owner.</span>  <span>What does it give?</span>  <span>Save battery and the ability to extract the necessary document without accessing the Internet, since it was downloaded in advance.</span> </p><p>  <span>Since letters are also synchronized with the server, when you delete them, you can choose from two options - only from the device or also a backup copy.</span> </p><p>  <span>If we talk about the instant messaging system, then this operating system has a program like Viber.</span>  <span>This is a way to keep in touch with relatives and not-so-people who own the BlackBerry 9780. The characteristics of the BlackBerry messenger are not inferior in encryption to other well-known programs.</span>  <span>One drawback is that everyone needs devices of this brand.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Programs and folders </h2><p>  <span>It's nice that in the BlackBerry Bold 9780 programs can be "laid out" in folders, as in "Android 6.0".</span>  <span>The application folder includes those that help you view text documents.</span>  <span>The only condition is that you will not be able to make corrections to them; for some reason, this is not registered in the system.</span> </p><p>  <span>Games cannot be considered a merit of this phone, since there are practically none.</span>  <span>And those that are are pretty dull and monotonous.</span> </p><p>  <span>Of the available social networking programs, only Twitter and Facebook.</span>  <span>There are no others, and installing them is difficult.</span>  <span>But those that exist work flawlessly.</span>  <span>There is even synchronization with LED.</span> </p><h2>  Navigation and GPS </h2><p>  <span>The cards in BlackBerry 9780 are similar to the standard Google cards, but with some differences.</span>  <span>Unfortunately, the embedded application is very limited in functionality.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  To understand whether this phone is bad, you need to compare its shortcomings with advantages.  To do this, read the reviews of those who used it and were able to evaluate it. </p><p>  What is good in the look of the BlackBerry 9780 is its design and comfortable keyboard.  The screen can be attributed to the list of minuses. </p><p>  The phone has good sound, but when watching a video or listening to your favorite tracks, you can clearly hear wheezing - a characteristic sound for the locking speaker.  Even the pleasant interface of the player does not equalize the situation. </p><p>  The improved operating system BlackBerry OS 6.0 is considered much better than all its previous options, but it still falls short of modern ones. </p><p>  The camera in the device is frankly weak, but every second budget smartphone can envy the battery. </p><p>  The phone is positioned as a business class model.  There is not a drop of irony or deception - for working with documents (the lack of editing is not included here) and file transfer, it fits perfectly.  The protection of personal data is also respected. </p><p>  This is a phone for those who know what they want.  It is suitable for people who do not pursue modern touch "shovels" and consider usability and reliability as priority. </p>
