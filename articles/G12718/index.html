This is due to the unique nature, beautiful landscapes and clean air.  The peninsula constantly receives tourists who want to not only see the sights, but also relax on the sea beaches.  On the Crimean coastline are some of the most famous resort towns among Russian-speaking vacationers: Alushta, Yalta, Koktebel, Kerch and others.  Among these, there are also health centers, for example, Theodosius.  Of course, they have recreation centers, motels, <span>hotels, hotels</span> and other establishments, where you can stay both for a short period and for a long period.  The most popular among them are the following: "Sea Breeze", "Surf" and "Stepnaya".  About them and some other bases will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  "Sea breeze" </h2><p>  The tourist base is open all year.  The administration takes from 1 thousand rubles per person per day.  If we consider the issue of nutrition, then for these purposes a bar works here.  In it you can order both one-time and three-time food consumption.  It is worth noting that there are various discounts and promotions.  For example, for a child under 10 years old, parents will pay only 50% of the cost.  If you want to enjoy barbecue or seafood, then you can make an individual order - and the cook will satisfy this request. </p><p>  As for accommodation, the Sea Breeze is located in Sevastopol.  Next to it lies the <span>coastline of the Black Sea,</span> as well as Cossack Bay.  The recreation center is 10 km from the city center.  At the guests' disposal is a two-story cottage where there are comfortable places for 2 or 4 people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean camp sites" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1411044.jpg" width="374"></div>

Many Soviet dishes are served in the local dining room, and the decor itself is designed in the appropriate style.  The pool has a bar, it is open only in summer.  There is a pizzeria. </p><p>  The complex is located in Alushta.  Relict tree species grow on its territory, which allows not only to purify the local air, but also to make it as useful as possible. </p><h2>  Belbek </h2><p>  Crimean camps located on the slopes of the peaks are most often visited by people who need to improve their health.  The mountainous areas of the peninsula are particularly popular with tourists. </p><p>  The lowest room rate in Belbek per day - 2500 rubles.  The recreation center operates year-round. </p><p>  There is the possibility of self-cooking.  There is a kitchen in every room.
