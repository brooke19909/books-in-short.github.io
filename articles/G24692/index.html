    <p>  Of course, the operating system of Fly Nimbus 4 is Android.  The version is quite new, 4.4.  If necessary, you can easily update it.  This is an inexpensive smartphone with a good camera for a phone with a cost of up to 9,000. There are two in the model: front (0.3 megapixels) and rear (5 megapixels).  4 core processor.  The clock frequency of each 1.3 GHz.  It is enough to run many games and applications.  Screen size - 5.5 inches, there is a special protective glass.  Runs Fly Nimbus 4 for a long time.  This applies to both active use and offline use.  But this model is considered cumbersome.  Not everyone is comfortable.  Plus, Fly Nimbus 4 has very little RAM.  In a smartphone, it is only 512 MB.  Not all of this is enough. </p><h2>  Alcatel C3 4033D </h2><p>  Which smartphone is good and inexpensive?  For example, you can offer a fairly budget option from Alcatel.  This is Alcatel C3.  This model is very popular among schoolchildren.  More precisely, among parents who want to teach their child how to use the phone.  Such a miracle of technology costs from 2 to 5 thousand rubles.  It has a 4-inch display, a rather large size, and the ability to use 2 SIM cards at the same time.  Dual-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  The operating system of Alcatel C3 is not as new as in the previous case, it is "Android 4.2".  But if you wish, you can easily update it.  The camera is not very good - 3.2 megapixels.  There is no front option.  So sometimes you have to make small sacrifices for accessibility.  Plus, Alcatel POP C3 4033D also has a bit of RAM, 512 MB.  The battery, according to customers, is pretty weak.  But this is generally a good inexpensive smartphone on Android.  You can go online with it, as well as call and write messages without problems.  And it‚Äôs also possible to take good photos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sony Xperia E1 </h2><p>  Next, we will get acquainted with the more popular manufacturer of phones.  It's about Sony.  This manufacturer offers the best low-cost smartphones with good features.  For example, pay attention to the Sony Xperia E1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive smartphone with a good camera and battery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968294.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The screen has a good diagonal of 4.5 inches.  With all this, the display is protected by a special glass.  It prevents the device from quickly being scratched and damaged.  In addition, the Sony Xperia E1 has a good rear (it‚Äôs the only) camera - 3 Megapixels.  You can find more good indicators, but such models are quite expensive.  And Sony Experiment will cost the buyer about 7,000 rubles.  The processor, in truth, is not very powerful: 2 cores at 1.2 GHz.  What can be said about RAM?  Its as much as in previous models, 512 MB.  Before us is a good inexpensive smartphone on Android.  True, with a slightly outdated version of the software.  ‚ÄúAndroid 4.3‚Äù is installed here.  Supports Sony Xperia E1 only 1 SIM card.  But this is an inexpensive smartphone with a good camera and battery for this price category.  So you need to pay attention to the phone. </p><h2>  Fly cirrus 1 </h2><p>  And here is another quite inexpensive smartphone with a good camera.  This is again about the Fly.  This time we are dealing with the Fly Cirrus 1 model. It has a rather large screen - 5 inches diagonally, capable of recognizing and displaying up to 16 million colors and shades.  The image on it is always clear and bright.  The processor, according to customers, is quite powerful - 4 cores.  Each frequency is 1.2 GHz.  There is support for 2 SIM cards, as well as high-speed Internet (Wi-Fi, 3 G).  In principle, these services are in all other smartphones.  There is enough RAM here - 1 GB. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, as already mentioned, Fly Cirrus 1 is a good inexpensive smartphone on the Android (latest version, 5.1), which is equipped with a very good camera.  Moreover, there are several of them: in the front (2 megapixels) and on the rear panel (8 megapixels).  There is a flash and autofocus.  The phone works for quite a while without recharging, about 4-5 days in active use mode.  Quite decent performance.  Perhaps there are no shortcomings in this model.  Especially if you take into account the low cost of the device - about 6,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a smartphone inexpensive but good" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968293.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fly chic 4 </h2><p>  Good and inexpensive <span>phones (smartphones),</span> as you see, are not so rare.  The main thing is to look carefully for them.  For example, here is another option to consider, Fly EVO Chic 4. But it differs little from the previous model. </p><p>  As in the previous case, the phone has several cameras: the front 2 MP and the rear 8 MP.  There is support for two SIM cards simultaneously.  One is standard ("old") type, and the second is micro.  The Fly Chic 4 has a quad-core processor.  Each core has a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  RAM here is 1 GB.  In principle, for many games and applications this is more than enough.  The Android operating system, however, is a bit outdated - 4.4.  But if necessary, it can be easily updated. </p><p>  Perhaps Fly Chic 4 is an inexpensive smartphone with a good camera and battery.  It will cost us approximately 7,500 rubles, and it is capable of working for a long time.  Both offline and with active use.  To be honest, there are no shortcomings in the phone.  Unless some buyers are initially not satisfied with the manufacturer.  After all, once ‚ÄúFly‚Äù has established itself as not a very good company for the production of phones.  For this reason, some tend to abandon Fly Chic 4. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="good inexpensive smartphone on android" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968292.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  IconBit MERCURY Q4 </h2><p>  Well, now a little non-standard manufacturer.  The best inexpensive smartphones are usually produced by well-known brands.  But if you are tired of Samsung, Fly, and so on, then you should pay attention to AykonBit.  The thing is that this is perhaps the cheapest option that you can offer.  IconBit NetTAB MERCURY Q4 costs only 4,000 rubles.  This model is equipped with 2 cameras: front (0.3 megapixels) and rear (5 megapixels).  Plus, there is also a powerful processor with a standard and already known indicator - 1.2 GHz.  "RAM", according to customers, is enough - 1 GB. </p><p>  IconBit NetTAB MERCURY Q4 has support for multiple SIM cards.  The operating system here, according to many opinions, is outdated - "Android 4.1".  The battery is rather weak for a modern gadget.  With active use, you can count only on 2-3 days of stable operation.  Although, for the proposed price, these are quite acceptable opportunities.  So do not pass by this model.  She was released in 2013, but is still quite popular. </p><h2>  ZTE Leo M1 </h2><p>  The best low-cost smartphones are running out.  So it is worth paying attention to the last few quite worthy budget options.  For example, ZTE Leo M1.  This is perhaps the typical representative of an inexpensive and functional phone.  Such a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù costs a little more than 4.5 thousand rubles.  With all this, the manufacturer offers quite interesting characteristics.  Although, they will not differ much from all previously proposed models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which smartphone is good and inexpensive" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968291.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The thing is that the ZTE Leo M1 has a quad-core processor (1.2 GHz each), plus 1 GB of RAM.  There is support for 2 SIM cards.  Both standard type and micro.  Sometimes this feature can be very useful.  The operating system, as in many budget smartphones, is ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.2.  But buyers claim that they are satisfied.  If necessary, you can use the Wi-Fi connection and update.  The camera at the ZTE Leo M1 is also not so bad.  The rear shoots with a quality of 5 megapixels, but the front one is not very good - only 1 megapixel.  This smartphone works for a relatively long time: from 3 to 5 days without recharging. </p><h2>  Lenovo A760 </h2><p>  The latest option worthy of attention is the Lenovo A760.  The cost of this model is 5,000 rubles.  In general, buyers respect Lenovo.  This manufacturer has long established itself as a pretty good creator of smartphones.  <span>Lenovo A760</span> offers customers a powerful 4-core processor, as well as a standard indicator of RAM.  It is 1 GB.  The operating system version is "Android 4.1".  If desired, you can use several phone numbers at once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="good and inexpensive smartphones phones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968290.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to users, Lenovo A760 works for quite some time - about 7 days without recharging.  In addition, the camera here is also quite decent - 5 megapixels.  But there is no frontal option.  True, not everyone is satisfied with the large dimensions of the device.  In principle, this is not so scary.  Indeed, in general, the <span>Lenovo A760</span> is a pretty high-quality smartphone that will please you with its work for a long time.  But for this you have to rely on numerous reviews of phones.  Inexpensive good-quality smartphones are now a reality, not a myth.  And everyone can find the best option for him. </p>
