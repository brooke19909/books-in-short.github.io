    <p>  Bali is nothing interesting.  However, its beaches are truly magnificent.  They have a fine sand cover, and in the course of the sea is covered with a mixture of fine pebbles and sand. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Sunset Hotel Apartments 4 * (Greece, Crete), as we have already mentioned, is located in the small village of Bali.  This village is a fishing village and at the same time a modern resort located twenty-five kilometers east of the famous Rethymnon and forty-five kilometers from Heraklion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Here is incredibly beautiful nature.  The mountain slopes are covered with a continuous carpet of green plants, and in secluded bays you can plunge into the purest water.  The village is characterized by a calm and restless atmosphere.  Therefore, Bali is considered a great place for a wonderful holiday surrounded by magnificent nature. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that this area is far from flat, and therefore, when choosing a hotel, consider this fact.  It is possible that the hotel may be located on a mountain, and then you will have to climb the slopes several times a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset hotel apartments bali rethymno 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546572.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It <span>is</span> easy to get to <span>Sunset Hotel</span> Apartments 4 * (Greece).  For example, you can order a taxi from Heraklion Airport, which will cost 60 EUR.  Booking a taxi in advance is not worth it, such a service will require additional costs and is simply not needed.  Because free cars are always available at the airport. </p><p>  For those tourists who do not like difficulties, the hotel can book a transfer. </p><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  Buses run past Bali to Heraklion, Chania and Rethymnon.  However, from the highway to the village - about two kilometers, which must be overcome on foot.  You can then take the local tram, but it is important to compare the timetable here.  There are several car rental locations in Bali.  If you plan to travel around the island on your own, then you just can not do without a car. </p><h2>  Local beaches </h2><p>  Bali is famous for its stunning beaches.  A total of four.  All of them are in the bays.  The most open and the largest of them, in the presence of wind, experiences quite strong excitement, and therefore waves are very frequent here.  The second bay is much smaller and calmer.  The third is the busiest, as it is the central congestion place for all tourists.  There is even a pier with fishing boats, from here pirate schooners carry excursions.  The best and most calm bay is located behind a mountain cape on the right side of the central beach.  It is called Evita (or Karavostasi).  This place is the most peaceful and secluded in Bali.  In this place there is only one hotel and several taverns.  Near the beach by the sea there are stunningly beautiful grottoes that are worth seeing for tourists.  They can only be reached from the sea by boat.  And at the very top of the mountain there is an observation deck from where you can admire stunning views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset hotel apartments 4 crete reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The lack of waves is a significant advantage of Bali.  However, in the high season (July, August), during windy weather, beaches can be crowded with tourists from nearby villages, where the sea is not as quiet as here. </p><h2>  Entertainment and shopping </h2><p>  In Bali there are souvenir shops and several supermarkets.  Traditional taverns work here, which are incredibly popular among tourists due to not only delicious food, but also large portions.  "Panorama" is the most famous among them.  But in the institution "Psaropula" perfectly cooked seafood. </p><p>  Fans of water activities in Bali can go diving, canoeing, go to sea fishing.  The village itself does not have a huge selection of attractions, to see something worthwhile and interesting, you need to go to Heraklion or Rethymnon.  The only place that is worthy of the attention of tourists can be considered the cave of Melidoni (Gerondospilios).  The entrance to it is located at an altitude of 230 meters above sea level.  The largest dungeon hall has considerable dimensions: 55 by 44 meters.  The height of the cave in some places ranges from 10 to 25 meters.  Stalactites hanging from the arches and illuminated by multi-colored lights look very beautiful.  The cave is open to visitors from March to October.  Entrance fee is 3.5 EUR. </p><h2>  Sunset Hotel Apartments 4 * (Crete): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who rested in it.  As a rule, any complex has conflicting comments, but this does not apply to Sunset Hotel Apartments 4 *.  Reviews of vacationers about him are incredibly positive, which speaks for itself.  The hotel has an excellent location, close to not only the coast, but also shops with taverns.  The hotel is a family business, members of the same family deal with it, so they are interested in the results of their work. </p><p>  No matter what time you arrive, you will certainly be met with joy at the reception and will be accommodated in your room.  According to guests, the apartments in the hotel are quite simple, with a minimal set of furniture.  However, for a small fee, you can stay in more affordable rooms with a balcony or terrace.  In general, the situation is quite normal, given the economy class of this institution.  The apartments are kept in perfect cleanliness, quality cleaning is done daily.  Towels and bed linen are changed regularly according to the schedule.  Plumbing in the rooms is working and working. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset hotel apartments 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546574.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for nutrition, there are some comments from tourists on it.  Some guests find the menu too monotonous in the morning, although it fully corresponds to the concept of a continental breakfast.  Other guests are fully satisfied with the food.  Dinner is enjoyed by absolutely all vacationers, since a variety of hot and cold dishes are served on the tables, the assortment of which does not repeat every day. </p><p>  The bar has a wonderful young man (the son of the owners of the hotel) who not only perfectly serves guests, but also solves all kinds of issues that may arise. </p><p>  Tourists feel in a hotel in a warm and comfortable atmosphere.  The hotel is not big at all, and therefore there is no large crowd.  Rest here is more reminiscent of a good old place, where I have visited more than once and where everyone is glad to see you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunset hotel apartments 4 Rethymno" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546581.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A very important advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the coast.  To get to the beach, you must cross the road, but this does not cause much inconvenience.  Tourists can use the municipal coast, on which you need to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  European hotels do not have their own beaches.  The hotel accepts tourists with animals, but this must be agreed with the management in advance.  At the reception of the complex you can rent a car to travel the whole island and see all the sights.  The village of Bali itself is small, so it can be explored quite quickly.  But for new experiences you need to go to neighboring cities.  There you will find many interesting and entertaining. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Sunset Hotel Apartments (Bali, Rethymno) 4 * can be recommended for relaxation to those tourists who are looking for a good place for a budget holiday.  Of course, here you will not find chic rooms and bohemian furnishings, but peace and comfort are guaranteed.  The hotel has a warm, homely atmosphere, the friendly owners are always friendly and interested to please their guests.  A convenient location of the complex makes it possible not only to quickly get to it from the airport, but also to live in close proximity to the coast, which is very important for a sea resort. </p>
