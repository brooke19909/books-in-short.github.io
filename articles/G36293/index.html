And while he is still a schoolboy, this is simply necessary.  At such times, Parental Control comes to the rescue.  MTS offers this service on favorable terms.  But what do the subscribers think about it?  How to use this opportunity?  What does she give her customers?  All this will be discussed later.  However, keep in mind that often this service package is used on computers.  On mobile devices, much less often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parental control pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125020.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Parental Control (MTS) service is what allows you to control your child while working on the World Wide Web.  Are you worried that your children will read inappropriate information online?  Or will they start visiting dangerous pages?  Then it's time to connect the "Parental Controls". </p><p>  With this option, parents will be able to install a filter on a phone or computer with a network from MTS, which will protect the child from unwanted information.  A very popular feature, which is mainly used by subscribers who still have schoolchildren.  But how to connect and use it? </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Before that, it is worth considering that Parental Control (MTS) is not at all a free package that is provided to everyone.  You have to pay for it.  Charged from the balance daily in the amount of 1.5 rubles.  Not so much if you think about it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the direct disconnection and connection of this option is free.  And this moment is extremely pleasing to subscribers.  You can start using the service at any time, as well as stop working with the option called "Parental Control".  MTS offers several options for connecting and disconnecting options.  About them a little later.  For now, let's learn how to use this opportunity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts parental control connect" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Using </h2><p>  On the computer, everything is very clear - just connect the package, then go to the Internet settings of MTS and turn on the Parental Control filter.  In it, set the desired settings and confirm your actions.  Nothing complicated.  It is customary to pay more attention to the "Parental Control" function on the phone.  MTS offers several filtering options in this case. </p><p>  To use the package, you should not only connect it, but also establish a connection between the phone of the parent and the child.  Two scenarios are suggested.  The first is the basic setup.  It allows you to set restrictions on receiving and sending calls / messages.  It is necessary to connect the Black List on the child‚Äôs phone.  Further, in the ‚ÄúMy MTS‚Äù service, in the ‚ÄúBlack List‚Äù you will have to indicate the student‚Äôs phone number, and then click on ‚ÄúSend Request‚Äù.  Now you agree to the terms of service, and you do the same on the child‚Äôs phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second option is advanced communication.  The same as the basic version, but with some innovations.  For example, you will now be able to view the call history of a child who has been blocked.  This option is the most suitable for the "Parental control" of the student.  The binding process is similar.  The main thing is to choose the type of communication between the phones of parents and children.  After that, you can wait for the confirmation of the process (up to 3 business days), and then use the Parental Control at MTS.  How to use it?  In the appropriate fields in "My MTS" parents are able to put a lock on numbers and messages, followed by confirmation of actions.  Everything is extremely simple. </p><h2>  Connect (baby) </h2><p>  Now we can talk about connecting the package.  MTS Parental Control can be connected in several ways.  And this process is divided into several sections: connecting this option to the child and the parent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parental service mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125022.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The first thing you can offer is to use the "My MTS" service.  This option is suitable for both children and parents.  Let's start with the first option.  Log in from your child‚Äôs account on the MTS page, find the Black List - Parental Control list in the list of services and click on the "Connect" button.  Now confirm your actions with the help of a secret code that will come via SMS.  All done. </p><p>  Then you can send an SMS request.  If the official MTS page is used extremely rarely for connection, then this approach is already more popular.  Send SMS with the text 442 * 5 to number 111 and wait a while.  Like last time, we confirm the actions and enjoy the result. </p><p>  In addition, Parental Control (MTS) can be connected using a USSD request.  To do this, dial * 111 * 72 # from the child‚Äôs phone.  Next, click on the "Call" button on your mobile device.  That's all the problems are solved.  But this is not enough for the service to work.  Now you need to connect the parent phone to the child. </p><h2>  Parental control </h2><p>  Here the alignment is the same as in the previous case.  You can use the service called "My MTS".  Not the most suitable option.  No different from connecting on a baby phone.  Therefore, it is not worth focusing on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable parental control on mts" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125024.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But to use the Parental Control (MTS) service, you can use the SMS request.  Form a message from the parent‚Äôs phone with the text 442 * 4 and send it to 111. Confirm the action and that‚Äôs it, you can control the child. </p><p>  USSD requests should not be forgotten either.  To activate the service, you need to dial * 111 * 71 # from the parent on the mobile device and press the subscriber‚Äôs call button. </p><p>  If you use Parental Controls for computer Internet, you will have to dial * 111 * 786 # or send a message to 111 with the text 786. Nothing complicated. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  But <span>how to disable "Parental Control"</span> on the MTS.  Sometimes in this service there is no need.  And here, too, there are several options.  You can use the Internet, and resort to writing a special statement. </p><p>  In the case of connecting to a computer, it is better to call the operator at 0890 and inform about the desire to terminate the "Parental Control" on the SIM card.  Or use the "My Account" on the official website of MTS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts parental control how to use" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125018.jpg"></div>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If we are talking about phones, then here you will have to disconnect both from the child in the room and from the parent.  To do this, you need to contact the nearest MTS office and write a statement to renounce "Parental Control".  This option is offered on the official website of the operator. </p>
