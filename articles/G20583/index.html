    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Active recreation on the shore of the Sea of ​​Azov </h2><p>  For lovers of relaxation without children, noisy companies and wild beaches, you should pay attention to the private sector in the Arabat Strelka area.

However, one must understand that the prices for staying in such institutions are much higher than those of private owners.

The cost of apartments starts from 300 hryvnia per day. </p><h2>  Pension "Brigantine" </h2><p>  On Arabatskaya Strelka you can stay at the Brigantine boarding house in the village of Schastlivtsevo (17 km from Genichesk).
