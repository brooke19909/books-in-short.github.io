It is located in the Old Town.  During the Middle Ages, this building was the main city administrative building.  Only representatives of the nobility could get into it, who solved issues related to the life of the city. </p><p>  Today this unique historical building consists of several parts, some of which are in use by the city authorities, and the rest function as museum halls. </p><p>  In 2014, the Town Hall in Tallinn turned 610 years old. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.4369933" data-lng="24.74537310000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/4/7/9/10479.png"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The Town Hall is the only Gothic city government building in Northern Europe that has survived to the present day.  Today, any tourist can almost completely examine all the rooms of this interesting historical building: from the basement to the tower, which can be reached by a spiral staircase, consisting of 115 steps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tallinn Town Hall" class="if uuid-2912380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912380.jpg"></div><p>  This magnificent building is located in the middle of the main square in the Old Town.  It was built in two years (1402 - 1404 years).  Initially, all the premises were intended for various meetings of the burgomaster.  And today, the Tallinn City Hall is used to receive notable people, the president, and celebrations for concerts.  On the weather vane of the spire of the representative town hall, the famous Old Thomas flaunts, which has been a Tallinn symbol since 1530. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the summer, the town hall serves as a museum that any tourist or traveler can visit.  Here you can enjoy the splendor of this attraction.  Particularly admires the interior of the bright meeting rooms.  The painted ceilings, atypical wood carvings, and a unique collection of artwork are also delightful. </p><p>  From the height of the tower, a magnificent picturesque city panorama opens.  The rooms in the attic and basement are used for exhibitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.fotolia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the tower of the town hall" class="if uuid-2912523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912523.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Tallinn City Hall (see photo in the article) is the only structure of this style that has been preserved almost unchanged.  The first mention of it dates back to 1322.  At that time it was a small one-story structure built of limestone.  By the end of the 14th century, the important commercial importance of Tallinn (at that time Revel), which was a member of the Hanseatic League, had grown significantly, so the need arose to expand the administrative building.  There were spacious halls for special occasions.  A tower 64 meters high was added to the building in 1483, and in 1530 a weather vane was put on the spire in the form of a guard, whom the townspeople called Old Thomas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Subsequently, this magnificent building was overgrown with various decorations.  In 1627, the city master Daniel Peppel made metal weirs in the shape of dragon heads, which are a typical example of the high craftsmanship of Revel blacksmiths who created their works in the Middle Ages.  A small reconstruction of the town hall was carried out in the XVII century, after which a spire appeared on the tower (late Renaissance style).  In the middle of the same century, a new entrance appeared, thanks to which the central gate began to be located from the front of the building, in the center.  The eastern facade and windows of the town hall were transformed in the 19th century. </p><p>  During the Second World War, during the forced spring bombing of 1944, necessary to liberate the city from Nazi invaders, the town hall was partially destroyed.  But post-war restoration work gave the building its original appearance. </p><h2>  Halls and premises </h2><p>  The Tallinn City Hall consists of several halls that are open to visitors when official events are not held. </p><ol><li>  The Magistrate‚Äôs Hall is the main building of the Town Hall.  Previously, meetings were held in it.  Today exhibited works of art, thematically related to justice.  The most valuable of them are paintings by Johann Akean (L√ºbeck artist of the 17th century). <div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magistrate's Hall" class="if uuid-2912481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912481.jpg"></div></li><li>  Burger Hall - a room for receptions.  There were foreign ambassadors for whom performances of wandering musicians and actors were arranged.  The walls of the hall are decorated with copies of picturesque tapestries depicting scenes from stories of King Solomon. </li><li>  Merchant Hall - a room where Tallinn merchants gathered to conclude their transactions.  Until now, a map of trade routes hangs on the wall and chests stand along the walls. </li><li>  Trading and basement halls - premises used as wine cellars.  Now there is a permanent museum exhibition. </li></ol><p>  There are premises in the building designed for the kitchen and the treasury.  And today, in the kitchen, the atmosphere of the Middle Ages is presented.  It is also worth noting that at the end of the kitchen in the old days there was also a toilet for ratmans.  Moreover, the sewer system throughout the building was unified and perfectly preserved.  The Treasury over time was turned into the office of the city mayor.  Of particular value is the children's portrait of Queen Christina of Sweden and the image of King Charles XI of Sweden in his youth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tower </h2><p>  The most interesting in the Tallinn Town Hall (photo is presented in the article) is the tower towering above the territory of old Tallinn, or rather, views from the site where the bell tower is located (34 meters high). </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.parkinn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather vane on the spire of the Town Hall" class="if uuid-2912387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912387.jpg"></div><p>  You can climb the tower for 3 euros, you will have to climb the steep stairs, but it's worth it.  The views from the heights are stunning.  True, this platform is small and you have to explore the surroundings through narrow windows-loopholes.  City guards used this observation platform to find out if there was a fire somewhere and if enemy troops were approaching.  In case of danger, they beat the alarm bell, made in 1586 by the Tallinn master Hinrik Hartmann.  Until recently, the ringing of a bell was heard every hour (the number of strokes corresponded to time).  This was done manually.  But now the bell is controlled by the clock (on the facade of the town hall) using an electronic system. </p><h2>  Town Hall for tourists </h2><p>  In the summer, anyone can climb up the tower to admire the fabulous surroundings.  From the height of the tower offers a wonderful view of the Town Hall Square and the surrounding area. </p><p>  The building has a Museum of Photography.  Pay attention to the pillars of this ancient building.  One of them was used as a "shameful" in the Middle Ages.  This is reminded of shackles and chains mounted in stone.  With their help, the hands of criminals were held together, so that they lost the ability to move. </p><p>  The Tallinn City Hall is open for visitors to inspect indoor halls and premises all year round.  It offers interesting and exciting excursions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town Square" class="if uuid-2912371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912371.jpg"></div><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  According to legend, in the Middle Ages in Tallinn every spring, competitions of the best city archers took place in the square at the Great Sea Gate.  The most accurate shooter, who managed to hit the target (wooden parrot), was rewarded with a silver goblet.  Once, when the knights, lined up, pulled their bows, the target suddenly fell, pierced by an unknown whose arrow.  The shooter was a simple young man, poor Toomas.  He was scolded and forced to set the parrot in place. </p><p>  Sanctions against the young man were limited to this, he was even offered to become a guard.  And that in those days was a great honor for the poor.  But Toomas subsequently fully justified his trust, constantly showing heroism in the battles (Livonian War).  Closer to old age, he grew a magnificent mustache and became very similar to the brave warrior, who towered in the form of a weather vane on the famous tower of the Tallinn Town Hall.  And since then, they began to call him Old Thomas. </p><h2>  Cafe in the Town Hall </h2><p>  There is a very interesting establishment on the Town Hall Square in Tallinn - a tavern located inside the historic building itself.  Cafe "Three Dragons" is decorated in a medieval style.  And the inscription on one of the doors ‚ÄúLet's play in the Middle Ages‚Äù attracts tourists to this unique cafe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitestonia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafe &quot;Three Dragons&quot;" class="if uuid-2912494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912494.jpg"></div><p>  Being here, you can fully plunge into the atmosphere of medieval life. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The city hall of Tallinn, according to many tourists, seems rather austere and harsh.  But a walk along it leaves a lot of rather vivid and unforgettable impressions.  This interesting historical place gives a complete sense of a past life. </p><p>  There are a lot of positive reviews about the expositions of the museum halls and about the surrounding surroundings opening from the tower site.  Positive and enthusiastic reviews about this unique attraction located in Tallinn - a cafe in the Town Hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old city" class="if uuid-2912377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2912377.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Town Hall Address: Estonia, Tallinn, Raekoja plats 1, 10114. </p><p>  In order to get to the town hall, you should find the Old Town.  There is no public transport on it, so you need to get to the nearest stops: Linnahall, Vabaduse v√§ljak and Virul.  Then you should walk on foot to the very central part of the Old Town, where you can immediately see the city hall.  You can visit it on weekdays and Saturdays from June 26 to August 31, from 10 to 16 hours.  On other days, it can only be visited by prior arrangement. </p>
