Glyphs in archeology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you carefully look at the composition of the word "hieroglyph", you can isolate from it an independent concept - a glyph.  This is an element of writing related to graphics, and its semantic expression goes back to the Greek verb Œ≥ŒªœçœÜŒµŒπŒΩ gl√Ωphein, which means ‚Äúcut‚Äù or ‚Äúengrave‚Äù in translation.  British archaeologist Frederick Katherwood was the first to become interested in glyphs.  What such a concept exists, Europe has learned thanks to his drawings made during the excavation of the Mayan civilization.  Glyphs were carved from stone, which is consistent with the ancient Greek view of them. </p><h2>  Where the glyph meets </h2><p>  The statement that the glyph is the same graphic image as any component of information expressed in written form will be completely true.  However, this is only partially true.  If we draw an analogy with the letter, then it, being an integral part of the word, does not have an independent meaning, representing only a sound expression, which, only combining with other elements, is able to convey the content of the concept. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geneonline.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egyptian hieroglyphs" class="if uuid-3091450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3091450.jpg"></div><p>  The glyph, on the other hand, has a specific meaning in itself, and in connection with this, the requirements for writing it are quite high and canonized in a certain way.  This is confirmed by numerous archaeological artifacts discovered around the world: in Egypt, in the city of Kopan, in Greece, Turkey and in the mountains of Ingushetia.  Petroglyphs carved in stone by ancient masters are valuable sources of information, thanks to which we can now get to the bottom of the mysteries of history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are characters carved on stones and carved on a wooden plane, they can be in the form of a pictogram or logogram. </p><p>  It is also known that a glyph is such an image of a font that gives it a certain exclusivity, which is sometimes necessary in typography.  In addition, symbolism is indispensable in creating computer programs.  All kinds of graphic symbols are widely used in them, both complex, for example, an icon, and elementary ones - letters, numbers, periods, commas, etc. </p><h2>  Sacred meaning </h2><p>  At first, the researchers suggested that the glyph is the same writing element as all that were previously discovered and used by ancient people to transmit information, including everyday content.  However, having studied in more detail archaeological finds with signs embossed on them, scientists realized that these symbols not only carry some independent meaning, but also have a certain power that goes back to ancient magical rituals, and have nothing to do with everyday life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoding of hieroglyphs" class="if uuid-3091451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3091451.jpg"></div><p>  The oldest types of writing, their heyday and decline can be traced on the example of Egypt.  Initially, pictography prevailed there, as evidenced by samples with reduced images of the object.  After some time, the symbols acquired a broader interpretation, and the glyph of the Sun became not just the name of the star, but also indicated the light or dark time of the day.  That is, if necessary, to inform about an event that happened in the afternoon, it was possible by depicting the sun, and during a night incident they painted a lunar sign. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The heyday of glyphs in Egypt can be considered the period of Roman rule, when there were more than 6,000 characters. However, they were used for the needs of priests who wrote secret texts with signs. </p><p>  For everyday needs there was an hieratic cursive.  The complex system of hieroglyphs remained in the past due to Christian influence. </p><p>  Glyph can be used both in the singular and in the kit, being a compound.  In addition, as a unit of glyph graphics, it is used in linguistics as a complementary component to expand the meaning of the main character. </p><p>  There is still such a thing as an allograph.  This is when a couple or several glyphs are equal in essence, but differ in graphic performance.  They can be used in different pieces of text.  Drawing an analogy with the alphabet, we can say that this is a different spelling of the same letter. </p><h2>  What ends the argument with the gods </h2><p>  Among the many variations of the already known sacred symbols, a special place is occupied by the glyphs of Arachne.  The story of their appearance is reflected in one of the myths of Ancient Greece, which speaks of a duel between the goddess Athena and the unsurpassed weaver from the mortal world Arachne.  The girl really was an outstanding craftswoman, and there were no peers in the art of weaving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Athena and Arachne" class="if uuid-3091455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3091455.jpg"></div><p>  And she was extremely proud, and it was her quality that prompted the weaver to challenge Athena herself.  The competition ended sadly: the goddess tore apart the canvas woven by Arachnoy, while hitting the girl with a shuttle on her forehead.  The weaver could not survive such humiliation and decided to take her own life by trying to hang herself.  She almost succeeded: she reached the limits of Navi - that was the name of the kingdom of the dead. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, Athena returned the proud woman to the world of the living, having determined her punishment: to become a spider, to hang and weave forever and ever.  And the knowledge brought from Navi by the weaver Arachna, has since been used in magic in the form of necroglyphs. </p><h2>  Areas of darkness </h2><p>  Glyphs of Arachne are used in black magic when they want to achieve a quick and concrete result.  They, according to those who use them, are very effective due to their "otherworldly" origin.  They go well with runes, the creation of which also uses glyphs.  The difference between the impact of the runes and the work of the necroglyphs is as follows: the former try to find a milder way to solve the problem, and the latter come to the goal in the shortest way, without thinking about the means.  Therefore, working with glyphs of Arachne is considered dangerous due to their unpredictability. </p><p>  In addition, without special preparation, just having read the relevant literature, in abundance offered by book publishers and certain sites, you can run into trouble.  The fact is that working with otherworldly symbols is dangerous in that they can subjugate the thoughtless "sorcerer" to themselves, making him a toy of their power.  And the consequences are well known to employees of psychiatric clinics ... </p><h2>  16 elements </h2><p>  There are only 16 glyphs of Arachne. Each of them is intended for a specific task. </p><p>  For example, the glyph of the target, becoming a shield for the subject, leads him on the chosen course.  It is ordered by those who want to achieve quick success in a career that is accompanied by financial well-being. </p><p>  The glyph of physical transformation is designed to rebuild the body's natural forces. </p><p>  The symbol of the victory of the spirit is chosen by those who wish to eliminate in a magical way all obstacles on the way to the goal, without thinking about the means. </p><p>  One way or another, but all the glyphs of Arachne are ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù to obtain the desired or achieve certain heights with the help of otherworldly influence.  But at the same time, few people think about what the payment for the benefits will be: by interfering in the natural course of events and disrupting the world order, a person destroys primarily his energy and the fate of his descendants. </p><h2>  Runic characters </h2><p>  The origin of the runes is Scandinavian, and before the establishment of Christianity, there were two types of glyphs: the younger and the older futark.  It was a kind of alphabet, but intended for polar purposes.  The runes of the younger futark were known to all literate inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries: it was used in the preparation of contracts, letters, business accounts and other household records. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thegemtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scandinavian runes" class="if uuid-3091468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3091468.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The runes of the older futark</span> were accessible only to the initiates who knew their sacred meaning and used it for ritual purposes.  Then, the ancient knowledge transferred to the initiates (according to myths) by the god Odin was lost.  And only in our time they were restored by runologists. </p><h2>  Glyph scattering </h2><p>  Today in various sources you can find information about a variety of characters that carry a certain magical implication. </p><p>  We will name only a few of them: </p><ol><li>  Glyphs of Jupiter, consisting of four characters that in conjunction attract victory. </li><li>  Glyphs of the Moon, used to unite with the natural forces and energies that are administered by the night luminary. </li><li>  Alkhainth glyphs are dealt with by people who want to give significance and influence to a certain organization or community. </li><li>  Solomon's glyphs are used in black magic to attract wealth, power, success in show business, etc. </li></ol><p>  The list goes on, but the general meaning is quite clear: getting all kinds of benefits without any hassle. </p><h2>  Proserpine Impact </h2><p>  The planet Proserpine manages the work with various kinds of symbols, which monitors the thoroughness of the elaboration of the sign and the correct spelling.  All sorts of subtleties are taken into account, up to the distances between points and dashes in the glyph.  It is no coincidence that it is this planet that governs symbols related to the world of the dead: according to ancient Greek mythology, Proserpine was the wife of the god of the underworld Hades. </p><h2>  Space symbols </h2><p>  In addition to different types of writing, the most ancient symbols were astrological signs.  This field of knowledge uses different calculation options.  However, the designation of zodiac signs with symbols is practiced in all astrological systems. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the Western way of depicting the influence on the fate of the personality of both lower planets (located up to Saturn inclusive), and higher: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Proserpine, Chiron. </p><p>  Each of these planets corresponds to a certain sign.  In addition, images of twelve constellations: from Aries to Pisces, are an addition to the system of astrological symbols. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xw.qq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Astrological glyphs" class="if uuid-3088987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3088987.jpg"></div><p>  The interpretation of the horoscope is based on an understanding of the relationship between the planet and the zodiac sign in which it is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="astrologerjolly.tripod.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glyphs of Vedic Astrology" class="if uuid-3089021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3089021.jpg"></div><p>  Vedic astrological glyphs are represented only by the planets of the lower circle bounded by Saturn.  At the same time, not only the symbols of the planets and zodiac constellations are indicated on the map, but also the energy centers controlled by a certain celestial body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.redbubble.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chakra Glyphs" class="if uuid-3091475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/3091475.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to the study of the topic of glyphs, an understanding of its versatility and ambiguity comes, as well as its connection not only with the history of the ancient world, but also with modernity: literally in every area there is a symbolic series accessible only to the "initiates". </p>
