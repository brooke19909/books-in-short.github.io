It‚Äôs just rebuilt in antiquity.  The castle stands on the road, at the entrance to the village of Orlovka (Kaliningrad region).  On the way, waiting for them to be noticed, two skeletons in <span>chastity belts</span> froze <span>.</span>  But in more detail about everything we will tell later in the article. </p><h2>  The appearance and description of the castle </h2><p>  Nesselbek Castle (Kaliningrad) is a building erected in full accordance with the requirements of medieval architecture.  Architects were able to recreate a knight's castle with the help of old drawings - an exact copy of the fortress of the Teutonic Order.  And, by the way, they were marked with a diploma from the above order - for the preservation of traditions. </p><p>  As you know, the village of Orlovka (Kaliningrad) used to be a German settlement.  In the XIX century there was Nesselbek manor, which belonged to the noble family of Schenkendorfs, who were originally from Tilsit.  The estate was built at the beginning of the 19th century and included, in addition to the main building, buildings for storing grain and raising cattle. </p>

    <p>  Nesselbek Castle got its name from the stream.  It is translated from German as "nettle stream."  And indeed, it existed and flowed through the territory of the village, and got its name, in turn, due to nettles growing along the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, there is a legend about this lion fish.  In the distant past, fishermen from the sea caught fish and were allowed to swim in a stream.  The fish of the villagers prayed day and night to release it back into the sea.  And in return she promised to give a source, not a simple one, but with the best beer in the world.  So it was or not, no one knows, but the castle has its own brewery .... </p><h2>  Accommodation at the castle </h2><p>  Nesselbek Castle (Kaliningrad Region) is built of warm red brick, and its interior is unique and elegant.  The rooms have exclusive furniture: chairs and tables with leather upholstery and painted wooden surfaces are designed in a medieval style.  Custom-made curtains, wall paintings in the lobby, and colored window stained-glass windows complete the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Hotel Nesselbek is a four-star, consisting of 3 floors.  Guests have the opportunity to choose from 23 rooms: from standard to presidential.  Each number is given the name of one of the Masters of the Teutonic Order. </p><h2>  Standart room </h2><p>  Double rooms are located on the first, second and third floors.  They have one double or 2 separate beds, refrigerator, TV, telephone, air conditioning, minibar, individual safe.  In the bathroom - shower and hairdryer.

    <p>  If you go to the courtyard (and all guests of the Nesselbek castle (Kaliningrad) do just that), the glass dome of the brewery opens up.  Through it you can see how the elixir is cooked in large vats of magic.  Here, beer is prepared according to ancient recipes, once beloved in Europe. </p><p>  Based on beer, a soup is served in the restaurant - a signature dish from the chef.  For soup, guests are offered onion bread. </p><h2>  <span>Museum of Medieval</span> Torture and Punishment </h2><p>  The dimensions of this scary museum are small - three flights of stairs up a narrow staircase. </p><p>  At the entrance stands the executioner - a man with a bad reputation for those times.  People in this profession were feared and despised: executioners, as a rule, traded parts of bodies executed for magic rituals.  At bazaars and markets, merchants gave them food for free, for fear of touching their hands.  And they removed clothes from dead criminals.  The executioner could leave his terrible position after he found a receiver for himself. </p><p>  In the halls you can see the devices used by the masters of torture of the Middle Ages: </p><ul><li>  "Spanish boot" - worn on the leg, crushed and broken bones. </li><li>  Vise - the head of the convict was placed in them, and then it was squeezed; </li><li>  "Nuremberg Maiden" - an iron cabinet with the outlines of a female body.  Long nails were placed on the inner surface of the cabinet doors.  The convict went into the closet, the doors closed, and the nails pierced into different parts of the body. </li><li>  Torture table - the body "rolled" on the rollers with spikes.  And so that the victim did not twitch, his arms and legs were straightened with shackles. </li><li>  Pear - introduced into certain parts of the body.  When opened, it tore them. </li><li>  Knee Crusher - crushed the knee and elbow joints. </li><li>  "Death Chair" - a terrible device, covered with spikes in the amount of from 500 to 1500, with belts, which were fixed by the victim.  Sometimes a hearth was set up under the chair for quick recognition of the convict. </li><li>  Seat with a collar - the victim was seated on a seat with his hands tied.  An iron collar with a screw was put on his head.  The executioner tightened the screw tightly, and the metal wedge located on the collar slowly penetrated the prisoner's head, causing death. </li></ul><p>  These devices were used to kill a person or to make him a cripple.  For more ‚Äúeasy‚Äù punishments, other tools existed: </p><ul><li>  shameful pillar - as a punishment, the convict was ridiculed and humiliated by the crowd; </li><li>  mask of shame - worn on <span>grumpy wives</span> and women who pronounced swear words in public places; </li><li>  the drunkard‚Äôs mantle - they put it on chronic alcoholics;  it was a barrel turned upside down, in which the drunk's favorite drinks were previously stored;  then he was led through the streets of the city for condemnation and ridicule. </li></ul><p>  And, of course, <span>chastity belts.</span>  These devices appeared during the Crusades, so that the knights, leaving the family for a long time, did not worry about the loyalty of their wives.  Chastity belts for men later appeared.  Their main task was to prevent masturbation.  By the way, chastity belts are still relevant today: as an accessory for BDSM games. </p><p>  Museum exhibits are not originals - these are just mock-ups skillfully recreated according to drawings and historical documents.  But, as those who have been here admit, upon examination it becomes creepy. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  And in order to feel the joy of life after visiting the museum, the Nesselbek Hotel offers its guests to conduct spa treatments: </p><ul><li>  Jacuzzi or bath with beer - increase the tone of the body, strengthen immunity, relieve muscle tension and warm the joints.  Brewer's yeast softens and heals the skin, strengthens hair and nails. </li><li>  Cleopatra‚Äôs bathtubs with honey and milk.  During the adoption of the procedure, the pores are cleaned, blood circulation improves, fat deposits are burned. </li><li>  A bath for lovers, in which champagne is poured instead of water. </li></ul><p>  In addition, Nesselbek Castle provides additional body care services: </p><ul><li>  beer pellet wrap - eliminates dead skin, heals nails and hair; </li><li>  nutritious wrap based on honey and milk - increases skin firmness and elasticity, tightens body contours.  It has a moisturizing and calming effect; </li><li>  tightening wrap ‚ÄúAroma-algae‚Äù - prevents sagging skin during weight loss, instantly relieves heaviness and swelling of the legs, stimulates the metabolism, detoxification and microcirculation of the blood; </li><li>  wrapping with live kelp leaf kelp - eliminates excess fluid in tissues, restores skin elasticity, helps to relax the body. </li></ul>
