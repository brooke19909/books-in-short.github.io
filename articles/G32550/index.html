Literally, this concept means "destruction."  Actually, in a broad sense, destruction is a violation of integrity, normal structure or destruction.  This definition can be understood narrowly.  For example, we can say that destruction is the orientation of either the component (s) of a person‚Äôs behavior and psyche, which are destructive and related to subjects or objects.  Where and how is this concept used?  More about this later in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="destruction it" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/405742.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The initial ideas about the presence in a person of forces and elements that have a destructive orientation towards external objects or himself, were formed in ancient mythology, philosophy, and religion.  These concepts subsequently received some development in various fields.  In the 20th century, some actualization of understanding was noted.  Many researchers attribute this surge to various phenomena in society, psychoanalytic problems, and various social cataclysms.  Various thinkers of that time were quite closely involved in these issues.  Among them are Jung, Freud, Fromm, Gross, Reich and other theorists and practitioners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is destruction" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/405464.jpg" width="505"></div>

In the process of working activity, the transformation of individual characteristics of a person is noted.  Profession, on the one hand, contributes to the development and formation of personality.  On the other hand, the workflow has a devastating effect on a person in the physical and psychological sense.  Thus, it can be noted that the <span>transformation of personality</span> occurs in directions opposite to each other.  In the field of career development management, the most effective tools are those that contribute to the conscious reinforcement of the first trend while minimizing the second.  Professional destruction is a gradually accumulated negative changes in personality and ways of working.  This phenomenon arises as a result of performing monotonous work of the same type over a long period.  As a result, undesirable labor qualities are formed.  They contribute to the development and strengthening of psychological crises and stress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="professional destruction" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/405468.jpg" width="266"></div>  That's what destruction is in the career field.

    <h2>  The medicine </h2><p>  In some cases, destructive processes can contribute to the elimination of certain adverse events.  In particular, such an effect is noted in medicine.  How can destruction be useful?  This phenomenon, caused intentionally, is used, for example, in gynecology.  In the treatment of certain pathologies, doctors use different methods.  One of them is radio frequency destruction.  It is used for diseases such as cysts on the walls of the vagina, warts, erosion, dysplasia.  Radio wave destruction of the cervix is ‚Äã‚Äãa painless and quick way to affect the affected area.  This method of treatment of pathologies can be recommended even to nulliparous women. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Oncology </h2><p>  Many pathologies are accompanied by tissue destruction.  Oncological diseases are also referred to.  One particular case is <span>Ewing's</span> tumor <span>(sarcoma).</span>  This is a squamous bone <span>tumor.</span>  <span>This tumor</span> is sensitive to radiation.  Compared with other malignant neoplasms, this pathology occurs at a fairly young age: between the 10th and 20th years.  The tumor is accompanied by a lesion of the bones of the limbs, but can also develop in other areas.  The neoplasm includes densely located rounded cells.  The most characteristic symptoms include swelling and soreness.  Sarcoma is characterized by a tendency to a significant spread and in some cases covers the entire central section of the long bones.  On the radiograph, the affected area does not look as wide as it really is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radio wave destruction of the cervix" class="if" height="188" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/405465.jpg" width="600"></div>  With the help of MRI and CT, the boundaries of the pathology are determined.  The disease is accompanied by lytic destruction of the bone.  This change is considered the most characteristic for this pathology.  However, in a number of cases, ‚Äúonion‚Äù plural layers of <span>bone tissue</span> formed under the periosteum are also noted.  It should be noted that earlier these changes belonged to classical clinical signs.  Diagnosis should be based on a biopsy.  This is due to the fact that a similar pattern of x-ray examination can be observed against the background of other malignant bone tumors.  Treatment involves the use of various combinations of radiation, chemotherapeutic and surgical methods.  The use of this complex of therapeutic measures can eliminate the pathology in more than 60% of patients with a primary local form of Ewing's sarcoma.

    <h2>  Chemical destruction </h2><p>  This phenomenon can be observed under the influence of various agents.  In particular, they include water, oxygen, alcohols, acids and others.  Physical agents can also act as destructive agents.  For example, among the most popular can be noted <span>ionizing radiation,</span> light, heat, mechanical energy.  Chemical destruction is a process that does not proceed selectively under the condition of physical impact.  This is due to the relative proximity of the energy characteristics of all bonds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polymer degradation" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/405469.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Polymer degradation </h2><p>  This process is considered the most studied to date.  In this case, the selectivity of the phenomenon is noted.  The process is accompanied by the breaking of a carbon-heteroatom bond.  The result of the destruction in this case is the monomer.  Significantly greater resistance to chemical agents is observed in the carbon-carbon bond.  And in this case, destruction is a process that is possible only under harsh conditions or in the presence of side groups, which contribute to a decrease in the bond strength of the main chain of the compound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal degradation" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/405466.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <h2>  Classification </h2><p>  In accordance with the characteristics of the decomposition products, depolymerization and destruction are randomly divided.  In the latter case, we mean a process that is the reverse of the polycondensation reaction.  In the course of it, fragments are formed whose dimensions are larger than the size of the monomer unit.  In the depolymerization process, the monomers are presumably sequentially detached from the end of the chain.  In other words, there is a reaction opposite to the addition of units during polymerization.  These types of destruction can occur both simultaneously and separately.  In addition to these two, there is probably a third phenomenon.  In this case, we mean destruction by the weak bond present in the center of the macromolecule.  In the process of random random degradation, a rather rapid decrease in the molecular weight of the polymer occurs.  With depolarization, this effect is much slower.  For example, for polymethylmethacrylate having a molecular weight of 44,000, the degree of polymerization of the residual substance remains almost unchanged until depolymerization is completed by 80%. </p><h2>  Thermal destruction </h2><p>  In principle, the splitting of compounds under the influence of heat should not differ from hydrocarbon cracking, the chain mechanism of which is installed with absolute reliability.  In accordance with the chemical <span>structure of polymers</span> , their resistance to heat, the rate of decomposition, and also the characteristics of the products formed in the process are determined.  The first stage, however, will always be the formation of free radicals.  An increase in the reaction chain accompanies a breaking of bonds and a decrease in molecular weight.  Clipping can occur through disproportionation or recombination of free radicals.  In this case, a change in the fractional composition, the formation of spatial and branched structures, and double bonds at the ends of macromolecules can also occur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lytic destruction" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/405467.jpg" width="241"></div>

    <h2>  Substances that affect the speed of the process </h2><p>  During thermal degradation, as with any chain reaction, acceleration occurs due to components that can easily decompose into <span>free radicals.</span>  Slowdown is noted in the presence of acceptor compounds.  So, for example, an increase in the rate of conversion of rubbers is noted under the influence of azo and diazocomponents.  In the process of heating the polymers at a temperature of from 80 to 100 degrees in the presence of these initiators, only destruction is observed.  With an increase in the concentration of the compound in solution, a predominance of intermolecular reactions is observed leading to gelation and the formation of a spatial structure.  In the process of thermal cleavage of polymers, together with a decrease in the average molecular weight and a structural change, depolymerization (monomer cleavage) is observed.  At a temperature of more than 60 degrees with the block decomposition of methyl methacrylate in the presence <span>of benzoyl peroxide, the</span> chain breaks mainly by disproportionation.  As a result, half of the molecules should have a terminal double bond.  In this case, it becomes obvious that a macromolecular break will require less than activation molecule, rather than a saturated molecule. </p>
