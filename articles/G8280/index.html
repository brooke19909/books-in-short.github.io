    <h2>  Ancient tradition </h2><p>  The tradition of giving a person two names, one baptismal and the other worldly, took root in Russia after the adoption of the Christian religion.  It persisted until the 17th century.  The fact is that church names were first perceived by Russian people as alien and unusual.  In addition, they were often repeated, because there were relatively few of them in use.  This created unnecessary communication problems.  Therefore, it was decided to name the child an additional second original Slavic name.  It was understandable and simple for our ancestors.  Many were formed from dubious ancient names: Goodness, Ratibor, Rad, and many others.  Sound and beautiful, they were also uncomfortable in everyday life.  From ancient times they tried to reduce them.  These names were turned into monobasic and added to them a variety of suffixes: Gostomysl - Gostilo - Guest;  Radoslav - Rad - Radik - Radko;  Miroslav - Mirko - World and so on.  This explains the origin of Russian surnames.  Such "everyday" forms are rooted in everyday worldly names.  They can often be found in ancient letters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Derivatives on behalf of </h2><p>  Many derivative forms arose from the Slavic names Putislav ("glory" and "path") and Putimir ("world" and "path"), popular in Russia.  Many believe that the origin of the surname Putin dates back to this source.  Ancient letters refer to people named with similar names.  For example, they mention the peasant from Novgorod Putitsa Fedor (1495);  elder Tovluisky Demidov Putka (1671);  Vyshegorodsky boyar Putsha (1015);  the landowner Putilo Semenov, who lived in Spassky Pogost (1500);  Boyar of Smolensk Prince Dyadkovich Putyata (1281).  This group can also include the once-affectionate nickname Puta, which was used in one of the ancient documents to refer to a peasant living in Gorodok on Chusovaya, which is located in Great Perm.  The letter mentions Sergushka Nikulin, the son of the Way (1647). </p><h2>  Surname origin </h2><p>  In the 15-16 centuries, official naming began to appear in Russia as special, generic nicknames inherited from generation to generation.  So gradually began to form Slavic families.  The generally accepted model for their construction did not arise immediately.  But by the 17th century, most clan names were formed by adding the suffixes -in, -ov or -ev to the nickname or name of the father.  They combined with stems ending in consonants or vowels -a and -o.  Surnames in -in arose from nicknames and names ending in -i or -a.  Thus, from the secular nickname of the Way, the patrimonial naming Putin was formed.  That was such a long and entertaining story of the origin of the surname.  Its origins lurk in ancient times.  And to establish reliably when and where it first sounded is almost impossible.  Therefore, the origin of the surname Putin requires special genealogical research.  However, scientists have established that a certain Putin Kuzma was engaged in trade in 1623 in Kursk.  And in the Customs Book of the city of Voronezh for 1620, there is a trading man Denisov Fedor son Putin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Famous nicknames </h2><p>  The origin and meaning of surnames is incredibly interesting to study.  It was said above that they went back to Old Russian non-church names, very common in past centuries.  There were a lot of them.  The origin of the surname Putin can be associated with several: Putay, Putilo and Putyata.  But what do these funny nicknames mean?  Scientists suggest that this could be called a child who was born on the way, during the move of parents.  There is another version: they called the baby so that he was lying in a cradle, tangled in arms and legs with diapers.  The foundations of these surnames are connected, as already mentioned above, with the dibasic ancient names Putimysl, Putimir, Pustislav.  They were quite widespread in Russia.  However, it is believed that the nicknames Putilo, Putiato and Puti go back to the old Russian word "putney", which means "decent, sensible, good, useful." </p>

    <h2>  Trail in the Tver region </h2><p>  At one time, the origin of the name Putin was subjected to a detailed journalistic investigation.  And it led to unexpected conclusions.  In August 1, 2007, an article appeared in the Hewsland publication that wrote that our president could be related to the most famous royal families in Europe.  Interestingly, some documentary evidence of this theory was found.  Journalists failed to find a trace of the name of the current president of the Russian Federation in history.  However, it is known that Vladimir Vladimirovich had a grandfather, Ivan Spiridonovich, a native of the Tver province.  It was logical to assume that the history of the origin of the surname Putin originates in these parts.  And the fact that it is extremely rare in archival documents has led researchers to the idea that it was formed artificially and relatively recently. </p>

    <h2>  Rod Putyatin </h2><p>  In the fifth part of the genealogy book compiled for the Tver province, the princely family of the Putyatins is listed.  He gave Russia a lot of famous commanders, artists, clergy and politicians.  The Putyins were relatives of the Rurikovich and accomplished many glorious deeds for the good of the country.  Many scientists connect the history of the origin of this surname with Ivan Semenovich Dursky.  He lived in the 15th century, was a companion of Prince Svidrigailo and spoke of the nickname Putyata.  At the base of the ancient family are many famous personalities.  These include Prince Mikhail of Tver and his wife, <span>Anna Kashinskaya,</span> as well as Vladimir Krasno Solnyshko and Polovtsian princess Rogneda.  Journalists boldly suggested that the history of the origin of the Putin name is directly related to the Putyatin family.  Like, the direct descendant of the president’s grandfather could well be Admiral Efim Vasilyevich Putyatin, who died in 1883 in Paris.  Perhaps that’s why the president’s relatives were always secretive and silent, but they were very interested in the history of the origin of the surname of the ancient family. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The origin of names is often obscured by obscurity.  To open the veil of the past is a serious occupation, requiring a long and painstaking work.  There is no doubt at all that the origin of the surname we are considering has a centuries-old and entertaining history, and it can be attributed to the number of the oldest.  This testifies to the most difficult and seemingly mundane things that reach us through time in difficult ways.  Exploring the origin and meaning of family names is a great hobby for both adults and children. </p>
