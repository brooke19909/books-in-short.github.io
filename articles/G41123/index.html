There are a lot of hotels, budget hotels, children's camps and health centers.  The main and most famous resorts in Bulgaria are Golden Sands, St. Constantine and Elena, Sunny Beach, Kranevo, Pamporovo and Borovets.  The oldest and most beautiful resort is St. Konstantin and Elena.  It is considered one of the most popular on the entire coast of Bulgaria.  Its geographical location is about a few kilometers from the city of Varna and near the very noisy youth resort Golden Sands.  In ancient times, on the territory where the hotel complexes are now located, there was an ancient holy monastery, after which the name of the resort did not have to be invented.  The village was created a long time ago and was considered the most popular and famous balneological center.  The combination of sea breeze, mineral healing properties of water and heady mountain air makes this place unique.  The resort of St. Constantine and Elena is significantly different from the others in the presence of steep descents and ascents, narrow streets and rocky terrain.  There is a very steep coast, descent to the sea - only by stairs.  But this does not frighten tourists, the resort is, has been and will be the most popular and picturesque in Bulgaria. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climatic conditions here are quite comfortable, and the sea air only adds a feeling of freshness and purity.  The temperature of the water from the healing springs is approximately 42 degrees.  Incredible stories tell that water here has healing properties.  It is saturated not only with beneficial substances such as calcium and iodine, but also with various sulfates and magnesium ions. <br>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort area is located among the old ancient, but very beautiful park, in which a huge number of exotic and mysterious trees, lilies and cypresses grow.  Absolutely all the hotel complexes of this village are located on the territory of bewitching gardens, therefore there is no shortage of green spaces and fresh air on their territories.  The sea and sand here are very clean, despite the narrow coastline.  The main difference between the beach of the resort of St. Constantine and Elena is that its sand is gray.  This is no longer seen in any resort in Bulgaria.  And all because there is quartz in its composition.  Perhaps at first glance it does not look as aesthetically pleasing as it could be, but this sand has healing properties, especially for the respiratory system of the body.  There are incredibly favorable conditions for recreation and recreation of families with children and elderly tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The time of year significantly affects how much a ticket to Bulgaria will cost.  The price will be slightly higher in the summer.  In spring and autumn you can relax at a lower cost. <br><br>  The special beauty and mystery of this resort center is emphasized by: a weighty rocky coast, the presence of many coves, a steep and curved descent to the sea, narrow streets and walkways along the streets, the presence of numerous buildings.  The water in the sea is crystal clear.  For those who love extreme sports, there is the opportunity to satisfy their desires and go scuba diving or diving with a snorkel.  Underwater beauty will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  To rest brought only positive emotions, it is best to take care of staying at the resort in advance.  A worthy place of accommodation is the Lebed Hotel (Bulgaria). </p><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  The complex is located on a vast territory next to 5 other hotels.  Guests are free to move throughout the territory.  But pools and bars can be used only by those that belong to the Swan Hotel.  Each hotel issues bracelets to its customers, by which you can determine which guests of the complex you are.  In the bars of other hotels you may be served, but they may be refused.  So it‚Äôs better not to risk it. </p><p>  The area is very well maintained.  Walking on it is a pleasure.  This is especially appreciated by families with small children.  Wheelchairs are very comfortable here.  Nature lovers can even sit on the lawn. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The hotel has its own beach.  The sea and sand here are beyond praise.  A trip to the beach takes only 3 minutes.  After a hearty breakfast, you can head to the sea by stairs.  Lazy people can take a detour through the Rubin Hotel and go down by elevator there. </p><p>  The cleanliness of the beach area is carefully monitored by staff, cleaning it daily.  But there is still enough debris.  After all, guests of all 5 hotels spend their leisure time here.  It is best to swim in the morning, the water in the sea at this time is clean and warm.  After lunch, you can meet algae, especially when the sea waves.  Since the resort of St. Constantine and Elena is considered balneological, it is noticeable in every hotel in this place.  For example, a special pipe connected to a hydrogen sulfide source comes to the beach here. </p><p>  On the beach you can use sun loungers and umbrellas for free.  Mattresses are available for a fee.  Towels are issued free of charge on cards.  At the reception they change to fresh ones.  Refreshments can be made at one of the beach bars. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2>

    <p>  This hotel is definitely suitable for families with children and for senior citizens.  Young people should choose a more lively place.  From entertainment there is only evening animation and various games (volleyball, table tennis, billiards).  Excellent conditions are created for children.  There is a game club, playground, inflatable attractions.  Some of the children's entertainment are paid. </p><p>  There is practically no entertainment outside the hotel.  Nearby is a street with various shops, restaurants and supermarkets. </p><p>  Those who come here with young children should be very attentive.  Children can easily get various infections.  Varna Hospital is almost always crowded with sick children.  This can significantly overshadow your stay in Bulgaria.  Unfortunately, local hotels do not provide qualified assistance of doctors. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>
