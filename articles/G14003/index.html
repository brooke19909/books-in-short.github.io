  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Christianity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The origin of Christianity dates back to the middle of the 1st century.  AD  The emergence of this religion was associated with the difficult living conditions of the people in Palestine, who were seeking solace in the new faith.  Religious workers associate the emergence of Christianity with the preaching work of Jesus Christ. </p><p>  The history of Christianity, according to the teachings of representatives of the clergy, begins with the <span>descent of the Holy Spirit on the apostles,</span> who began to preach the teachings of Christ in different cities and localities.  Five societies arose in different territories, which came to be called Churches.  These were the Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Roman and Constantinople Churches, equal to each other. </p><p>  The first Christians were the ancient Jews (as before, the worldview - the Jews).  After the fall of Jerusalem, a period of persecution of Christians by the Romans, who were then pagans, began.  Their values ‚Äã‚Äãcompletely diverged from Christian postulates (luxury against asceticism, pride against humility, etc.).  Christianity preached temperance, monotheism, freedom, and called for mercy.  All this contradicted the way of life of the ancient Romans, which led to a complete ban on the nascent doctrine.  The followers of Jesus were tortured and executed until the year 313, when <span>Emperor Constantine</span> officially called Christianity the state faith. </p><p>  The history of Christianity since apostolic times has been associated with the Holy Fathers and teachers of the Church.  Church Fathers are writers who have become famous for the holiness of their own lives.  The teachers of the Church are writers who were not saints, but who were faithful and protected it from heretics and false prophets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the need to resolve arising complex or controversial issues over a long time, Councils were convened.  The first took place in 51 and was called Apostolic.  Later, by his example, <span>Ecumenical Councils</span> began to convene <span>.</span>  They were attended by the chief bishops and other representatives of all the churches, which were equal in position at the cathedrals.  Decisions with general decisions were recorded in the Book of Canons, which became part of the teachings of the Church. </p><p>  The First Ecumenical Council was held in 325 in Nicaea, and the second in Constantinople.  The <span>Symbol of Faith</span> was affirmed on them <span>.</span>  The last (7th) took place in 787 in the same way as the first, in Nicaea.  It approved the use of icons. </p><p>  From its inception, the history of Christianity has been associated with the scriptures that make up the scriptures. </p><p>  Since the beginning of the existence of Christian teaching, a pronounced desire for primacy appeared in the Roman Church.  The reason for this was the glory of the Roman Empire, which spread the teachings of this church.  In 1054, it separated from other churches and became known as the Roman Catholic.  The remaining churches began to call themselves Orthodox to emphasize their commitment to the original teaching. </p><p>  After 1054, the <span>Orthodox Christian</span> Church did not introduce any innovations to its teaching.  Within its framework, new national daughter churches gradually began to appear.  Over time, they gained complete independence.  For example, the Russian Orthodox Church of Constantinople and others appeared.  In them services were conducted in local languages. </p><p>  After the split, the <span>Catholic Church</span> introduced a number of changes in the tradition of Christianity.  14 ‚ÄúEcumenical Councils‚Äù appeared.  Other churches were present, and therefore they were not recognized.  The doctrine of <span>celibacy (celibacy) appeared, the</span> Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar (there were changes in the dates of the celebration of Easter).  The 8th article of Faith was changed, many posts (reduced or even abolished).  The doctrine of the infallibility of popes appeared. </p><p>  All this led to the emergence of new teachings, the departure of people from the Roman Church and the emergence of new Protestant churches, which continued the history of Christianity.  They left only the Holy Scriptures from the former religious canons, abandoning confessions, icons, fasting, veneration of saints. </p>
