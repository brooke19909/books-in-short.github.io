  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY knitting markers: a cheap alternative to the purchase option!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a beginner in needlework or a true professional, because you still need knitting markers.  It‚Äôs even easier to make them yourself than to find it in a store, so we will choose the first path that does not require extra effort.  We will collect all the materials at hand, select the appropriate ones, and then add bright details so that it is not only convenient to knit, but also beautiful! </p><h2>  Useful thing </h2><p>  If you have recently been fascinated by knitting, then we will nevertheless explain to you why this small keychain is needed, more reminiscent of decoration.  So, the marker for circular knitting, as it is called among connoisseurs of knitting, is usually used to fix certain increments, decreases or new rows. </p><p>  With their help, the product is more accurate, similar to the purchased and manufactured factory.  And if you can make hand-made knitting markers, is it worth it to overpay for their plastic version? </p><h2>  First idea: bright beads </h2><p>  How to make hand-made markers to make them bright and comfortable at the same time?  Of course, use improvised materials.  We will take this advice and collect all the necessary components of the house, thereby reducing the amount of accumulated stocks.  You will need: </p><ul><li>  A lace with a cap, such as those used on key chains, or any other dense rope. </li><li>  Beads of different colors and sizes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="comsar.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead Markers" class="if uuid-2521795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2521795.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturing process is so simple that these markers can be made in five minutes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Prepare a rope or cord in advance, fixing one of the ends so that the beads do not fly off. </li><li>  From the open end string the jewelry in the form of beads, beads and others. </li><li>  Put the second bracket on the back of the marker, it can be made of an iron ring or use hot glue.  Our knitting markers are ready.  Do it yourself with your own hands. </li></ul><h2>  The second idea: the office in motion </h2><p>  If you absolutely do not have time to create the first option, then we offer you just a wonderful alternative, the result of which cannot but please the eye.  We will make bright markers from what is on each desktop. </p><ul><li>  Pins or paper clips: it is best if they are large so as not to hamper the knitting process. </li><li>  Spray paint, acrylic paint, nail polish. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.creative-industry.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap DIY markers" class="if uuid-2521852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2521852.jpg"></div><p>  And now we bring the idea to life: </p><ul><li>  Cover the work surface with unnecessary cloth or paper and spread out all your ‚Äústationery‚Äù evenly on it. </li><li>  Spray paint on top if you are using a spray can.  Or paint the staples by hand, gently holding them with tweezers.  Do not forget the back side. </li><li>  Leave your markers to dry completely, and then safely use them when knitting.  How cool these bright colors look! </li></ul><h2>  Idea Three: Funny Rings </h2><p>  Another interesting way to make hand-made knit markers.  To do this, you will have to find all the old trinkets, key pendants.  Are needed: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Metal rings, which no, no, yes there are in some pocket.  The more you find them, the more markers you get in the end. </li><li>  Again, beads, beads, pendants and various trinkets that are a pity to throw away, but can be hung. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="comsar.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Handy Markers" class="if uuid-2521778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2521778.jpg"></div><p>  How will we use them all?  Now we will tell you: </p><ul><li>  Check the metal rings for rust so that they do not stain the yarn during operation. </li><li>  After this selection is perfect, we select the appropriate beads in size and string on the rings.  Yes, perhaps it‚Äôs not so easy to do, because you have to move one spiral from the others, but believe me, the result is worth it.  Also, be careful not to bend the ring. </li><li>  Once the accessories are in the right place, you can immediately use the markers in the work. </li></ul><h2>  Some more tips </h2><p>  So we told you how to make DIY knitting markers.  The master class is simple.  Even small children can master it, so feel free to bring them to this matter. </p><p>  It is important to recall that knitting markers (it is very simple to make them with your own hands) is only the first step to an ideal result, because practice also plays a huge role. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.dawanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Convenient knit markers" class="if uuid-2521768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2521768.jpg"></div><p>  But we can still advise you a couple of devices to facilitate this process: </p><ul><li>  Automatic row counter.  It works by clicking, thereby counting their number.  Indispensable in the event that you are interrupted during the knitting process or knit on the road, and an ordinary craftswoman would greatly simplify the life of the device. </li><li>  Tips for knitting needles.  A very useful detail if you wear knitting with you, as it eliminates the possibility of slipping loops from the knitting needles.  Cheap but cheerful. </li><li>  A large pin for knitting patterns when you need to put off a large number of loops before or after work. </li><li>  A holder for the ball, which can be made from an ordinary bucket with a lid and a small hole.  This alternative is very convenient and easily fits into any interior. </li></ul><p>  In fact, this is only a small fraction of what helps you a lot in knitting, and we helped you with what we could, with homemade markers. </p>
