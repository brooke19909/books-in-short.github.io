The inhabitants of our country survived this system and entered the new century with completely different situations.  Nevertheless, many aspects that occurred in the first half of the last century, and now continue to affect our lives.  Whether this judgment is true or not is a question, the answer to which everyone should find for himself.  Therefore, we will talk about how the power of the Bolsheviks in the country was established briefly.  And based on these facts, you yourself will be able to analyze social issues. </p><h2>  Background of the revolution </h2><p>  For starters, we will consider the events that occurred in the last days of the Russian Empire, namely, how the power of the Bolsheviks in the country was established.  1917 was the starting point in the history of the Russian people.  Then the elections to the Petrograd Soviet were held, and it was the Bolsheviks who won the most votes.  They were headed by Lenin, who was extremely belligerent in relation to the still existing power.  At the same time, he was in illegal positions.  And he believed that it was precisely getting the greatest number of votes in the ranks of workers 'and soldiers' deputies that would give him the opportunity to reach a new level of power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the power of the Bolsheviks in the country was established" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/597301.jpg" width="600"></div>

In its course, a program of rebellion of deputies and the masses against the current government was prepared.  <span>The All-Russian Revolutionary Military Committee (Military Revolutionary Committee) was formed,</span> which was headed by Vladimir Ilyich Trotsky <span>,</span> who previously supported him.  This movement also had well-known opponents - Zinoviev and Kamenev, but their voices did not become decisive in comparison with ten positive ones.  Thus, on October 22, Trotsky sent his best speakers, who were concurrently deputies, to the rallies.  The main streets of Petersburg, stations, bridges, squares were blocked.  The Bolsheviks spoke to the people with their slogans and proposals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the power of the Bolsheviks in the country was established briefly" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/597299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prosthetic Attempts </h2><p>  Two days later, after rallies were held in the entire capital, tsarist junkers banned the publication of the newspaper ‚ÄúRabochiy Put‚Äù, which was supervised by the Bolsheviks, at a central printing house.  Such a step was regarded by Lenin as a protest against the majority, which had already embarked on <span>executive power.</span>  Here, we can say, there is a turning point in history about how the power of the Bolsheviks in the camp was established.  Under the leadership of Trotsky, the <span>Winter Palace</span> was surrounded <span>.</span>  Other strategically important objects of the city were also captured.  No one showed a protest, except for a small detachment of cadets who were in the palace.  Nevertheless, their strength was small compared with the Bolsheviks, and soon the Winter fell. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beginning of work.  First congresses </h2><p>  It is possible to understand more broadly how the power of the Bolsheviks in Russia was established by studying the work of new representatives of the government.  On October 25, the Second All-Russian Congress of Workers and Military Deputies opened, most of which supported all the proposals of the Bolsheviks.  However, among the people who participated in the meetings, there were also Social Revolutionaries who did not support the aggressive mood of their opponents.  They left the event, because of which they forever lost the opportunity to adjust the actions of the new government from the inside.  As for all those remaining, who henceforth ruled under the leadership of Lenin, they adopted a new decree.  Its essence was that Russia was leaving the war without resorting to annexations and indemnities.  The decree also suggested agrarian reform, which was very beneficial for the peasants.  In the course of such proposals, the Bolsheviks completely subjugated this layer of the population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the power of the Bolsheviks was established in the country of 1917" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/597307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How Moscow Obeyed </h2><p>  It is impossible to fully disclose this topic without specifying how the Bolsheviks established power in Moscow, in the city that later became the capital of the new state.  On October 25, 1917, the Bolsheviks of the city began to gather armies and seize strategically important targets, guided by the experience of the St. Petersburg allies.  The local Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks rebuffed them, smashed troops and dispersed rallies.  Junkers acted under the leadership of Ryabtsev, and for several days luck was on the side.  However, on October 29, the Bolsheviks cleared from the junkers not only the city center, but also reached Lefortovo, after which they completely surrounded the Kremlin.  The local authorities in such conditions refused further work and military resistance, which meant surrender. </p><h2>  New Russia </h2><p>  In the remaining months of 1917, the Soviets gradually moved east.  Looking through this trend, one can see in chronological sequence how the power of the Bolsheviks in the country was established.  By the end of November, under the new slogans, all the cities adjacent to Moscow and St. Petersburg had healed.  In December, the new government became dominant in Siberia, Kazan, Astrakhan and Saratov.  At the dawn of 1918 Altai, Yakutia submitted to the Soviets, and by March, the Far East was already under the new banner.  It is worth highlighting that the new government had a huge impact on the population thanks to its agrarian reform.  Most of the population was engaged in agriculture, and the Soviets offered the people in this kind of activity very bad conditions. </p><h2>  Equalization of rights and duties </h2><p>  In November 1917, at one of the congresses, a decision was made to eliminate all existing titles, ranks and titles that gave some people the opportunity to be more powerful and influential over others.  Titles such as barons, counts, princes were eliminated, people ceased to be peasants, noblemen, bourgeois or augusts, but simply became citizens of the Russian Soviet Republic.  It is worth noting that in the process of how the power of the Bolsheviks was established, the church separated from the state, science and other branches of life.  In addition, religious equality and freedom between all citizens was established in the country.  Everyone could now profess any religion.  Or not to be a supporter of any of the gods - now it has become a personal matter for everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the power of the Bolsheviks was established" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/597318.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The importance of holding a constituent assembly </h2><p>  From the moment support was received in the affairs of most of the people, the Bolsheviks began to put pressure on the interim government.  The charges related, in particular, to the fact that the authorities delayed the holding of the constituent assembly.  Because the Bolsheviks took everything into their own hands and themselves held this event.  To their great surprise, the people supported the right-wing political forces, but they gathered a much smaller number of votes.  As a result of this, a declaration was compiled that stated everything that had been done for the exploited people over the past time, and also painted plans for the future.  Soon the people, and most importantly the military class, supported this party and completely rejected the policies of the Mensheviks and other right-wingers.  Nevertheless, the deputies who were against the Bolsheviks, nevertheless insisted that the declaration had no political value, and did not recognize it.  Because of this, they left the meeting, while pulling along most of the military deputies.  As a result, the meeting was dissolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the power of the Bolsheviks in Russia was established" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/597303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After these events, to assume how the power of the Bolsheviks was established in the country further is no longer so difficult.  All the deputies who were members of the Soviet party became one, they were fully supported by the people.  On the right side there were insignificant attempts to create another military conflict, but they were unsuccessful, and soon the power of the Bolsheviks became the only and indestructible in our lands. </p>
