In a small area there are meadows, taiga and mountain ranges, which are considered sacred among the local population.  Yenisei flows through Khakassia - one of the largest Siberian rivers.  There are all conditions for a good winter holiday, one of the directions of which is winter fishing.  The ski resort ‚ÄúPriiskovy‚Äù is also very popular. </p><h2>  Winter Paradise for Freeriders </h2><p>  A small village is located on the slopes of the <span>Kuznetsk Alatau</span> mountain range <span>.</span>  Its history began in 1834, when gold deposits were discovered in Khakassia.  Mining of precious metal was carried out until the mid 90s of the last century, then the mine was closed and the village would have been deserted if it had not been discovered by freeriders, lovers of skiing from wild, unequipped mountain slopes. </p>

    <p>  Since then, the village has become a real paradise for them, and pure deep snow brought the village more popularity than gold mining.  At the site of the former mine, the Priiskovy recreation center was opened.  In two-story wooden houses there are no more than 1000 people.  Fans of ski slopes have chosen for themselves the former premises of the village hospital.  It was converted into a hotel, for which the name "Hospital" was preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Snow happiness </h2><p>  Due to the unique climatic conditions, the Priiskovy recreation center is a godsend for lovers of unspoilt mountain slopes.  Snow appears here in October and lies until June.  As a result of snowfall, the snow cover is constantly updated and has a sufficiently large thickness.  There is not much vegetation on the mountains.  Mostly these are shrubs and spruce with birch trees, which do not pose a great danger to skiers.  All freeriders before the descent receive radios and avalanche equipment, although the danger of avalanches is low. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúMining‚Äù is a ski resort, the photos of which show us all the grandeur and beauty of the snow-capped mountains.  It is also called snowy Eldorado.  The descent begins at 9 a.m. and ends at 6 p.m.  During this time, freeriders make 8-10 runs.  Mountain slopes have a slope of 20 to 45 ¬∞, so a smooth descent occurs at medium speed.  The safety of thrill-seekers is monitored by instructors, and in the case of a minor injury, they can help with the available means available in the medicine cabinet.  In case of serious injury, the victims are taken to the hospital of the village of Kopievo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trails </h2><p>  Ski resort "Priiskovy" is not equipped with ski lifts, ski slopes are not laid.  A snowcat delivers 10 people to the top of the extreme mountain.  He meets them below and takes them to the top again. </p><p>  Mountain trails start 200 meters from the "Hospital".

    <p>  The second mountain range also includes 5 mountains, but their height varies from 1353 m (Mount Tumannaya) to 1674 m (Mount Bobrovaya).  The shortest descent is 700 meters and the largest is 1,500 meters.  Both experienced skiers and beginner freeriders can ride on the slopes.  Each descent has its own characteristics, so athletes get new riding experiences every day.  On some slopes there is a rocky terrain that adds extreme downhill.  According to the reviews of many thrill-seekers, emotions just go wild. </p><h2>  Accommodation in the "Hospital" </h2><p>  Ski resort "Priiskovy" provides relaxation with accommodation in a mini-hotel "Hospital-resort".  The enterprising owners of the hotel were able to adapt and beat the old building into a modern room.  The hotel has 15 rooms, which are called wards here, and all tourists receive the status of "patients". </p><p>  Many of them, having visited once in such a "Hospital", become its regular customers.  "Chambers" are adapted to accommodate 2-3 people.  The hotel has a lounge with a TV and a large sofa 14 meters long.  It offers guests a sauna and a Japanese bath, toilets, showers, clothes dryers, as well as a room with stands for storing skis and equipment. </p>
