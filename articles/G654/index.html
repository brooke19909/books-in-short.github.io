    <h2>  Photo Features </h2><p>  3 ha is the area occupied by the Dessole Saadia Resort 3 * hotel.  Photos on such a large territory, of course, there is where to make, especially when you consider that it is buried in numerous palm trees, flowers and other plants.  All the rooms of the hotel look great too, so vacationers can take pictures in its bars, restaurants, halls and rooms.  It is important not to forget the camera when going to the beach.  After all, while relaxing at sea, you simply have to replenish your photo album with another photo from summer vacation, which for many years will remind you of how wonderful you spent it. </p><p>  Tunisia is one of the countries that are able to surprise tourists with its mere existence.  Everything is unusual for them here - both at home, and streets, and transport, and people, and so on.  Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt matter where you go - to walk along the beach, take a walk along Monastir or get acquainted with the sights accompanied by an experienced guide, be sure to bring a camera with you.  Believe me, such opportunities for "photo hunting", as in Tunisia, are very rare where. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  During the existence of Dessole Saadia Resort 3 * (Tunisia), tourists from Russia rested there more than once.  And even if not all, then many of them shared their impressions of the hotel, its staff and Tunisia in general.  Thanks to this, today it is already possible to get the most vivid idea about this hotel and the country before the trip.  Although it is necessary to make an adjustment to the fact that all opinions are subjective. </p><p>  Perhaps, it is worth starting from what reviews Russian tourists leave about the territory and hotel rooms.  Everyone notes the abundance of greenery, a cozy exterior and interior of the hotel.  The rooms, as stated, is cleaned daily, so it is always clean.  However, according to some vacationers, sometimes in the bathroom you can see cockroaches and ants, which is very unpleasant. </p><p>  As for food, tourists claim that it is tasty, although monotonous.  There are seafood, cereals, meat, fruits.  But the majority of the people were not satisfied with the drinks in the bar, as they consist mainly of ice.  Not the best impression was on vacationers about the beach: often dirty water, lots of algae and jellyfish.  But the animation at the hotel is satisfied, without exception.  It is argued that animators throughout the day and evening constantly think out what to do with both adults and children. </p>
