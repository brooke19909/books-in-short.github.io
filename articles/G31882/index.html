In this city there are two temples that are consecrated in the name of Prince Vladimir.  In this regard, confusion often occurs.  It will be about the Vladimir Cathedral - the tomb of the admirals in Sevastopol. </p><h2>  Let's look at the pages of history </h2><p>  Planning for the construction of the temple began with the perpetuation of the baptism of Prince Vladimir back in 988, in the city of Khersones.  But in 1842, Admiral M.P. Lazarev turned to Nicholas I with a request to rebuild the cathedral not in Khersones, but in Sevastopol, on a city hill.  <span>Vladimir Cathedral, the</span> tomb of the admirals, was built on voluntary donations.  At that time, more than once announced the collection of funds throughout Russia for the erection of the temple.  Construction began in 1848, but, unfortunately, work was suspended in 1854 in connection with the outbreak of the Crimean War.  History decreed that later this place became the tomb for the admirals of Sevastopol.  Admiral Lazarev was the first to be buried in the crypt, which was specially built.  During the Crimean War, his comrades and students were buried there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sevastopol.lemonp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Cathedral-tomb of the admirals" class="if uuid-2761468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2761468.jpg"></div><p>  Resumed construction work in 1858.  The burial place was designated with a marble cross.  Over time, about 72 names of naval servants were applied to the plates.  So Vladimir Cathedral became a monument not only to the baptist of Russia, but also to the heroes of the Crimean War and the defense of Sevastopol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1932 the temple was closed.  Atelier, workshops and warehouses were located in it.  During the Great Patriotic War, the building was seriously damaged.  And only 30 years later they decided to revive it.  After another 8 years, the monastery was transferred to the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol.  This was the beginning of a study of the history of the temple and the restoration of the building.  October 20, 1991 Vladimir Cathedral was re-consecrated.  Divine services resumed.  Today, the customs of the tomb of the admirals of Sevastopol continue to live.  The priest consecrated St. Andrew's flags and even pennants of ships.  Every year, May 13, a prayer service is held, which is dedicated to the founding of the Black Sea Fleet, and funeral services for the dead defenders in the war years take place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crimeaburo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Vladimir Cathedral" class="if uuid-2761434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2761434.jpg"></div><h2>  Crimean War </h2><p>  The main and main reason for the beginning of the Crimean War is the clash of interests of several powers: France, England, Russia and Austria.  All these countries sought Turkish possessions in order to increase market sales.  But at the same time, Turkey in various ways wanted to prevail after losing in battles with Russia.  The Crimean War led to the following: </p><ul><li>  Sevastopol returned to Russia in exchange for Kars (Turkish fortress). </li><li>  The Black Sea has assumed a neutral status.  This deprived Turkey and Russia of the opportunity to place a navy in this place and build coastal fortifications. </li><li>  There was a transfer of land located at the mouth of the Danube, Moldova. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean War" class="if uuid-2760371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102885/2760371.jpg"></div><h2>  Defense of Sevastopol </h2><p>  The defense of Sevastopol was a turning point during the Crimean War.  The purpose of the Anglo-French fleet was the capture of Sevastopol.  Three admirals, Nakhimov, Kornilov and Istomin, took control of the defense of Sevastopol.  A settlement fortification scheme was created thanks to General Totleben.  Bastions have been built, providing housing for soldiers.  The defense of Sevastopol went down in history as one of the majestic and tragic events in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tracesofwar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="defense of Sevastopol" class="if uuid-2760384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102885/2760384.jpg"></div><h2>  Crimean War Video </h2><p>  You can learn more about this event from the video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="zr9gRQx_DbI" data-url="https://youtu.be/zr9gRQx_DbI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/0/8/0/8080.jpg"></div><p>  There are several prominent admirals of Sevastopol, whose biographies will be useful to know. </p><h2>  Philip Sergeevich Oktyabrsky </h2><p>  On October 23, 1899, one of the great admirals of Sevastopol, Philip Sergeyevich Oktyabrsky, was born.  He was brought up in a peasant, poor family.  When the boy grew up, he was sent to study at a local village school, where he graduated from grade 4.

After 12 months, he leads the Black Sea Fleet.  During this period, the Great Patriotic War begins.  Filipp Sergeevich later led the defense of Sevastopol and Odessa.  At the same time, he was the commander of the Sevastopol defensive region.  In the summer of 1943, he leaves the post of leader of the Black Sea Fleet. </p><p>  In the period from 1943 to 1944 he was the commander of the Amur Flotilla.  Then he again became commander of the Black Sea Fleet and made every effort to liberate the Crimea and the Caucasus.  After the war, he remained the head of the fleet.  Since 1948, Oktyabrsky continued to occupy high positions.  In 1954, Philip Sergeyevich fell ill and temporarily left the service.  But after 3 years he returned as if nothing had happened.  In 1958, Oktyabrsky was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  In the city of Sevastopol, he lived his last years.  On July 8, 1969, Philip Sergeyevich Oktyabrsky died.  Residents of the city and the military of the Black Sea Fleet buried the war hero in the cemetery of Kommunarov.  A street in the city of Sevastopol Admiral of October is named after Philip Sergeyevich. </p><h2>  Vladimir Georgievich Fadeev </h2><p>  There is another street in Sevastopol - Admiral Fadeev.  Vladimir Georgievich Fadeev was born on July 10, 1904.  He began his service as a young man in 1920.  During this time, he managed to take part in the Civil War.  In 1941, Fadeev became a member of the CPSU (b).

He was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery. </p><h2>  Stepan Osipovich Makarov </h2><p>  In the cold winter, January 8, 1848, in the city of Nikolaev, S.O. Makarov was born into a poor family.  He was not of noble blood, which means that he began his career on ordinary ships, holding low positions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="encyclopedia.mil.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://encyclopedia.mil.ru/encyclopedia/history/more.htm?id=11888081@cmsArticle"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Makarov" class="if uuid-2748231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102885/2748231.jpg"></div><p>  Stepan Osipovich went on his first voyage in 1862, on the ships of the Siberian Flotilla.  On the Pacific squadron came in 1863.  Later, he went on long trips, including to the United States, on the corps ‚ÄúBogatyr‚Äù.  In 1865, in the spring, exams began at the <span>educational institution</span> where Makarov studied.  Stepan passed them the fastest.  Only excellent marks in his studies could allow him to claim high ranks, and not lower ones, as was prescribed in the charter of the school.  But not everything was as beautiful as it seemed at first.  Again, the lack of noble origin prevented him. </p><p>  In order to enter the midshipmen, it was required to pass exams in subjects that were not studied at the school.  In addition, you had to have practical experience in swimming.  The family didn‚Äôt have money for either.  Therefore, Makarov did not go anywhere further.  Over time, Stepan Osipovich was able to climb the career ladder thanks to the knowledge that was obtained in the process of self-training, success in battles and research activities.  In the fall, in November 1866, the corvette unexpectedly received orders to leave for Kronstadt.  It was here that Stepan Osipovich managed to pass exams and enter the midshipmen. </p><p>  Makarov became a real hero in the Russian-Turkish war.  He was lucky to become a member of the Akhal-Tekinsky expedition.  He organized the delivery of supplies to Krasnovodsk from Astrakhan.  After some time, he was overtaken by the fate of a research sailor. </p><p>  He brought many benefits to this world.  And if he had not died, then he did even more.  During the Russo-Japanese War, the battleship Petropalovsk was blown up on an enemy mine.  Most of the crew died, including Stepan Osipovich Makarov.  On July 24, 1913, a monument to Stepan Osipovich was erected in Kronstadt with the inscription ‚ÄúRemember the war!‚Äù  A street named after Admiral Makarov also exists in Sevastopol. </p><h2>  Pavel Alexandrovich Pereleshin </h2><p>  After graduating in 1835 in the Marine Corps, Pereleshin was sent to the Baltic Sea.  Later appointed midshipman of the Black Sea Fleet.  In 1839, he took part in the landing, after which he received the Order of St. Anne for courage and courage.

He was the head of the 5th branch of the defensive line of Sevastopol. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gradkostroma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Pereleshin" class="if uuid-2748236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102885/2748236.jpg"></div><p>  Pavel Alexandrovich was wounded in the left temple, and later in the head and arm.  But despite this, he was able to command other courts: ‚ÄúDo not touch me!‚Äù  and ‚ÄúVladimir‚Äù.  Pereleshin for all his life received all the existing Russian and foreign orders.  In honor of Admiral Pereleshin, a street is also named in Sevastopol. </p>
