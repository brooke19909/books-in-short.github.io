Drying and curling their hair is certainly very convenient, but it is worth remembering that some models are not intended for daily use.  This article presents the best hair dryers for curling hair from a variety of brands. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the purchase of a hair dryer for curling requires some knowledge.  So, first of all, the buyer should pay attention to the power of the selected product.  The optimum value of this indicator is considered to be power from 1,400 to 1,800 watts.  There are models with higher power.  Their use can lead to severe hair overdrying. </p><p>  Choosing a hair dryer, do not forget about its functions.  The third most important criterion is considered such an indicator as weight.  There is an opinion that the heavier the hair dryer for curling, the better the styling result.  It is also important to pay attention to the body material of the device.  If it is made of heat-resistant plastic, then the device can be bought without fear.  If not, then the buyer may not count on the long service life of such a hairdryer with a hair curler. </p><p>  And finally, it is recommended to pay attention to the number of attached nozzles.  As a rule, a curling iron-hair dryer should have at least two nozzles.  But it is better to choose the one that has more of them.  This will expand the range of possible styling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goods.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hair dryer" class="if uuid-3123209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123209.jpg"></div><h2>  Top best manufacturers of hair dryers for curlers </h2><p>  The market has a huge number of devices of this type from different brands.  Despite this, only 5 brands appeared in the list of the best.  Among them is BaByliss.  The best model of this brand is the Babyliss BeLiss brushing 2736E hair dryer.  Also a worthy place is taken by brushes from Philips, Braun, Scarlett, Polaris.  Reviews and a detailed description of the best models of these manufacturers are presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tr.eyeni.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hair dryer" class="if uuid-3123206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123206.jpg"></div><h2>  Babyliss BeLiss brushing 2736E hair dryer </h2><p>  This model takes first place in the ranking of the best devices for this purpose.  She earned her leadership position thanks to a huge number of advantages.  According to users, working with her is a pleasure.  So, in a set with a hairdryer there are four nozzles.  Each of them performs different functions.  On each nozzle, only natural bristles are used.  One of the four is a hub.  It makes it possible to pre-dry hair.  The device for straightening hair does its job extremely carefully, due to the presence of ceramic teeth.  For twisting curls, the set includes ceramic brushes of different diameters.  In the process of using the girls were able to highlight a number of advantages and disadvantages of this device. </p><p>  Babyliss hair dryer brush has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  extensive features included in the set of nozzles; </li><li>  the device does not overheat hair thanks to an innovative ceramic coating; </li><li>  ionization; </li><li>  convenient container for carrying a hair dryer; </li><li>  two-vector rotation; </li><li>  lack of gaps when attaching any nozzle; </li><li>  long cord equipped with a rotation function. </li></ul><p>  With regard to the shortcomings, users felt that the hair dryer of this brand is somewhat heavy and quite expensive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="expertpovolosam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hair dryer" class="if uuid-3123207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123207.jpg"></div><h2>  Philips HP8657 / 00 Hair Dryer </h2><p>  This device is worthy of the second place in the <span>ranking of the best hair dryers</span> for curling hair.  The first thing you should pay attention to when considering it is the variety of attached nozzles.  There are five of them in the set, and each of them carries out its work very carefully.  This is ensured by keratin-tourmaline treatment.  With the help of nozzles, you can not only create curls of different diameters, but also dry and straighten your hair. </p><p>  This model also did not do without user ratings.  The girls who used it did not like that the hairdryer was very heavy and had only two temperature conditions.  Also, in their opinion, the device is very noisy in operation.  Some have noticed that villi are too rarely planted on the nozzles of this hairdryer, which leads to the presence of very large partings.  But despite a number of disadvantages, the advantages of the curling iron are much greater.  These include: </p><ul><li>  innovative coating of nozzles; </li><li>  the presence of convenient holes for hanging; </li><li>  broad focus; </li><li>  the presence of a protective brush; </li><li>  warranty for operation (2 years); </li><li>  convenient cleaning due to retraction of cloves; </li><li>  sufficient device power. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="smartfashionbeauty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hairdryer and bottle" class="if uuid-3123210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123210.jpg"></div><h2>  Braun AS 530 MN Black </h2><p>  In third place, Braun's hair dryer is confidently located.  He deserved this position with his high power and reliability.  With him, hair is laid in the hairstyle in just five minutes.  This model is especially suitable for owners of dry hair.  The fact is that the Braun AS 530 MN Black has a wonderful function of supplying steam during installation.  Another option of the curling iron helps to fix the image successfully - a strong stream of cold air. </p><p>  The kit includes three nozzles.  Their selection is very successful and allows you to experiment with various hairstyles.  Volumetric curls, small curls, various styling - all this can be done using this brush in a few minutes.  A successful feature of the device is the presence of three modes of air supply and temperature changes. </p><p>  According to reviews, this model pleases users with its lightness, a wide range of functions, a variety of nozzles and the presence of a mesh filter.  In the process of use, such disadvantages as the inconvenience of turning off cold air and the too protruding steam supply section were noticed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poradum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brush hair dryer" class="if uuid-3123212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123212.jpg"></div><h2>  Scarlett Hair Dryer SC-HAS73I09 </h2><p>  The fourth place of honor was taken by the Scarlett SC-HAS73I09 hair dryer.  This model is not much inferior to its competitors.  Although it has less power, with its help it is also simple and easy to make a variety of styling.  The hair dryer comes in a set with four nozzles.  With their help, you can dry the strands, straighten them, create stylish curls or give your hair a beautiful volume.  The device is equipped with an ionization system.  This option helps to saturate the hair with the necessary negative ions.  Thanks to this, the hairstyle is not electrified and retains its natural shine.  The air flow in this hairdryer is regulated using two modes.  According to reviews about it, we can safely say that the advantages of the device include: </p><ul><li>  many diverse nozzles; </li><li>  ionization option; </li><li>  swivel wire; </li><li>  the ability to supply chilled air flow; </li><li>  average weight. </li></ul><p>  As for the shortcomings, they were identified in the process of using the device.  These include a short cord and an insufficient number of operating modes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cmp24.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="babyliss hair dryer" class="if uuid-3123211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123211.jpg"></div><h2>  Hair Dryer Polaris PHS 0746 Lilac / Metal Silver </h2><p>  Fifth place in the list of top hair dryers is the Polaris PHS 0746 Lilac / Metal Silver brush.  She got her place of honor thanks to the high quality, which correlates perfectly with the price.  It is worth noting that the power of this device is the lowest in comparison with other representatives of the list.  But this does not stop the hairdryer from making excellent styling. </p><p>  As for the configuration, the set includes only two nozzles.  Their purpose is the ability to create styling and give it volume.  Despite the fact that the hairdryer has few nozzles, it has a very important plus - three modes of temperature and air supply.  In addition to a modest configuration, the lack of an ionization mode is attributed to the disadvantages of the device.  As for the benefits, the hairdryer has a lot of them.  Among them are a stylish design, compactness, environmental friendliness, a system to prevent overheating, sufficient power and more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chebo.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curling hair with a bottle and hairdryer" class="if uuid-3123214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3123214.jpg"></div><h2>  Hair Dryer Tips </h2><p>  For those who want to create stylish curls with their own hands, there are a few tips.  The first - classic - involves the use of curlers.  It is best to wind wet hair on them, fixed with mousse.  Then the hair should be dried with a hairdryer and the curlers removed.  Curls are ready. </p><p>  As for the second tip, beauty bloggers decided to use a plastic bottle to implement it.  Curling hair with a hairdryer and a bottle is carried out according to the following principle: </p><ol><li>  A plastic container cuts off the neck and cuts a vertical hole on the side.  The hole should hold the neck of the hair dryer. </li><li>  A strand of hair is pushed into the bottle.  A hairdryer is inserted into the hole. </li><li>  The hair dryer turns on for 10 seconds. </li><li>  A lock is taken out of the bottle. </li></ol><p>  In order for the hair curling with the help of a bottle and a hairdryer to be as effective as possible, it is recommended to coat the hair with special fixators.  The result from this procedure amazes absolutely everyone. </p>
