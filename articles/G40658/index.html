It was formed in 1938, and received its modern name on September 12, 1957.  From that moment, the settlement began to develop rapidly, and after the collapse of the USSR, it received the status of the State Russian Center for Atomic Shipbuilding.  The profile factories of the city survived the crisis of the 90s.  Today they are actively working and developing.  Sights of Severodvinsk are mostly associated with the history of the city and its national significance. </p>

This also includes the Nyonok temple complex.  It was originally built in the 14th century, but did not survive to this day.  Already in the 17th century it was erected by the North Seaers again from the best Arkhangelsk forest.  There are no analogues to these buildings in any city in the country.  To date, the complex is subject to reconstruction and detailed study.  It is believed that the person who built the Nenok temple was illiterate.  This fact only increases the value of the building, which has stood for more than one hundred years.  This complex attracts many tourists to Severodvinsk.  Sights, photos of which are presented in the article, amaze with their pristine beauty.  What is the Theater Lake, pictured below. </p>

    <h2>  Nicholas Korelsky Monastery </h2><p>  The year of foundation of the monastery is considered to be the 1419th.  This date is mentioned in ancient chronicles.  The construction of the shrine was carried out by those who, fleeing from the persecution of the authorities, were forced to seek refuge on the White Sea.  It was here that the unwanted people of that time were sent into exile.  Within the walls of the monastery, Orthodox monks did not always live.  There was a time when even a children's colony was located here.  Currently, the monastery is gradually being restored after the ruin in the 30s.  Sights of Severodvinsk, which include the St. Nicholas Korelsky Monastery, will remain in memory for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Severodvinsk Attractions Photos" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1452453.jpg" width="550"></div>

It is a large stone with a metal board, the text on which says that the English captain was in this place.  According to historical information, it was after his visit that relations between Russia and England were established. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Severodvinsk photo with names" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1452454.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Embankment of Alexander Zryachev </h2><p>  In honor of the honorary citizen and shipbuilder of the city of Severodvinsk, the embankment was named.  This is a favorite walking place of all local residents and visitors.  Asphalt paths, cozy benches, green spaces - all this awaits you on the city's waterfront. </p><h2>  Chapel of the Blessed Prince Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  If you find yourself on the shores of the White Sea, be sure to visit the city of Severodvinsk.  The sights of the village are connected with interesting and memorable events of our country.  In honor of the patrons of the city - Euphemia, Anthony and Felix - in May 2000, the chapel of Alexander Nevsky was founded.  The construction was organized at the expense of the citizens themselves with the support of the city administration.  The construction was timed to the 55th anniversary of the victory in World War II.  The first divine liturgy and the illumination of the chapel took place 6 years later, in December 2006.  From this day the doors of the chapel are always open for both locals and visitors alike. </p><h2>  Church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker </h2><p>  The history of the temple is not quite ordinary.  Initially, there was a kindergarten on the site of the shrine, part of which local authorities placed at the disposal of the Orthodox community of Severodvinsk.  Over time, the entire premises was given for the future temple.  In the 90s of the 20th century, the church was consecrated.  From that moment, the building was reconstructed and repaired.  If you decide to explore the sights of Severodvinsk, photos with the names placed in the article will help you navigate easier. </p>

    <h2>  Church of the Ascension of Christ </h2><p>  Formed in the 90s, the Christian community of Severodvinsk was faced with the problem of the lack of a suitable place for worship.  Since it took a lot of money to build a new church, it was decided to use the existing one.  For this purpose, a shrine from a neighboring village was transported to the city.  The church was to be carefully dismantled and transported to a new place.  During these works, the Icon of the Mother of God "Sign" was discovered.  This event was perceived as a sign that the decision to transport the church was the only right one and gave the temple a new life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Severodvinsk" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1452452.jpg" width="600"></div>
