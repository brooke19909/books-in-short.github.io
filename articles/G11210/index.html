    <p>  The “Save” program from the <span>largest bank in Russia</span> is primarily aimed at people who plan to accumulate funds for a major purchase.  Interest on the deposited amount of funds is calculated according to a complex scheme.  If the owner of the deposit does not withdraw the accruals, they are added to the main deposit amount and in the subsequent period, the accrual is made on the deposit amount itself plus interest.  Capitalization allows you to get the maximum benefit from a partnership with the bank.  Now it’s easy and simple not only to save your funds, but also to significantly increase them.  “Save” deposit Sberbank offers for those customers who are serious about planning for the future and care about tomorrow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General terms and conditions of deposit </h2>

    <p>  This program is designed for a period of 1 month to three years inclusive.  The minimum partnership period is due to the fact that interest is accrued on a monthly basis.  “Save” deposit Sberbank offers to open in one of three currencies: dollars, euros and rubles.  Depending on the chosen currency and on the duration of the partnership, an interest rate will be selected.  The terms of the “Save” deposit at Sberbank do not provide for the possibility of replenishment.  Partial withdrawals are not available.  The minimum deposit amount depends on the currency.  At least 1000 monetary units must be put into ruble accounts, from $ 100 and 100 euros, respectively, into dollar and euro accounts.  The maximum amount for funds that may be located on the account is not provided.  The maximum deposit rate is available either to pensioners or to people who have deposited more than 2 million rubles or 100 thousand dollars, 100 thousand euros for a period of 3 years. </p><h2>  What percent does the contribution provide? </h2><p>  “Save” deposit Sberbank has made very flexible.  <span>The interest rate</span> on the deposit will be formed depending on several factors: the currency of the account, the duration of the partnership, the amount of funds deposited into the account.

    <h2>  Early <span>termination of</span> the partnership agreement and its extension </h2><p>  If the client of the bank decides to terminate the partnership agreement ahead of schedule, when considering the situation, attention will be paid to the period for which it was originally planned to deposit funds.  If the planned cooperation was executed for a period of up to 6 months, then all the calculated interest from the moment of signing the documents until the termination of the partnership will be paid, but at the deposit rate of “Demand”.  If the client has placed funds for a period of 6 months or more, the percentage paid when the partnership is broken will correspond to 2/3 of the current rate.  In any situation, termination of the contract with the bank is called problematic. </p>

    <p>  If the client does not withdraw his savings at the end of the partnership, the partnership continues automatically.  The terms for which the client first placed his funds are saved, but the rate can be changed if new partnership conditions apply at the time of deposit extension.  If you wish to continue cooperation with a financial institution, you do not need to submit a statement.  Limitations in terms of the number of deposit renewals are not provided by Sberbank.  The “Save” deposit for pensioners is extended or terminated on similar conditions.  If a person, due to certain circumstances, did not manage to withdraw the deposit before the start of the extension procedure, it will be necessary to draw up the termination of the contract on general terms. </p><h2>  Benefits of the “Save” deposit and partnership with Sberbank </h2>

    <p>  Considering deposits in the domestic financial market, we can talk about the unique attractiveness of the programs that Sberbank of Russia offers.  The “Save” deposit, with one of the largest interests on the market, is a new product adapted to the needs of modern people.  A flexible partnership scheme and an insignificant initial deposit can be noted, which makes the offer accessible to most residents of Russia.  Preferential conditions for senior citizens can increase capital.  An individual approach to each and the ability to save money not only in rubles but also in dollars or euros is a kind of opportunity to differentiate risks.  The convenience of the partnership is provided by the ability to open a deposit at any time on the Internet.  We add that it is Sberbank that has the status of the most reliable bank in Russia. </p>
