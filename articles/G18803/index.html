It consists of five monolithic tower houses, around which there is no infrastructure.  Buyers are offered to purchase apartments and apartments.  The developer is the company "Krost", which specializes in housing business and comfort class.  In this article, we will talk about the main features of this residential complex, give reviews of real interest holders who decided to buy apartments here. </p><h2>  About the residential complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="msk.restate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residents reviews about LCD Nevsky" class="if uuid-3077481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077481.jpg"></div><p>  The key features of the Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium are a unique architectural style, which resembles a seaport, relevant interiors, the availability of a large number of layouts, proximity to the metro. </p><p>  This residential complex is another project of one of the most respected and famous metropolitan developers.  It is noteworthy that he is full of surprises.  Externally, the Nevsky LCD at the Water Stadium resembles a modern business center, however, once in any of the vestibules, the visitor is immediately transported to the chic retro-style ocean cruise liner interiors. </p><p>  It becomes even more interesting if you carefully study the master plan for development.  In this case, it turns out that the entire architectural composition of the Nevsky residential complex at the Water Stadium is a large-scale seaport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that such an exclusive aesthetics, obviously, had an impact on the cost per square meter in the new building.  On average, a one-room apartment will cost six to seven million rubles.  For this money, the owner will become the owner of an interesting and attractive surroundings, developed infrastructure in a residential neighborhood, a metro station within walking distance. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Information about LCD Nevsky" class="if uuid-3077482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077482.jpg"></div><p>  When describing the Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this is an area with a developed transport network.  The name chosen for the residential complex looks symbolic.  After all, the Leningradskoye Highway is nearby, which is considered a kind of "bridge" between the two Russian capitals.  The names of neighboring streets even say about the city on the Neva - Kronstadt Boulevard, Vyborgskaya, named after Admiral Makarov. </p><p>  Voikovsky district, where the residential complex is located, always had a developed infrastructure.  There are also many industrial enterprises, which negatively affects the general environmental background.  The Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium is also famous for the fact that several major routes pass through it, for example, the Third Transport Ring is eight kilometers away, and it is about 11 km to the Moscow Ring Road. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A residential complex is being built on the site of the Brattsevo industrial zone.  This territory was reorganized, and in 2015, the city authorities transferred it to residential development.  Some may be confused by the proximity to the Golovinsky cemetery, which is even visible from the upper floors of high-rise buildings.  Other unpleasant "neighbors" can be considered a current pre-trial detention center, which is part of the Russian Federation‚Äôs sentence enforcement department. </p><p>  Despite such a mixed development, the photo of the Nevsky LCD at the Water Stadium looks quite presentable.  In addition, several more residential complexes of comfort and business class are located nearby. </p><h2>  Address </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8353366" data-lng="37.49602930000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/0/4/14304.png"></div><p>  All additional information about the Nevsky LCD at the Water Stadium can be obtained at the sales office located at the facility.  His address: Vyborgskaya street, house 7, building 2. </p><p>  The cozy room, renovated in the style of the wardroom on the ship, is located on the 22nd floor.  Demand for apartments in the residential complex is large, because of this, managers have a high load, so reception is carried out only by appointment. </p><p>  During this visit, you can get additional information about the features of the new building, ask all your questions.  According to the results of the meeting, you can choose an apartment for your budget, clarify all the details, discuss the conditions of sale. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On weekdays, managers work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., on Saturday they start working an hour later, and on Sunday - from 11 a.m. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Judging by the feedback from real estate investors about the Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium, it will not be difficult to get to these new buildings. You can use public or private transport for this. </p><p>  Leningradskoye Shosse is 650 meters from the residential complex.  On this highway in a quarter of an hour you can reach the Third Ring Road.  However, this is without taking into account traffic jams that regularly occur in this direction. </p><p>  Therefore, many new settlers prefer the subway.  Moreover, the Water Stadium station of the Zamoskvoretskaya line is located within walking distance (about 5-7 minutes walk). </p><p>  Four kilometers from the residential complex to the trains that follow the Riga direction.  From the station "Leningradskaya" you can leave for the Moscow region. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress LCD Nevsky" class="if uuid-3077484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077484.jpg"></div><p>  ADM Limited Liability Company, which is the developer of the residential complex, was registered in 2011.  At the same time, the developer of the facility is the well-known Krost group of companies.  This reputable organization specializes in the construction of business and comfort class housing. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the projects of this company is the original architectural solutions.  Housing from the developer can always be recognized by interesting and bold design decisions. </p><p>  The developer has a good reputation.  He rents all his objects on time.  Moreover, if you believe the feedback from real estate investors in the Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium and other new buildings of this company, there are no serious complaints about the quality of work for them. </p><p>  The land plot of the developer is owned.  This means that when you buy an apartment, you automatically become the owner of the land under the house. </p><p>  In accordance with the general plan, all five tower-type houses will be equipped with underground parking lots.  The first two buildings were commissioned at the end of 2016.  It is planned to complete the work on the remaining three in the fourth quarter of 2019. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrprice.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews holders about LCD Nevsky" class="if uuid-3077483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077483.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of residents a large selection of layouts in this residential complex.  In addition to standard apartments, here are hotel-type rooms that automatically translate this object into the status of a multifunctional center.  The apartments presented here are proposed for use as offices, coworking, second housing or studios. </p><p>  Having studied the general information about the Nevsky residential complex at the Water Stadium, it should be recognized that only people with a high or at least average income can buy apartments here.  The cheapest studio apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã35 square meters will cost more than six million rubles.  The price of the most expensive housing is more than 20 million. </p><p>  The most budget option is a small apartment, which will cost about five million rubles.  However, such areas have the status of non-residential premises.  You can only register them temporarily, and then renew your right to stay every five years.  In addition, you have to pay rather high taxes for apartments. </p><p>  Apartments are for rent in a free layout.  Internal ceilings, as a rule, are absent, which allows you to equip your home as you like.  This is especially beneficial if you intend to make repairs on an individual design project. </p><p>  Most of the apartments for sale are presented in today's popular European version with combined kitchen and living room.  There are not only standard rooms with a regular rectangular shape, but also original options in curved sections of the buildings.  Bathrooms combined.  About four square meters are reserved for them.  Most apartments have storage rooms, with no loggias or balconies provided. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Nevsky" class="if uuid-3077480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077480.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of the Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium, construction of its own infrastructure in the residential complex is not expected.  However, in the Voikovsky district itself there is everything necessary for a full life.  First of all, there are many cultural, social, sports and entertainment facilities. </p><p>  Directly within walking distance there are ten kindergartens, five schools, and a clinic is located about two kilometers away. </p><p>  On the street of Admiral Makarov there is a shopping gallery "Nevsky berth", where you can go shopping.  Here you will find two dozen fashion shops, a beauty salon, a branch of Sberbank, on the upper floors there are cafes and restaurants on the terrace. </p><p>  Another place for purchases is the Vodny shopping center, which is located on Kronstadt Boulevard.  You can get to him on foot in about a quarter of an hour.  Here, on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 50 thousand square meters, there are already more than a hundred stores, perfumes, clothes, household appliances and electronics.  There is a cinema "Kinomax". </p><p>  600 meters from the new buildings you will find a well-maintained recreation area with Golovinsky ponds, Mikhailovo estate, built in the XVIII century, an impressive dam.  This is a pleasant and picturesque place for cycling and hiking, jogging, picnics.  There is also a drawback in this park - there is no lighting in the evening. </p><p>  If you take the metro in just two stations, you can get to the Khimki reservoir and the Northern River Station.  There is a huge expanse of greenery with pedestrian boulevards, which smoothly flows into the Friendship Park. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Nevsky" class="if uuid-3077486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077486.jpg"></div><p>  Residents' reviews of the Nevsky Residential Complex near the Water Stadium constantly indicate that ecology is one of the main problems.  The entire Voikovsky district is considered one of the most polluted in the Northern Administrative District of Moscow. </p><p>  The Leningradskoye Highway, on which steadily high traffic is noted, is largely to blame.  As a result, it is almost impossible to hide from dust, so it is better not to open the window.  In addition, the Koptevo industrial zone is located in the district, which is only about a kilometer from new buildings.  There is the Avangard engineering plant, which produces missile defense and air defense systems, which causes significant harm to the environment. </p><p>  A negative impact on the ecological situation is also exerted by several large parking zones. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><p>  The architectural concept of this residential complex looks attractive.  In general, it is a large-scale installation, which resembles the departure of huge sailboats from the port. </p><p>  The entire architectural ensemble is conditionally divided into two parts.  In the center are two main buildings.  At the same time, relief and multi-level facades give the house the shape of a ship. </p><p>  The makeshift port of the three hulls is a bit off to the side.  These houses are made in the classic Scandinavian style. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Much attention was paid to landscaping landscape designers.  The spacious courtyard is next to each building. </p><p>  Flower beds, elaborate lampposts, gazebos for rest are made in the Victorian style. </p><h2>  How to buy? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="citydevelopers.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Nevsky at the Water Stadium" class="if uuid-3077479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077479.jpg"></div><p>  The developer sells apartments directly, without intermediaries.  In the first two buildings, which have already been commissioned, they sell finished apartments, in the rest, the purchase can be made under an equity agreement. </p><p>  In the reviews of real estate investors who have come across this company, one regularly encounters complaints that additional services are imposed on them when they are executed.  This looks especially strange when a developer tries to make extra money on everything in a row, given the high cost of apartments. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Having studied the description of the reviews about the Nevsky residential complex near the Water Stadium, we can conclude that its main advantage will be the unique architectural component and interiors. </p><p>  Moreover, the reputation of this residential complex is extremely controversial.  On the one hand, there is good transport accessibility, and on the other, poor environmental conditions.  In addition, a cemetery, prisons and hazardous production are located in the neighborhood. </p>
