And soon Standard appeared.  As the name implies, the standard option is quoted slightly lower than the previous ones, which affects its price.  DJI Phantom 3 Standard is much cheaper, which allows it to be categorized as ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù - at least compared to Advanced and Professional.  Outwardly, however, all variants of the third generation drones are very similar.  Did DJI manage to maintain all the best features with an almost 50% price reduction?  The DJI Phantom 3 Standart review is intended to clarify this issue. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  When it comes to important parameters, the quadrocopter basically matches its more expensive counterparts.  It has the same battery as the other two models, and thus the drone provides the same 25-odd minutes of flight per charge.  In addition, the device retains a GPS-based intelligent return function, which automatically pilots it to the launch site when the control signal is lost or simply if the pilot does not want to manually control the return flight of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard quadrocopter. </p>

    <h2>  Camera overview </h2><p>  According to the owners, the model offers aerial photography capabilities identical to Advanced and Professional.  The camera here is very similar to those installed on more expensive quadrocopters, but its characteristics are slightly different.  The image sensor, which users suspect is the same Sony Exmor sensor as on other unmanned aerial vehicles of the line, has a size of 1 / 2.3 ‚Äù, a resolution of 12 megapixels and the same relative lens aperture equal to f / 2.8, like 94 -degree field of view.  The camera records frames in JPEG or RAW format, as well as video with a resolution of 720p, 1080p or 1520p.  The latest version of DJI calls "2.7K" because the image is composed of 2704 x 1520 pixels.  In fact, this gives more opportunities than the Advanced solution, although it should be noted that if you need to record with a frame rate above 30 fps, you will have to lower the resolution to 720p (Advanced allows you to record in 1080p format at speeds up to 60 fps) . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Video and photo quality </h2><p>  Pictures in good light are excellent.  12-megapixel photos and videos in high resolution retain a huge amount of detail that does not decrease until the user tries to record in low light, when increased ISO sensitivity leads to more grainy and less clear results.  But given the cost of Standard, the owners are impressed by how similar the performance of the camera is with the performance of other aircraft in the line.  Judging by the footage, the green foliage and grass can sometimes seem a little blurry, but the fields are rich and deep, the suburban scenes are filled with sharp details, and the color changes in the sunset shots look absolutely magnificent. </p><p>  The quadrocopter uses the same three-axis suspension as on other Phantom 3 drones. It makes the camera independent of the movements of the aircraft itself and can be tilted up to 90 ¬∞ (using the control dial in the upper left corner of the remote control).  This is very impressive and important for smooth, stable frames that do not look out of place when viewing. </p>

    <h2>  Flight qualities </h2><p>  Flight quadrocopter DJI Phantom 3 Standard, according to owners, is almost no different from other models of the third generation.  And this is not surprising, given that for an unprepared observer, he looks exactly like other third-generation drones.  Using the remote control and a smartphone (there are applications for iOS and Android, although there are not many recommended Android devices), it‚Äôs quite easy to control the device.  The copter responsively responds to commands, which makes it easy to cope with it, getting real pleasure from it.  However, the drone does not tolerate careless control, because it is not a toy, and it can fall like a stone if it collides with something larger than a butterfly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  GPS and other sensors do not allow the quadrocopter to stray off course when wind gusts, and the screen of the phone connected to the drone provides all the information about its speed, altitude, location, battery life, etc. Plus, of course, live broadcast from the camera. </p><h2>  Broadcast video </h2><p>  Here the differences become apparent.  In Advanced and Professional models, the mobile device is connected to the controller via a cable, and the video communication system uses the proprietary DJI Lightbridge system.  However, in Standard, the controller and the phone are connected via Wi-Fi, and a more ‚Äústandard‚Äù form of wireless communication is used between the quadcopter and the controller.  This means that the transmission range is significantly reduced, as well as the broadcast quality.  According to DJI, the video resolution is 720p.  Under optimal conditions, the image is crisp and clear, but compared to more expensive models, the quality decreases dramatically when the drone moves away from the pilot. </p>

    <h2>  Working range </h2><p>  This does not mean that the flight range is unsatisfactory.  According to reviews, the DJI Phantom 3 Standard quadrocopter in open space will remain under control at a distance of up to 500 m or so.  But this distance is shorter than that of other models, and sometimes the drone abruptly cuts off the broadcast and begins to return to the launch site at a surprisingly close distance of several hundred meters.  Owners are annoyed when this happens, but they have found that this can be avoided if the antenna of the controller is aimed directly at the quadrocopter, which you should not worry about when using Professional and Advanced.  In any case, according to the rules of flight safety, you cannot send an aircraft out of line of sight, so this will not be a serious problem for those who do not violate the rules. </p><h2>  The control </h2><p>  The DJI Phantom 3 Standard quadrocopter, according to reviews, is much simpler than that of Professional and Advanced, and is equipped with only two joysticks and a gimbal control wheel.  This means that you need to use the touch screen of your mobile device to take photos and videos.  This is not difficult, but makes controlling the quadrocopter a little more unusual and fussy than on other models, which allow you to start the camera using physical buttons and do not require to take both hands off the controller. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The drone works with the DJI Go application, which is quite similar to the DJI Pilot program previously used in the Advanced and Pro models.  As soon as a connection is established between the phone and the quadrocopter, the operator gets an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe shooting due to the multitude of flight and photographic data, as well as access to a menu that allows you to re-calibrate and configure the desired video and photo settings.  The pilot also sees the current location and position of the drone on the map, at any time knowing where it is, and in the event of an accident and crash can easily find it.  Or what is left of it. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  This, of course, is a joke, since reviews of the DJI Phantom 3 Standard quadrocopter speak of its sturdy construction.  Despite the fact that the drone looks like a toy, it is a seriously thought-out product that can survive incredible loads.  According to the owners, a hit on a tree and a fall on concrete leave the quadrocopter unscathed, with the exception of a few scratches on the metal surface of the camera, blades and minor cracks in the chassis.  It‚Äôs nice to know that during an accident, you may not have to buy a new drone or even some of its components.  However, DJI and other companies sell many spare parts separately.  Therefore, even if the quadrocopter breaks, most components can be replaced quite easily. </p>

    <h2>  Possibility of freezing </h2><p>  The last difference between Standard and more expensive Phantom 3 models is the lack of a down-facing camera.  It is used not for the purpose of photography, but only for the analysis of the terrain and provides freezing in the same place.  In the open air, it is mainly replaced by the siting system, but it does not work in buildings.  Thus, this model is not suitable for flights inside buildings, if the room is not large enough or the user is not ready to very accurately control the movements of the aircraft. </p><p>  Standard, of course, is less impressive than Advanced and Professional, but when you consider that the cost of the drone is much lower, its shortcomings, if you can call them that, are fading into the background. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The quadcopter DJI Phantom 3 Standard, according to the owners, is not suitable for everyone who wants to make a career in the field of aerial photography, but its price (about 30 thousand rubles) is a rather small fee for the opportunities that the user receives: a device that flies stably for 25 minutes on a single battery charge, shooting good quality video and making beautiful clear pictures from insane heights;  a device that features reliable assembly and incredible ease of use for such sophisticated equipment. </p><p>  And while many would prefer a 4K-compatible professional option, the DJI Phantom 3 Standard radio-controlled aircraft provides the best balance between availability and performance.  Which is the reason for the amazing success of the model. </p>
