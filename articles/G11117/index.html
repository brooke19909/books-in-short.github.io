Probably the most common paper product is the heart.  Take at least one Valentine's day, for which billions of similar symbols of this holiday are made.  If a novice master is engaged in the manufacture of various paper crafts not so long ago, then it may not be completely clear to him how to make a heart out of paper so that it turns out to be elegant and unique.  In this case, you can use the "recipe" given in this article. </p><p>  To make a heart according to the method described below, it will take a lot of time and no less perseverance.  When making a gift for Valentine's Day, the question: "how to make a heart with your own hands?"  becomes the most relevant.  In order to make a heart that will not only please the person to whom we are going to give it, but will very pleasantly surprise you, you will need quite ordinary things.  It is necessary to take several sheets of colored paper, the amount of which will be determined by the size of the heart.  Since the constituent parts will be small roses, it is desirable to have paper in different colors, for example, soft pink, red and white.  White color will be needed to frame a floral heart.  Red for main filling and pink for decoration.  You can choose another color scheme - it already depends on the imagination of the manufacturer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We continue to consider the question of <span>how to make a heart out of paper.</span>  In order to fasten the flowers together, you will need glue (optimally - clerical or PVA).  And the last tool that will become the main one in production is a metal rod of a small diameter, for example, you can use an ordinary knitting needle. </p><p>  Having finished all preparations, we proceed to the practical implementation of the question of how to make a heart out of paper.  To begin with, we make the basis: you can take a piece of cardboard and cut out a heart-shaped base from it, its dimensions will serve as the dimensions of the future masterpiece.  Next, cut the colored paper into strips about three centimeters wide, and then you need a knitting needle.  Gradually we wind up pre-cut pieces of paper on the knitting needle, but we do it in such a way that each next turn lies slightly lower than the previous one.  Thus, we get something like a rose, squeeze the tip firmly and pull the paper from the knitting needle, we get an almost finished rose, which we strengthen with glue. </p><p>  Having made the required number of roses, we continue to understand further how to make a heart out of paper.  It is more convenient first of all to make flowers from white paper, since they make up the frame of the craft itself.  After making white roses, gently stick them on the cardboard base of the heart.  Next, we will manufacture red roses, which form the basis of the whole craft.  Next, we begin to stick them.  If you have enough patience and perseverance, you can give them a little volume with the help of pre-glued pieces of paper.  Having made the main filling of red roses, we are engaged in the production of flowers from pink paper and stick them to decorate an almost finished heart.  After all the flowers are pasted on - the heart is ready, but you can not stop there, you can additionally decorate it with glued beads, sparkles, a little drop of glue on the flowers - it will soon dry out and will look like dew drops. </p><p>  It‚Äôs only a dear person to give such a heart, so it will take a lot of time and effort to make it.  But those who accept such a gift will be very flattered by such attention. </p>
