    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  After visiting <span>the Sambia Hotel (Zelenogradsk),</span> on some points, the guests had a negative opinion: </p><ul><li>  Almost all guests consider the room rates to be overpriced. </li><li>  When guests arrive with large suitcases, the absence of elevators in the buildings is especially felt. </li><li>  Some vacationers believe that the hotel has small rooms. </li><li>  Guests also note that the rooms need to be redecorated. </li><li>  There are some visitors who did not like the fact that room cleaning (the noise of vacuum cleaners) and outdoor work (the operation of lawn mowers) begin too early when some guests are still sleeping. </li><li>  Not very convenient mode of operation of the water park.  After every 1.5 hours of work - a half-hour break. </li><li>  The rooms of the first category have poor insulation. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Despite some shortcomings, many vacationers consider the <span>Sambia Hotel</span> located in the city of <span>Zelenogradsk of the Kaliningrad Region a</span> worthy alternative to foreign vacations.  It pleases not only the architecture of the hotel, but also the gorgeous views of the Baltic Sea, as well as the magnificent surroundings of Kaliningrad.
