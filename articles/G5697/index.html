He came from the Romanov dynasty. </p><p>  Alexander II was remembered as an outstanding innovator conducting liberal reforms of the 60-70s of the 19th century.  Historians still argue about whether they improved or worsened the socio-economic and political situation in our country.  But the role of the emperor is difficult to overestimate.  No wonder in Russian historiography he is known as Alexander the Liberator.  The ruler received such an honorary title for the <span>abolition of serfdom.</span>  Alexander II died as a result of a terrorist act, for which activists of the Narodnaya Volya movement took responsibility. </p>

    <h2>  Judicial reform </h2><p>  In 1864, the most important document was published, which largely changed the justice system in Russia.  It was a judicial charter.  It was in him that the liberal reforms of the 60-70s of the XIX century manifested themselves very clearly.  This charter became the basis of a unified system of courts, the activities of which from now on should be based on the principle of equality of all segments of the population before the law.  Now the meetings, at which both civil and criminal cases were considered, became public, and their result was to be published in print.  The parties to the lawsuit <span>received the right to</span> use the services of a lawyer who has a higher <span>legal education</span> and is not in the public service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liberal reforms of the 60 70s of the 19th century" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/659538.jpg" width="600"></div>

If political processes were considered, then administrative repressions were inevitable, even if the verdict was acquittal. </p><h2>  Zemsky reform </h2><p>  Alexander II was aware of the need to make changes to the local government system.  Liberal reforms of the 60-70s led to the creation of elected Zemstvo bodies.  They had to deal with issues related to taxation, with medical assistance, primary education, financing, etc. The elections to the county and zemstvo councils were held in two stages and provided most of the places for them to the nobles.  The peasants were given an insignificant role in resolving local issues.  This situation continued until the end of the 19th century.  A slight change in the proportions was achieved by entering into the councils of the kulaks and merchants, immigrants from the peasant milieu. </p><p>  Zemstvos were elected for four years.  They dealt with issues of local government.  In any cases affecting the interests of the peasants, the decision was made in favor of the landowners. </p>

    <h2>  Military reform </h2><p>  Affected change and the army.  Liberal reforms of 60-70 years of the 19th century were dictated by the need for urgent modernization of military mechanisms.  Supervised by the transformations of D. A. Milyutin.  The reform took place in several stages.  At first, the whole country was divided into military districts.  For this, a number of documents were issued.  The central act was the normative act on universal military service, signed by the emperor in 1862.  He replaced the recruitment into the army by general mobilization, regardless of the estate.  The main goal of the reform was to reduce the number of soldiers in peacetime and the possibility of their prompt collection in the event of an unexpected start of hostilities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a result of the transformations, the following results were achieved: </p><ol><li>  An extensive network of military and junker schools has been created, in which representatives of all classes were involved. </li><li>  The size of the army was reduced by 40%. </li><li>  The main headquarters and military districts were founded. </li><li>  The army abolished the tradition of <span>corporal punishment</span> for the slightest offense. </li><li>  Global rearmament. </li></ol><h2>  Peasant Reform </h2><p>  <span>Serfdom</span> during the reign of Alexander the Second has almost become obsolete.  Conducted by the Russian Empire liberal reforms of 60-70 years.  XIX century with the main goal of creating a more developed and civilized state.  It was impossible not to touch on the most important <span>sphere of social</span> life.  Peasant unrest became stronger, they escalated especially after the exhausting Crimean War.  The state turned to this segment of the population for support during the hostilities.  The peasants were sure that the reward for this would be their liberation from landlord arbitrariness, but their hopes were not realized.  More and more riots broke out.  If in 1855 there were 56 of them, then in 1856 their number exceeded 700. <br>  Alexander the Second ordered the creation of a specialized committee on peasant affairs, which included 11 people.  In the summer of 1858, a reform project was introduced.  He envisioned the organization of local committees, which would include the most authoritative representatives of the nobility.  They were given the right to amend the draft. </p><p>  The basic principle on which the liberal reforms of the 60-70s of the 19th century in the field of serfdom were based was the recognition of the personal independence of all subjects of the Russian Empire.  Nevertheless, the landowners remained full owners and owners of the land on which the peasants worked.  But the latter got the opportunity over time to redeem the land on which they worked, along with outbuildings and residential premises.  The project caused a wave of indignation from both the landlords and the peasants.  The latter were against landless liberation, arguing that "you won‚Äôt be full of air alone." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian Empire liberal reforms 60 70 years of the 19th century" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29398/659355.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fearing aggravation of the situation connected with peasant riots, the government makes significant concessions.  The new reform project was more radical.  The peasants were given personal freedom and a piece of land in permanent possession with the subsequent right of redemption.  For this, a soft loan program was developed. </p><p>  02/19/1861, the emperor signed a manifesto, which legislated for innovation.  After that, normative acts were adopted, which settled in detail the issues that arise during the implementation of the reform.  After serfdom was abolished, the following results were achieved: </p><ol><li>  Peasants received personal independence, as well as the opportunity to dispose of all their property at their own request. </li><li>  The landowners remained the rightful owners of their land, but were obliged to give certain estates to the former serfs. </li><li>  The peasants had to pay rent for the use of the leased plots, which could not be abandoned for nine years. </li><li>  The sizes of corv√©e and allotment were recorded in special letters, which were checked by intermediary bodies. </li><li>  Over time, peasants could redeem their land in agreement with the landlord. </li></ol><h2>  Education reform </h2><p>  The training system has also changed.  Real schools were created in which, unlike standard gymnasiums, the emphasis was on mathematics and science.  In 1868, the only higher courses for women that began at that time began to function in Moscow, which was a major breakthrough in regard to gender equality. </p>
