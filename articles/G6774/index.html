For a long time symbols and drawings related to higher powers have reached our days.  Previously, they adorned clothes and household items, so that Slavic deities would assist people.  And today, as many say, such products, made with soul and with one's own hand, help owners overcome troubles and turn life for the better.  What are the most common amulets?  Consider in more detail, and also analyze the basic rules for their creation. </p><h2>  Historical context </h2><p>  For a long time people have learned to embroider.  Slavic charms did not exist yet - for so long people have known the art of embroidery.  According to historians, as soon as flax became available as an agricultural crop, humanity learned to make a thread, and soon they built the first embroidery machine.  So they began to embroider.  According to rough historical estimates, the event happened about seven millennia ago.  According to some, a couple of thousand years later.  For the first time, the ancient Egyptians began to embroider.  Later, excavations of the pharaonic tombs gave an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe styles and techniques practiced at that time: embroideries that appeared to the eyes of later generations were surprisingly skillful. </p><p>  Mastery, which appeared in those ancient times, improved and improved, schemes became more complicated, new styles appeared, and accumulated skills were passed on between generations.  The pattern allowed the person to convey the perception of the world and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnatural phenomena, inexplicable to people living in those days.  So folk motifs appeared.  Most nations paid very much attention to weaving and patterns on fabrics, and the Slavs were no exception.  On the embroidery, Slavic charms are not just decorative details, but elements filled with meaning, giving others an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe owner of the thing.  Some symbols were embroidered so that the object protected its owner, others were intended to activate some personality traits.  Every line, every curl and every pattern is filled with the deepest meaning that has survived to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic amulet healer cross stitch embroidery" class="if uuid-3045170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045170.jpg"></div><h2>  About the rules </h2><p>  In order for embroidery consisting of Slavic charms to be useful for its owner, it is necessary to subordinate the work process to a number of rules that have come down to us from the sages from ancient times.  In particular, it is forbidden to make a talisman for yourself.  The product made by the consanguineous will have the greatest strength.  Forcing another to do a thing for himself will not work - it will not have power. </p><p>  Connoisseurs in this area urge to select the most appropriate pattern and color with which it will be performed as responsibly as possible.  These aspects play a significant role, have a certain meaning.  Only having mastered the subtleties of meaning, they make the final decision.  They sit down at work when the mood is good.  The embroiderer should think positively about who the item is intended for.  Do not work in a very noisy room.  Turn off the music.  In order for embroidery to have power, those working on it must immerse themselves in the process. </p><p>  You can not embroider amulets, being sick.  Girls are forbidden to work during monthly bleeding.  Traditionally, Slavs do not use fire.  If embroidery is made using these devices, it will only be an ornament that does not carry a protective function. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The subtleties of the process </h2><p>  To make cross-stitch of the Slavic amulet make sense, you need to make the first stitch strictly in the center of the product.  Then they work on the central part of the picture and only then gradually move to the edges.  It is better not to use scissors in the process.  If necessary, finish the thread with a candle.  Until the work is completed, the amulet should be hidden from other people so that no one‚Äôs eyes ruin the thing. </p><p>  You cannot stitch embroidery.  First, the item that she adorns is fully prepared, and only after that they begin to work on the patterns.  However, to make it easier, it should be noted on the pattern where and what symbols will be located later. </p><p>  In order for embroidery to benefit the owner of the item, the talisman is activated.  The rite of activation requires reference to materials symbolizing the element, which they are counting on to help.  If it is fire, activation requires a candle flame, on which the product is held for some time so that it does not catch fire.  If you turn to the ground, you need to pour a pinch of soil or lightly rub the object with a stone.  Hoping for water, the object is sprayed or washed under a duct, then dried in the sun.  To get the strength of the air, you should blow on the product or put it for a short time at the open window. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="makosh goddess amulet embroidery" class="if uuid-3045171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045171.jpg"></div><h2>  Tips &amp; Tricks </h2><p>  People who know what embroidery containing Slavic amulets should look like with a cross recommend creating the product so that it does not have knots.  It is no secret that creating amulets differs from simple work on decorative embroidery, so you should pay attention to this limitation.  Paying attention to color aspects is equally important.  It is believed that red, red - these are shades that protect against traitors and exclude the spouse's infidelity.  For a small child, it is better to make a charm from red, black.  Choose animal motifs that match the character and appearance of the child.  For older children (school age) violet, blue colors are more suitable - these protect a person from external aggressive forces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To strengthen their financial situation, resort to green colors, traditionally associated with money.  Dark threads are used if the amulet is intended for a woman who can not conceive a child.  You can make a Slavic amulet designed to protect health.  An embroidery for men and women that protects against diseases - containing a tree image.  Traditionally, such vegetation is associated with longevity.  Classic pattern - spruce embroidered with green threads. </p><h2>  Subtlety is the key to success </h2><p>  If you plan to make a Slavic amulet for embroidery for a man or a woman and at the same time a small-format product is planned, it is recommended to use only one color of threads for its design.  The classic way to embroider is with a cross.  It should be placed in a discreet place.  For example, decorating a scarf, the symbols are placed in one of the corners, making them small enough so that they are not striking and not visible to strangers with potentially unfriendly intentions. </p><p>  If a person is a believer, before starting work on embroidery it is worth praying.  It will not be superfluous to conspire if a person sincerely believes in his strength. </p><p>  Modern needlewomen are usually used to design a mouline thread.  Bead embroidery is no less in demand.  The latter, although allowed to create amulets, is not recommended.  Beads are made from synthetic material, which means that made with its use will have a distorted meaning.  The amulet can turn out to be completely powerless - and all because of the materials.  According to experienced people, it is better to decorate decorative things with beads, and when creating a talisman, cross stitch with natural threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nwhistorycourse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic symbols amulets meaning" class="if uuid-3045175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045175.jpg"></div><h2>  Where and what? </h2><p>  Experienced people who know a lot about cross-stitch Slavic charms, the meaning of charms, are advised to decorate the product with such motifs to their taste and choice.  You can add ceremonial decor to almost any item.  Some embroider symbols on linen, others prefer bracelets for continuous wear, key chains or pendants.  You can make a ribbon that adorns the forehead.  If you decide to make a motanka doll, the strength of this amulet will increase if you decorate its apron with a symbol of the Slavic deity.  According to knowledgeable persons, the more often a product touches a person, the higher will be the magical power of the item.  It is best for the child to make an embroidered toy with which he will constantly play.  The product is filled with grain or cherry pits.  For a girl, a doll is more appropriate whose clothes are decorated with symbols of the Slavic faith.  Orthodox figures approve of baptismal embroidered diapers and towels, which are specially prepared for the wedding of a young couple. </p><p>  Having dealt with the embroidery of Slavic amulets and their meaning, choosing something suitable and making such an object for a loved one, do not stop there.  The product accumulates in itself a negative force, a negative message from the outside world.  From time to time you need to remove this energy.  It is enough to manually wash the thing carefully.  If it was not possible to maintain the brightness and attractiveness of the decor, the threads were torn and faded, the pattern was embroidered, which means that the amulet protected its owner from a strong negative external message.  The product must be given to the river or left in the forest, having previously thanked for the protection of the beloved. </p><h2>  About signs </h2><p>  Since cross-stitching of Slavic charms is popular for a long time, many observations have been accumulated, on the basis of which it is customary to associate events with people.  For example, if the thread is tangled, it means that a man thinks well about the one that is working on the amulet.  If you happen to injure your thumb, the person to whom the mascot is intended may run into trouble.  If the finger working on the product is pricked during the embroidery, the result pleases the eye with accuracy, but a drop of blood has fallen, you need to immediately make a wish.  Most likely, it will come true soon.  True, this does not apply to damage to the thumb. </p><p>  As observations have shown, and worldly wisdom says that if you leave an unfinished amulet on the bed, it is more likely that you will no longer return to work, so you should avoid such a place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": MariBoriEmbroidery, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic amulet Ladin embroidery" class="if uuid-3045176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045176.jpg"></div><h2>  Moon and work </h2><p>  Embroidery of Slavic symbols, charms should be made in accordance with the lunar calendar, otherwise the product will not have magical power or it will turn out to be completely different from what we would like.  Experienced people are advised to work in the first quarter of the moon.  If the amulet is intended for an adult, you can work on the second day or on the third day.  If the talisman is created so that its owner is healthy, it is better to work on the pattern on the 4th, 7th, 10th, 14th days of the lunar cycle.  In order for the subject to help get rid of something, the third quarter of the cycle is suitable, and the best day is the 20th.  If possible, all work should be completed at the right time.  If you plan a lot of work and for some reason there is no way to complete it at a good time, just start at the right time. </p><p>  Some symbols should be done while the moon is rising.  On the second day, they work on amulets with Kolyadnik, Lelnik.  Here, embroidery with Molvinets, Squirrel is appropriate.  You can embroider Double Kolovrat, Radinets, Heat color.  The Veles symbol is embroidered on the 4th or 6th day, on the 14th Wedding, Makosh.  Then they work on Ladinets and prepare an amulet with Rozhanitsa.  With the waning moon on the 20th day and the next day, you should depict the color Perunov on the product with a cross or embroider the same grass.  On the 27th day, amulets are made to protect against evil spirits, negative energy.  Needlework is strictly prohibited on Friday.  This day the Slavs gave Makoshi, who was responsible for the female half of the clan.  On Sunday morning, you should also refrain from working on embroidery - it is better to postpone work until the afternoon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic embroidery patterns description" class="if uuid-3045169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045169.jpg"></div><h2>  Makosh </h2><p>  Perhaps this deity among the Slavs was one of the most important and revered.  This is also noticeable in the extant objects, on which there are Slavic charms calling for the power of Makoshi.  Embroidery on such products appeals to the patroness of all wives, helping those who keep comfort in the house and loves to needlework.  Makosh was traditionally revered as a home-preserving and tradition of the clan, family.  She is responsible for procreation.  A woman guarded by this great power is balanced, calm, strong.  Decorated with symbols of <span>Mokosh, the amulet</span> was the guarantor of the health of everyone living in the house.  It is believed that he granted consent in the family and attracted wealth.  Traditionally, amulets with such symbols were worked on lunar days: 10th, 14th. </p><p>  Quite interesting conclusions can be made if we look at the preserved amulets preserved to this day: the Slavic goddess Makosh is present on almost any talisman.  Most of those who appealed to the power of the gods, addressed primarily to it.  And if we were talking about a female amulet, then here without signs dedicated to Makoshi, it could not do at all.  It was believed that it was this higher power that bestowed on the female genus the ability to needlework.  Thanks to Mokosh, people learned to spin, weave.  She showed how to cook bread and wash clothes, taught milking a cow.  It is generally accepted that this goddess somewhat simplifies the everyday worries of someone who values ‚Äã‚Äãher and worships her.  From a heavy share of housework, they turn into a pleasant bustle, which joyfully fill your days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic amulet cross stitch" class="if uuid-3045140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045140.jpg"></div><h2>  Mascot Features </h2><p>  The Slavic goddess Makosh, so often found in the charms embroidered with a cross, helps to call home wealth and prosperity.  It is believed that it contributes to prosperity, gives spouses mutual understanding, strengthens relations between relatives.  The amulet guarantees that children will be born healthy, grow happy.  Makosh gives a person peace of mind, makes him responsive, kind and compassionate.  If you give a man a talisman with the symbols of this goddess, he will stronger believe in miracles, at the same time become susceptible to the world of higher powers.  A woman with such a talisman is more feminine, her virtues attract the eye, and flaws are lost sight of.  Many say that mastery of the mascot with the symbols of Mokosh helps sharpen the subconscious, intuition. </p><p>  I must say, there are no special restrictions on who to give Slavic charms decorated with cross-stitch.  The goddess Makosh helps every home, therefore, products on which there is her symbolism is a universal present.  A ritual item will help in solving problems and achieving goals for someone who does not have something more suitable for a specific task.  As experts note, the Makoshi symbol is one of the options for writing a solar sign.  It feeds on the energy of light, destroys dangerous darkness, filled with evil thoughts.  The counteraction is not aggressive, but still effective.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a talisman is creation, increasing the power of light in the world.  If the owner is in danger, the talisman will protect him to the best of his ability. </p><h2>  Healer and Molvinets </h2><p>  In the manufacture of amulets, craftsmen often resort to the symbol of Healer.  Embroidery on the Slavic amulet with such signs is universal: it is believed that it will help any person.  It does not matter whether it is old or young, a man or a woman.  Positive energy is inherent in the healer.  This symbol simplifies recovery from a serious illness.  It is believed that signs protect a person from the evil eye and provide a long life. </p><p>  No less interesting is Molvinets.  This sign protects against negative energy directed at the person.  Any evil words and thoughts, slander directed to the owner of the amulet will return to the source.  The molvinets symbolizes the god Rod.  More often, children and women wear ornaments with such decorations, since they are considered more susceptible to curses.  Traditionally, pendants, personal items, and wrist jewelry were decorated with a symbol.  Necessarily placed the product, supplemented by the symbols of Molvinets, in the crib. </p><p>  If Molvinets protects the student, it will be easier for such a child to adapt in society.  They recommend things decorated with this symbolism to those who are forced to speak in front of a large audience. </p><h2>  Ladinets </h2><p>  This amulet has a very large positive force.  Often it was used to decorate objects with embroidery, Slavic charms.  Ladin, as experts say, forms an indestructible shield that protects a person from any curse.  It protects against female diseases and makes the family happier, gives all the inhabitants of the house the ability to reason sensibly.  Like any other amulet, Ladin gives protection only to a good person with a bright soul. </p><p> An alternative name for this symbol is the Lada Cross.  It symbolizes harmony and family happiness, it was associated with love.  Very often, things adorned with this symbol were worn by young girls who feared the evil eye.  To Ladinets was always strong, you need to enter the amulet in Kolo.  The female amulet harmonizes the essence of the wearer, gives peace of mind, joy.  This affects the appearance, a woman becomes an attractive, healthy beauty.  Ladin, used in the embroidery of Slavic female amulets, as was believed in antiquity, allowed everyone to feel the joy of being themselves, as well as more fully realize their feminine essence. </p><p>  Traditionally, the first beam is embroidered with red threads.  The second can be red, black, green, blue.  Very often roses are depicted in a company with a Slavic symbol.  If a girl received an amulet decorated with a symbol of Lada as a present, she should wear a skirt or dress for the next 40 days.  Houses use bathrobes, sundresses.  Ladinets is a twin symbol of Rodovich.  The combination of these two characters is a heavenly family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic amulet of men embroidery" class="if uuid-3045150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3045150.jpg"></div><h2>  Sacred Symbols: Continuing Consideration </h2><p>  What symbols are not used for embroidery!  In the descriptions of the Slavic charms you can find the Thunderer - he is also often chosen when they want to make out some product with protective symbols.  Traditionally, this image was associated with Perun.  Thunderbolt is a solar sign.  It is believed that he gives spiritual strength, makes a person confident in their abilities.  Some assure that the Thunderbolt has the power to protect against any enemy and ward off the ill-wisher.  Many are convinced that such a sign protects against damage.  The symbols of Perun are not allowed for children, because everything connected with this god has too strong energy, moreover, fiery, aggressive, sometimes destructive.  Thunderbolts are allowed to women, but only in an exceptional situation - for example, when you need to protect the house.  If a lady is forced to gather all her internal forces, become decisive in some situation, she can ask for help from Perun through the tommy of Gromovnik. </p><p>  Previously, one could often see embroidery in the house, Slavic charms with symbols of Dazhdbog.  This sign guarantees a person protection.  There are two main options for the image.  In a direct form, the cross protects from negative thoughts and intrigues of people who want evil to the owner of the amulet.  Such a product protects against diseases and gives peace of mind.  It is believed that it attracts luck and makes a person prosperous, successful in business.  Such a symbol can be used by persons of any age.  For the image on the subject, they resorted to scarlet threads.  An alternate spelling is a hinged cross.  It provides connectivity with previous generations.  Dazhdbog, as is known from Slavic mythology, rules until winter begins.  The hinged cross reminds of this, at the same time gives enough energy to ensure that the genus is safe. </p><h2>  Stars and fire </h2><p>  Collections telling about Slavic symbols, charms, their meaning in embroidery, usually consider the star of the cross.  This amulet has a diamond shape, with both sides extending beyond the corner.  The symbol is intended to attract good luck.  If a person wears products decorated with such images, he is more confident in his own abilities, strengths, which means he is able to achieve amazing success.  However, the star of the cross approves of perseverance and the ability to work tirelessly.  Only such behavior will achieve the desired.  The talisman accumulates the energy of the person using it. </p><p>  No less curious is the fiery symbol of Svarozhich.  Collections, in which Slavic embroidery of amulets with a cross is presented with patterns, a description, tell that in ancient times Svarozhich symbolized the connection of man and his ancestors.  This amulet allows Rod to be united in all tribes.  If a person is protected by a symbol, it is easier for her to exclude conflict situations from her life, to commit only deliberate actions.  Man is guarded by higher powers from external aggression and negative predilections.  Svarozhich is especially recommended for those who, due to their professional activities, are constantly forced to take risks.  The amulet, as you can learn from the bearers of folk wisdom, protects against injuries, protects life and health, including mental. </p><h2>  Horse and Svarog </h2><p>  From the dedicated to the schemes and the description of the Slavic charms for cross-stitch editions, you can learn about Horse.  This symbol was associated with an important for the Slavs deity of the disk of the Sun.  Visually, it looks like a cross whose ends are bent inward.  Such a sign, as experts say, gives a person solar energy.  The use of things protected by such images protects the person from failures, eliminates unpredictable losses.  Horse is characterized by very strong energy, which can even protect against dangerous natural radiation. </p><p>  Svarog is traditionally associated with sky, fire.  It reflects the highest essence that created the world, is the deity of wisdom.  It is Svarog, as one can learn from ancient myths, who created the laws that governed Slavic society.  The symbol protects the person who uses it, and also simplifies the mastery of some craft.  It is believed that Svarog protects those who seek to create, and provides special opportunities in this area.  Traditionally, this is a male amulet that is most suitable for a person who is forced to work hard.  Such symbols are recommended for athletes. </p>
