    <p>  The first floor of the Honey club in Rostov-on-Don includes a rather long bar counter with high comfortable chairs and tables, where you can eat and drink soft or alcoholic drinks.  Next comes the dance area - a spacious and roomy dance floor with an abundance of spotlights, light and shine.  There is also a large LCD-screen, equipped with a stage, a place for a DJ and musical equipment.  A luminous wide staircase leads to the second floor, where there are soft sofas, tables and VIP-zones, private rooms.  Here you can sit in a more relaxed atmosphere, order a hookah.  Everything that happens on stage is visible from the upper balconies. </p><h2>  Club staff </h2><p>  ‚ÄúThe theater begins with a hanger‚Äù, and the club ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù in Rostov-on-Don - with face control.  People who are intoxicated by alcohol, as well as those who behaved aggressively the previous time and were already taken out of the institution, are not allowed here.  The requirements for the dress code are the same as in most entertainment venues: compliance with the rules of decency, neat appearance, sportswear, shorts (for men) are not allowed.

    <p>  The bar is replete with soft drinks, freshly squeezed juices, various types of tea and coffee.  The assortment of alcoholic beverages is also wide: instant layered cocktails, which the bartender effectively makes at the client, the most popular types of wines and beer, vintage and elite alcohol. </p><p>  Prices for everything are very affordable, the quality of drinks and food is always at a high level.  The average bill without salads and main dishes is about 800 rubles, with food - within 2000 rubles.  Payment is possible both in cash and non-cash. </p><h2>  Music and show programs </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of the night club "Honey" in Rostov-on-Don is the variety of musical styles and directions.  Here you can hear the most popular R'n'B hits, fiery hip-hop, house, funk, disco, etc. At least twice a month, the club administration invites the most famous DJs of not only Russia, but also the world to perform. </p><p>  It is rare to find an entertaining nightlife that is open to visitors every day.  The club "Honey" hosts various theme parties on the days of the week.  For example, on Thursdays - a party ‚ÄúOnly girls in honey‚Äù with a mandatory male striptease program, or ‚ÄúPop Sunday‚Äù on the corresponding day of the week, ‚ÄúStudent party‚Äù on Wednesdays or ‚ÄúDouble Tuesday‚Äù, when all drinks ordered are doubled. </p><p>  The club has opened preparatory courses for DJ mastery ("DJ Factory") with further promotion in the profession.  There is also a Go Go dance school "Deja Vu". </p><p>  The cost of an admission ticket on ordinary days is 400-700 rubles, if star guests are present at parties, the price will be 1000-2000 rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews about the club "Honey" in Rostov-on-Don </h2><p>  According to visitors' reviews, the club is more popular with students who come here to ‚Äúwash‚Äù the session and relax after difficult exams.  Young people find the atmosphere cool, and the music is great and varied. </p>

    <p>  I also like the institution for people of the 30-40 age category.  They come here to hold a corporate party or to celebrate an anniversary.  They prefer to reserve tables on the second floor, where there is less noise and a more relaxed atmosphere.  Visitors positively evaluate the work of the waiters, who, according to them, very clearly monitored the cleanliness of the tables, cleaned up the dirty dishes. </p><p>  The lovers also liked the night club "Honey", some come here repeatedly, 2-3 times a month.  The only drawback is the not very large dance floor, but it only seems like this with a large number of party people during the arrival of star DJs.  The girls are impressed by the pink-black interior, delicious cocktails and the opportunity to order a hookah. </p>
