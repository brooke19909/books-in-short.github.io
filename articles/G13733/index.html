She managed in a short period of time to create the best infrastructure in the world for receiving tourists.  The state boasts magnificent beaches, luxurious shopping centers with boutiques of the most famous European fashion houses and extremely helpful staff of numerous hotels. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to the emirates in November" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1527190.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Why are Emirates attractive for tourists? </h2><p>  The United Arab Emirates have an extremely mild climate and plenty of sunny days.  Here you can comfortably relax almost all year round.  After all, the <span>Arab Emirates</span> in November are as beautiful as in March or June.  This attracts millions of tourists from all over the world every year. </p><p>  Emirates enjoy special love among shopaholics who dream of combining a luxurious beach holiday with daily shopping trips.  From such a trip it is difficult to return with empty suitcases and without gifts.  Most often, tourists visit the Dubai Mall - a huge shopping center.  It contains more than one thousand different stores.  They also love to roam the so-called “golden” market, beloved by all Russians. </p><p>  November is a time of widespread discounts and sales.  Therefore, even if the weather lets the rain down and drips, it will be possible to usefully spend time in shopping centers.  Moreover, it is in the “Dubai Mall” that the largest aquarium in the Emirates is located.  It is worth a visit for both children and adults.  In this huge aquarium, more than thirty-three thousand species of marine inhabitants peacefully coexist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Men are attracted to the Emirates not by beach vacations and sales, but by the Formula 1 race.  It usually takes place in mid-November and gathers thousands of spectators who are ready to give their money, if only to look at this enchanting spectacle. </p><p>  Emirate hotels always receive only enthusiastic travel reviews.  And this is no wonder.  Each hotel is practically a work of art, designed to delight and amaze guests.  A perfectly trained staff will serve each guest as the richest sheikh. </p>

    <h2>  Tours in Emirates in November </h2><p>  Many tourists are becoming interested in holidays in this eastern country closer to the New Year holidays.  The end of autumn and the beginning of winter seems to them to be the most successful time for traveling to the East.  I would like to note that a trip to the Emirates in November is a profitable investment.  Tour operators still do not have time to raise prices for the holidays, and the hot sun finally stops mercilessly firing, forcing to constantly hide under an awning.  In addition, according to travel agencies, it is the last month of autumn that is the peak of the <span>holiday</span> season <span>in the United Arab Emirates.</span> </p><p>  You should not expect that the prices for tours to the Emirates in November will be lower than at other times.  On average, a settlement in a not-so-luxurious hotel for ten days will cost a couple of lovers about 150,000 rubles.  If you buy a ticket before the departure, the price may drop by thirty thousand.  But it is likely that tourists will not find "last minute" trips to the Emirates.  This country is very popular.  Therefore, tours are sold out in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Weather in Emirates in November </h2><p>  Air at the end of autumn warms up to about thirty degrees above zero.  And the combination of the warm water of the Persian Gulf with the gentle sun will make a vacation in the Emirates in November truly unforgettable.  Those who plan to leave the hotel often at night to enjoy the beauties of megalopolises stretching under a velvety starry sky should take care of a few warm things. </p><p>  You need to bring a light jacket or jacket.  Indeed, at night the weather in the United Arab Emirates in November can bring some surprises.  Typically, the temperature does not drop below twenty-one degrees.  But thanks to the cool wind from the coast, night walks can cause tourists considerable discomfort. </p><p>  In addition, quite often in November you can get caught in a drizzling rain and lose a few days of outdoor activities due to cloudy and windy weather.  In the Emirates, the breath of the desert is very strongly felt.  Therefore, any winds cause tourists great discomfort.  Do not forget that in different resort cities the weather may vary slightly. </p>

    <h2>  November weather in Dubai </h2><p>  More often than not, tourists planning their trip to the Emirates in November opt for Dubai.  This resort is traditionally considered one of the best in the country.  Weather in November will delight tourists with the opportunity to sunbathe and swim.  Indeed, in the afternoon the air warms up to thirty degrees. </p><p>  But at night, the situation changes dramatically.  The temperature drops to seventeen degrees in a few hours, the water cools instantly.  Many hotels during this period begin to heat the pools to make vacationers more comfortable.  Tourists, leaving feedback about the trip, noted that at night in November it often rained and an unpleasant cold wind blew from the sea. </p><h2>  November weather in Abu Dhabi </h2><p>  Choosing Abu Dhabi to travel to the Emirates in November, be prepared for sharp changes in climate regimes.  Tourists note that during the day the temperature often exceeds thirty degrees, but at night it can sometimes reach sixteen with difficulty.  Such changes affect the temperature of the water in the Persian Gulf.  Even during the day, few vacationers prefer spending time by the pool swimming on the coast.  At night, tourists will be chilly without warm outerwear. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Emirates in November" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1526255.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  November weather in Fujairah </h2><p>  Currently, this resort has not yet become a place of pilgrimage for tourists traveling to the Emirates in November.  The weather here is significantly different from other resort areas of the country.  Tourists cannot swim in the bay.  Water temperature is not conducive to long procedures.  In cool water, you can easily catch a cold. </p><p>  During the day, the air warms up only to twenty-five degrees, but at night there are no particularly sharp temperature changes.  Vacationers feel very comfortable during night walks at a typical temperature of twenty-three degrees Celsius for this month. </p>

    <h2>  What do vacationers in the United Arab Emirates need? </h2><p>  November is an autumn month, but not in the Emirates.  Despite the vagaries of the weather, the sun can cause irreparable harm to the skin.  Therefore, you definitely need to bring along a sunscreen with a high filter, as well as skin softeners after tanning.  Day clothes should be light and consist of natural materials.  As warm clothes fit pants and a thin <span>knitted jacket.</span>  Jeans lovers can take them with them.  A convenient spring jacket will also come in handy. </p><p>  <span>The United Arab Emirates</span> is an oriental tale that has come true thanks to the perseverance and hard work of the local population.  Holidays in this country will be remembered by travelers forever, even if they meet the Emirates in November. </p>
