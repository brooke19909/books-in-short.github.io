The Belem Tower is one of the historical monuments that has become a reference point in the revolutionary exploration of the territories of Vasco de Gama.  There were many legends about its creation.  The reasons were very diverse and until today the main goal that was invested in the <span>architectural project is</span> unknown <span>,</span> since the historical foundation is replete with unconfirmed facts. </p><p>  Next, we consider all the possible secrets that Belem Tower hides in itself.  Who created this beautiful landmark memo?  And with what in our time it attracts tourists from all over the world, and not only those who have already been here more than once, but also those who are constantly in search of new sensations. </p><h2>  In the distant past </h2><p>  The Belem Tower in Lisbon was built in 1515-1521, the completion of the construction was dedicated to a very significant event - Vasco de Gama opened the sea route to India.  The construction of this fortress was engaged in the eminent Portuguese architect Francisco di Arruda. </p>

Francisco also did not forget about the aesthetic appearance of the tower, having built it in the style of manuelino.  It was inherent in many architectural structures of the Renaissance, but has already been lost to date. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1983, the building and the nearby monastery of Gironimush were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </p><p>  After a short amount of time, the Belem tower was subject to significant pogroms from Russia.  Also, Napoleon acted with might and main, and the <span>Portuguese fortress</span> often saved the inhabitants from death.  After this incident, the tower did not lose its beautiful view and remained as impregnable for the enemies as it was before. </p><h2>  Royal stars </h2><p>  After the construction of the building and its grand opening, one of the great astrologers of that time, Tycho Brahe, became interested in the fortress.  Just at that time, he was looking for a place for his scientific studies of the sky and settled on an excellent option called the Belem tower.  The observatory, which soon was located there, caused a certain sensation among representatives of the authorities and local residents, since this was a great rarity for that time. </p><p>  But only one could enjoy the view of the heavenly expanses, such luxury was not available to the ordinary population. </p><p>  The scientist focused his attention on the powerful domes provided by the Belem tower.  Brahe was delighted with the result, as he received a great view of the open sky. </p>

    <h2>  Mysterious interior </h2><p>  Initially, the building was 200 meters from the sea.  There was mainly a berth for those who go sailing.  But a century later, she moved closer to the shore due to a large earthquake in 1755. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Outside, the Belem tower conveys exactly the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits author, and most importantly - it matches the style.  On the outer walls, various sea figures, celestial spheres and the cross of the Order of the Knights flaunt.  The walls also have a toothed surface, which adds mysticism to the image. </p><p>  As soon as you get inside, architectural symbols made in the <span>Gothic style</span> are immediately evident <span>.</span>  Darkness is added not only by various chimeras, but also by an underground prison, which is executed in the same style direction.  Many tourists note that this hall is most impressive, as it is excessively filled with ancient energy. </p>

    <h2>  Water unusual panorama </h2><p>  The first floor also contains a hexagonal platform, which offers a wonderful view of the expanses of water and the architecture of the building.  In the center of the platform you can see the statue of the Virgin of the Happy Return looking into the sea under a canopy.  Since ancient times, it has been a symbol of sailors retiring into the distance, who went for a long time to an unknown path. </p><p>  If you go upstairs, you will see the huge Royal Hall, which was used for noble receptions.  There were solemn evenings at which significant issues for the state could be resolved. </p><p>  It is not for nothing that the Belem tower is a symbol of Portugal; it is an example of how all <span>functions</span> important to the <span>state</span> can be combined in one building <span>,</span> it is a defensive fortress and at the same time an area for solving diplomatic issues. </p><p>  From the penultimate floor of the building, you can see how wonderful the wonderful Atlantic waters are and how belligerent the spirit is that it still does not leave the walls of the fortress. </p>

    <h2>  We get to the fortress </h2><p>  The Belem Tower has found its place on a hill, which allows you to see everything that happens in the sea and the city from a bird's eye view.  It is also surrounded by the waters of the Tagus River, which flows in the western part of the Portuguese capital. </p><p>  The best way to get to the fortress is by tram No. 15, which will take you to the Largo da Princesa stop.  Next 5 minutes walk on foot - and you are there. </p><p>  You can also get to the tower by train, but then the walk will be much longer due to the fact that you have to go all the way to the Tagus River. </p><h2>  Open time for sightseeing </h2><p>  A visit to the historic fortress is usually carried out on any day except Monday.  But there are certain time limits.  Between May and September, the tower is ready to receive guests from 10 am to 6:30 pm.  In other, already colder periods, time is reduced to 17:00. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that visiting such a place is not free.  The cost of one pass ticket is about 4 euros. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of experienced visitors </h2><p>  Those who visited this unusual architectural structure note that the idea and style were sustained, but the view on each side of the fortress is different and bewitching.  Inside is a museum that embodies the spirit of bygone times. </p><p>  But some say that only outward beauty is inherent in the fortress, and inside they did not see anything special.  Moreover, there are very narrow passages and corridors, which are very difficult for two to walk along.  This situation is regulated by traffic lights that are located on the aisles in the building itself. </p><p>  Many also note that this area in itself is beautiful in its nature.  Someone is attracted by the landscapes around the building and the proximity of the monastery, which is located near the Tagus River. </p><p>  Most tourists focus on the <span>romantic style</span> in which the Belem tower was built.  The observatory adds even more fabulousness and a certain mystery to the architecture of the building. </p>

Here you can find for yourself new, unknown solutions of the architect and get a lot of pleasure from the panoramic picture that opens from the tower.
