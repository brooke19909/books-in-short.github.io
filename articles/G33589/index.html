Returning social injustice seems to be the norm.  But those who lived by the tenets of Lenin‚Äôs teachings know that this is not the norm at all.  In any case, his writings are still accessible and even very topical.  In addition, the history of your country must be known.  And about who Lenin is, too.  For seventy years the country lived according to his teachings - this is a fairly large part of the life of the state.  With great victories.  With faith in tomorrow.  Let's hope that Vladimir Lenin is alive. <em> </em></p><p>  <em>Childhood</em> </p>

    <p>  Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin) was the fourth child in the family of the director of public schools in the city of Simbirsk, Ilya Nikolayevich <span>Ulyanov.</span>  <span>The family</span> was extremely friendly, because the mother devoted herself entirely to the children.  An extremely gifted pianist, excellently well-read - she had something to pass on to children.  And she herself is the best example before their eyes: never raising her voice, strict, but at the same time kind-hearted woman, fair, but able to understand her child and really deeply understand the situation.  All five of Lenin's brothers and sisters became revolutionaries.  The eldest, Alexander, was executed for the assassination attempt on Tsar <span>Alexander III.</span>  Vladimir Ilyich always studied perfectly.  He graduated from the Simbirsk gymnasium with a gold medal and entered Kazan University.  For active participation in student unrest, he was expelled and sent to the village of Kokushkino. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Revolutionary</em> </p>

    <p>  In 1888, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin became a professional revolutionary.  A study of the "Capital" of Marx and the works of Engels, Plekhanov, Kautsky helped him to comprehend all the heights and depths of political economy and philosophy in four years.  He carefully studied the economic conditions in Russia and the situation of the proletariat and peasantry.  At the same time, Vladimir Ilyich was preparing to pass exams at St. Petersburg University as an external student and passed them brilliantly, having received the diploma of assistant attorney.  True, he almost did not engage in legal practice, since other goals and tasks determined all his aspirations.  Even then, when he was very young, he surprised his comrades with the versatility and quality of knowledge and the intransigence of his convictions. </p><p>  <em>Who is Lenin</em> </p><p>  Even his first philosophical works were brilliant.  In 1894, a work entitled "What are Friends of the People ..." was published, where the whole path of the working class through the revolution to freedom and prosperity against tsarism and capitalism and for socialism was traced more clearly.  Lenin continued the work of Marx and Engels, independently developing and developing their doctrine.  In 1897 he was sent into exile in Shushenskoye (Krasnoyarsk Territory).  Here he worked hard on his books (including The Development of Capitalism in Russia).  In his personal life, too, changes came: he married <span>Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya,</span> who all his life was his first and most reliable assistant in all revolutionary matters.  Then in Shushensky, Lenin came up with a means for rallying all the progressive forces of the country.  This tool later turned out to be the Iskra newspaper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Party leader</em> </p>

    <p>  In 1903, Lenin facilitated the early convening of the second congress of the Social Democratic Labor Party.  By this time, the Social Democrats no longer had a question about who Lenin was.  His works were not only universally studied, but also gained their supporters and opponents.  It was there, in London, that the party‚Äôs split into the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, discovered by him in Shushensky, was revealed.  So Bolshevism took shape as an independent political movement.  All subsequent years, Lenin worked tirelessly, living semi-legally, either at home or abroad.  Most of the time he devoted to the study of labor reform, published the newspaper New Time, and conducted revolutionary educational work.  <span>The first Russian revolution</span> was brutally suppressed.  Vladimir Ilyich revealed all the objective and subjective causes of failure.  The following years, especially from 1908 to 1911, were very difficult. </p><p>  <em>Innovative scientist</em> </p><p>  In 1911, the party school for workers began, where Lenin lectured on the theory and practice of party politics.  After the conference in St. Petersburg, the newspaper Pravda appeared.  It was then that the broadest sections of the population of Russia learned about who Lenin was, what he was calling for, and in what way the working class would lead to the victory of the revolution.  Lenin led the publication from abroad, wrote materials for it every day, which helped to attract the majority of class-conscious workers to the work.  The First World War was not enthusiastically greeted by the people.  And Lenin called on the warring parties to turn weapons against bloody tsarism and capitalism.  In 1915, he justified the possibility of the victory of socialism in a single country.  The February bourgeois <span>revolution of 1917</span> called Lenin from abroad to Petrograd.  He edited Pravda, explaining the Bolshevik slogans and calls for a revolution that will be many times stronger than the February one.  In addition, he conducted classes, delivered speeches in the soldiers 'barracks, in the workers' shops.  The number of supporters of the revolution grew rapidly.  An order was issued to arrest Lenin.  Work continued underground. </p><p>  <em>Organization of the revolution</em> </p><p>  October 25, 1917 happened!  Lenin's contribution to the revolution is really enormous.  The doctrine he created of the party as the leader of the proletariat in the struggle for its dictatorship was <span>an irresistible force</span> for the bourgeoisie and all its manifestations.  In addition, Lenin became the founder and leader of a new philosophical trend of the Marxist sense.  The volume of his writings is enormous: fifty-five volumes of learned texts.  And the immeasurable value of what is stated in them. </p>
