On it in the old days, noble ladies made their daily promenade.  On Dam Street is the tower of Tore de la Minaco.  On it in the past there were patrol duty.  It was their responsibility to monitor the sea - whether pirate ships would appear on it.  For centuries, the tower was used as a prison.  Today it houses the best hotel in the old city.  Dam Street leads tourists to Piazza di Spagna, whose main attraction is Gordon's house.  This is the first residential building that was built on the island.  The owner of the building was Francisco de Gorai, the first notary in the area.  Goray came with Christopher Columbus and became extremely wealthy in transactions with local real estate.

    <p>  From the windows of the house of Gordon, you can see Alcazar de Collon.  The building was built in 1510. This is the house of the prince.  About one and a half thousand Indians were driven to its construction.  They were led by Spanish architects.  The construction of the palace was carried out using the most primitive tools - saws, hammers and chisels.  No nails were used during construction. </p><p>  In 1985, the local academy studied the ashes in the lighthouse.  The verdict was unequivocal: it belongs to Christopher Columbus.  On the day of the <span>discovery of America,</span> namely October 12, a visit to the tomb with the ashes of the <span>great navigator is</span> allowed <span>.</span>  That same evening, in the sky over Santo Domingo, a unique system of one hundred and fifty spotlights draws a huge cross in the sky.  The spectacle can be seen even tens of kilometers away. </p><h2>  Climate of Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The capital of the republic, as well as its many resorts, do not accidentally attract tourists.  The fact is that the Caribbean climate zone is classified as a tropical marine type.  It is characterized by warmth, high humidity and frequent winds-trade winds.  The winter period in this area is relatively dry.  An increase in humidity is observed in summer, at the end of which it rains frequently.  August is considered the hottest month: the temperature can rise to around thirty degrees.  However, the northeast winds that blow from the sea soften the heat. </p>
