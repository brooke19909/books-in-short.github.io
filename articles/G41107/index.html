Fine and soft as talc, sand that creaks under your feet, palm trees bent over the turquoise water, the delicate shadow of exotic trees and rainbow fish splashing near the shore.  Add to this the paradise gardens with peacocks pacing on it, luxurious rooms and delight spilled in the air ... This is the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa 5 *.  The photos of this hotel indicate that the rest spent in it will be unique, and you will not have to regret the money spent. </p>

    <p>  Well, what do the tourists themselves say about the hotel?  In this article we will talk about the Hilton representation on the largest island of Thailand - Phuket.  Fans of this hotel chain say that they keep the brand of the company here.  This applies to both the territory and the rooms and services.  Well, now about all this in more detail. </p><h2>  Phuket and Karon Beach.  Resort Features </h2><p>  What travelers need to know when arriving at the island‚Äôs international airport?  The fact that foreign tourists here are given free SIM cards of the Thai network.  Activate, put money into your account and use it!  Calls to Russia will be really cheaper.  As for the other features of Phuket, it is difficult to talk about them in a nutshell.  There is cheeky Patong, the capital of the sex industry, competing with Pattaya, and modest Muslim villages.  Well, what is Karon Beach famous for, next to which is the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa?  This is the second largest beach of the island.  Its length is three kilometers.  His chip is a small and clean sand that creaks under your feet like snow.  The only drawback of Karon Beach is the road (quite busy) that separates the beach from the rest of the infrastructure.  Thus, the hotels allegedly on the front page are actually located on the other side of the highway.  But, despite the fact that the beach is municipal, they clean it very carefully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  At the southern end is Karon Noi.  Unlike Patong, decency is respected here.  The rest here is a little richer.  The promenade of Karon Beach has recently been restored and is full of quiet and pleasant restaurants.  Marina Phuket Resort has Dinos Park Mini Golf, all designed in the style of Jurassic Park. </p><h2>  What is the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa 5 * </h2><p>  This spa hotel is located in the center of Karon Bay, on the western tip of Phuket.  From the international airport to the hotel you need to get about half an hour (forty kilometers).  The island‚Äôs evening activity center, Patong Resort, is a fifteen-minute drive away.  Wat Chalong Temple is five kilometers from the hotel.  The representative office of the Hilton Hotels and Resorts chain in Phuket is a huge hotel complex.  It consists of three zones, built up with dissimilar buildings of different floors.  These are Andaman Wing, Lotus and Sai Tong wing.  It will be comfortable for both lovers of high-rise buildings and those who want to relax in a quiet Thai-style villa.  The buildings were built in 1987, and the last renovation took place in 2013.  The vast territory of the complex is framed as a garden of paradise.  The impression of Eden is strengthened by peacocks, slowly walking on the lawns, and murmuring waterfalls cascading into an artificial lagoon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  As with most other hotels, rooms at the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa are categorized.  The cheapest rooms are standard.  You will have to pay extra for the sea view.  The category above is deluxe plus.  The guest area adjoins the bedroom.  The Andaman Suites feature a living room.  The Karon rooms are two bedrooms with a spacious lounge.  And the Royal Suite is a villa with its own dining room.  Some rooms have hardwood floors and some have cool tiling.  Tourists were pleasantly surprised that the air conditioners in the rooms work in manual mode and do not depend on the card inserted into the slot.  This is good because you could cool the room in your absence. </p>

    <p>  The filling and technical equipment of the rooms corresponds to the five-star status of the hotel.  A bathrobe, slippers, tea / coffee set and other signs of luxury are present.  Very high-quality new furniture and a pleasant design make the stay in the room doubly comfortable. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Karon Beach has all-inclusive hotels, but the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa is not one of them.  The hotel only practices breakfast.  Half board is available.  Most tourists said that the Karon Beach embankment contains such a number of restaurants that you can‚Äôt try everything in two weeks.  There are places to eat in the hotel.  Breakfast is served in the Bon Appetito restaurant - in the evening they serve pasta, lasagna and other Italian delicacies.  Thai Tai is famous for Asian cuisine, Zen is Japanese, and Ocean Beach Club specializes in seafood and fish dishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Breakfast at the hotel is European.  There is the usual oatmeal, granola, yogurt.  A lot of fruits and herbs, just unrealistic delicious pastries.  As for afternoon and evening meals, tourists recommend meat-eaters to visit the Karlson restaurant (not far from the Old Phuket Hotel), and go for fish dishes to the restaurant under the sign of Capri. </p><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  As we wrote, Karon Beach is located behind the road.  The hotel traffic controller does everything possible to ensure that the intersection of a busy highway is safe.  Parasols and sun loungers are rented at the municipal beach for a fee.  But towels can be freely obtained from one of the pools.  Lovers of wildlife are advised to walk along the beach to the south.  There, at Karon Noi, there is a coral reef.  But you can see the fish in the hotel itself - in the artificial lagoon.  Each zone <span>of the Hilton</span> Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa 5 * <span>hotel</span> has its own pool.  But swimming, according to reviews, can be done anywhere, despite the place of residence.  Naturally, sunbeds and umbrellas at the pools are free. </p>

    <p>  The pools are very beautiful, decorated in the form of lagoons with waterfalls.  Bars are located nearby.  Tourists say that there you can take cocktails or ice cream at any time. </p><h2>  Services at the hotel.  Which of them are paid </h2><p>  According to reviews, the rooms at the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa are cleaned twice a day.  And for real - with mopping and replacing towels.  And always - in the absence of guests.  And new clothes were laid in a day.  In general, the hotel staff is unobtrusive.  It was in the Hilton that many tourists made sure that Thailand is the Land of Smiles. </p>

    <p>  A feature that few reviews talk about is that the hotel teaches you the basics of diving for free.  The word "Spa" in the name of the hotel is also not accidental.  Visitors have free access to the sauna and hot tub.  But the services of experienced Thai masseurs are already worth the money.  There is a depository at the reception, where you must put a certain amount of baht upon check-in.  Money is returned by deducting the amount for the paid services used. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Tourists call the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa the most kids-friendly hotel.  Paradise conditions are created here for little guests.  Thailand is famous as a country of shopping.  So that parents can fully indulge in this occupation, a mini club is located on the territory of the hotel.  A child under the supervision of animators draws, plays, runs, jumps on a trampoline ... and in the evening does not want to leave.  If you go on shopping or a full-day excursion, you can choose from the restaurant menu dishes that will feed the child in your absence.  The hotel has cribs, high chairs for babies and low slides by the pools. </p><h2>  Excursions in Phuket </h2><p>  The Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel is located very convenient to make various travels on the island.  Tours tourists recommend not buying at the hotel.  Directly opposite there is a small booth where a Russian-speaking guide works.  Some tourists went to see Thai boxing.  On a transvestite show, you can go to Patong yourself - at the same time and watch the evening Bangla Road in all its glory.  This tour is best done without children.  Tourists also liked trips to the elephant farm and to the islands of Phi Phi.  Excellent water excursions with snorkeling on high-speed boats or walks on traditional "tailed" boats will also not leave anyone indifferent.  Tourists recommend visiting at least one Thai temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hilton phuket arcadia resort spa 5 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1068246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  In general, vacationers - especially those who are familiar with the high level of service in the Hilton network - found that the hotel corresponds to the stated five stars.  The location of the hotel is just excellent, based on the conditions on Karon Beach.  It offers stunning views of the sea or the hills.  The territory is so large that even when the hotel is completely full in high season, there is no sense of crush.  You can have breakfast in one of the two restaurants.  There are never queues, the waiters are very quick.  Everyone praises breakfast at the Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort &amp; Spa.  Reviews say that the food here is familiar to the European taste - cottage cheese, pancakes, yogurts.  The abundance of fruits is especially pleasing to visitors.  Many reviews praise landscape design: bunk pools with cascades, bridges across the lagoon. </p>
