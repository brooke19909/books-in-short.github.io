    <h2>  From the history of the hotel </h2><p>  There was a time when Karelia worked only for foreign tourists.  <span>The hotel (St. Petersburg</span> lies in front of it, as if in the palm of its hand) belonged to the Intourist network.  Almost all national hockey and skiing teams, as well as chess, stayed here.  Very close to the hotel is <span>Polyustrovsky Park,</span> where you can conduct sports training and just walk in the evening.  Today the situation has changed, every resident and guest of the city can take advantage of the hospitality, which Karelia (hotel) generously lavishes.  St. Petersburg is rich in historical and cultural monuments, and the historic city center is located just a 15-minute drive from the hotel.  It is here that <span>Smolny Cathedral</span> and Nevsky Prospect are located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  If you like to view the city from a bird's eye view, then your best choice is Karelia (hotel).  St. Petersburg is amazingly beautiful, and the tall sixteen-story building in which the hotel is located helps to enjoy the city in the rays of dawn and sunset, in sunlight and night lights.  Despite the fact that the hotel was built back in 1979, today it has undergone a complete renovation and is the most modern, cozy and comfortable hotel in the city.  There is no place for relics of the past, on the contrary, tourists note that the rest is fully consistent with the European level.  And it‚Äôs doubly pleasant that such praises are not lavished on a foreign resort, but on our Russian hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel karelia spb" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1033423.jpg" width="500"></div>

We have already given the address, now let's take a closer look at how you can get to the place.  The hotel is located on the right <span>bank of the Neva,</span> in a sleeping area, where you can enjoy peace and quiet.  There will be no problems with delivery: there are several public transport stops nearby.  The nearest airports are 25 km away - these are Pulkovo-1 and Pulkovo-2.  From the hotel to the center and back you can easily get on the shuttle buses No. 181 and K-28, K-185, K-332, K-118.  The waiting time at the stop does not exceed 3-4 minutes, and you will reach the place in 15 minutes in the absence of traffic jams.

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It is rare that, having arrived in the Northern capital, he spends all day at the hotel, even if he is as comfortable and calm as the Karelia Hotel (St. Petersburg).  Photos taken while walking around the city will make your family album a lot more colorful.  However, even without going outside the hotel you can find a lot of options in order to have a good time.  There is a solarium on the territory, free admission for tourists.  There is a 24-hour front desk, an ATM and a tour desk.  Even at night you can have a car tour in St. Petersburg.  For beautiful ladies there is a hairdresser and a beauty salon, for business people - a business center and a conference room. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  ‚ÄúKarelia‚Äù is an example of home comfort and warmth, it is quiet and calm here.  Judging by the reviews, this suits absolutely everyone, because lovers of vibrant nightlife in St. Petersburg can find a huge amount of entertainment.  The rest of the guests, who, on the contrary, are looking for a quiet place to sleep and relax, this does not hurt.  Absolutely everything emphasizes the convenient location of the hotel.  The modern high-rise building is organically inscribed in the landscape of the park area, which immediately has a good rest.  A lot of kind words are addressed to the staff.  The polite and attentive employees of the Kareliya Hotel (reviews with great warmth mark their work) are always ready to help, but the rest of the time they are almost never visible.  Of course, a three-star hotel may seem to someone too modest, without gloss and pleasant trifles.  Nevertheless, I would like to note that business people regularly stay at the hotel, who are satisfied with the high level of service for reasonable money.  Many praise the excellent cuisine, gourmet breakfasts and amazing dishes that can be ordered throughout the day. </p>
