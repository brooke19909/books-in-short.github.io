  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Epilator Philips - option without losing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smooth skin has become an invariable attribute of a <span>well-groomed woman.</span>  Therefore, the modern industry is developing more and more new methods of hair removal, making it as painless, comfortable and effective as possible.  Let's talk about one of the most popular hair removal devices - an electric epilator.  For example, consider the Philips epilators. </p><p>  <strong>Principle of operation</strong> </p><p>  The Philips epilator is a small, beautifully designed device with built-in tweezers - 21 pcs, located on metal disks.  When an electric current is supplied, the discs begin to rotate, tweezers grab the hairs and pull them out, most often with a hair follicle.  The rotation speed is adjustable - you can set medium or high. </p><p>  Initially, electroepilators were intended <span>to remove hair</span> only on the legs.  But in modern models there are special nozzles that help remove hair in more delicate areas. </p><p>  <span>The Philips epilator</span> is equipped with a special massager that helps make the skin more supple for hair removal and less sensitive.  Some models are equipped with special bags with a cooling gel to enhance the effect of pain relief.  All new models allow you to do <span>bikini</span> and armpit hair removal. </p><p>  <strong>Pros and cons</strong> </p><p>  The advantages include the long-lasting effect of smooth skin, the availability of the procedure at home without any special skills, and the low price of this device. </p><p>  And the following facts can be mentioned as minuses: some women after using the epilator experience the effect of ingrown hairs.  True, this risk can be avoided if several times a week to carry out peeling procedures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And another minus is the pain of the procedure.  However, according to reviews, the sensitivity of the skin decreases sharply after two or three sessions using the epilator. </p><p>  <strong>How to use the Philips epilator at home?</strong> </p><p>  The device itself must be held correctly - with an inclination in the direction of its movement.  The direction of motion of the epilator is against hair growth, the speed of movement is slow. </p><p>  For smooth <span>legs, hair removal</span> should be carried out, moving from bottom to top. </p><p>  In the armpit area, hair grows in all directions, so you need to do <span>circular movements with an</span> epilator. </p><p>  The device should not be pressed too hard to the skin, so as not to leave minor damage.  But to carry out several times under the same skin area - you can without problems.  This will provide better hair removal. </p><p>  Epilators do not do well with long hairs.  Therefore, they must first either be cut short or shave and wait until they grow by 2-3 millimeters. </p><p>  After using the epilator, redness may occur on sensitive skin.  This should not be considered an annoyance.  This effect has the usual mechanical effect, because the hair is pulled out of the skin along with the bulb.  After a few hours, the skin will return to its usual color.  To reduce the effect, you can use special tools after shaving or hair removal. </p><p>  If there are red dots, and the redness does not go away, then you may be pushing the epilator too much to the skin.  Or, a similar <span>type of hair removal,</span> in principle, is not suitable for you because of too sensitive skin. </p><p>  <strong>Epilator Philips, reviews:</strong> </p><p>  ‚ÄúTo each his own - who shaves his legs every day, who goes to laser hair removal.  And I chose the epilator.  In time - quickly, in terms of accessibility - great and inexpensive.  Of all the manufacturers, Philips was chosen.  And I got used to the pain of hair removal a couple of times.  Now it‚Äôs no problem, even in the bikini zone. ‚Äù </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe Philips epilator was chosen by chance - the most ordinary and inexpensive.  And never regretted it.  On the removable head of the epilator it is written that it is made in Slovenia.  He has a very nice design, streamlined shape, he liked the drawing.  Another positive aspect of the design is the ribbed surface on the back wall so that your fingers do not slip.  Well, the skin after Philips is smoother - I used epilators from other manufacturers for testing. ‚Äù </p><p>  <strong>Attention, contraindications for using the epilator:</strong> </p><p>  - phlebeurysm; </p><p>  - damage to the skin; </p><p>  - pregnancy. </p>
