Fruits and vegetables daily at breakfast. </p><p>  Opposite the hotel is the Family Mart.  Snacks and drinks are also available there. </p><h2>  Karon Beach </h2><p>  Phuket is famous for the diversity and cleanliness of the beach lines.  The nearest beach to Baan Karon Resort 3 * (Phuket, Karon) is Karon.  Its name appears in the name of the hotel.  This is a special practice of hotel complexes in Thailand. </p><p>  Karon is a beach stretching for several kilometers along the western part of the island.  He is often chosen by couples with children, because it is clean, beautiful, and the Karon Beach area is quite calm.  There are many cafes, restaurants, there are markets, but for more noisy leisure you will have to go to Patong.  The road to Patong takes about ten to fifteen minutes. </p><p>  Karon is the island's only quartz sand beach.  It has a yellowish beautiful color.  In the sun, such sand is very hot, so it is better to walk along the beach in special shoes.  This is especially true for children. </p>

    <p>  The Baan Karon Resort hotel territory is also worthy of excellent marks.  Reviews about the tropical garden and terraces, as well as cozy balconies are the warmest.  The cost of accommodation is very modest, which can also be considered an absolute plus. </p><h2>  Disadvantages that tourists write about </h2><p>  In general, there are few shortcomings.  Some guests are unhappy with the location of the establishment.  Sometimes it is required that the hotel is located closer to the beach line.  Some tourists do not pay attention to the free shuttle service. </p><p>  They also write that there are no discos near the hotel.  It's true.  Karon in this regard is not the place where you need to go for nightly entertainment.  All of them are concentrated on the largest beach of the island - Patong.  In the evening, life begins in Patong, bars and discos are open all night, as well as a large shopping center.  But on this beach at night it is difficult to sleep because of music and noise. </p><p>  When choosing a hotel, it is better to get acquainted with the reviews in advance. </p><h2>  Where to go on an excursion? </h2><p>  Phuket is a great place to visit interesting and memorable excursions in a tropical paradise.  The choice for tourists is huge.  You can buy a voucher directly in the lobby of the Baan Karon Resort 3 * hotel (Phuket, Karon).  An experienced employee will easily pick up for the guest a trip for every taste and budget. </p><p>  A tour of the island, as a rule, comes as a gift from a tour operator, but if you travel on your own, it would be nice to explore the large and beautiful Phuket. </p><p>  A day or two can be spent on a trip to one of the national parks in Thailand - Khao Lak or Khao Sok, including Lake Cheolan.  They will ride on elephants and talk about how the country lives today. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the mass of sea excursions.  This includes day trips to small islands - Coral, Racha, and snorkeling, and diving.  The Phi Phi Islands and the <span>Similan Islands</span> complex deserve a separate discussion <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  These places can be safely called paradise.  Here, pure white sand, untouched nature and the azure ocean.  The film "Beach" was shot on the Phi Phi islands, and people do not live on the Similans.  They are located in the Indian Ocean, far from civilization.  There are no shops and cafes, there is only white as flour, sand, sea and jungle.  Crayfish run on the sand.  Tourists are invited to swim by the coral reefs, enjoy the view from the shore, sunbathe and relax.  Very often in the water you can find large sea turtles or reef sharks.  Such excursions will be remembered for a lifetime! </p><p>  Phuket is a beautiful island of Thailand, there is entertainment for everyone, and relaxation will be unforgettable near Karon Beach at Baan Resort.  And most importantly, many people can afford such a vacation. </p>
