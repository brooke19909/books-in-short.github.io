On the contrary, the hero of the courtly novels is a secular man and therefore close to readers.  He possesses many virtues and, of course, is devoted to his Lady of the heart. </p><p>  Lancelot Lake - one of the most famous heroes of the knightly epic.  Novels in the Middle Ages were written about his exploits and love for Guinevere, and today they make films.  They are based on the ancient legends of the Celts about the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur. </p><h2>  Celtic mythology </h2><p>  What do we know about the Celts?  Much less than the Romans or Greeks.  Historians are sure that they had a written language, but not a single text was recorded that time.  It is believed that Druid priests had a hand in this. </p><p>  Be that as it may, all that we know today about the Celtic civilization is based on archaeological finds and an oral tradition.  The latter was preserved in the form of legends, and each of them has several options. </p>

    <p>  A vivid example of this is the tradition in which there is a famous medieval character: Lancelot.  Celtic mythology, according to some scholars, transformed one of the pagan gods into a new hypostasis - the illustrious knight of the Round Table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moreover, there are various expositions of his life and adventures.  All this was reflected in the heyday of medieval <span>knightly literature,</span> when cycles of novels about King Arthur were created in England, Germany and France. </p><h2>  Breton legends </h2><p>  In the mythological history of the Celts, Arthur appears completely unexpectedly.  The most ancient references to him can be found in Welsh sources, where he appears as an ordinary military leader, who does not stand out from the others.  However, traditions soon elevate him to an unprecedented height. </p><p>  A similar twist remains a mystery to researchers to this day.  However, like the personality of King Arthur.  Unfortunately, we will never know if he had a real prototype, although many historians are inclined to this version. </p><p>  It is believed that the Britons - one of the Celtic tribes - at the end of the 5th - beginning of the 6th century did indeed have a military leader named Arthur.  Later, in legends, his personality combined with the image of the Celtic god Arthius and in this interpretation was widely distributed among the Britons.  His faithful comrades-in-arms have the same semi-mythical origin. </p><p>  Lancelot - the knight of the Round Table - appeared in these legends later than other actors of the Arturovsky cycle.  Nevertheless, it was he, along with the king, who became the most famous hero of medieval literature. </p><h2>  Knights of the Round Table </h2><p>  Chretien de Trois, author of the 12th-century courtesan novels, mentions in one of them the castle of Camelot as the place where King Arthur gathered his knights at the Round Table.  According to Celtic legends, such an unusual table shape was invented by the <span>wizard Merlin</span> so that all the knights behind him felt on equal terms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to the same Chretien de Troyes, the cycle of works about King Arthur was enriched by a new character, who later became one of the most famous in literature.  Lancelot Ozerny first appears in the novel ‚ÄúThe Knight of the Cart‚Äù as an example of an ideal lover, ready for the sake of the Lady of the heart for the most reckless exploits. </p><p>  Since that time, the writings about the Knights of the Round Table acquire the character of a courteous novel.  Such virtues as personal valor, readiness to come to the aid of the weak and, of course, service to the Beautiful Lady are glorified in them. </p><h2>  Sir Lancelot Lake District: The Legend </h2><p>  If King Arthur may have had a historical prototype, then Knight Lancelot is a fictional character.  We draw information about his life from courtly novels of the 12th century and later works.  In them, medieval realities are firmly intertwined with Celtic mythology.  What do we know about this popular hero of chivalric novels? </p><p>  Lancelot was the son of Ban, king of Brittany.  Once, Cloud attacked the lands of Lancelot's father, he and his family were forced to flee under cover of night.  But the king‚Äôs heart could not stand it when he looked back and saw his castle, engulfed in flames.  The queen laid her son on the lake, and she bent over the body of a dying husband. </p>

    <p>  All this was watched by Vivian, the Lake Virgo, who simply stole the little Lancelot and took him to her possessions.  The poor queen, having lost her son and husband, had no choice but to find shelter in the monastery. </p><h2>  In the castle of Camelot </h2><p>  Vivian, better known as the Lake Virgin, learned magic from Merlin in love with her.  Over time, she created her own courtyard, consisting of many ladies and knights.  In such an environment, Lancelot was brought up until he was 18 years old. </p>

    <p>  Vivian sent a young pupil, nicknamed Ozerny, to Camelot to the court of King Arthur, where he will be knighted.  Arriving at the castle, he made a great impression on its inhabitants with his nobleness, courage and ability to wield weapons. </p><p>  The wife of Arthur, Queen of Guinevere, from the ranks of other knights singled out Lancelot.  Needless to say, according to the laws of the courteous novel, the vassal fell in love with the overlord's wife and she reciprocated.  For the sake of Guinevere, Lancelot Ozerny won many military and tournament victories. </p><h2>  Enchantment of Elaine </h2><p>  Fidelity to the chosen Lady of the heart in the Middle Ages was considered one of the main virtues.  As an exemplary knight, Lancelot was, of course, loyal to Queen Guinevere, although many women sought his love.  For example, Princess Elaine.  There are several variations of her relationship with Lancelot. </p><p>  According to one of them, using the help of a sorceress, Elaine assumes the guise of Guinevere and thus achieves her: Lancelot spends the night with her.  True, when the deception is revealed, he refuses to marry her and returns to King Arthur. </p>

    <p>  Only when Galahad, the illegitimate son of Lancelot of the Lake, came of age, did he meet with his father.  The young man was distinguished by nobleness and purity, so of all the knights he only managed to find and receive a precious relic - the Holy Grail. </p><h2>  Eternal Triangle </h2><p>  But back to the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, since it was she who made up the core of chivalric novels.  As in the case of Elaine, various interpretations of their relationship are found in medieval literature. </p>

    <p>  Some works describe Lancelot's feelings for King Arthur's wife as exclusively platonic.  Others make it clear that the lovers have nevertheless crossed the line of what is permitted. </p><p>  In the end, the deceived king sentenced the unfaithful spouse to be burned.  True, the execution never took place - Sir Lancelot Ozerny saved Guinevere and hid her in the monastery, he himself disappeared into Brittany. </p><h2>  End of the legend </h2><p>  According to feudal laws, King Arthur gathered an army to punish a vassal who violated the oath of allegiance.  To control Camelot in his absence was Mordred, whom legends call either the illegitimate son or the king‚Äôs nephew. </p><p>  But the treacherous Mordred, desiring to seize power in Camelot, concludes an alliance with the Saxons - tribes hostile to the Britons.  King Arthur dies in an ambush arranged for him, and Guinevere, despite the pleas of Lancelot, takes tonsure and becomes a nun.  Thus ends one of the most famous love stories in literature. </p><p>  More than a century has passed since the creation of the courtly novels; nevertheless, the knight Lancelot Ozerny has not been forgotten.  On the contrary, his love for Guinevere, exploits and life in general continue to interest our contemporaries. </p>
