    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the negative comments regarding this hotel, it is especially worth highlighting the following: </p><ul><li>  constant problems with hot water in the rooms (especially for the upper floors); </li><li>  dirty dishes in the hotel dining room, as well as an untidy uniform among the waiters and workers at the distribution; </li><li>  at the entrance to the hotel there are several large garbage cans that emit an unpleasant odor; </li><li>  the complete lack of animation for both adults and children; </li><li>  very old furniture and plumbing in the rooms, and the whole hotel is in need of repair; </li><li>  at the entrance to the sea there are many small fish that bite very painfully; </li><li>  construction is being carried out in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, which not only spoils the view from the window (of those rooms that overlook the mountains), but also creates a lot of noise and garbage; </li><li>  there are practically no fruits on the buffet menu (the only thing you can sometimes count on is not very high-quality watermelons); </li><li>  Hotel staff and the administration practically do not respond to requests, comments and complaints of guests. </li></ul>
