In the process there are many difficulties, delaying the deadlines, changing ideological inspirers.  However, the level of coherence, initiative, as well as appreciation from the audience is noticeably higher.  Such a circus is in the city of Omsk.  In a region with a very cold and harsh climate, there is no time for entertainment.  These difficulties can be overcome if there are those who want to help in this.  As you know, the circus gives people special joy.  Omsk is a city where people are kind and cheerful. </p>

    <h2>  The right attitude </h2><p>  For four decades of work, the circus in Omsk showed performances of different troupes.  Viewers saw performances of many genres.  The joy of the townspeople was caused by acrobatic and gymnastic tricks, juggling clowns and tightrope walkers, as well as animals.  The circus cheered up the inhabitants of Omsk thanks to the performances of artists and animals who performed incredible stunts in the arena. </p><p>  This circus (Omsk) has been operating for many years.  Guest reviews can be found in the book, which is placed at the entrance.  People write that this place is like a fairy tale that gives a <span>positive attitude</span> for many years to come.  Kids love clowns and trained poodles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the reviews, trainers are especially noted, who were able to tame the most ferocious predators.  Each performance is a real show, which is accompanied by applause and thanks from the audience.  Humor and talented performances of clowns also leave no one indifferent.  You can endlessly talk about such a thing as a circus.  It is difficult to imagine something more spectacular and vibrant.  Especially when on stage there are flexible gymnasts who perform tricks under the very dome. </p>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Omsk Circus is already thirty-seven years old, but there is little information about it.  Very few people remember his true story.  Siberians assure that this requires time and hard work.  The reason lies in the small number of documentary evidence containing information about the circus.  Some information, however, has already become public.  The history of the emergence of circus art in Omsk is known. </p><p>  Residents of the city got acquainted with the circus in the 19th century with the appearance of a stationary circus room made of wood.  It belonged to the merchant Sichkarev, who built it in 1898.  It was heavy and low, but it could fit up to eight hundred spectators.  For its time it is a lot!  Under this roof were also theatrical and musical productions.  After some time, the first movie shows began. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But there was one unpleasant moment.  Due to the lack of heating in the winter, performances became a real test for both artists and spectators.  However, no one complained about the difficulties, the idea was worth it.  And people continued to visit the circus of Omsk. </p>

    <h2>  The appearance of the second circus </h2><p>  Sooner or later, competition is everywhere.  At the beginning of the 20th century, there were already two circus rooms in the city.  The second circus (Omsk) was built on Cossack Square, but it was originally designed as a temporary one. </p><p>  The new building was warm and comfortable, so all the artists from the circus of the merchant moved here.  The Sichkarevsky circus was covered, and the building was planned to be reconstructed.  These plans were not destined to come true, as there were no people willing to invest in an expensive and risky project.  In 1909, the Sichkarevsky circus was abandoned, as evidenced by documentary evidence. </p><p>  After the revolution of 1917 and the change of power, the construction of the <span>Soviet circus began.</span>  From documentary sources received information that the first performance of artists took place in 1922.  Now they are trying to remember who and how spoke at the premiere. </p><p>  In those days, the government controlled the actions of creative teams that spoke to a large number of people.  Therefore, gymnasts and trainers with small animals performed to a greater extent.  The highlight of the program was a bear who rode a bicycle. </p><h2>  Years of silence </h2><p>  There are no data on performances in the next half century.  The following reliable information indicates the opening of a new circus for 1900 seats on October 14, 1973.  For 30 years, the Omsk circus delighted the audience, but in 2006 it was closed for repairs: the fire alarm system needed to be updated.  Some of the structural features of the building did not meet the new stringent fire safety requirements.  For three years, Omsk was deprived of its favorite resting place.  Visiting troupes performed in tent circuses, which were set in haste. </p>

    <p>  The end of 2009 was marked by the opening of a renovated building.  The reconstruction also affected the number of seats for the audience: they became four hundred fewer.  But this fact did not upset the residents and visitors of the city, because the joy of the discovery was noticeably greater.  By the way, there are plans to restore lost places in the future. </p><h2>  The best in Russia </h2><p>  Time passed.  The circus of Omsk to this day is one of the best.  There are more than 30 circuses in the country, but only in Omsk is the best fire safety system.  Now no one is hiding the names of the groups that perform here.  In the arena were world-famous artists: Zapashny, Kio, Filatova and others. </p><p>  During the reconstruction of the building, the square in front of it was redone.  In this place the famous circus "Baronets" performed.  Omsk rejoiced during the performance of virtuoso artists. </p><h2>  Regular touring </h2><p>  On the stage in front of the audience are the best domestic and foreign artists, vivid performances, exciting tricks and mysterious attractions.  This holiday is created by the simplest people.  The joy of the audience and artists makes us understand that the end is not visible to him.  In the summer of 2015, the Royal Circus performed in Omsk.  The circus of Gia Eradze with the new show "Baronets" conquered the locals. </p>
