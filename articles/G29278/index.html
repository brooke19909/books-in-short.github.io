    <h2>  Norms of behavior of past centuries </h2><p>  In the modern world, etiquette is nothing more than a set of rules designed to make our life pleasant and safe in <span>communicating with each other,</span> as well as to protect ourselves and others from inadvertent claims and insults.  Many of the requirements, such as not slapping the stranger on the shoulder, are quite obvious and are dictated by life itself, but there are those that are transmitted in the form of teachings and instructions. </p><p>  The history of the origin of etiquette in its earliest form is known mainly due to the norms of behavior set forth in the Egyptian and Roman manuscripts, as well as in Homer's Odyssey.  Already in these ancient documents, the principles of the relationship of the sexes, bosses and subordinates were formulated, and the rules for communicating with foreigners were also established.  It is known that violation of these attitudes entailed the most severe punishments.  In general, the norms of communication between people were complicated in parallel with how history itself developed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knight's Code of Honor </h2><p>  Etiquette in Western Europe found itself especially fertile ground in the X-XI century, with the spread of the system of chivalry among the privileged layers of society.  As a result of this, the Code of Honor appeared - a set of rules stipulating to the smallest detail not only the norms of behavior, but also prescribing to the knight the color and style of his clothes, as well as generic heraldic symbolism. </p><p>  During this period, many new very peculiar rituals and customs appeared, such as, for example, indispensable participation in <span>knightly tournaments</span> and the achievement of feats in the name of the lady of the heart, even in cases where the chosen one did not reciprocate.  In order to fully comply with his status, the knight had to be brave, noble and generous.  However, the last two qualities needed to be shown only in relation to people of his circle.  With the common people, the knight was free to do as he pleases, but this is a completely different story. </p><p>  Etiquette, or rather, strict adherence to its rules, was sometimes able to play a cruel joke with those who blindly obeyed it.  For example, the case is known when, during the <span>Battle of Crescy,</span> which became the most important battle of the Hundred Years War, the French knights, having galloped to their king Philip VI with an urgent report, did not dare to break the court etiquette and be the first to turn to it.  When the monarch finally allowed them to speak, they bowed for a long time, giving each other this honorable right.  As a result, the rules of good manners were observed, but time was lost, and procrastination destructively affected the course of the battle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Etiquette was further developed in the XVII-XVIII century at the court of the French king Louis XIV.  Actually, this word itself stepped into the world from his palace, where during one of the receptions, everyone present received a card (in French - etiquete) with a detailed list of rules of conduct that he was obliged to continue to follow. </p><h2>  The history of etiquette in Russia </h2><p>  In pre-Petrine Russia there also existed certain standards of etiquette, but they came not from Europe, but from Byzantium, with which for centuries there were close ties.  However, side by side with them, the wild customs of pagan antiquity coexisted, sometimes confusing foreign ambassadors.  The history of etiquette in Russia, which has repeatedly become the subject of close scrutiny, shows how important it was given to the social status of a person. </p><p>  It was customary, for example, to visit a peer, drive into the courtyard and stop at the very porch.  If the owner of the house was higher in rank, then he was supposed to stop still on the street, and walk through the courtyard on foot.  The owner was obliged to meet an important guest standing on the porch, an equal in the entrance hall, and one whose status is lower in the upper room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It was supposed to enter the room without a hat, but not to leave it in the hallway, like a cane or staff, but be sure to hold it in your hands.  Upon entering, the guest was baptized three times on the icon, and then, if the owner was higher than his rank, he bowed to him.  If they were equal, then they shook hands.  Relatives hugged. </p><p>  The history of Russian etiquette during the reign of Peter I in many respects recalls the path that the countries of Western Europe, once mired, like Russia, in barbarism and lack of culture have traveled.  Peter, like many foreign monarchs, forced his subjects to follow the norms of civilization.  Among high society, he introduced fashionable European-style clothing, allowing the wearing of caftans and Armenians only to representatives of the lower classes.  He made the boyars, in fear of an impressive fine, shave their beards. </p>

    <p>  In addition, thanks to the tsar, the situation of Russian women has radically changed.  If earlier wives and daughters of even the highest dignitaries were obliged to sit at home, now they have become regular participants in all holidays and celebrations.  The rules of gallant handling with them appeared and came into use.  This largely contributed to the achievement of the European nobility by the domestic nobility. </p><h2>  Fashionable Education </h2><p>  At the end of the 18th century, and especially during the reign of Alexander I, among the aristocracy, education and awareness of literature and art became fashionable.  Proficiency in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãhas become the norm.  The meticulous imitation of Western European patterns, in clothing and behavior took on the character of a stable style called comme il faut (from French comme il faut - literally translated ‚Äúas it should‚Äù). </p><p>  A vivid example of this is the image of Eugene Onegin, well known to us from the school bench.  It is enough to recall how important this rake attached to his wardrobe, but at the same time he was able to shine in society with an excellent command of the French language and familiarity with ancient poetry. </p><p>  According to Pushkin, he was able not only to dance the mazurka, but also to disassemble the Latin epigraph, to talk about Juvenal‚Äôs poetry and immediately devote a brilliant epigram to the lady.  Etiquette of that time was a whole science, from the realization of which career and further advancement in society depended a lot. </p>

    <h2>  Intelligentsia and the new requirements of etiquette </h2><p>  The further history of the development of etiquette in our country marks its rise to a new qualitative level in the middle of the 19th century.  This was due to the reforms of Alexander II, which opened the way to education for people of various classes.  A new and previously unknown social stratum called the intelligentsia has appeared in the country. </p><p>  To her belonged people who did not have a high position in society, but were well educated and, by virtue of their upbringing, learned good manners.  However, in their midst excessive politeness and extremely scrupulous adherence to the rules of etiquette adopted in the period of previous reigns began to look somewhat archaic. </p><p>  The etiquette of the 19th century provided, among other things, for strict adherence to the fashion for jewelry, in which diamonds and gold gave way to antique cameos made of ivory or corresponding breeds of stone.  In ladies' society, it became good practice to wear short hairstyles in memory of the heroines of the European revolutions, who ended their lives on the scaffold, who had their hair cut short before being executed.  They also came into fashion, and therefore became one of the requirements of etiquette, curls or a small bundle of loose hair pulled together by several ribbons. </p><h2>  Etiquette in the country of the victorious proletariat </h2><p>  Did the history of the development of etiquette have a continuation in the Soviet period?  Yes, of course, but the stormy and dramatic events of the 20th century reflected in its entirety.  The years of the Civil War pushed into the past the very existence of <span>secular society,</span> which once established the rules of good form.  Along with this, decent manners completely went out of use.  The emphasized rudeness became a sign of belonging to the proletariat - the hegemonic class.  Only diplomats and individual representatives of senior management were guided by the norms of behavior, however, by no means always. </p><p>  When the wars finally died out, and in the second half of the 20th century, a poor, but politically stable life was established in the country, most of the population rushed to universities, which at that time was quite affordable.  The result of this desire for knowledge was the general upsurge of the population‚Äôs culture, and with it the increased need for observing communication standards. </p>

    <p>  The word "etiquette" itself was rarely used, but everyone who wanted to make a favorable impression on others was obliged to follow the rules of decency.  A number of stable expressions intended for certain occasions have firmly entered into everyday life.  Phrases such as ‚Äúwill it not make it difficult for you‚Äù, ‚Äúplease‚Äù or ‚Äúdo not refuse courtesy‚Äù have become the hallmark of every cultural person. </p><p>  In those years, the preferred style of men's clothing was a business suit and shirt with a tie, and women's clothing was a strict dress, a blouse and a skirt below the knees.  No sexuality in clothing was allowed.  The word "comrade" with the addition of a surname was equally used in an appeal to both a man and a woman.  These rules of ‚ÄúSoviet etiquette‚Äù were not taught at school, but were more or less strictly enforced by most citizens. </p><h2>  Features of Eastern Etiquette </h2><p>  All that was discussed above is a European history of etiquette from antiquity to the present day.  But the story would be incomplete without mentioning how this area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman culture developed in the countries of the East.  It is known that in most of them the rules of behavior and relationships with other members of society were given great importance.  This is equally evidenced by today's customs that exist inside these countries and their centuries-old history. </p><p>  Etiquette of China is one of the oldest aspects of its culture.  Each of the successive ruling dynasties made its own changes to the code of conduct, and established requirements, the implementation of which was closely monitored.  However, despite the differences, they all had common features. </p><p>  For example, in all ages, the Chinese clothing should have corresponded to his status and position in the bureaucratic hierarchy.  The outfits were strictly divided into those that the emperor, the rulers of the vassal principalities, ministers, aristocrats, and so on had the right to wear.  Moreover, the simple peasant did not have the right to dress whatever he wanted, but was obliged to obey the established norms. </p>

    <p>  Each step of the hierarchical ladder corresponded with a certain headdress that could not be removed even indoors.  The Chinese did not cut their hair, but laid them in complex hairstyles, which were also an indicator of social status. </p><h2>  Korea‚Äôs Code of Conduct and History </h2><p>  The etiquette of this country is in many respects similar to Chinese, since both states have been linked closely for centuries.  The community of cultures became especially noticeable after many Chinese immigrated to Korea as a result of the political crisis that erupted in the 20th century, bringing with them a significant part of the national culture. </p><p>  The basis of the rules of conduct are the requirements concluded in two religions practiced in the country - Confucianism and Buddhism.  They are taught in educational institutions at all levels, their observance is carried out vigilant control. </p><p>  A characteristic feature of local etiquette is the avoidance of the use of second person pronouns.  A well-educated Korean will never even say ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äù about someone, but will politely pronounce the name with the addition of ‚Äúmaster‚Äù, ‚Äúmistress‚Äù or ‚Äúteacher‚Äù. </p><h2>  Features of the behavior of the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun </h2><p>  The history of etiquette rules in Japan is largely connected with the <span>Bushido code</span> ("The Way of the Warrior") established in it in the XII-XIII century.  He determined the norms of behavior and morality of the military class, which was dominant in the state.  On its basis, already in the 20th century, a school textbook was compiled, in which all the rules of behavior of a well-educated person in society and at home are examined in detail. </p>
