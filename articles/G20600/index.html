  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beautiful and comfortable do-it-yourself cosmetic bag</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Having at home even a small amount of cosmetics and various hairpins, it is very easy to lose them.  Spending your time looking for lipstick or elastic for hair, you begin to think about the need to store such trifles in one place.  Perfectly suitable for this cosmetics bag, sewn and decorated with your own hands. </p><p>  It will not be difficult for needlewomen to make several diverse and beautiful models of such a necessary thing.  But for those who do not have good sewing skills, the simplest cosmetic bag is offered.  You can sew such a model with your own hands in just an hour.  Let's look at a few different models. </p><p>  The first cosmetic bag sewn with your own hands should have a rectangular shape.  It is on it that we will train to make the production of subsequent models made easy.  We need two flaps of any fabric for the top and a lining with dimensions of 16x22 cm, a zipper of 15 cm and any decorative elements for decoration.  In finished form, the product will have dimensions of 14x10 cm, which is quite enough to store a minimum supply of cosmetics, which should always be at hand. </p><p>  We cut out two parts of the required size.  To start, we sew the zipper into the outer part.  To do this, fold the short sides of the top with the zipper with the front sides inward and connect with a stitch at a distance of 0.7 cm from the cut.  Fold the part in half so that the sewn lock is at the top.  Equalize the side sections and grind, retreating 1 cm from the edge.  We turn the finished part to the front side. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Take the lining detail.  Turn the short sides inside out by 1 cm and iron.  Fold the part in half with the wrong side outward, sew the sides together, backing 1 cm from the edge.  We put a lining in the finished part of the top.  We apply ironed sections to the zipper and pin with needles.  We sew the lining manually or lay a beautiful line along the outer part, which will simultaneously fix the lining.  Now it is necessary to arrange our product with decorative elements and use it with pleasure. </p><p>  A round cosmetic bag sewn with your own hands will require a little more time.  Let's make it in the form of a pencil case.  The manufacturing principle is similar to the previous method, but with small additions.  We will need a piece of fabric 16x22 cm and two small pieces for the side circles.  Also, prepare a 15 cm lock. If desired, can be made with a lining.  But we will consider an option sewn from drap with external seams.  We cut off the finished main part with special edging scissors in short sections, forming beautiful triangles. </p><p>  We lay the zipper face up on the table.  We impose the main part on it and fix it with needles on one and the other side.  We adjust, departing from the middle of the castle 0.5 cm on each side.  We get the pipe.  Set it sideways on a piece of fabric and circle the resulting circle.  We cut two identical parts.  We sew them on the sides of the pipe so that the seam allowances are outside.  We trim them with edge scissors, leaving an allowance of 0.5 cm. We decorate the finished product with embroidery or applique. </p><p>  We examined how to make a small cosmetic bag that you can carry with you in a <span>handbag.</span>  In addition to her, we need a home convenient container in which all decorative cosmetics will fit.  For such purposes, a shoe box with a hinged lid is perfect.  It turns out a beautiful and roomy cosmetic bag, which is very easy to do with your own hands. </p><p>  In addition to the box, you will need any beautiful fabric, <span>decorative braid,</span> PVA glue and bright adhesive paper for interior decoration.  First, we make a paper pattern.  To do this, lay out a piece of paper on the table.  We put the box on it bottom down and circle it.  Gently rotate the box to the side and circle again.  We do this with each side and box cover.  We receive the expanded detail. </p><p>  To each section we add one centimeter to the seams and two centimeters for folding inside the box.  Cut out a pattern from paper.  We transfer it to the fabric and cut it out.  Sew side seams.  Insert the box into the stitched case.  We cut out rectangular parts from sticky paper and glue them on the inner sides of the future cosmetic box.  After that, we bend the cover fabric inside and glue it with PVA glue.  We close all sections with decorative tape, which we fix with glue.  The box cover is decorated with rhinestones, beads or sequins. </p><p>  Using beautiful shreds and various decorative details, you can make various cosmetic bags with your own hands, which will be a wonderful gift for friends and family members. </p>
