The reviews speak of low monolithic-brick buildings of varying number of storeys - from four to six floors, where you can judge by the finished buildings the exterior decoration, which is very impressive.  Reviews mention the modern style of the complex "Imperial Mytishchi" repeatedly: the lining is high-quality, the latest technologies that preserve thermal insulation, promising durability. </p>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  In this <span>residential complex, the</span> project provides not only residential apartments, but also premises for social and domestic needs, as well as commercial areas.  Apartments are offered from the developer, which will be described in detail below.  There are three, two, one-room, and the layout options are varied, as the reviews say.  "Imperial Mytishchi" - a <span>residential complex</span> of nineteen buildings, several buildings are already ready for occupancy.  Each apartment requires a spacious balcony or loggia, there are even more enviable options - with large open terraces in duplex apartments on the upper floors. </p><p>  The housing area is offered from twenty-eight to eighty-five square meters.  Ceiling height - 2.7 meters.  Finishing the apartments by the developer is not provided, but it can be ordered additionally for a fee, the developer - the Granel group of companies - is in this desire to meet the client.  I must say that it will cost much cheaper, and better, which is also noted by the reviews.  "Imperial Mytishchi" - a <span>residential complex</span> in which apartments are quickly sold out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Without finish </h2><p>  If the client does not want additional finishing from the builder, he still will not receive a ‚Äúbare‚Äù floor, ceiling and walls.  Interior partitions (one block high) will be erected, all double-glazed windows will be installed, all communications will be carried out, heating radiators, metering devices, all entrance doors will be installed.  Hot and cold water was installed in the kitchens, bathrooms and toilets, a bathtub and sinks were installed, electricity was connected and laid out in all rooms.  There will be Internet connection, telephone connection, cable TV.  LCD "Imperial Mytishchi" reviews are rated very highly. </p><p>  Entrance groups are rented with an already functioning modern security system, intercoms are installed on metal doors, the lobby in each building is required with a concierge or security room.  Right in the porches there is enough space for baby strollers and bicycles, and spacious halls flaunt in designer finishes.  There will be no elevators in the buildings, because the number of storeys is small.  And this is a rather big drawback of the Imperial Mytishchi residential complex.  Reviews also note not very good transport accessibility. </p>

    <h2>  How to get </h2><p>  You can use a mortgage to purchase an apartment in the Imperial Mytishchi residential complex.  The 2017 reviews indicate that the Granel group of companies has several partner banks for this purpose.  In addition, the developer offers such an opportunity for his clients as an individual installment payment.  All real estate transactions that the Imperial Mytishchi LCD offers, customer reviews are associated with the conclusion of an equity agreement (in accordance with 214-FZ). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Zenit Bank offers two mortgage programs, one program - Sovcombank, RaffeisenBank, VTB, Bank of Moscow, VTB24, and four other partner banks.  From the group of companies "Granel" installments are interest-free for a period of up to one year.  There is also a military mortgage, which is supported by many banks collaborating with Granel in the sale of apartments in the Imperial Mytishchi residential complex.  Customer reviews (2017) are already published with photos showing their new housing and the method of purchase.  Many people use a mortgage. </p>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  At the moment, the new settlers are receiving the keys to the apartments in 19 and 20 buildings, which are delivered, on time, as Granel usually does.  The feedback from the Imperial Mytishchi interest holders noted that the delivery of buildings 14 and 16 was postponed from the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth.  Three more buildings will be ready in the third quarter of 2018, and one - the thirteenth - in the third quarter of 2019.  The remaining buildings are still under construction. </p><p>  The already completed buildings have ninety studio apartments from 22 to 26 square meters in area and cost from two million rubles, 64 one-room apartments, 54 two-room and 6 three-room.  Almost all of them have long been sold.  The developer enjoys well-deserved respect, since his activities are marked as reliable.  And the residential complex from GK "Granel" - "Imperial Mytishchi" also received mostly pretty good reviews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The group of companies was founded in 1992, now it specializes mainly in the construction of commercial and residential real estate in several regions of the country.  The project portfolio includes more than four and a half million square meters, including multi- and low-rise residential complexes, where special attention is paid to the infrastructure necessary for comfort. </p><p>  Since the companies are a group, absolutely all stages of the process are controlled from the development of the concept, the construction of the project, the actual construction, to the implementation and even management of finished facilities.  The team of professionals of the Civil Code has been together for many years, therefore, its work is well-coordinated, and the product of the activity is obtained at more affordable prices and better quality.  "Imperial Mytishchi" is no exception.  Architectural solutions are original and even, as they say in the reviews, unique, high-quality building materials.  In the real estate market, Granel Group of Companies has a reputation as a reliable developer.  And this applies not only to Moscow and the region.  Wherever this developer appears, rich positive information comes much earlier. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Granel Group of Companies always makes social infrastructure facilities in the construction of residential complexes.  These are clinics, schools and kindergartens, sports facilities, libraries and much, much more.  LCD "Imperial Mytishchi" will also be equipped as it should.  A small private clinic with a capacity of up to two hundred visits daily is planned, the school will have eight hundred places, a sports center, two kindergartens (one municipal, the other private) for three hundred and ninety places in total.  There will be a library, a police station, and a baby food establishment. </p><p>  No cars will be buzzing and buzzing on the territory of the complex: there are plans to build a whole complex with multi-level parking lots, with garages, and ground parking for guests.  Usually GK "Granel" envies the envy of competitors for its design of adjoining territories.  And here everything will be landscaped in the complex: the landscape will be decorated with parks and squares with fountains, all internal roads and access roads will be correctly paved.  The project includes sports and playgrounds, bike paths, places for a relaxing and active holiday for children and adults. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD "Imperial Mytishchi", as already mentioned, is being built seven kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  By car, it is best to get along the Ostashkovskoye Shosse, since Yaroslavskoye is usually heavily congested, there are many kilometers of traffic jams, and Ostashkovskoye is almost always free.  Public transport runs pretty well to the Imperial Mytishchi residential complex - both minibuses and buses from the Medvedkovo metro station. </p><p>  Separately, it must be said about the ecological situation in the region.  She is very favorable.  There are no industrial enterprises in the okrug and there was not, this is a field, former farmland, and even before they were even artificially irrigated.  It is also good that Pirogovsky Forest Park and the reservoir of the same name are close.  But, despite the proximity, water will have to be bypassed: the coast is built up by private estates, there are almost no approaches.  It‚Äôs easier to get into the forest, there will be alleys directly from the residential complex.  And the fact that heavy transport is prohibited in the city has a very good effect on the environment. </p>

    <h2>  Pogorelki and Mytishchi </h2><p>  The village of Pogorelki is located right next to it, and the first settlers of the Imperial Mytishchi housing complex will have to use this infrastructure.  It is usual for a small settlement: several shops, pharmacies and a post office.  But two kilometers away is Mytishchi. </p><p>  It‚Äôs practically Moscow, and the infrastructure there is appropriate - with shopping and entertainment centers, an excellent water park, clinics and kindergartens for every taste and budget.  A lot of schools, including famous ones.  Excellent drama and other theaters, museums, cultural centers and palaces for young people. </p><h2>  A look into the future </h2><p>  It is much easier to get a job in Mytishchi than in Moscow, and it‚Äôs easy to get there.  Grace is here for students and scholars.  Located near the LCD research institutes, branches of various universities, technical schools and colleges.  While your own infrastructure is being built, you can get to Mytishchi by your own car or by public transport. </p><p>  But in the future it will be wonderful.  Another residential complex is under construction - Mytishchi Light, where a large-scale shopping center <span>and a fitness</span> center will be erected <span>.</span>  Nearby, in Boltino, a yacht club operates.  Everything suggests that even at first, you can have a great time free from work, weekends and even holidays. </p>

    <h2>  About deficiencies (from reviews) </h2><p>  A well-wisher from among the buyers of the Imperial Mytishchi apartment advises not to sign the acceptance certificate right away.  If deficiencies were found, usually information about them is entered in a special journal, which is not a document.  The buyer recommends composing a letter with a list of claims, taking a copy of the (printed) act and going to Tverskaya in the head office, where they will hand over these documents to the secretary, who will register them with a date and signature number. </p><p>  In this case, the deficiencies are eliminated literally within one to two days.  If this is not done, then you can wait for a very long time.  You cannot send documents by letter either.  Even with a notification.  Because it will follow from Mytishchi for at least nine days.  The buyer assures that this is verified.  Perhaps such information is useful to someone.  Although many buyers talk about the good quality of construction and praise the work associated with additional finishing. </p>

    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Despite the sonorous name, the LCD "Imperial Mytishchi" refers to the economy class.  Nevertheless, the layout of the apartments is extremely diverse.  One and the same type of apartment has up to ten options; there are truly exclusive ones.  You can choose from cozy studios from nineteen to twenty-three square meters as starting housing for very young people, and extensive three-room apartments for families with children.  There are two-room apartments up to sixty meters - quite spacious, and one-room rooms - up to forty. </p><p>  I would also like to talk about the most striking features of this residential complex.  These are two-level apartments with a second light.  From the room you can exit to the terrace (they are also all different: there are eight meters, and there are up to thirty square meters).  Here, of course, the scope is simply maximum.  We can say - personal space and complete merger with nature, an oasis that has come off from the bustle, the place of the aristocrat.  The windows in these apartments are panoramic, and the landscape in them is picturesque. </p>
