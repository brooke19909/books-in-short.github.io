One such place is Varkala in India.  The village won the title of Ayurvedic and <span>seaside resort.</span>  Of course, he is not as famous as Goa, but in his own way is good.  It will be discussed about him in our article. </p><h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  Varkala Village (Kerala, India) is a popular tourist resort located 36 kilometers from the state capital, Trivandrum.  The village is located 1.5 kilometers from the coast.  There is a pharmacy, shops and vegetable stalls.  But the beach part, located near Varkala, consists of two parts - northern and southern.  Each of them has its own infrastructure.  On their territory, hotels of various levels have been built, restaurants and travel agencies that sell tickets for trains and planes work.

    <p>  Following from the village to the south coast, you can see the temple complex along the road.  Nearby residents sell coconuts to guests.  The south coast is essentially a fishing village, on the coast of which hotels and lounges are built.  Very close to them are ordinary residential buildings.  A gently sloping beach descends to the ocean, along which not only tourists walk, but also cows.  The local coast is not always safe, as there are strong currents.  In the village, patriarchy is felt.  In the early days, this is a little confusing, but in the future you just get used to it.  Local fishermen go to sea twice a day, it is always interesting to watch from the side for their work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  North coast </h2><p>  The northern coast of Varkala (India) is a real resort, which can even be called chic.  There are many restaurants, hotels, shops, salons and Ayurvedic clinics in this area.  The resort is located on a cliff.  In order to get to the ocean, you need to go down a very steep path that goes into a steep staircase.  Local beaches are quite deserted even in the daytime. </p><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  You can get to Varkala (India) from the state capital by bus in just two hours.  Ticket price is 25 rupees.  Tourists carry six rupees from the north shore to the rickshaw village, but the fare from the station will cost forty rupees. </p><h2>  Resort Weather </h2><p>  In Varkala (Kerala, <span>India) the climate is</span> tropical and mild, it is influenced by seasonal monsoons.  In July and June, monsoons come from the south-west, as a result of which rainy weather begins, which lasts until October.  But at the same time, it is still warm in the afternoon.  The temperature does not fall below +21 degrees.  But from November to May, the high season lasts.  The hottest period is from March to April.  At this time, the daily temperature reaches +36 degrees.  At night, the temperature drops to +24 ... + 30 degrees.  In the remaining months, the air temperature ranges from +28 ... + 30 degrees.  At night, indicators can drop to +18 ... + 25 degrees.  However, it is worth noting that rains in this region are possible at any time of the year. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the Indian summer is an incredible heat (more than 35 degrees), burdened with high humidity.  Sleeping without an air conditioner or fan at such a time is simply impossible.  High temperatures lead to evaporation of moisture from the Arabian Sea, and as a result - to high humidity.  Sometimes travel agencies offer last-minute tours during the hot season, but it is unlikely that they can fully enjoy their vacation in such conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pilgrimage center </h2><p>  Varkala (Kerala, India) is a real center of Hindu pilgrimage.  In the village is the famous Vishnay temple of Janardham Swami, whose age exceeds two thousand years.  According to tradition, the temple was built without sand and cement.  For construction, a special solution was used.  Hindus believe that as soon as the main Deity raises a hand, the end of the world will come. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Varkala (India) cannot boast an abundance of historical sights.  But here there are interesting places worthy of the attention of guests.  We already mentioned one of them, it is the temple of Janardham Swami.  The village is divided into two parts by a source from which local residents take water.  Walking along the coast in any direction, you can find cozy bays, beautiful calm beaches, where only fishermen are found.  Since the village was originally a fishing village, they still engage in fishing here to this day.  That is why in local restaurants most of the menu is presented with seafood dishes. </p>

    <p>  In Varkala in India (photos are given in the article), much is of interest to the European tourist.  Alien culture and customs, a completely different way of life - all this causes genuine interest among holidaymakers.  Tourists often travel to the state capital by bus.  The ancient Indian city, although it is the capital, looks like a provincial town. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Tourists come to Varkala (Kerala, <span>India),</span> whose <span>photos</span> cannot fully convey its beauty, not only for a beach holiday, but also for health improvement.

    <p>  Even on beaches, Hindu teachers offer their services in teaching the art of yoga and meditation.  Guests of the resort should definitely visit Ayurvedic treatments and wellness massages.  In addition, local specialists arrange entire courses, teaching techniques. </p><p>  The resort has its own Kathakali theater, in which almost every evening there are performances in the form of dances with elements of yoga and Ayurveda.  But in the evenings, Vishnu temple holds ceremonies that are interesting for European tourists to watch. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Resting at the resort, tourists, of course, do not miss the opportunity to do shopping.

    <p>  But on the market you can buy fresh vegetables, fruits and seafood.  Since there are many fishermen in the village, cafes on the coast prepare a variety of dishes from seafood.

If you wish, you can find establishments with a high level of service and more economical guesthouses.  Sometimes tourists even rent rooms in houses or a bamboo hut.  It all depends on your budget and the conditions that you want to receive. </p>

    <p>  One of the most popular establishments is a three-star hotel "Deshadan", built on a rock.  The hotel offers stunning views of Varkaly beach.  Guests at the establishment can use the services of a traditional Indian spa, which has a hot tub and pool.  The rooms are decorated in a modern style, but with elements of Indian decor.  The rooms are equipped with air conditioning, fans and TVs.  You can rent a car at the hotel.  The restaurant offers visitors to taste the best international dishes.  The rooms in this hotel cost from 2400 rubles per night. </p><h2>  Sata Beach Residence </h2><p>  Sata Beach Residence Hotel is located 50 meters from the beach.  It has a swimming pool and free internet.  The rooms are equipped with balconies, a fan, a living room and furniture.  The bathroom comes with toiletries.  The hotel is surrounded by a garden where you can always take a walk.  At the hotel reception you can book a tour, rent a bike or exchange money.  Restaurants and cafes are approximately 200 meters away.  A hotel room costs from 2 thousand rubles a day. </p><h2>  Tourist trips </h2><p>  Indian markets are painted in <span>local colors.</span>  If you‚Äôre not even going to get anything, then you just have to go through one of them in order to feel the oriental flavor. </p><p>  Each hotel offers trips to the lakes, lagoons and backwaters of the resort.  This will allow you to feel the difference between the sea and mountain ponds.  You can also go to the islands, on one of which is the city of Cochin.  In the old days, it belonged to the Phoenicians, and then to Jews, Chinese, Portuguese and Dutch.  On small islands is the village of Kumarakom, which still has a unique bird sanctuary.  On it you can ride a boat and see flocks of birds.  A special mood when traveling through swamps is created by the amazing beauty of lilies. </p>

    <p>  The resort also organizes trips to Javhar, which is a national park.  You can still visit the temple of Krishna, located in the village of Guruvayur.  For locals, the place where the three seas merge is sacred.  It is located at Cape Kanyakumari.  Many tourists come here.  An old legend says that by bathing here at dawn or at sunset, you can wash away all sins, thus cleansing karma. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, Varkala (India) is a nice and cozy place.  The village is quite quiet and calm.  Varkalu, perhaps, cannot be called a fashionable resort, but for a beach holiday it is worth coming here.  It is worth noting that the resort area is located on a high cliff, like all hotels, regardless of the number of stars on the sign.  In order to get to the coast, it is necessary to overcome a large number of steps.  And everything would be fine if it were not for the terrible state of these very steps.  Some of them are completely destroyed, while others are overgrown with grass.  In general, according to the guests, the descent is extremely inconvenient.  It is necessary to step very carefully so as not to fly down from a decent height.  For the resort, such steps are simply nonsense.  In total, there are three descents to the beach.  All of them are in approximately equally poor condition.  Therefore, the resort should not be recommended to older people or those who find it difficult several times a day to go down and climb steep stairs. </p><p>  But the beaches of Varkala themselves are a real miracle.  During the high season they are very wide.  The coast stretched far beyond the village.  Walking along the coast, you can reach the most secluded places where no one will bother you.  The sandy beaches of Varkala are something amazing.  However, going to the resort, it is worth knowing that the local coast is quite stormy.  There is a wave all the time.  If you are lucky, then the excitement will not be strong, but often the waves are so powerful that they knock down even in those places where the water reaches the knee.  Of course, everything is explainable, because this is the ocean.  It is not for nothing that surfers ride on the coast, and local residents offer training services for the basics of this sport.  In general, if you like to calmly swim or splash in the water, then you definitely are not here.  Even in periods of relative calm, it‚Äôs not worth going far into the sea, since there are very strong currents.  Sometimes rescuers sitting on the shore, because of the waves forbid to enter the water. </p><p>  Weather in Varkala (India) almost always pleases holidaymakers, with the exception of the monsoon period.  But at this time no one comes here.  And it‚Äôs not even the precipitation, but the storms that rage during such periods. </p><p>  The village has a pretty good selection of hotels.  Among them there are expensive establishments and more budget ones.  In addition, locals offer accommodation in guesthouses or in the rooms of their own homes.  Which option to choose is a personal affair of every spa man.  In whatever institution you are located, they are all on top of the cliff.  In any case, you have to go down the slope to the beach.  There is simply no other descent at the resort. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, going to Varkala, you really need to rely on your strength. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Varkala is a very nice place to relax with beautiful beaches.  It is for their sake that it is worth coming here.  In the village there are a lot of food establishments that mainly cook seafood.  As for the outstanding attractions, they are practically nonexistent here.  But you can go on an excursion to the state capital.  According to tourists, you can have a good rest in Varkala, but not very long, because after a week it becomes a little boring, especially if you are active. </p>
