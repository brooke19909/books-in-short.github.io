    <h2>  Skirt "sun": fabric calculation </h2><p>  Fashion does not stand still - this is one of the simple and well-known truths, just like the assertion that there is nothing new under the sun.  Today, models that won the hearts of fashionistas in the 60s are once again popular - the skirt ‚Äúsun‚Äù for the girl will become a real find.  The pattern of this garment is very simple to build, and even a beginner can cope with sewing.  Therefore, do not postpone sewing until later, but you should immediately go for the fabric.  For this type of skirt, both dense and protruding canvases, and soft flowing ones are suitable.  The length of the product should be either to the middle of the knee, or above it by 15 cm. </p><p>  <span>The skirt</span> pattern for girls of this model is a circle with a hole in the center, the diameter of which is equal to the waist circumference.  However, this does not mean that the thing can be seamless.  In any case, you will need to make a cut and insert a zipper, because the hips are always wider than the waist and if you lower this moment, then the skirt will simply be impossible to put on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cutting is done directly on the canvas.  The calculation of the fabric is based on the volume of the waist and the length of the product.  With a material width of 1.5 m, 2 skirt lengths and another 20-30 cm are required. If the fabric is already processed, then cutting is not transverse, but along the edge and 4 lengths plus 40 cm will already be required. In any case, an important role in the calculation of the fabric plays the growth of the girl and her volumes. </p><h2>  Skirt "sun": cutting fabric </h2><p>  So, the <span>pattern of a skirt</span> for girls is built like this: </p><ul><li>  depending on the width of the web on the edge or from the edge, put a measure of the length of the product +5 cm on the processing of seams; </li><li>  from the received point, note the value, which is calculated by dividing the measurement of the waist volume by 4; </li><li>  then again lay the length of the skirt +5 cm; </li><li>  the middle segment in the drawing is divided in half and from the obtained point are lowered by half its value; </li><li>  Next, draw a rounded waist line, which should be in the shape of an even semicircle; </li><li>  At the end of the drawing, the length of the product should be postponed from the waist line in several places and closed in a semicircular border of the bottom of the skirt. </li></ul><p>  The second part of the skirt is built in the same way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="half sun skirt pattern for girls" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1117236.jpg" width="409"></div>

    <h2>  Half-sun skirt: fabric selection and cutting </h2><p>  The skirt pattern for girls in the ‚Äúsun‚Äù model is two parts in the form of a quarter circle.  The construction of the drawing can also be done directly on the canvas.  Absolutely any materials are suitable for the product, including delicate knitwear and thick drape.  If you use delicate translucent chiffon or silk, an excellent semi-sun summer skirt will come out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern for the girl is no different from the product template for adult women.  The product is hidden on the corner of the canvas.  First, a bisector is carried out, after which a point is found from which the distance to the edge of the fabric (edge ‚Äã‚Äãor cut) will be ¬º measurement of the waist volume.  Next, draw a waist line so that it forms a quarter circle in the corner.  The length of the product +5 cm for processing is laid off from the resulting line along the blade and edge.  From the waistline in several places mark the edge of the hem plus increase and close the bottom line of the part.  The pattern at this stage is ready, the second half is constructed in the same way. </p><h2>  Material calculation for the semi-sun model </h2><p>  This product is not so expensive in terms of fabric consumption.  Due to the fact that the parts are built in the corner of the cut, when calculating the fabric, it is necessary to take into account the offset from the edge, equal to about half, 5 cm for allowances for processing, and also that two parts need two corners.  This means that the product will require two calculated lengths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern skirts year for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1115713.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Straight skirt pattern </h2><p>  The basic straight skirt template is the initial drawing for modeling.  On its basis, models are built in a fold on the yoke, ‚Äúyear‚Äù, ‚Äúpencil‚Äù, ‚Äútulip‚Äù and so on.  Its construction requires the following measurements: the volume of the waist and hips, the height between them, the length of the product.  The process consists of the following steps: </p><ul><li>  first draw a rectangle with sides equal to the circumference of the hips and the length of the product; </li><li>  along the waist line, the side is divided in half and 2 cm are added to the future front panel for a perfect fit of the side seams; </li><li>  in accordance with the height from the waist to the hips, an auxiliary line is drawn in the drawing; </li><li>  then the difference between the volumes is calculated, which allows you to determine the number of centimeters that you want to close in the tucks on the sides and on the back halves, as well as in the middle seam; </li><li>  tucks should not be deeper than 2.5 cm; </li><li>  for a perfect fit, lower the waist line 1.5 cm from the side seam to the middle of the front. </li></ul>

    <p>  At this stage, the basic template for modeling is ready.  It can be used as a <span>denim skirt</span> pattern for a girl. </p><h2>  Building a skirt "Year" </h2><p>  If you work out the drawing a little, a workpiece for the ‚Äúyear‚Äù model will come out.  So, the pattern of the ‚Äúyear‚Äù skirt for the girl is built on the basis of a straight skirt, the drawing of which should be created on paper or construction film.  The following actions should be performed: </p><ul><li>  divide the difference in the volume of the hips and waist by 6 and evenly distribute along the waistline; </li><li>  divide the front and rear panels into three equal parts so that the cuts go out from the extreme points of the tucks; </li><li>  identify and outline the tick line; </li><li>  cut the parts into elements and lay them out on a new sheet of paper; </li><li>  from the tick line on each side of each element, outline points and draw auxiliary lines at equal angles; </li><li>  the size of the line depends on the height at which the tick line is; </li><li>  after all additional model lines have been outlined, the hem line should be closed. </li></ul>

    <p>  When sewing a ‚Äúone-year‚Äù skirt, it should be noted that the cut out details should hang on a hanger with clothespins, fixed along the waist line, at least for a day.  This will allow the fabric to take its shrinkage and even out.  After this time, parts can be assembled into the product.  It is possible that after hanging the sections will stretch and you will have to adjust the hem of the product. </p>
