  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to change the number on MTS - a detailed guide</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the process of using a mobile phone, a subscriber may experience situations in which it becomes necessary to change the number.  For example, this can help him get rid of persistent calls or promotional SMS messages when standard tools like blacklisting do not help.  The MTS operator offers its subscribers to carry out such a replacement, making this service fast and convenient. </p><h2>  Ways to replace the MTS phone number </h2><p>  Previously, in order to get a new MTS number, there was one solution - buying a new SIM card.  This option is still in demand today.  In addition, it is easy to implement: you can purchase a new SIM card in any communication stores and other retail outlets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="integracon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone in hand" class="if uuid-2679430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97218/2679430.jpg"></div><p>  However, this is not very rational - after all, a new SIM card means the loss of various settings, bonuses and data stored on it about the recipients of the phone book.  Therefore, it will be useful for subscribers to learn how to change the number on the MTS, leaving the old SIM card.  The following options are available to subscribers today: </p><ul><li>  visiting the MTS salon; </li><li>  call to a call center. </li></ul><p>  In both cases, employees will provide the subscriber with all the necessary information, as well as talk about the price of the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many subscribers are interested in the question of how to change the MTS phone number using a website on the Internet (for example, through an account on a mobile operator‚Äôs website).  Despite the convenience and speed of this method, it is not yet possible.  The probability that fraudsters will be able to use this method is high enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.carpediem.cd" data-author=": " data-source="http://moscow.carpediem.cd/events/2828353-idealnyy-administrator-i-operator-koll-centra-at-uchebno-ozdorovitelnyy-centr-predtecha-klinika-professora-ogulova/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cat and phone" class="if uuid-2679394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97218/2679394.jpg"></div><h2>  Salon visit </h2><p>  To change the number while visiting the MTS salon, the person to whom the SIM card is registered needs to contact any office of this operator.  At the same time, the settlement may be any, and it is convenient on a business trip or travel.  An office employee will tell you how to change the number on MTS, and will accept the application from the subscriber.  Then he will offer him a list of available numbers, from which only it will be possible to choose the most liked combination. </p><p>  To visit the MTS office, you should bring your passport with you.  After all, the operator needs to make sure that the SIM card belongs to the subscriber who submitted the application.  In addition, it is advisable to have a contract for the purchase of a SIM card with you: so identification will happen faster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="42.tut.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS operator" class="if uuid-2679427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97218/2679427.jpg"></div><p>  24 hours after filling out a replacement application, the phone must be rebooted so that the SIM card starts working on the new number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, it is very easy for a subscriber of another operator to go with a number to MTS, because for this it is enough to visit the salon with a passport.  A few minutes later he will issue a new SIM card.  The number that the subscriber previously used will be attached to it. </p><h2>  Call to a call center </h2><p>  If, for some reason, visiting the office is inconvenient, it is possible to change the existing number by calling the service center.  During a conversation with the operator, you will need to tell him the details of the passport and contract.  To connect to the MTS call-center in any region, the subscriber just needs to dial 0890 on his mobile number. To make calls to other operators or from a regular telephone, you need to dial this combination of numbers in the international format: 8 (800) 2500 890. </p><p>  When you press "0" on the keyboard, a connection will be made.  At the beginning of the conversation, the operator will find out the identity of the subscriber by checking his data documents with those entered in the database.  Then, as when visiting the salon, he will explain how to change the number to MTS.  After that, the subscriber will be offered a choice of several digital combinations for replacement.  It is only necessary to dwell on one of them.  This replacement method will save time and for many is more acceptable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.criadvantage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The operator answers" class="if uuid-2679374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97218/2679374.jpg"></div><p>  A day after treatment, it is also necessary to turn the device off and on again.  From now on, all calls and messages will be made from the new number. </p><h2>  Room Replacement Cost </h2><p>  The replacement service will cost the MTS subscriber quite inexpensively, only 75 rubles.  The cost of choosing from the proposed combinations of numbers is somewhat more expensive.  It depends on the region of residence, and on their belonging to the list of ‚Äúbeautiful numbers‚Äù on the MTS, for example, ‚Äúgold‚Äù or ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù.  For Muscovites, the service of choosing the numbers you like will cost from 750 rubles.  For residents of other regions, this amount is much less. </p><p>  Rates may vary, so the question of how much a replacement costs is best to ask the operator during a call or visiting a salon.  So you can get the most reliable information and find answers to any question of interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="roho.4senses.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Telephone area" class="if uuid-2679383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97218/2679383.jpg"></div><h2>  How to find out your number on MTS? </h2><p>  There are situations when a subscriber forgets his phone number.  He can easily remember him using one of the following options: </p><ul><li>  dialing * 111 * 0887 # and "Call" on your phone; </li><li>  typing * 111 # on the keyboard, and then the call button (the electronic ‚Äúassistant‚Äù will be connected, and using his prompts you can find out the number); </li><li>  in the application "My MTS". </li></ul><p>  It is convenient that the subscriber does not need to worry about the region of his location, since it is possible to find out your number on the MTS using these methods both in all regions and when traveling abroad. </p><p>  If you are on the territory of Moscow and the Moscow region, you can find out the number by making a call to 0887. </p><h2>  How to change the MTS number to the previous one </h2><p>  There may be situations when the subscriber needs to change the number to the one that was before the replacement.  For example, this may be necessary when bank cards or discount cards of stores were attached to it.  In this case, you should contact any MTS salon as soon as possible.  However, it is highly likely that the previous number has already managed to appear a new owner.  In this case, it will be impossible to return it.  Therefore, it is better to provide for such nuances before making a decision. </p>
