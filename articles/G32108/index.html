Radisson (Moscow), like any other employer, is always interested in qualified personnel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Best Five Star Hotel </h2><p>  In the capital of our large state there is a sufficient number of hotels for every taste and affluence, including five-star ones.  However, if guests of the capital are looking for the best hotel in the city, then this will certainly be the Radisson Hotel.  Moscow with great pleasure invites all visitors to the fashionable Radisson Royal Hotel, which is located in the building of the former Ukraina Hotel.  This famous skyscraper, which was built back in the 50s of the 20th century, today offers luxurious rooms and apartments, six restaurants and three bars in which anyone can find their favorite dish.  Guests can have a great time in the huge Wellness Club, where there is a 50-meter-long swimming pool, a gym with professional equipment and spacious rooms, various spa and beauty salons, massage rooms, a real Russian bath, a hammam and a sauna.

There is also a bar decorated in the best Irish traditions.  Guests interested in sports can visit the local fitness center, which includes a gym and Finnish sauna. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of this hotel, here the Radisson network worked just fine.  The hotel is perfect for both leisure and business travel.  The guests, however, note that the mode of operation of the sauna is not very convenient: it must be ordered in advance, since it is not always on.  But the variety of breakfast dishes all delight. </p><h2>  What rooms are offered at the Radisson Blu Belorusskaya Hotel </h2>

    <p>  For those who travel a lot with transfers in Moscow, and for business people who have no time to travel around the city in search of a suitable hotel, there is a special hotel ‚ÄúRadisson‚Äù (Moscow), which is located directly on the territory of <span>Sheremetyevo International Airport.</span>  The hotel is connected to the terminals with a special pedestrian gallery, which is very convenient.  Indeed, almost immediately from an airplane, anyone can get into their room and relax without tormenting themselves with additional movements. </p><p>  Everyone will surely remember the time spent here, because there are two restaurants here, from which you can watch the planes, a gym with a hammam and a Finnish sauna, an express laundry, a variety of meeting rooms and a large conference room. </p><p>  All guests of the Radisson Blu Sheremetyevo Hotel are delighted with its location.  Of course, the rooms here are not cheap, but both the service and the decor in them are worth the money.  In addition, as vacationers have repeatedly noted, there is no need to even go outside from the airport to get to the hotel. </p><h2>  Accommodation with a view of the planes </h2>
