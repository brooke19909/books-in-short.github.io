For motorists, this is not a distance at all. </p><p>  The exact address: Staromaniysky district, p. Sadovka, where the "Boyarskaya Manor" is located.  Ulyanovsk is a very hospitable city that you will feel very well when you first cross the threshold of this hotel.  Every tourist is welcome here, no matter what time of day or night he settles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

There are all conditions for a relaxing holiday.  For tourists there is a three-story hotel with cozy and comfortable rooms.  On the first floor there are five two-room apartments, and on the second ten one-room apartments, which are designed for two people.  And if you want to enjoy the view from the window, then the third floor will be an ideal option.  Large two-room rooms are located here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center boyarsky estate ulyanovsk reviews" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1392764.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Separate houses </h2><p>  For those who love comfort and coziness, separate houses will be a very good option for the whole family to relax.  There are 14 of them at the recreation center. These are real chopped huts that organically fit into the surrounding reality.  The houses belong to the VIP class accommodation option.  They are located in a stunning birch grove and stylized as a Russian village.  Here you can relax your body and soul. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Given the high class service at the base, the price does not seem unreasonable.  “Boyarskaya Manor” (Ulyanovsk), the photo of which you see in the article, is a wonderful vacation for a reasonable price.  If you want to stay in a comfortable hotel, you will have to pay 2000 rubles per room per night.  In houses, the price per person is 500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boyar estate ulyanovsk reviews" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1391780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  You have to cook here yourself.  But this will not be a heavy burden.  What is only worth the opportunity to fry freshly caught fish or boil aromatic and tasty fish soup from it?  Any novice culinary specialist here can prove to be a master of the highest class.  Camping in a fun company or in a close family circle is what you need for real relaxation after hard working days in a busy city.  But if you are too tired to mess with cooking, you can use the services of a cafe.  The food here is very tasty and inexpensive. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  This is precisely what tourists are attracted to by the Boyarskaya Manor (Ulyanovsk).  Reviews emphasize that the large territory of the recreation center allows everyone to find entertainment to their liking.  If you have plans for a family vacation, then you need to first find an activity for your children.  A huge platform and a stunning wooden town for a long time will take the attention of fidgets.  And when the active games get bored, take the kids to a small zoo, go on a picnic to the forest together or just rent bicycles. </p><p>  The rental center of sports equipment offers its widest choice: roller skates, bicycles, skateboards (in the summer).  However, in winter, the recreation center also works.  In cold weather, you will be offered to visit an excellent Russian bath, and thrill-seekers can dive right into the cold water after the steam room.  In winter, take sledges and ice, skis and skates.  Life here does not freeze at any time of the year.  There are options for home entertainment.  Rent chess, checkers or backgammon, but you want to spend time in leisurely conversations, welcome to the cafe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center boyarsky estate ulyanovsk reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1391779.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  So, we leave everything to work, we are waiting for the recreation center "Boyarskaya Manor" (Ulyanovsk).  Reviews emphasize that getting here is not difficult, since it is located very close to the city.  You leave on Ulyanovskiy Avenue and on a good highway you arrive at the place.  The distance is only 40 km.  Judging by the reviews, everyone with great pleasure recalls the holidays spent at the hotel.  A company of up to 40 people can easily accommodate in a cozy house.  It’s not necessary to sit at the table all the time.  You can play soccer and volleyball, fry kebabs and sing songs in karaoke.  The territory has to go for a walk, so even the most avid couch potatoes will definitely choose an activity for themselves. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Graduation or birthday, the end of the school year or corporate party - any of these events will be a great success if you decide to celebrate it in the Boyarskaya Manor.  There is no need to worry about the entertainment of the guests, each of them will find something for themselves and bring a selection of unique frames of photos.  Mostly reviews only note the positive aspects of relaxation here.  Of the shortcomings can be noted the location, without a car you can not get here.  Not everyone likes the lack of a comprehensive diet.  On the basis of the cafe you can have a snack, but it is rather an entertaining element.  Also, rest here is not at all suitable for those who do not like solitude with nature, but prefer noise, bustle and crowded beaches. </p>
