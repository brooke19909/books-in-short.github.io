Modern India: features, map</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The peninsula on which India is located is washed on three sides by the waters of the Indian Ocean, and in the North it is surrounded by literally soaring Himalayas.  This corner of the planet is rich in its natural resources and traditions of local residents.  India is the only country that covers the entire territory of the peninsula, a real find for any tourist.  Here you can discover beach vacations, both active and extreme, as well as learn a lot of new things.  Therefore, we will not hesitate and go on a virtual tour, during which we visit the very peninsula on which India is located. </p><h2>  Peninsula Characteristics </h2><p>  Hindustan belongs to the geographical south of Asia.  Its area is 2 million square kilometers.  In the southwest, the peninsula is washed by the waters of the Arabian Sea, and in the southeast - by the Bay of Bengal.  The southern part of Hindustan touches the open waters of the Indian Ocean.  Also in this area is a giant island - Sri Lanka.  On the territory of this peninsula there are two rivers - Indus and Ganges, which were the centers of ancient civilization.  Along them were the homes of the ancestors of modern Indians, these rivers became a source of irrigation, as well as an important element in the development of local folklore and traditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the peninsula where India is located" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/640794.jpg" width="389"></div>

In the northern part of Hindustan, the climate is subtropical and tropical.  In summer, here the air warms up to +28, in winter the thermometer drops to +13.  Sub-equatorial weather conditions are set closer to the south.  It is very hot here in summer - more than +37.  From August to November, the rainy season begins, and the temperature drops slightly.  But in winter and spring it is very warm and dry - about +30 in the afternoon, +25 at night and not a cloud in the sky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of india" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/640793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As a rule, for most tourists, the characteristic of India is based on what the beaches were in the state where they had a rest, and how comfortable it was.  The most “battered” resort for our compatriots is Goa - Northern and Southern.  The first part of the state is full of vibrant nightlife.  There are a lot of rave discos, dance floors that work around the clock, restaurants and bars.  In the south of Goa it is always quiet, calm and expensive.  This is a great place for a honeymoon or for a vacation with children.  It is worth noting that in India there are also resorts that are not at all mastered by Russian tourists.  This is Mumbai - a very expensive city in the East of Hindustan.  Also, many wild and incredibly beautiful places are located in the western part of the peninsula.  People come here to dive and snorkel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristic of india" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/640795.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  India Travelers Every Traveler Must Know </h2><ul><li>  <em>Pay attention to the shoes.</em>  Firstly, in this country they don’t cross legs, because otherwise your interlocutor will see the sole of the boot.  And this is a sign of disrespect for him.  Secondly, in the <span>temples of India</span> go barefoot.  In extreme cases, you can wear socks or shoe covers. </li><li>  <em>Keep your hands to yourself.</em>  Namely, handshakes are not welcome in India.  It’s also not customary to pat each other on the shoulder, throw hands on the other person’s neck and perform other body movements that are familiar to us. </li><li>  <em>Visiting temples is a special ritual.</em>  A woman must have hidden shoulders, legs and head, a man also should not be frivolously dressed.  In addition, it is customary to bypass any structures, especially sacred ones, only on the left. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As it turned out, the peninsula on which India is located is a literally new world.  Here, their traditions, their customs, which have been formed over the centuries, are completely different people.  And most importantly, even a tourist must respect all these rules and follow them in order to fully experience not only the natural riches of this country, but also its whole life, emotions, traditions. </p>
