Bamberg is one of the most unique cities located on its territory.  And if anyone had a chance to visit the German state, then he must visit this settlement, the founders of which are saints.  There are many excellent attractions, as well as a symphony orchestra, which is considered one of the best on Earth.  Many cultural objects during the Second World War were significantly damaged, or even completely destroyed.  But after the end of hostilities, all the sights were restored according to old photographs and plans.  Therefore, modern travelers have something to admire and enjoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="germany bamberg" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1343358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Overview of Attractions </h2><p>  The city of Bamberg is an example thanks to which it is possible to trace the stages of development, as well as the structure of European cities that appeared during the Early Middle Ages.  In 1993, this fact allowed the village to acquire the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The list of attractions located on the territory of Bamberg includes the Old Town Hall. </p><p>  Wonderful Baroque monuments await the traveler at every step.  But there are many other cultural objects here, from Romanesque churches to the fishing quarter with colorful half-timbered buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bamberg germany attractions" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1343355.jpg" width="600"></div>

This attraction is also called the New Town Hall.  At the beginning of the XIV century, one very famous family lived in this town - Geyer.  It was in honor of this kind that the castle was named.  In 1580, the object was seized by the local diocese led by Bishop Vitus II.  In the same period, a park was laid south of Geyersvert. </p><p>  Germany, Bamberg in particular, has few attractions that have managed to maintain their original appearance.  This happened with the castle, the medieval face of which has not been preserved until our times.  In the 18th century, Geyersworth underwent reconstruction and became the residence of the local kings and bishops. </p><p>  Today Geyersvert Castle (Germany, Bamberg) is the property of the town, and the authorities of the village are located here.  The last restoration of the site took place in 1984, and since then the building has been used for official receptions.  Every year in June, a <span>wine festival is</span> held in the courtyard of the building <span>.</span>  In the castle tower there is an observation deck from which you can watch the historical center of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="euro-trip" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1343354.jpg" width="600"></div>

In Bamberg, this is the church of St.  Jacob.  It is located in the center of the town on Jacobsplatz square.  The building is a Romanesque three-nave basilica.  The construction of the landmark began in 1073, when Herman I was the bishop. Bishop Otto I of Bamberg finished the construction of the church in 1109.  In those days, the religious building was the stopping place for the pilgrims who walked along the Way of St. James to the holy places.  These places represented the tomb of the Apostle Jacob in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. </p><p>  In 1171, the Church of St. James (Germany, Bamberg) was decorated with a baroque facade.  The fresco used in the interior of the shrine also belongs to this period.  She depicts scenes from the life of Jacob and is located above the middle cross. </p><p>  Today this church is the only Romanesque church in Bamberg.  There are five bells in its tower, two of which were cast back in the 14th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bamberg city" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1343357.jpg" width="368"></div>

    <h2>  The famous fountain and no less popular museum </h2><p>  Bamberg <span>(Germany),</span> whose <span>sights are</span> quite unique and unusual, has one gorgeous object with a very "rude" folk name.  This is the old Gabelman fountain.  It is crowned with a majestic sculpture of a deity depicting the ruler of the seas and oceans of Neptune with a trident in his hands.  But the local population christened the monument ‚ÄúA Man with a Fork‚Äù.  The fountain was decorated with sculptures in 1566.  The initiator of such an idea was Ludwig Krug, a city councilor who wished to perpetuate the memory of his person in his hometown after moving to live in Nuremberg.  This fountain is also a popular meeting point in the city. </p><p>  There is a house in Bamberg in which the famous storyteller Ernst Hoffmann lived for four years.  He served as a bandmaster at the Bamberg Theater.  In the attic of the house in question, Hoffmann composed his fairy tale ‚ÄúThe Golden Pot‚Äù.  The most famous landmark room is the Mirror Cabinet.  The walls of the room are painted with obscure signs.  This is a special font that the author used in his diary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bamberg Cathedral" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1343353.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <h2>  Bamberg's most famous cathedral </h2><p>  Bamberg Cathedral is the best work of German architecture, the monumental church of St. Peter und Georg.  The building is located in the very center of the village.  The first stones of the cult building were laid in 1002 by Henry II.  Consecrated St. Peter-und-Georg in 1012.  In length, the structure reaches almost 94 meters, in height - 26, and in width - 28 meters.  Each of the four towers of the church is almost 81 meters high.  There are many art objects in the cathedral.  One of them is a beautiful marble tomb.  In it lies the founder of the temple and his wife. </p><p>  Another shrine treasure is the "Bamberg Horseman" - an equestrian statue that depicts Stephen I, the Ugrian ruler.  Sculpture dates back to 1225-1237 years.  In the days of Nazi Germany, sculpture was considered the ideal embodiment of a true Aryan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bamberg horseman" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1343356.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Church of Our Lady </h2><p>  The correct name for this temple is the Catholic Upper Parish Church, and it is located on Kaulberg Hill.  Bamberg (Germany, whose attractions are numerous, can be proud of this city) can tell a legend about the history of this church.  So, according to the stories, the parish was created in the era of the Early Middle Ages, but the first written mention of it dates back to 1140.  For many years, the church bell tower was used as a watch tower.  Today, the parish church is considered the main religious building of the Bamberg Catholic community. </p><h2>  Venice in Germany </h2><p>  In Bamberg, there is a district that used to be a fishing village.  Today it is called "Little Venice".  This name is due to the fact that there are many half-timbered houses with facades overlooking the river.  The area is located between the Marcus Bridge and the Lower Bridge.  Each building has a miniature pier.  Boats sway slightly on the water, and the surrounding loggias and balconies are simply buried in flowers.  Embankments and sidewalks are absent here.  The place has only a splash of water and beautiful cozy houses.  To the east of Little Venice is a jetty for pleasure boats. </p>
