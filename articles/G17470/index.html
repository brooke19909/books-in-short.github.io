    <p>  To choose a metal detector, you need to determine its features.  So, there are models of three categories - soil, deep and underwater.  For treasure hunters, it is precisely soil devices that have different functional features.  The characteristics of metal detectors are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Depth of detection.  Most often, this parameter depends on the size of the target: the larger the metal object in size, the greater the likelihood that the device will detect it.  Depth depends on the mineralization of the soil and the degree of its moisture: the higher it is, the smaller the distance at which the metal detector can detect objects. </li><li>  <span>Discrimination.</span>  <span>This</span> indicator suggests that devices distinguish between objects depending on the type of metal.  So, most often the difference between non-ferrous and <span>noble metals is found.</span>  This function plays an important role when working in heavily littered areas. </li><li>  Pinpoint  This indicator tells about the static mode of the metal detector, which makes it possible to accurately determine the object in the soil.  This feature is also in the Garret Ace 250 model. The metal detector of this brand belongs to the budget segment, but its characteristics are not much inferior to mid-range devices. </li><li>  Functional features of the model.  Before buying, remember that a professional metal detector requires a fairly long time for the development of beginners.  Therefore, for treasure hunting as a hobby, you can safely choose cheap analogues, given their weight and ease of use. </li></ol><h2>  Garrett ACE 250 - a metal detector with a long history </h2><p>  This model, according to user reviews, is one of the best in the Russian market.  Such popularity is due to a combination of the reliability of the device circuit, its high-quality assembly, the optimal ratio of price and search indicators.  The detector is widely used by search engines, being perhaps the most popular device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  One of the main parameters of this brand of metal detector is target localization.  To do this, the Pinpointing mode is configured: by clicking on this button on the panel, the user activates this mode, which is easy to work with.  When detecting a target, you need to place the coil parallel to the ground in the area where the signal appeared.  The Pinpointing button is pressed and held, while the coil should be moved from left to right with smooth movements.  As soon as a target is detected right under the coil, you will hear the maximum beep. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The metal detector created by the Garrett brand is equipped with a liquid crystal screen on which signal strength can be monitored.  If the sensitivity bar is fully highlighted, then your target is right below the center of the coil.  If the targets are too small, the signal will be emitted below the top of the coil‚Äôs inner loop.  In any case, when working with this metal detector you need to carefully listen to the signal. </p><h2>  Search Secrets </h2>

    <p>  Coils for Mars MD metal detectors are maximally adapted to the Garrett Ace 250 model. Due to their light weight and round shape, they allow you to quickly pass large areas and are useful for work on any terrain.  The Mars Tiger reel has unique dimensions and depth indicators, thanks to which it easily works at great depths, in heavily littered areas.  Thanks to the well-developed form, it makes the capture of the area maximum. </p><p>  A good solution is the NEL Hunter coil for the Garrett Ace 250, which increases the depth of the detector by 40-50%.  Thanks to the oval shape, the product easily finds even the smallest target, and a well-thought-out scheme expands the coverage of the probe rays, preventing possible omissions.  The shockproof housing is based on durable polymers, which protects the entire coil from negative influences. </p><p>  Bulgarian-made Detech search coils can handle any terrain.
