  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crafts from sweets: interesting ideas and master classes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A person with creative inclinations always finds where to apply his skills.  Absolutely everything attracts such people.  Therefore, it is not surprising that crafts from sweets appeared.  They are unusual and colorful due to their bright wrappers.  In addition, making them is not at all difficult, the main thing is to show your imagination. </p><h2>  Which products are suitable </h2><p>  To make simple crafts from candies, it is enough to purchase these sweets by weight and put them together in the composition.  For such purposes, anyone with bright candy wrappers will do.  Of course, if you plan to give your product to someone, then it is worth stopping at more expensive sweets.  But for your child you can take his favorite "Cow" or simple caramels with filling.  It all depends on the purpose for which a sweet masterpiece is created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from candy ship" class="if uuid-2398070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398070.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that it is better to choose those options that have a wrapper.  This is due to the fact that sweets should not directly contact with other materials and substances.  A wrapper is a protection from external factors anticipated by the seller. </p><h2>  Ordinary sweets in unusual presentation </h2><p>  Interesting crafts from sweets will turn out if we focus not on the sweet component, but use them as a decorative element.  For example, the photo above shows a ship.  Sweets in it serve as a building material for the sides and the core of flowers.  But not every person will immediately notice them, paying attention to the general appearance of the craft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So you can give about 300-400 g of sweets in a yellow wrapper, if you make an apple or pineapple from them.  To do this, you need to prepare a little.  You will need a base on which you will glue the sweet "decorative elements".  As it is possible to use a piece of foam, pre-cut to the desired shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from candies pineapple" class="if uuid-2398067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398067.jpg"></div><p>  For work, you will need another double-sided tape and some green paper.  The tails of candy wrappers need to be bent inward and glued with tape.  When all the candies are prepared in this way, you can begin to create the product itself. </p><p>  At the top you need to glue the green leaves.  Then, on top of them, you can already start laying out the candies, attaching them with double-sided tape.  You need to place them as tightly as possible to each other in order to completely hide the base behind them. </p><p>  There is an even more unusual version of such a candy craft.  As a basis, you can take a bottle of champagne.  It closely resembles the shape of a pineapple.  In addition, such a gift will be highly appreciated by adults for whom it is intended. </p><h2>  Sweet and colorful cakes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from sweets cake and a bouquet" class="if uuid-2398061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398061.jpg"></div><p>  This is perhaps one of the most unusual crafts from sweets.  Such cakes often fulfill the function of gift wrapping, in which the main present is located.  But the ‚Äúbox" itself delights its recipient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is made of cardboard.  First you need to cut and glue several cylinders of different diameters.  Then they are decorated with colored or wrapping paper and decorated with sweets.  If this is a gift box, make sure that it can be opened without destroying the entire structure. </p><p>  The sides of this cake are laid out with long and flat candies.  Portions of chocolate, which are packed in individual packages, can be an ideal option.  When the sides are closed, you can additionally decorate them with ribbons with a bow or pearl beads. </p><p>  Then it‚Äôs worth moving on to decorating the top.  It is decorated with flowers from sweets.  Make them easy if the house has colored crepe paper.  Cut rose petals.  Stretch their upper edges and twist outward with scissors, and twist the lower edges with flagella in the direction of the extension lines.  It remains only to stretch the middle part, not reaching the edges of a couple of millimeters. </p><p>  The flower itself is going to be quite simple: lay out the petals around the candy and wind them with sewing thread.  Make sure that the bud is tight, and all the petals below are attached at about the same level.  Unopened rose buds can be obtained by simply wrapping the candy in a wide strip of crepe. </p><p>  When the flowers are ready, collect them in a composition, fasten them to the top with double-sided tape, or, better, hot-melt adhesive.  Now our candy cake is ready to go on a visit. </p><h2>  March 8 and Valentine's Day </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts made of candy heart" class="if uuid-2398088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398088.jpg"></div><p>  For these holidays, it is customary to give sweets in the form of eights or hearts.  So why not make such a gift with your own hands?  There are several options for implementing this idea: you can take polystyrene as a basis or make a cardboard form.  You will have to tinker with the second one a bit, but we remember that this is a good box for an additional gift. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, to create crafts from sweets for Valentine's Day, you must repeat the same steps as with the cake.  The sides are sealed with long candies, which are placed tightly to each other.  Then, on the upper part, you need to attach a composition of sweet flowers.  But there is another option for decorating the top. </p><p>  You can make many roses so that they densely fill the top of the heart or figure eight.  They need to be planted on toothpicks if foam is used as the base.  If this is a cardboard form, then you can get by with glue.  All these flowers should be tightly installed on the base so that it is not visible through them.  But it is also worth remembering that the petals of flowers are made of paper.  Therefore, too dense arrangement can ruin the appearance of the buds. </p><h2>  Shoe for Cinderella </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts made of candy slipper" class="if uuid-2398097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398097.jpg"></div><p>  This is not so much a valuable thing as an expression of your attitude to the lady.  In such an article of sweets, only a few flowers are created.  The shoe itself is a foam form with a wire pasted over with crepe paper. </p><p>  Since there are not many sweets in this craft, you need to make sure that they are the best.  In addition, the flower should be made so that you can safely get the candy out of it without harming it.  After all, this shoe will then serve as a detail of the interior of a beautiful young lady. </p><h2>  Sweet gift to man </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from sweets to a man" class="if uuid-2398107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398107.jpg"></div><p>  The stronger sex also loves sweets.  And men love unusual jokes.  Therefore, we can safely combine these two features into one. </p><p>  Before starting work, remember what is the main occupation of a man or what he is most fond of.  Based on this, choose a form for a future gift.  You can make a sweet computer for a system administrator, a bell for a teacher, an engineer for a ruler, an architect for a house, a locksmith or plumber for a wrench. </p><p>  Cut the blank of the desired shape from the foam and paste over it with beautiful paper.  And already on top of this, you can lay out sweets on double-sided tape or glue.  Finish off with a simple bow made of packaging or satin ribbon.  If you wish, you can add a bottle of alcohol to the composition.  Such crafts made of chocolates will surely be remembered by everyone for a long time. </p><h2>  Tearing patterns and stereotypes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from a bouquet of sweets" class="if uuid-2398094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398094.jpg"></div><p>  Imagine a situation when a girl or woman asked you for a modest presentation of a bouquet of chocolates.  What does she expect?  Of course, beautiful flowers made of paper, inside which are hidden exquisite sweets. </p><p>  But we can act differently by presenting her a bouquet, as in the photo above.  To do this, you will need many different bars and packs of dragees.  Even Kinder Surprise eggs will go to this bouquet. </p><p>  To make such a work of art is not at all difficult.  It is necessary to take wooden skewers and wrap all the components of the bouquet with tape or thread.  Chocolate eggs must first be packed in a transparent film to make a tail for attachment from below.  So the packaging will not be damaged and they will be visible among other bars. </p><p>  On thick packing paper, we need to lay out our future bouquet and wrap it in an envelope.  To prevent the longest skewers from sticking out, cut them with scissors or a knife.  Everything can go to surprise your soulmate. </p><h2>  Crafts from sweets: a bouquet of roses </h2><p>  If you still decide to make beautiful flowers, then you need to properly assemble the bouquet.  How to make rose buds we figured out above.  What else needs to be added to this?  For a full bouquet, we need roses on the stem.  Therefore, the stages of work will have to change a little. </p><p>  First you need to prepare sweets.  They are tied with ponytails to wooden skewers.  And only after that the buds themselves begin to collect.  Remember, unwinding candy wrappers or piercing sweets is strictly prohibited.  This is due to the fact that an infection can be introduced into the food product, which will cause the disease of the person who eats them. </p><p>  You can collect a bouquet in different ways: pack it in gift paper, put it in a basket, give it in a vase.  All this depends only on you and the preferences of the woman for whom you are preparing a gift. </p><h2>  Candy toys </h2><p>  In childhood, mothers told everyone that food is not a toy.  But you can prove the opposite if you give your child crafts from sweets.  For children it will be an unforgettable present.  In addition, you can easily make it yourself. </p><p>  For work, you will need, in addition to sweets, polystyrene, crepe, double-sided tape, scissors and a knife. </p><p>  First decide what you would like to do.  Boys will appreciate cars, tractors, tanks or a car steering wheel.  Girls will like dolls and animals, except for bouquets, of course. </p><p>  So, we begin by creating a blank for crafts.  A candy machine, for example, consists of wheels, a body and a cab.  The easiest way to make them from different pieces, and then fasten together.  For such purposes, it is better to use toothpicks, as some types of glue can melt the foam. </p><p>  After that, the entire blank must be covered with colored paper.  Ideal for thick crepe and PVA glue.  The paper needs to be glued well, otherwise the candies will fall off with it. </p><p>  Next, you need to make the wheels.  There are several options here.  You can pick up round sweets or chocolate coins, or you can cut them out of cardboard and decorate with the same paper. </p><p>  When the body is assembled, you can begin to decorate it.  Take the sweets, hide the ponytails from the wrong side and glue the double-sided tape to the typewriter.  Try to calculate their position so that there is not a single not closed area on the body. </p><p>  About the same way you can make a <span>tank of sweets.</span>  But you need to remember about its design features: caterpillars, a gun and a tower.  If you are creating a small model, then the role of the tower is perfect for a semicircular candy.  But it‚Äôs better not to be lazy and make a bigger copy.  To do this, the tower will have to be cut separately and fixed to the main building.  But in this case, you can make a hole in it to fix a long cylindrical candy-barrel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from candies machine" class="if uuid-2398081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2398081.jpg"></div><p>  Caterpillars can be made from the same round coins as in the example with the machine.  But after you stick them to the case, do not forget to put a thin strip of colored cardboard around the perimeter. </p><h2>  Toys for girls </h2><p>  But you don‚Äôt give a tank of sweets to every girl.  Therefore, you have to do something else for them.  For example, a sweet doll.  For this, the hem of the dress is cut out of cardboard, into which you need to insert a toy.  Then the top of the dress is glued from paper for her.  All this is decorated with colored paper applications. </p><p>  Then you can attach sweets to the hem, as described above: not double-sided tape.  But you can go even further and put the whole composition on a foam pallet.  This will make it possible to create a fabulous floral train of roses.  This option of crafts made from sweets will look even more impressive. </p><p>  And you can make funny animals or characters of your favorite films, for example, bears, cats, chanterelles.  The logic of work here is the same as before: we make the base, seal it with colored paper, decorate with sweets, creating clear character traits.  By the way, for a gift, such crafts from sweets for children can be created together with your kids.  But the main thing here is to stock up on a little more sweets, because their consumption will increase. </p><h2>  The main features of working with sweets </h2><p>  The first thing to remember is food products, and gifts from them all the same people will eat.  Therefore, you must strictly follow the rules for working with them: do not remove wrappers, do not puncture sweets, work only with clean and non-toxic materials. </p><p>  Crafts from sweets are original works of art.  Therefore, it is worth treating them with all responsibility.  The main decorative effect is achieved due to colorful candy wrappers.  Therefore, you need to think through all the crafts in advance, so that later in the store you can pick up suitable "art materials". </p><p>  You should not work with sweets in hot rooms or near heating appliances.  They can leak and not only spoil the entire appearance of the product, but they themselves will spoil. </p><p>  Do not do the craft much in advance.  Sweets have a limited shelf life.  If they stay with you for a couple of weeks, they can go bad.  Which is not very good effect not only on their taste, but also on the health of the donee. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Creating something from ready-made things is an unusually interesting activity.  Therefore, crafts made of sweets cause extraordinary delight among those who receive them as a gift.  Their advantage is that creating them is not so difficult.  In addition, they will not become trash in the future, which simply gathers dust on a shelf and cannot be thrown away. </p><p>  For almost any reason, you can present such a gift.  Making a heart made of sweets will be an excellent option for Valentine's Day, a charming bouquet for a birthday, and a toy car or a doll for a children's holiday. </p><p>  In addition, this is an exciting activity not only for adults.  Children can also help create such crafts.  This lesson is great for developing their ability to transform things into something new and creative vision, which, of course, will be useful to them in adulthood. </p>
