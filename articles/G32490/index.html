  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paris. The metro scheme and the main nuances of the French metro</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Paris is one of the most romantic cities in Europe.  It inspires, captivates and falls in love with millions of tourists from all over the world.  Here, world classics of literature drew their inspiration, local restaurants stupefy with specialties, and museums and monuments delight even the most experienced travelers. </p><p>  As in any major city, Paris has a well-developed transport connection.  Residents of megacities can no longer imagine their life without a subway, but in Paris he does most of the work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.rambler.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris from above" class="if uuid-2258411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2258411.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The French at all times loved to experiment, and the Paris metro was no exception.  Its history begins in the middle of the XIX century, but the opening of the first metro station took place only on July 19, 1900. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that initially local residents were categorically against the construction of underground railways, but the city authorities insisted on their own.  In the course of all subsequent years, the Paris Metro grew and developed rapidly.  In the 1920s, the first project was developed to expand the underground railways, 17 years later the first interactive metro scheme of Paris appeared, and in 1998, metro automation and train improvement began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paris metro map </h2><p>  The metro scheme of Paris may at first seem very confusing and chaotic, but if you look closely, soon everything will fall into place.  The Paris Metro is 16 different lines, the name of each of which corresponds to the main street or square where the stop is located.  Why are all the tourists who first arrived in Paris puzzled over the analysis of these incomprehensible lines crossing each other, reminiscent of a web from the side?  The fact is that a network of regional electric trains is superimposed on top of the Paris metro scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eutouring.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris metro map" class="if uuid-2258427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2258427.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a RER? </h2><p>  The R√©seau Express R√©gional d'Ile-de-France is a separate train service connecting all surrounding areas with the city itself.  Since it is marked on the Paris metro scheme along with all lines and stations, it is sometimes quite difficult to understand.  The RER system has its own designation: A, B, C, D, E. </p><h2>  Metro cost </h2><p>  Metro tickets in Paris are another full story.  Passengers can enjoy a wide range of different fares: Single Tickets, Mobilis (one-day), Paris Visite, NaviGO card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each of the tariffs has its own cost, to proceed when choosing a ticket you need from the wishes of the tourist.  If you plan to stay in the city for up to 5 days, then Paris Visite will be the best option, the cost of which varies between 11 and 63 euros. </p><p>  Not all visitors know that the NaviGO map is perfect not only for local residents, but also for tourists.  You need to purchase a card separately for 5 euros, and then connect one of the proposed tariffs for the corresponding fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro inside" class="if uuid-2258435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2258435.jpg"></div><h2>  Fines </h2><p>  Thrifty tourists in this city will be especially disappointed, because stowaway in Paris entails a bunch of serious consequences.  Controllers who regularly check the availability of tickets for passengers, especially tourists, can quickly find a ‚Äúhare‚Äù.  Believe me, they can easily distinguish a tourist from a local resident.  The fine charged by the controller is about 80 euros.  In addition, most <span>Paris stations</span> are equipped with turnstiles both at the entrance and at the exit, so stowaways often run the risk of being blocked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train in the subway of Paris" class="if uuid-2258446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2258446.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Some Russian-speaking guides can provide the tourist with the Paris metro scheme in Russian, if you are completely confused in this underground communication system.  Initially, a city can scare away a novice tourist with its intricate system, dividing into districts and the high cost of the subway, but all this is quickly forgotten when you realize that you are standing on the streets of one of the most romantic cities on the planet. </p>
