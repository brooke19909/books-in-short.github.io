Many tourists pay special attention to the last point, and this is fully justified.  After all, if the hotel is not to your liking, all the rest can go down the drain.  Those who choose Pattaya as their place of vacation are advised to pay attention to the Wongamat Privacy Resort Residence 3 * hotel.  But for starters, I would like to find out what the resort itself is and what features of rest on it. </p><p>  Pattaya is a city that all of Thailand is proud of.  It is located near Bangkok, and is considered the best place for recreation and tourism.  This can be seen by the number of visitors, it can reach more than 5 million annually.  Pattaya is the most striking and versatile resort where you can come to relax, have fun from the heart and spend a vacation with children. </p><h2>  Features of stay in Pattaya </h2><p>  For those who love the hot sun and sandy <span>beaches, Pattaya has</span> prepared wonderful places for sunbathing and a warm sea.  Fans of night parties will like the many bars, discos, restaurants with amazing Thai and traditional European cuisine, massage services, and, of course, an incendiary trans show.  Many believe that Thailand is a country of almost debauchery, this opinion is fueled by the fact that there are three sexes in the country.  But, having been here for some time, you quickly get used to such people and do not notice their extravagance at all.  Nevertheless, it is worth to visit the famous transvestite performances of the Alkazar Show, these are truly unforgettable and surprisingly beautiful performances.  If you want to combine hot beaches and fun nights, Pattaya is exactly the place where you can enjoy a varied vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who can not imagine a vacation without their children, Pattaya presents beautiful and unique parks: </p><ul><li>  A farm with crocodiles and snakes. </li><li>  Safari. </li><li>  Park with tigers. </li><li>  A show of elephants that you can even ride on. </li></ul><p>  Pattaya resort has children's entertainment spots, water parks and attractions, warm and clean pools and tropical parks.  For example, the ‚ÄúDinosaur Park‚Äù alone can occupy your child for the entire period of stay at the resort. </p><p>  For sports and outdoor enthusiasts there are special offers: </p><ul><li>  Equestrian theater and the opportunity to ride horses. </li><li>  Golf Courses. </li><li>  Tennis courts. </li><li>  Lakes for fishing. </li><li>  Windsurfing. </li><li>  Extreme parachuting. </li></ul><p>  Hotel Wongamat Privacy Residence 3 * is a wonderful hotel complex that welcomes tourists all year round.  But are all the months perfect for a vacation in Pattaya? </p><h2>  When is it better to go to Pattaya? </h2><p>  In principle, at any time of the year you can relax in Pattaya, here each period is favorable in its own way.  The rainy season does not last too long.  Due to the tropical climate, heavy rainfall is characteristic here, especially in September-October.  But this can not spoil the rest and overshadow the experience, since it can rain rarely and not for long.  Of course, it‚Äôs not very comfortable to rest in the rainy season.  Due to the ebb from April to October, the sea goes far from the coast, and even muddy water becomes even dirtier.  During such periods, it is dangerous to swim, because of the invisibility under water, you can easily injure yourself on a sea urchin or get a jellyfish burn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most favorable vacation in Pattaya is from November to June.  The air temperature at this time is ideally comfortable for relaxing on sandy beaches and traveling to interesting places in Thailand.  Water in this period leaves only at night, which practically does not interfere with rest. </p><p>  If you nevertheless chose Pattaya, then rest on the islands will be simply unforgettable, especially on Koh Lana, and this is available to everyone.  From June to September in Thailand itself is the rainy season.  But, despite this, during this period it is very comfortable for Europeans - moderate temperature and humidity. <br>  For those who want to see exotic places and relax on the clean beaches of the <span>Gulf of Thailand, to</span> taste delicious food, and all this for little money, then the most favorable period is from June to the end of December.  Tours and accommodation prices are as low as possible and there are practically no tourists. </p><h2>  Hotel Wongamat Privacy Resort Residence </h2>

A varied breakfast menu, lots of fruit and delicious ice cream. </p><p>  The hotel is visited by many foreigners, most of them Russian and Chinese.  In the morning, many go on excursions, so during the day it is very quiet and calm.  Hotel Wongamat Privacy Residence 3 * (Pattaya) is located far from the road, which makes it possible to enjoy the tropical atmosphere and cheerful twittering of birds. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  One of the best beaches in Pattaya is Wongamat.  The water, of course, is not very clear, but, having sailed a bit from the coast, you can observe the true beauty of the seabed even without a mask.  There are practically no sun loungers on the beach, so it‚Äôs better to take personal bedspreads with you, you can rent special rugs.  To the beach you need a little walk.  The journey takes 20 minutes.  But this allows you to peek along the way to interesting shops. </p><h2>  Island trip </h2><p>  The nearest island from the hotel is the famous Koh Lan.  Get better in the morning.  It is very cheap and convenient to ride a tuk-tuk (the so-called local transport).  The cost of a trip per person is about 10 baht to the central street of Volkin Street.  There is a port where you can get to any island for 30 baht by ferry.  From the center, you can get to any point in Pattaya in several ways, relax on the best beaches, for example, Tien, Samaia, Mankin Beach.  Most of all tourists are impressed by Samete beach.  The sand here resembles semolina - clean and warm, and the sea is just a pleasure.  If you decide to visit the island, you should definitely go for a swim with masks, see all the delights of the seabed, watch beautiful fish and other marine life. </p><h2>  Excursion programs </h2><p>  It is better to choose excursions on your own or use the services of a hotel guide.  On the territory you can order and choose at affordable prices excursions, parks, interesting sights.  At Wongamat Privacy Resort Residence 3 * you can meet interesting people, sit in local bars in the evening, listen to good music.  Often vacationers travel to the <span>river Kwai.</span>  They order a big bus for them.  They can stop by the whole group in wonderful shops with souvenirs, buy fresh fruits and local famous drinks.  You must visit one of the safari parks, enjoy the exotic nature and chat with wonderful animals.  Local farms with crocodiles will appeal to both an adult and a child.  Here you can find out a lot of unusual things about these animals. <br>  Pattaya has an incredible number of places to shop, markets are full of fresh fish and seafood specialties.  Large supermarkets are packed to capacity with interesting and tasty products, all of which can be purchased and prepared for yourself a gourmet dinner.  Near the hotel there is a large number of cafes where you can eat and just relax.  Such an abundance of fresh fruits, as in local bazaars, is nowhere else to meet.  There are several Russian cafes that our tourists like to go to.  Chefs here prepare tasty, familiar dishes; there is a large assortment for children. </p><h2>  Overall impression based on reviews </h2>

Some unscrupulous agencies, in order to cash in on tourists, can talk about additional registrations, without which you allegedly would not be able to leave Pattaya.

So you can safely travel wherever you want and enjoy the wonderful vacation that Pattaya hospitably offers.  Wongamat Privacy Residence Resort 3 * will accommodate guests of any age and prosperity.
