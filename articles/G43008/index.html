    <p>  Despite the fact that <span>Nokia C5</span> is an inexpensive device, the appearance turned out to be very solid.  In addition to plastic, metal elements are also present in the case.  This lends a resemblance to the more expensive E-Series models. </p><p>  C5 solidity is diluted with a rounded shape and a stroke of the body.  The device looks softer and not so striking.  On the other hand, the device does not stand out against the background of its brothers. </p><p>  The user will also like the dimensions of the <span>Nokia C5</span> 00. The device came out lightweight, only 89.3 grams.  The thickness of 12.3 mm let me down a little, but for a cellular one this is quite an acceptable characteristic. </p><p>  The front of the C5 is covered with painted plastic, similar to metal.  To protect the display, a panel with a black border is used.  A keyboard was placed under the screen, and a front-facing speaker and a speaker were at the top. </p><p>  The upper end was reserved for the charging socket, 3.5 mm input, as well as a USB connector.  Although the manufacturer significantly overloaded the side, this did not affect comfortable use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the left side there is only a place for the strap, and on the right there is <span>a volume control</span> and a slot for a flash drive.  The memory card goes deep into the device, and it will be very difficult to get it without foreign objects.  Problems will arise with the volume control, which is deeply recessed into the body.  It will be inconvenient for the user to use the buttons. </p><p>  At the back of the device, the manufacturer placed the main camera, a flash, two speakers and a logo.  The battery cover is completely made of metal.  However, the material is very susceptible to scratches.  Damage to the cover is immediately apparent. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The <span>Nokia C5</span> 00 installed a screen size of 2.2 inches.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer saved by installing a TFT-matrix.  This decision affects when working with the device in the sun.  The Nokia C5 display loses brightness, but the position is not critical.  Outdated technology has reduced viewing angles.  Even with a slight tilt, the image is noticeably distorted. </p><p>  The pixel resolution is 320 by 240. Given the small diagonal, the picture is acceptable.  Looking closely at the screen, you can detect minor pixels.  Compensates for the lack of 16 million colors. </p><p>  The display will please with its brightness and saturation.  You don‚Äôt have to expect more from a simple smartphone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The Nokia C5 model received the usual 0.3 MP ‚Äúeye‚Äù, which acts as a front camera.  The front camera is designed for video calls, which copes with it perfectly.  It is possible to make self-portraits, but the quality is poor. </p><p>  The main camera C5 Nokia equipped with a matrix of 3.2 megapixels.  Present in the device and flash.  The device‚Äôs camera is very weak, and high-quality images can be obtained only in good light.  A flash will also not be very useful. </p><p>  It is possible to shoot video.  Cellular is capable of recording videos with fifteen frames per second and a resolution of 640 by 480. This is not enough for a good video, most likely, the owner will not use this function. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  The ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of C5 differs markedly from the later model of Nokia C5 03. The characteristics of the first are more reminiscent of a cellular one, and the updated version is a powerful smartphone.  However, a simple C5 00 may surprise the user. </p><p>  The device received an ARM11 processor with a frequency of 600 GHz.  To work on the S60 platform, this is more than enough.  Confuses a small amount of RAM, only 128 MB.  However, the phone is capable of simultaneously processing up to 15 active applications. </p><p>  Summed up and the amount of native memory.  The device received only 256 megabytes.  The situation is expanded by the possibility of expanding it due to a flash drive up to 16 GB. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Nokia C5 works in familiar networks: 900, 850, 1800, 1900. The device also has GPS.  To connect to the Internet using the usual GPRS B-class.  There is also Bluetooth 2.0. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The manufacturer installed a removable battery with a capacity of 1050 maH.  The battery lasts about 3-4 days of average use.  More active work with the device will reduce his life to two days. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the cost of C5 00 varies in the region of 7-8 thousand rubles.  For a device so weak in its characteristics, the price is definitely too high.  It will be easy for the buyer to choose a smartphone that has a superior "C5" filling for the same price. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage of the C5 is its excellent autonomy.  The phone will provide the user with uninterrupted operation for several days. </p><p>  Small dimensions also appealed to many owners.  The device is much lighter and smaller than modern smartphones, which for the better affected usability. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The disadvantages of C5 are much greater.  Most alarming is the overpriced cost of the device.  To give 7-8 thousand for a frankly weak smartphone looks silly. </p><p>  The camera does not inspire confidence in users.  The 3.2 megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot capable of taking high-quality images and can fail in poor lighting conditions. </p><p>  For the 2010 device, 256 MB of memory is definitely not enough.  The user will have no choice but to install a flash card. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Nokia C5 looks interesting and quite attractive.  However, the greed of the manufacturer reduces the popularity of the device.  The only advantage, the high autonomy of the device, absolutely does not justify its price. </p>
