Although its equipment is manufactured in China, Lenovo is one of the few companies that produces really high-quality products.

    <h2>  Lenovo P780 does not turn on after water </h2><p>  If the phone has recently hit the water, you need to quickly pull it out.  In no case do not try to turn it on immediately, as you will only reduce the chances of recovery.  If he did not turn off, then do it you.  After all, a short circuit will occur due to water, and you will have to change the memory, battery and other elements in the Lenovo P780.  You must understand that through various USB ports, charging, microphone holes, water will quickly reach significant details, which, in turn, will disrupt the operation of the device. </p><p>  You won‚Äôt need to replace the Lenovo P780 until you are completely sure that your phone is not working.  Remember that even if you wash your device in a washing machine, there‚Äôs a chance to save it.  The main thing is to follow the instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo p780 memory" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1379752.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Basic Rules </h2><p>  So what should I do if the Lenovo P780 does not turn on after falling into water? </p><ol><li>  As we already found out, turn off the phone.  If the device was connected to a charger, you should very carefully disconnect it from the network.  Remember that water conducts electricity perfectly, so you can be shocked.  In this case, it is better to disconnect the apartment or house from electricity and then get and turn off the phone. </li><li>  After you turn off the phone, you need to get the battery.  Then we take paper towels and wipe the apparatus dry.  You must also make sure that all additional devices are turned off (headphones, SIM card, memory card, etc.). </li><li>  In order to completely get rid of water, you can try to disassemble the phone a little and wipe it from the inside.  Remember that if even one drop remains inside, this will lead to corrosion or short circuit. </li><li>  You can dry the phone with a vacuum cleaner, but you do not need to expose the device very close to the hose.  After 25 minutes, the moisture will not dry.  This method is perfect if the smartphone is quickly taken out of the water.  Do not use a hair dryer for this, as it can melt some elements with warm air, this will only do harm. </li><li>  Residual moisture can be removed with rice.  If you leave your smartphone for the night in a bowl of rice, then in the morning you can already turn it on.  Rice absorbs moisture well, but the gadget must be double-checked before turning it on. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battery lenovo p780" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1379750.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Before turning on, check all ports in the phone.  If it looks completely dry and clean, you can turn on the device.  Perhaps you have strange sounds when you turn on your smartphone, which means that it is damaged.  Also, if the phone does not start to turn on, but looks completely dry, then the Lenovo P780 battery may have been damaged or discharged. </li><li>  If complete drying did not help, then you should take the phone to a service center, where it will be checked for serviceability and, possibly, brought back to life.  Of course, it will be quite expensive, but it is cheaper than buying a new smartphone. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is necessary to approach the repair of the device based on your problem.  If he himself stopped turning on, then it is worth trying to reflash the device.  All the necessary software can be on the manufacturer's website Lenovo P780 w3bsit3-dns.com.  If the phone has stopped turning on due to your negligence, then you need to follow the above instructions.  You do not need to immediately think about replacing the device, since it can be returned to your previous life with your own efforts.  Remember that all actions must be performed carefully so as not to further harm the device. </p>
