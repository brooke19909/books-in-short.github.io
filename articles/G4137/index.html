Working with living plants requires florists to be creative and creative.  But, as in any business, you need special equipment.  An apron for a florist will help protect clothes.  Bouquet designers do not have strict appearance requirements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.floretflowers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron for florist" class="if uuid-2898245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2898245.jpg"></div><h2>  What is overalls for? </h2><p>  The apron for the florist can be of any color, style and is made of any suitable material.  It can be decorated with a company logo or other elements. </p><p>  An apron for a florist, the photo of which is presented in the article, should be made of durable fabric that does not allow moisture to pass.  Another important aspect: it should have pockets for work equipment.  A florist needs scissors, adhesive tape, tapes, pruners and other devices that should always be at hand to optimize the work process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself apron for a florist" class="if uuid-2898259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2898259.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  The apron should be sewn from durable fabric, because even on the finest plants there may be thorns and sharp leaves.  He should not constrain movements.  The apron should have convenient fastenings or ties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make the apron waterproof, you can use a special lining.  As a basis, you can choose thin tarpaulin, raincoat fabric, jeans, linen or synthetic materials. </p><h2>  Buy or sew </h2><p>  If you need a lot of aprons for florists, then you can buy ready-made ones in stores.  But if the company is small, then it would be more expedient to order at the studio or sew it yourself.  Work on such a product does not take much time.  If you make an apron for a florist with your own hands, then you can take into account the peculiarities of the figure and the other nuances and wishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron for florist" class="if uuid-2898273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2898273.jpg"></div><h2>  Fabric calculation </h2><p>  You can sew an apron with and without a bib.  Depending on the style, the amount of fabric is calculated.  If the width of the canvas is 70-80 cm, then a cut equal to the double length of the product is necessary.  With a fabric width of 120-140 cm, one product length is sufficient. </p><p>  The material is taken with a margin that is needed for cutting pockets, ties, belts and other decorative elements. </p><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To sew an apron for a florist, you need to take measurements and make a simple pattern.  The main dimensions are the circumference of the hips and the length of the product, which is measured from the waist. </p><p>  If the apron with a bib, you need to measure the height of the chest part. </p><h2>  Apron without bib </h2><p>  The product must cover at least half of the figure along the hips to effectively protect.  You can find out the width of the product by measuring the hips and dividing this indicator in half.  If you need a wider apron, you need to take this into account when measuring.  It will also require a measurement of the length of the product.  It is convenient to work in an apron up to the knee or slightly lower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron for florist" class="if uuid-2898225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2898225.jpg"></div><p>  On paper, build a rectangle that will be half the product. </p><p>  For cutting, fold the fabric along the shared thread.  To save material, this should not be done along the center line of the cut, but at half the width of the apron.  When cutting, add 2 cm on each side to allowances.  From the remaining tissue, cut a belt that is cut along a shared thread.  The width of the belt is 3-4 cm, and to find the length you need to add 30 cm to the width of the apron on each side.  The belt consists of 2 identical stripes. </p><p>  Also, do not forget about the pockets.  They can be made rectangular by laying 1 cm on allowances at the edges and 2 cm on top. </p><p>  Now you can start sewing.  Bend and stitch the side edges of the apron on the machine.  Fold bottom and hem too.  Mark the location of the pockets.  Before attaching them to the base, you need to bend and sew the top edge of the pocket, and bend the other sides inward and iron.  After that, they can be sewn to the product. </p><p>  It remains to stitch the belt.  Next, you should grind the belt details along the length on one side and sew along the width of the ties.  Turn to the front and iron thoroughly.  Mark the center of the belt and the center of the apron.  Connect both parts and sew them manually with a basting seam.  After that, stitch on a typewriter.  If the apron is intended for a slender girl, then 10 cm from each edge of the main canvas you need to lay small folds. </p><p>  The product is ready. </p><h2>  Apron with bib </h2><p>  If you need to protect the upper body, then you can make a bib.  It can be one-piece or sewn separately.  Its shape can be rectangular, in the form of a trapezoid or fantasy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="apron for a florist pattern" class="if uuid-2898228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2898228.jpg"></div><p>  Opening an apron with a separate bib differs from the option described above in that the shape of the upper part and the ties for it are cut out.  It is sewn after grinding the belt. </p><p>  If the product is one-piece, then you need to first build an apron pattern for the florist.  First, a rectangle is constructed (as described above), on which the product length and half the width are laid.  The pattern is built on half the product.  To postpone the height of the bib from the center point.  Draw a line equal to half the width of the bib (10-12 cm).  Connect the extreme points with a pattern or ruler.  Cutting products is carried out in the same way as in the previous version. </p><p>  When sewing, the edges of the apron are first treated.  Sew pockets and ties.  And after that they sew a belt.  The ties around the neck can be made adjustable in length using buttons or rings, and besides, such details will become a decorative decoration. </p><h2>  Creative option </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.denimdoover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron for florist" class="if uuid-2898293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2898293.jpg"></div><p>  To work with homemade flowers, you can make an apron from old jeans.  You need to leave the belt and back pockets, and cut off everything else.  Such an accessory is put on the waist with pockets forward or on the side - to whom it is more convenient. </p><p>  An apron for a florist should help in the creative search.  When everything is at hand, nothing interferes with work. </p>
