When a potential buyer decides to buy a gadget, he arranges shopping raids.  He definitely needs to see everything and hold it in his hands.  After all, the only way to understand which model is more suitable. </p><p>  But if you are not one of those, then a couple of reviews and reviews will be enough.  Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb can be purchased by reading or viewing several articles.  This smartphone is particularly comfortable and has a nice design. </p><h2>  Names </h2><p>  Before we examine this phone from head to toe, we need to deal with numerous names.  Last year, the manufacturer introduced a new smartphone - Xiaomi Redmi Pro.  It turned out to be interesting in appearance, not inferior to the design and ‚Äúiron‚Äù.  In general, the experiment was clearly a success. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi pro 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018043.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But this is bad luck.  Xiaomi still can not decide on naming.  In general, this problem is quite common among Chinese manufacturers who packs produce their products. </p><p>  If you look closely at the Redmi family, you can find a pattern in the fact that there are some models with a five-inch screen, and the second part with a 5.5-inch display. </p><p>  When the version of Redmi Pro appeared on the market, it was to be expected that this was still the same compact version, but advanced in the "stuffing".  In fact, it turned out that we still have the same option with a 5.5-inch screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How in this confusion to find out what's what, is still difficult to understand.  It is hoped that the manufacturer will streamline its names, and the user will understand what ‚Äújungle‚Äù he has to climb into. </p><h2>  About smartphone </h2><p>  Before us is a practically unremarkable Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb phone.  Reviews about him leave good.  Of course, there were confusions with the name.  Not everyone was able to figure out the complex circuits of the manufacturer.  But the one who was attentive to the options got what he wanted. </p><p>  The company introduced the model as a flagship.  In fact, there is already a familiar set of characteristics.  Interestingly, the model comes in three versions.  And besides the fact that they differ in the amount of RAM and internal memory, there is a difference in processors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi note 4x pro 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018042.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the budget option, Helio X20 works with 3Gb RAM and 32Gb of internal storage.  The middle model was equipped with Helio X25, the ‚ÄúRAMs‚Äù were still 3 GB, but the internal memory was doubled - 64 GB.  Well, the latest version also works with Helio X25, but with 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory. </p><p>  On average, a model costs 22-26 thousand rubles.  The cheapest option, as usual, is light gray. </p><h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  What else can be said about Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb?  He received mostly positive reviews.  Of course, the packaging has nothing to do with this, but it is worth mentioning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone was packed in an already familiar box of white thick cardboard.  In front is not only the orange logo of the company, but also the image of the model itself.  Below are incomprehensible hieroglyphs.  But you can guess what it says "Redmi Pro". </p><p>  Inside, too, is nothing new.  Chinese manufacturers are not pleased with the generosity of a complete set.  In addition to the phone, they put in the box a power adapter with cable.  There is a paper clip for removing the tray and documentation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi pro 64gb gray reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  According to reviews of Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb Gray, it became clear that the model was able to captivate users with its appearance.  While most manufacturers are striving to create another copy of the iPhone, Xiaomi is slowly but surely continuing its experiments. </p><p>  This one turned out to be very successful, although it also has newfangled characteristics.  Looking at the front panel, you can notice the features of the Meizu lineup.  In the case, rounded shapes are still traced.  There are upper and lower inserts, glass - 2.5D.  The phone‚Äôs back cover looks best.  Although someone can say that she is a full-fledged clone of Meizu M3e.  Nevertheless, the manufacturer decided not to upset us with plastic for metal.  Before us is a sanded panel: smooth, tactile.  Plastic inserts are made above and below to hide the antennas under them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The phone comes in three colors.  I received positive reviews from Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb Black (black).  Of course, to call this model ‚Äúblack‚Äù does not turn the tongue, because it is gray.  But so the manufacturer indicated the color of the front panel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone xiaomi redmi 4 pro 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018045.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is a silver version with a white front panel, as well as conditionally gold.  In fact, it is more beige and pink.  The same shade and the front. </p><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  The assembly is not satisfactory.  The body is monolithic, so no squeaks.  Glass with a protective oleophobic coating.  Fingerprints accumulate to a minimum.  Holds for quite a while without scratches. </p><p>  The dimensions are quite comfortable, given that we have a device with a large diagonal.  The phone is 15 cm high, 7 cm wide, and only 8 mm thick.  Due to metal materials, its weight is 174 grams, that is, in the hand the device will feel quite weighty. </p><p>  It is subjective to keep such a model comfortable.  She does not slip out of her hands, and the ends do not cut her palm. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  The elemental base is successful in general and already familiar to many.  Everything remained in their places from previous versions.  As mentioned earlier, the front panel is familiar.  Now this can be found in models of other manufacturers.  The main part is a 5.5-inch display.  We did not forget about 2.5D glass, which, by the way, received a lot of positive reviews. </p><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb mobile phone under the screen has an oval shaped mechanical button.  It is almost identical to the one located on Meizu.  Slightly recessed into the case and has a fingerprint scanner.  With him, as always, no problem: fast and accurate.  Above the display is a conversational speaker.  It produces a clear and loud sound.  If you are indoors, then most likely you will need to lower the volume so that others do not hear the other person.  Nearby placed a selfie camera, a pair of sensors and a notification indicator.  It is not too bright, does not interfere at night. </p><p>  The cover is made of textured metal.  Above and below there are plastic insert-lines for antennas.  The first thing you notice when looking at the back of the case is two cameras.  Modules of the same size are located under each other.  Between them is a flash. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi pro 64gb black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018048.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The right end is occupied by power and volume buttons.  On the left side is the only combination tray for SIM cards or memory cards. </p><p>  The bottom edge is occupied by a slot for connecting a Type-C charger.  To the left and right of it are grids with round holes.  Under one of them is an external speaker, under the second there is a microphone.  The upper end is equipped with an additional microphone for noise reduction.  There is also a place for connecting a headset and an infrared port. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The smartphone screen Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb received no bad reviews.  Before us is a good quality display with an AMOLED matrix.  For a 5.5-inch diagonal, a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels is an excellent solution.  Through the use of OLED technology, the image is contrasting and saturated.  The brightness with an indicator of 350 cd / m2 is acceptable, although I would like more. </p><p>  The matrix itself does not show bad results.  It does not distort color, it has good viewing angles.  When tilting, white deviations towards green are possible, but this is a familiar state.  Additional screen customization will not be superfluous in Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb Gold.  Reviews were left regarding the reading mode, in which the display loses its whitening whiteness.  You can adjust the intensity and select those softwares in which this mode will be activated. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  This is the next thing to talk about.  As already mentioned, behind us are looking at two camera eyes.  Each of them is equipped with a different resolution.  The top module received 13 megapixels and support from Sony.  At the same time, its aperture has a value of f2.0, and the number of lenses has reached five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi pro 3 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018046.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The lower module has got 5 megapixels and Samsung support.  It is needed in order to determine the depth of the picture. </p><p>  Two modules work according to the following principle: the bottom eye analyzes the depth of the image, while the software applies the blur effect to the photo taken from the top module.  This technology can be seen in the iPhone 7 Plus, but in the "apple" device it is better developed and almost never fails.  The Chinese device does not always work correctly and can blur the wrong area. </p><p>  In general, the pictures are good.  You can capture beautiful landscapes or portraits on Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb.  Negative reviews affected only insufficient sharpness.  Apparently, this is due to the "unfinished" technology of the two modules.  But focus and white balance, on the contrary, were touted.  You can record videos in Full HD resolution.  During the day, the camera operates at a speed of 30 frames per second, at night this figure drops by half.  You can apply the effect of the diaphragm, but it looks unfinished. </p><p>  The front camera also showed itself well.  With a resolution of 5 megapixels, it gives good pictures, it can even determine the age of the user, and almost accurately.  Shoots videos in HD. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  Reviews about the characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb, as always, a lot.  In general, users were satisfied.  Of course, someone dreamed of unprecedented performance, but you must not forget about the relatively low cost. </p><p>  The phone is powered by MediaTek Helio X20 or X25.  The chipset is made according to the technological process of 20 nm.  Inside there are 10 cores that work according to the 2x + 4x + 4x scheme.  The Mali-T880 graphics accelerator is a standard solution for such models. </p><p>  Notice any lags or brakes fail.  There is no such device.  The case heats up, but not to critical temperatures.  Tests showed a good result, and in Antutu the model scored 70 thousand points. </p><p>  Games can be run all, but the most resource-intensive ones ‚Äútweak‚Äù a little on the maximum schedule.  With active work, you will feel a good warm cover.  Software installation takes a little longer than we would like, but this is due to slow memory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi pro 64gb gold reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018049.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The device runs on Android 6th version.  Some models may have already received updates to the "seven".  The ‚ÄúMIUI 8.0‚Äù proprietary shell is ‚Äúwashed down‚Äù on top. </p><p>  Anyone who has come across her before knows that she is very pleasant.  MIUI has always been laconic and simple.  She didn‚Äôt change the interface strongly; everything was practically left in its place.  In addition, it provided the user with an almost ‚Äúclean‚Äù system, which for many is the main advantage. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Battery Xiaomi Redmi Pro 64Gb reviews received good.  Most users were happy with the 4050 mAh battery.  This is enough for an active day or an economical one and a half day.  Given the diagonal of the screen, such indicators are now worth its weight in gold. </p><p>  You can watch videos for 12 hours.  If you listen to music, the phone will last 50 hours, and games will have to be content only 3 hours. </p><p>  Charging, although it did not receive QC technology, it still charges the model in 2 hours. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  As already mentioned, you can install two <span>SIM cards</span> in your smartphone <span>: microSIM</span> and nanoSIM.  Both work with 3G / 4G technology.  True, at the same time they do not function with the same frequency.  The rest is all standard: the presence of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GLONASS and GPS. </p><p>  Messaging and phone applications are convenient.  No difficulties arise here even at the first acquaintance.  Everything is intuitive in the right places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi pro 64gb specifications reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018047.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Easy to record a new number, enter the phone.  You can quickly switch to the address book.  There are no problems with entering messages either. </p><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  Around the model under review there is a whole list of analogues that may interest any buyer.  Someone he can confuse, someone, on the contrary, direct on the true path.  Therefore, we will consider a couple of other models that make up the competition, but belong to the same manufacturer. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro </h2><p>  This model appeared previously monitored.  It differs significantly in appearance and cost, respectively.  There is a difference in performance.  This is a budget option for those who want to save a little. </p><p>  In appearance, notes of the usual "firmware" are visible.  The back cover does not have a similar textured structure, but it is also all made of aluminum.  Top and bottom - large plastic inserts.  There is only one camera, it modestly is located in the left corner with a flash.  The speaker was moved from the bottom to the rear panel, which is not always convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone xiaomi redmi pro 64gb reviews" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2018060.jpg" width="361"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  But back to the model under review.  As you can see, it turned out very worthy.  Around her - a huge number of competitors who can replace her.  Therefore, fans of the Chinese manufacturer usually pay attention to this device. </p><p>  The owners noted the appearance.  This model looks best in dark color with a black front panel.  In this color, the frames around the screen are invisible. </p><p>  The performance of the device was not deprived of a good word.  ‚ÄúIron‚Äù turned out to be solid, balanced.  Noticeable lags are not visible.  The device is especially comfortable for work or study.  It easily copes with the load in the form of office programs and well tolerates long surfing the Internet. </p><p> Of the advantages highlighted the presence of albeit unfinished, but a good dual camera.  The screen also pleased with the matrix, bright and saturated colors.  The owners spoke especially well about the sound in the headphones.  Well and, of course, about the quality of the case.  Metal smartphones are always more popular because they are considered more reliable. </p><p>  Users did not see significant shortcomings.  The only thing missing was the NFC function. </p>
