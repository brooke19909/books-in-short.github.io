  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The drainage canal in Moscow: photos and description, history, attractions and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The drainage channel of the Moscow River, which is very popular not only among tourists, but also among local residents, is also considered to be the numerous architectural sights of the capital.  That's all, because it is laid through the historical center of Moscow, where the main tourist attractions and places of worship are located.  Embankments and canal bridges are a favorite area for walks and photo shoots with excellent panoramas. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The artificial structure (the Drainage Canal in Moscow), whose history dates back to 1783, was the solution to the problem of periodic spills of the Moscow River, flooding of nearby houses and repair of damaged supports of the Bolshoi Bridge.  For water drainage, the old channel of the Moskva River was used, which allowed design work to be carried out in conjunction with the existing architectural development of the district, so the location of the streets was almost unchanged.  Demolished only a few wooden buildings.  Another positive factor in the construction of the canal was the drainage of wetlands in the lowlands of the region.  A watercourse begins just above the Bolshoi Bridge and connects with the Moscow River in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe embankment embankment.  The people of the channel received the simple name "ditch". </p><p>  In 1836, the city‚Äôs water sector again underwent a change.  One of the innovations was the construction on the Moskva River, between the embankments of the Bersenevskaya and Kropotskinskaya, Babiyorodskaya dam, which allowed the court to let go.  And near the eastern mouth of the "ditch" a dam was erected with a gateway, which was dismantled a century later during the construction and launch of the Moscow Canal.  In memory of this gateway, the bridge and the embankment were named. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now the water artery reaches a width of 30 to 50 m, the average depth is 2 m, and the length is almost 4 km.  The drainage channel, connecting with the Moscow River, forms the island of Baltschug. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.msk.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolotnaya Embankment" class="if uuid-2517513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2517513.jpg"></div><h2>  Canal embankments </h2><p>  Along the canal are 6 embankments: Shluzovaya, Bolotnaya, Kadashevskaya, Yakimanskaya and Sadovnicheskaya.  The riverbanks are reinforced with concrete fences, which, in turn, are lined with decorative stone - granite.  Along the embankments there are many buildings built in the XVII ‚Äì XIX centuries and having historical value: working barracks, merchant estates, manufactories and residential buildings.  Some of them today are given over to offices and cafes. </p><h2>  Channel bridges </h2><p>  Bridges were built along the entire length of the drainage channel, there are only 11 of them, five of which are pedestrian. </p><p>  If we consider them in order, the first and youngest is the Patriarchal Bridge.  It was built from 2004 to 2007.  It originates from the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, and ends on the Yakimanskaya embankment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turizm.sputnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patriarchal bridge" class="if uuid-2517475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2517475.jpg"></div><p>  Next, the Small Stone Bridge was built, which became a continuation of the Big Bridge.  Big and Small - that's what they are called in pairs.  The Small Bridge was built in 1938, and connects two streets - Serafimovich and Bolshaya Polyanka. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then comes the most famous pedestrian bridge.  It has several names - Luzhkov, Tretyakovsky, due to the proximity of the complex of the art gallery.  There is also a bridge of Lovers, due to the presence of ‚Äútrees of love‚Äù and a bench of ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù on it.  And he connects the <span>Kadashevskaya embankment</span> and the Swamp area. </p><p>  The next Small <span>Moskvoretsky bridge</span> built in 1938 <span>.</span>  It is connected with the Bolshoi bridge, and the Great Ordynka begins from it. Cast-iron - got its name from the material from which it was made.  It was built in 1966, it exists today. </p><p>  In 1963, for the convenience of pedestrians, the Gardener Bridge was opened. </p><p>  Commissariat Bridge was built in 1927.  The name is associated with the institution that was engaged in supplying the army.  It is a continuation of the <span>Big Ustinsky bridge,</span> which is located in the Zamoskvorechye area. </p><p>  Zverev bridge 4 m wide, 33 m long.  The date of its construction is 1930, and it is named after Zverev Lane. </p><p>  <span>The Big Krasnokholmsky bridge</span> passes into the Small Krasnokholmsky and is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Garden Ring. </p><p>  You can go to the Moscow House of Music along the Second Gateway Bridge.  This pedestrian crossing was built in 1997. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oteplohodah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luzhkov bridge" class="if uuid-2517505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2517505.jpg"></div><p>  And you can finish this list with the First Gateway Bridge.  It is named so because once there was a gateway nearby that blocked the channel. </p><p>  Slow walks on bridges are a great opportunity to enjoy the colorful panorama around, a top view of the drainage canal in Moscow.  Photos taken at the same time will replenish the collection of memorable pictures. </p><h2>  Sights of the channel.  Monument to Peter </h2><p>  One of them is a gigantic 100-meter monument of an iconic personality in Russian history, erected on an artificial island at the place where the drainage channel leaves the Moskva River.  Monument to Peter - a unique engineering building, both technically and aesthetically.  Seeing him, involuntarily breathtaking.  The base of the sculpture is made of stainless steel, and everything else is made of bronze.  The monument was assembled in parts.  Lastly, a ship was mounted, each guy of which consists of several cables interwoven among themselves, which completely excludes their mobility. </p><p>  The sails inside have a hollow copper frame to reduce the mass of the monument.  To make the monument more durable, the main material was subjected to high pressure sand treatment with further waxing and varnish.  To give monumentality to the scroll in the hand of Peter I, as well as St. Andrew's crosses, as a symbol of the Russian navy created by him, gilded.  The monument was framed by fountains, symbolizing the expanse of the sea, dissected by ships. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mosprogulka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Peter" class="if uuid-2517469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2517469.jpg"></div><p>  The opening of the monument was carried out in early September 1997 and coincided with the celebration of the 850th anniversary of Moscow. </p><h2>  Trees of love </h2><p>  Another place in the central part of Moscow that is unlikely to go unnoticed is the Luzhkov Bridge, with an avenue of trees hung with castles.  Newlyweds come here from all over the district to capture this memorable event in life in beautiful photos and hang a lock on a tree as a symbol of strong family ties - and, as usual, throw the key into the canal waters.  The first tree of love appeared on the bridge in 2007 and quickly ‚Äúovergrown‚Äù with castles.  At one time, the bridge, which began to collapse under the weight of such decor, had to be reconstructed, special trees made by blacksmiths were put up for the castles, which, as they fill up, are transferred to the nearby Bolotnaya embankment.  Every year the number of trees is increasing and it looks very romantic and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="towntravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trees of love" class="if uuid-2517492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2517492.jpg"></div><h2>  Fountains </h2><p>  Not far from the remarkable Luzhkov bridge in honor of the 800th anniversary of Moscow, the first floating fountains on the drainage channel were installed in the capital, on the basis of pontoons.  An interesting architectural solution is a whole complex of motionless and rotating fountains in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe channel: the jets erupt directly up from the water, and in the dark they are also illuminated by colorful spotlights. </p><h2>  River trams </h2><p>  In 2008, passenger excursion vessels of small capacity and dimensions were launched along the canal to increase the tourist attractiveness of the city.  Such a trip is a great opportunity to enjoy the sights of the central part of Moscow for an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Floating fountains" class="if uuid-2517488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2517488.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Arriving in Moscow, most tourists, one way or another, find themselves near the drainage channel of the Moscow River, since there are many significant historical objects of the capital nearby, and the ‚Äúditch‚Äù itself is considered an architectural monument.  Experienced travelers are advised to make a mandatory walk along the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe canal on a sightseeing tram, take a walk along the beautiful promenades, admire the colorful views of the city from pedestrian bridges and certainly take a photo against the background of floating fountains.  A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasant experiences and a positive charge is provided. </p>
