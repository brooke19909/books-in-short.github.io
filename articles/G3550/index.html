    <p>  It is no coincidence that the Moscow-Zvenigorod route has such a large passenger flow.  Its terminal station is located in a village with a rich history.  There are a number of hypotheses according to which Zvenigorod appeared with the filing of Prince Yuri Dolgoruky from 1150 to 1155.  Archaeological finds indicate that on the site of the city in the XII-XIII centuries there was a fortified settlement that could withstand the attack of a large army. </p><p>  In troubled times, the city was repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt almost from scratch.  In 1812, immediately after the Battle of Borodino, there was a mini-clash of Russians and French.  Until the end of 2000, the city was considered a unique historical settlement, but later it was deprived of this status, and now ultra-modern buildings can be erected on the site of historical development.  Almost 17 thousand people live in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Moscow </h2><p>  Since in Zvenigorod there are not many organizations providing jobs, many of its residents go to work in the capital.  A sufficient amount of transport runs along the Moscow-Zvenigorod route, so driving through it is not difficult.  A <span>large number of</span> architectural monuments are concentrated in the capital, they are treated much more carefully here than in the regions.  It may take several days to view them, however, you can arrange an express tour by hiring a guide or traveling around the city on your own. </p><p>  However, the main goal of those who travel to Moscow every morning is work.  Therefore, the regional authorities are doing everything possible to adjust the schedule of transport vehicles to the needs of the population.  As of 2016, the capital and Zvenigorod are connected by several electric trains, as well as three bus routes, one of which is social. </p><h2>  Distance between two cities </h2>

    <p>  If you want to calculate the time it takes yourself to overcome the Moscow-Zvenigorod route, the distance between the two cities is 65 kilometers, provided that you are traveling by car along the corresponding highway.  When traveling by train, you can safely drop five kilometers.  The straight line distance between points is a little over 48 kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We must not forget that there are a large number of less significant highways, which can also be used to overcome the route from Zvenigorod to Moscow and vice versa.  Depending on the chosen road, you will have to drive from 58 to 72 kilometers, the average travel time is 55-65 minutes. </p><h2>  Riding a bus </h2>

    <p>  One of the options that can be used to get from one city to another is bus No. 881 Moscow-Zvenigorod.  The starting point in the capital is the Strogino metro station, the journey takes about 50 minutes, and if there are no traffic jams, you will quickly reach the bus station in Zvenigorod.  The interval on the <span>route is</span> from 15 to 60 minutes, the beginning of the movement is at 5:45 on weekdays, at 6:25 on the weekends, the end of the movement is at 21:15 (to Moscow), and at 22:10 (to Zvenigorod). </p><p>  The Zvenigorod-Moscow bus is represented by two more routes: 452 and 455, the first goes to the station.  Kuntsevskaya metro station, and the journey takes up to 75 minutes, the second one goes to the Tushinskaya metro station, you can get there in 50 minutes.  These routes have much longer intervals than 881, but you can use them if necessary.  The fare must be clarified at the box office. </p><h2>  Electric train </h2>

    <p>  You can also take advantage of numerous electric trains following the Moscow-Zvenigorod route.  The distance by rail is 60 kilometers, but the trip will have to spend 70-80 minutes due to frequent stops.  The average interval of trains is from 55 to 70 minutes, the first electric train passes the Zvenigorod station at 4:50, the last - at 21:50.  Please note that the schedule is subject to change.  It is best to clarify it at the box office. </p><p>  The fare on the electric train is about 140-150 rubles, if you are traveling by ordinary train.  There is also an express train ‚ÄúZvenigorod-Moscow-Belorusskaya‚Äù, which leaves at 6:37 from Zvenigorod and after 1 hour and 11 minutes already arrives in the capital.  A ticket for a high-speed electric train will cost 180-190 rubles. </p><h2>  Car </h2>

    <p>  The Moscow-Zvenigorod route can be covered in your own car in just an hour.  When choosing a highway on which you will travel from one city to another, try to take into account possible traffic jams, and be sure to see if there are gas stations and campsites on the chosen route.  Also leave 10-15 minutes in reserve, since you can only move freely along the highway, in the capital itself you will probably encounter traffic jams. </p><p>  The easiest way will be to pass along the route using the M-9 and A-107 routes, but you can also use an alternative option - the A-106 road through Gorki-2 and Mechnikovo.  There is an opportunity to drive through Golitsyno, but the detour will turn out to be too large, and the road will take at least two hours.  However, if you want to ride, you can use it.  Please note that there are a large number of tire changers on this highway, so if necessary you can go there for a service. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you have traveled the Moscow-Zvenigorod route at least once, you will know for sure how to get to one or another city.  The main thing is to decide for yourself how much time you can afford to spend on the road, and also choose the most convenient vehicle for the trip (car, bus, train). </p><p>  Some passengers prefer to use taxi services to get from one city to another, but this service is not cheap, so you should first clarify the cost of the trip, and only then think carefully about whether to use this mode of transport.  If you just want to ride around the suburbs and look at the views, it will be easier (and cheaper!) To ask someone to take you. </p>
