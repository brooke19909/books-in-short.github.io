  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew ribbons to pointe shoes: detailed instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In childhood, many girls dream of becoming ballet dancers, playing the roles of Aurora or Odette on the stage of the theater, feeling like real princesses.  But on the way to the first roles in ballet, much remains to be learned.  Not only dancing, doing ball pas and jumps, but also how to sew ribbons to pointe shoes.  Preparing dance shoes is not an easy task.  Pointe shoes must be made exclusively correctly.  This applies to parts such as rubber bands and ribbons, which will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pointetilyoudrop.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew ribbons to pointe shoes" class="if uuid-2233151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233151.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing pointe shoes for first lessons </h2><p>  If you are just planning on doing ballet and getting ready for the first lesson, ask your teacher which pointe shoes are best to get.  After the purchase, carefully study the shoes and bend it slightly with an arc.  Do not bend pointes closer to your fingertips, as this may weaken support.  Relevue the fingers from half-fingers. </p><p>  Press a little on the front of the dance shoes.  This will expand a little and make it more comfortable for the fingers.  The main thing here is not to overdo it so that the box does not crack and pointe shoes do not break. </p><p>  At first, your task is to get used to the shoes and make them suitable for ballet.  It is better to break pointes directly in the dance.  Gradually, you will become a more experienced ballerina and learn how to break dance shoes and how to sew ribbons to pointe shoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All seams should be flossed or with special threads.  Such seams will wear less and shoes will be worn better. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  Before you figure out how to sew on ribbons to pointe shoes, you need to sew on an elastic band.  This is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  From the back seam, measure 2.5 cm on each side. </li><li>  Measure the length of the elastic.  She should not squeeze vessels, but at the same time shoes should keep well. </li><li>  Sew the elastic over the hem back and forth three times so that the seam is as strong as possible. </li></ol><h2>  How to sew tapes to pointe shoes: scheme and sequence of actions </h2><p>  First of all, study the stretched foot and determine the middle of the arch.  Bend the heel of pointe shoes to the toe.  Sew ribbons on both sides.  Get in the store a special tape for pointe shoes, strong and durable.  One pair will need about two meters.  The width of the tape should be from 2.5 to 4 cm, since a narrower one will hit the skin painfully and cause discomfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pointetilyoudrop.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew ribbons to pointe shoes" class="if uuid-2233154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233154.jpg"></div><p>  Pin the ribbons with pins and try to make a few ballet movements to make sure that they are well fixed.  Adjust if necessary. </p><p>  Sew on tapes under the cord.  Make sure once again that they hold the ankle securely.  After that, adjust the laces.  They should not be too tight. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><ol><li>  For longer pointe shoes, remove the earbuds after each workout.  For their storage, it is better to prepare a separate bag or purse. </li><li>  After class, be sure to dry your shoes well.  Try to make pointe shoes comfortable.  And do not be discouraged if at first you will be uncomfortable in a new pair. </li><li>  To sew tapes, you can use dental floss or quilting floss. </li><li>  Follow the advice of your choreographer. </li><li>  Ribbons and shoes should be muted.  You should not use bright colors, otherwise the audience will look only at your pointe shoes. </li><li>  Do not use too soft "killed" pointe shoes.  Only experienced dancers with very strong legs can wear soft shoes. </li><li>  Never wet pointe shoes. <div class="photo" data-original="www.chickensmoothie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew ribbons to pointes" class="if uuid-2233153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2233153.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Each ballerina should know how to sew ribbons to pointe shoes.  This step is very important in preparation for the performance.  Tapes perform a very important function: they fix pointe shoes and protect the ballerina from possible injuries.  Therefore, take the process of preparing dance shoes very responsibly. </p>
