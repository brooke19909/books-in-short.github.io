There are not enough words to tell in colors about this grandiose building, this must be seen with my own eyes.  And when you are inside the cathedral, the surrounding beauty is simply breathtaking.  It is recommended to start exploring the sights of the Vatican from this temple. </p>

    <p>  St. Peter's Basilica is remarkable not only for its enormous size, but also for its huge number of masterpieces of art.  Each tourist is advised to get a guide in advance to consider all the sights and not to miss anything.  If you wish, you can climb under the dome of the basilica through a narrow staircase, only you have to pay for it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many just come to Rome for a few days.

    <h2>  The Sistine Chapel </h2><p>  This church is built in the shape of a rectangle.  Inside the chapel on the floor you can see beautiful mosaic patterns, and in the middle there is a partition made of marble. </p><p>  The walls of the church are made in the form of horizontal stripes that intersect with special frames.  Below you can see the beautiful draperies with the coat of arms of the Pope.  In the center are paintings by famous artists: Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Luca Signorelli, Pinturicchio, Botticelli, Cosimo Rosselli.  The last strip, located under the ceiling, is decorated with portraits of the first Roman popes, all of them thirty. </p><p>  <span>Michelangelo</span> 's stunning <span>paintings</span> are on the far walls of the church, as well as on the ceiling.  This famous creator spent several years creating such splendor; as a result, hundreds of square meters of ceiling were decorated.  It should be noted that the long and almost continuous work negatively affected the well-being of the artist, because he constantly inhaled the paint, and it penetrated into his lungs.  But the efforts of Michelangelo, no doubt, were worth it, because he literally transformed the church, and now tourists simply freeze with delight, looking at his masterpieces.  It is for this that many go to the Vatican.  Italy, whose sights are amazing, attracts tourists from all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today in the Sistine Chapel, secret meetings are held by the Pope. </p><h2>  St. Peter's Square </h2>

    <p>  It is the most magnificent Italian architectural ensemble that Bernini built.  From the square you can clearly see the famous Colonnade.  This is truly amazing.  It seems that the columns diverge to the sides, but at the same time they invite to the cathedral.  The illusion of movement is created thanks to the oval shape. </p><p>  In the middle of the square is a brown granite obelisk, its length is 42 meters.  He was brought from Egypt by order of Caligula.  It was back in the 1st century.  And only after a long time, in 1586, Sixtus V ordered to put him on the square.  Now it adorns the Vatican.  Sights, the photos of which you see, it is better to inspect slowly, so that nothing escapes the eye. </p><p>  But back to the obelisk.  At the top of the pillar is a ball of bronze.  There is an interesting version that inside it are the remains of Julius Caesar.  Among other things, the obelisk can be considered a kind of sundial, and markings on the ground also play their role. </p>
