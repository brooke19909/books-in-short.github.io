    <h2>  Land vehicles (except railway) </h2><p>  An insurance contract for land vehicles is intended to compensate for damage caused to the property interests of the insurer regarding actions related to land transport (excluding railways).  It allows you to compensate for financial losses associated with the repair, restoration or loss of a vehicle.  Depending on the degree of fault of the insured and the terms of the contract, a full or partial restoration of value can be made. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Railway transport </h2><p>  In those cases when it comes to financial protection of railway transport, as well as compensation for material damage caused by the collapse of cars, blockages and other emergencies, an insurance policy is required for railway transport.  It will allow to fully or partially compensate for material damage, and will also become an additional guarantee of the safety of railway transport. </p><h2>  Air vehicles </h2><p>  In order for the owner or tenant of the aircraft to receive material compensation in case of loss, damage or destruction of this <span>type of transport,</span> he will need an insurance policy for aircraft.  Depending on the wishes of the insured, the insurance policy may include both main (destruction, loss of the ship) and additional (damage, rescue services) items. </p><h2>  Water vehicles </h2><p>  The insurance policy for water vehicles (in other words, CASCO) is intended so that the owner of the vessel could receive compensation for the damage caused to his transport in the event of its collapse, destruction or other incidents.  It should be noted that when insuring water transport, the policy applies only to the vessel itself, without insurance of the cargo transported on it. </p><h2>  To ensure the safety of various goods </h2><p>  An insurance policy to ensure the safety of various goods (in other words, CARGO) is intended for those who are somehow connected with the transportation of goods.  Thus, if during the transportation of goods by one of the means of transport an event occurred that caused material damage to the owner (damage, loss, destruction of cargo), he has the right to receive compensation paid on the basis of an insurance contract. </p><h2>  Insurance in the agricultural sector (crop, livestock, crops) </h2><p>  Insurance in the agricultural sector, or agricultural insurance, is relevant in cases where the owner or tenant of farmland wants to protect themselves from the negative effects of various natural and climatic changes that can harm the crop or plantations.  Thus, he has the right to compensation (in the case of frost, avalanches, hail and other events that caused material damage) in the MAKS company.  The insurance company (whether it is Krasnodar or another city) will provide support on time. </p><h2>  Protection of property of legal entities (except for transport and agriculture) </h2>

    <h2>  Water Transport Protection </h2><p>  In those situations when it comes to water transport, its owners (tenants, users) need to conclude a civil liability insurance contract for owners of water vehicles.  Thanks to this policy, passengers and cargo owners can claim to receive material compensation for harm or damage caused to them.  This type of insurance is required. </p><h2>  For legal entities when using obviously dangerous objects </h2><p>  An insurance policy for legal entities using deliberately hazardous facilities is necessary for those enterprises or organizations that use equipment or technology that could harm the environment or people living in the area where these facilities operate.  These include mining, objects of the metallurgical industry, the use of <span>cranes,</span> boilers operating under high pressure, and other hazardous structures. </p><h2>  If services are not provided or if there is a shortage of goods </h2><p>  In cases where there is a risk that the goods or services necessary for the production or activity of the company may be delivered in an improper time or not in full, insurance against damage caused by failure to provide services or a shortage of goods is quite relevant (civil liability) .  In accordance with the terms of the contract, the policyholder will be able to compensate for the damage that was caused to him by the partner or supplier. </p><h2>  In case of harm to third parties (civil liability) </h2><p>  All legal entities that in one way or another caused harm to third parties are obliged to compensate it in full.  This is regulated by applicable law and is the main argument for concluding a civil liability insurance contract for harm to third parties.  Thus, upon the occurrence of an insured event, beneficiaries can receive partial or full compensation for damage in accordance with the terms of the contract concluded by the insurance company and the policyholder. </p><h2>  If the obligations of the contract are improperly performed or incomplete </h2><p>  An insurance policy to protect against improper or incomplete fulfillment of obligations under a contract <span>(civil liability)</span> can be either voluntary or mandatory.  For example, in cases when it comes to developers who are responsible for the timely delivery of objects, there is compulsory insurance.  As for situations where the policyholder is the beneficiary, then in this case voluntary insurance is implied, allowing the organization to protect itself from unnecessary losses. </p><h2>  Entrepreneur Risk Insurance </h2><p>  Any entrepreneurial activity, one way or another, is associated with risks - to a greater or lesser extent.  In order for legal entities to be able to receive compensation, they must draw up a business risk insurance contract.  One of the most striking examples of an insured event is a case of production downtime due to some natural phenomena.  For example, when all machines and equipment are turned off due to a power outage.  And in this case IC ‚ÄúMAX‚Äù will help.  Moscow, Krasnodar, other regions of Russia - experienced consultants are waiting for you everywhere. </p>

    <h2>  Financial risks </h2><p>  Financial risk insurance allows entrepreneurs and owners of large corporations to protect themselves in cases of sharp financial fluctuations.  Among other things, these may be the risks of non-repayment of funds or loans.  Thanks to this type of insurance, credit and banking organizations can protect themselves in cases where customers cannot pay the amount of debt, which means that the financial institution suffers losses.  MAKS insurance is a guarantee of reliability. </p><h2><br>  For employees of passenger traffic </h2><p>  One of the types of compulsory insurance is a policy for passenger transportation employees (civil liability) for causing any harm to passengers.  For example, if one of the passengers of public transport was harmed, he has the right to demand compensation from the carrier.  The contract of compulsory insurance is a kind of guarantee that the carrier will fulfill its obligations in respect of the victim and reimburse him for the damage caused. </p><h2>  MAKS (insurance company): reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, the longer a company exists in the services market, the more customers it has.  As for the "MAX" (insurance company), reviews of which leave grateful customers, then it is no exception.  There are a huge number of positive responses and words of gratitude from both individuals and legal entities addressed to her.  A huge number of citizens know that ‚ÄúMAX‚Äù is an insurance company, reviews of which are heard in various regions of the Russian Federation.  All of them tell that this organization is responsible for its obligations and always fulfills them. </p>
