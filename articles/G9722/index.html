    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Initially, the city was called Romanov-Borisoglebsky, and only after the revolution did it get its current name.  As for his first name, it came from the founder of the city, Prince Roman Vladimirovich, who decided to build his fortress on one of the banks of the Volga.  The construction took three years, and in 1283 the construction of Romanov was completed.  On the opposite side of the river was located Borisoglebskaya Sloboda, which for a long time was considered a separate province.  And only after 500 years, namely in 1822, they became one.  And in 1918 the city was renamed in honor of the deceased Red Armyman I.P. Tutaev.  During its existence, the city managed to incorporate many amazing traditions.  Museums and temples of Tutaev are so interesting and bewitching that they attract visitors from different parts of the country.  In addition, the city has a large number of parks, old streets and friendly people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  The first thing that distinguishes Tutaev's sights from interesting places in other cities is his museums.  Let them here and not as much as in other cities, but they have their own charm and style that distinguishes them from everyone else.  <em>‚ÄúBagel Museum‚Äù</em> should be visited first of all, because where else can you see more than three hundred varieties of sweets?  Products are made in the form of coins, nails, animals and even a sailboat.  The history of baking in Tutaev goes back to very old times.  Although many recipes have not been preserved to this day, bakers do not despair.  Each time they try to recreate the method by which they used to make such illustrious Romano-Borisoglebsky bagels.  <em>The Sheep Museum is</em> dedicated to the history of the Romanovsk breed of sheep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temples of tutaev" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/396064.jpg?1400063682188" width="500"></div>  If you believe the legend, it was Peter the Great who ordered the first sheep from Germany to be brought here.  The reason for this was the beautiful meadows of the province, on which fresh and juicy grass always grew.  The museum itself has incorporated many exhibits of lambs, which are made of a wide variety of materials.  They all look very beautiful and will definitely bring a lot of good viewing experience.  Romanov's forges were always famous for their products, but nails deserved special honor, since, according to legend, they were used in the construction of the ships of the tsar‚Äôs fleet.  Now the museum has in its arsenal more than one hundred varieties of nails.  In addition to them, there are many other products made by local blacksmiths.

Their diversity and beauty will not leave anyone indifferent, which once again proves that the sights of Tutaev may interest more than one category of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tutaev Resurrection Cathedral" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/396065.jpg?1400063625452" width="478"></div>

    <ul><li>  <em>Holy Cross Cathedral.</em>  The construction of this temple began from the time of Ivan the Terrible and lasted almost a century.  The cathedral is a delightful <span>architectural structure, the</span> walls of which are decorated with the faces of the princes Roman, Gleb and Boris. </li><li>  <em>Resurrection Cathedral.</em>  Tutaev should be grateful for this popularity among Orthodox pilgrims for this particular building, since in its size and design it has the right to compete with many cathedrals in Moscow and Yaroslavl.  It was erected in 1678 as one of the best structures of the Orthodox Church, to this day has retained all its grandeur and pristine beauty. </li><li>  <em>Church of the Intercession.</em>  It is one of the oldest buildings in the city.  It used to be a <span>man‚Äôs monastery</span> and only in 1771 received church status.  One of its features is the presence of the <span>icon of the Virgin</span> under the name "Addition of the mind." </li></ul><h2>  Parks and squares </h2><p>  The tranquility that prevails in parks and squares will help to relax well after a long walk around the city.  What other attractions of Tutaev can guests see?  <em>"Park of the Soviet period"</em> will take you back to the past, in the days of communism and order.  The territory of the park is decorated with sculptures of great leaders, pioneers and symbols of the past tense, all this will inspire a sense of a little nostalgia during a walk.  Another interesting place is the museum dedicated to retro cars. </p><p>  <em>"City Park"</em> is located in the heart of the city and for many years pleases its visitors with the sculpture "Girl with a Scarf".  There are several more sculptures here, but it is the figure of the girl that always attracts the eyes of passers-by. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Tutaev Yaroslavl region" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/396066.jpg?1400063598245" width="500"></div>
