    <h2>  Age of Loss </h2><p>  At the end of the XVII century, Russia was a fairly vast country, however, it did not have a significant impact on pan-European affairs.  This was due to both previous historical events and the inertia of the rulers.  Over the course of this century, our country has experienced many shocks.  The Time of Troubles, the intervention of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden, the loss of Western lands, popular uprisings, the culmination of which was the revolt of Stepan Razin.  As a result of all these events, Russia lost access to the sea, through which there was active trade, and was isolated. </p><p>  In addition, an important role was played by the fact that the rulers of this period: <span>Mikhail Fedorovich,</span> Alexei Mikhailovich, Fedor Alekseevich, Ivan Alekseevich - were weak in health and did not differ in state thinking.  The exception to this series was Sofya Alekseevna. </p>

He organized military games, studied tactics, several ships were built on the lake of the village of Kolomenskoye, which Peter proudly called the fleet.  As he grew older, he more and more clearly understood that Russia simply needed to have access to the warm shipping seas.  In this idea, he further strengthened by visiting the <span>White Sea</span> and Arkhangelsk - one <span>ice-free port</span> at the disposal of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Intelligence and cooperation with Europe </h2><p>  The struggle between Peter and Sophia ended in victory for the first.  Since 1689, he takes full power in his hands.  The king had a dilemma to which sea - the Black or Baltic - to try to get a way out.  In 1695 and 1696, he decided in battle to scout the forces opposing our country in the south.  The Azov campaigns showed that the forces available to Russia were definitely not enough to defeat the powerful Ottoman Empire and its loyal vassal - the Crimean Khanate. </p><p>  Peter did not despair and turned his attention to the north, to the Baltic.  Sweden dominated here, however, to engage in battle with one of the leading European countries of that time without allies was suicidal, therefore, in the period 1697-1698.  the king organized the Great Embassy in the countries of Europe.  During this time, he visited the most developed states of the continent, inviting specialists in military, engineering and shipbuilding to Russia.  Along the way, diplomats recognized the balance of power in Europe.  By this time, the division of the Spanish inheritance was brewing, and the north of Europe had little interest in the great powers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Nistadt Peace of 1721: The Origins of Victory </h2><p>  Taking advantage of this, the embassy concluded a series of agreements with the Commonwealth, Saxony and Denmark.  This alliance received the name of the Northern Union in history and aimed to undermine Sweden‚Äôs dominance in the Baltic region.  The war begins in 1700. </p><p>  The Swedish king acted very quickly and decisively.  In the same year, Swedish troops landed near Copenhagen and with powerful attacks forced the Danish king to make peace.  The next victim, Carl the Twelfth chose Russia.  As a result of the inept command and other circumstances, the Russian troops suffered a crushing defeat near Narva.  The Swedish king decided that Peter was no longer a rival to him, and concentrated his military operations on Saxony, where he achieved victory in 1706. </p><p>  Peter, however, did not become discouraged.  With quick, energetic measures, he creates, in fact, a new army based on recruiting sets, and practically updates the artillery park.  In parallel, the construction of the fleet was in progress.  After 1706, Russia fought one-on-one with Sweden.  And the king‚Äôs active actions yielded results.  Gradually, the initiative and the preponderance went over to the side of the Russian troops, which was secured by the victory in the Battle of Poltava, which led in the final to the conclusion that the Nishtadt peace was concluded with Sweden. </p><h2>  Russia becomes an empire </h2><p>  However, the war continued for another 12 years; Russia added marine victories to victories on land.  The Gangut battle of 1714 and the Grengam battle of 1720 secured the dominant role of the Russian fleet on the Baltic shores.  In view of Russia's clear advantage, the Swedish government has requested a truce.  The Nistadt peace was concluded several months later; it marked the complete victory of our country. </p><p>  The astonished England and France were amazed that, while they were engaged in Spanish affairs, such a powerful military-political force was formed in the east of the continent.  But they were forced to agree with this.  The conditions of the Nishtadt peace involved a change in the borders between the two states.  The territories of Livonia, Estonia, Ingermanland, as well as some regions of Karelia, went to Russia for eternal possession.  For these lands, Russia pledged to pay compensation to Sweden in the amount of 2 million rubles and return Finland.  The Senate proclaimed Peter the emperor, and Russia - the empire.  From this moment, our state becomes one of the countries - the arbiters of the destinies of Europe and the world. </p>
