Reviews contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  when you arrive at the hotel you will not be greeted with a friendly smile (communication with the staff is rather dry and cold); </li><li>  when you leave the room and pick up the electronic card, all electrical appliances are turned off (including the refrigerator); </li><li>  to get to the beach, you need to go through a busy roadway without a "zebra" and traffic lights; </li><li>  the hotel does not correspond to its four-star status (this is a maximum of "three"); </li><li>  even for those who rest on an all-inclusive basis, ice cream and a snack in the bar are paid; </li><li>  there are a lot of algae on the beach that nobody takes away; </li><li>  extremely inconvenient location (almost in an open field); </li><li>  despite the fact that the beach is far enough, the possibility of transfer is not provided; </li><li>  for guests who did not pay the all-inclusive system, sun loungers on the beach are paid (2 euros per day); </li><li>  not only hotel guests, but also outside tourists can relax on the beach, and therefore it is quite crowded here (especially on weekends); </li><li>  for the use of beach towels you need to leave a deposit of 10 euros; </li><li>  a small TV that is uncomfortable to watch from afar; </li><li>  noisy fridge; </li><li>  the shower curtain is too short, and therefore, during bathing, all the water flows to the floor. </li></ul><p>  Grand Platon Hotel 4 * is a good option for a budget holiday in Greece.  Cozy rooms and quality food make up for the inconvenient location. </p>
