Photos of this corner of the planet often appear in modern media.  What is the reason for this popularity?  The thing is that, according to experienced tourists, it is almost impossible to remain indifferent to the features and beauties of this state. </p><p>  Do you want to remember your vacation with pleasure throughout the year?  Try to visit as many places as possible. </p><p>  Experienced travelers, for example, argue that Petra in Jordan, whose photo is attached below, is just that corner of the planet that is worth visiting at least once in your life! </p><h2>  general information </h2>

    <p>  The capital of the state is Amman. </p><p>  Tourists visit this country mainly to enjoy the beaches and coral reefs of Aqaba Bay.  At first glance it’s hard to imagine that you can swim and sunbathe there at any time of the year. </p><p>  By the way, it should be noted that the <span>Dead Sea</span> (Jordan), a photo of which can be found both in travel prospectuses and in magazines devoted to beauty and health, is a place with healing power, and therefore there are many centers on its coast wanting to improve health.  And nature here is unique, which means that I want to capture it in order to remember the journey for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the geographical position of the country gives tourists and Christian pilgrims the opportunity to combine a visit to Jordan with a trip to Syria or Israel. </p><h2>  How to get to your destination? </h2>

    <p>  You can also get to Jordan in transit by making a transfer in another country.  For example, by <span>Turkish Airlines</span> via Istanbul. </p><p>  From Israel it is convenient to travel by land.  It takes three to four hours. </p><p>  UM Air and Royal Jordanian airlines can use the residents of Ukraine.  Their charter flights “Kiev - Amman” are carried out regularly, every week.  The flight to the destination takes only 3 hours, i.e.  it’s impossible to get tired on the way to a country like Jordan. </p><p>  Photos, as a rule, tourists begin to take already through the <span>porthole of an airplane.</span>  And this is not surprising, because even from above the country looks interesting and unusual. </p><p>  Buses run from Amman International Airport to the Jordanian capital every half hour.  Also outside the air gate building there is the opportunity to take a taxi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Local cuisine - a gourmet gift </h2>

    <p>  In order for the trip to go well, you should prepare for it in advance, having learned about what places you should go to in the first place. </p><p>  Of course, according to the majority, in such a stunning country like Jordan, whose photo has not disappeared from the pages of fashion magazines about trips and trips for several seasons, you definitely will not have to. </p><p>  Here you should definitely visit a tour of the fabulous Petra Gorge and rock cloisters. </p><p>  You can also relax on the beaches of the Dead Sea or go on a full day excursion to Amman and Jerash, which are holy places for Jordan. </p><p>  You should definitely make time and see with your own eyes the fabulously beautiful fortress of the crusaders Karak or the Wadi Rum desert.  Note that usually such excursions are carried out in the form of jeep safaris. </p><p>  For lovers of <span>scuba diving</span> there is the opportunity to visit the island of Pharaohs.  Such a trip not only allows you to ride on a beautiful ship and dive, but also provide a chance to have a delicious lunch on the deck and see the ancient Egyptian castle. </p><h2>  Wadi Rum Nature Reserve </h2><p>  This territory is of national importance and among the locals is lovingly called the <span>Moon Valley,</span> as it is a spectacular desert landscape. </p><p>  Its main attraction, of course, are the deserted sand wastelands themselves, which neither civilization nor time touched.  Everything is the same as many centuries ago. </p><p>  Wadi Rum is famous for its beautiful natural arches, wells, canyons and unique cliffs, which are not found all over the world.  This place is especially loved by tourists who prefer an active form of relaxation, are fond of climbing. </p><p>  Wadi Rum is also interesting for its history.  On some of its cliffs drawings are drawn that are already more than three thousand years old.  The stunning example of the architectural style that dominates this place many centuries ago can be considered the remains of the ruins of the ancient Nabatean temple. </p><p>  In the spring, after rains, the desert of the country actually takes on an unusual appearance.  Crowds of both local and foreign tourists rush here.  Rania Al-Abdullah herself, Queen of Jordan, comes there every year. </p><p>  A photo of this edge of eternal sand cannot but amaze the imagination of even experienced travelers: a huge area turns green and for some time turns into a beautiful endless thick meadow covered with various colors. </p><p>  Wadi Rum is best visited as one tour with arrivals in Petra, Dana and Aqaba. </p><h2>  Petra, Jordan: photos and description </h2><p>  It is the oldest city in the country.  Once it was the capital of the ancient Nabatean state, which arose in the 7th century BC. </p><p>  Most of the architectural structures of this place are located directly in the rocks and carved from red sandstone. </p><p>  In ancient times, it was a thriving village, which was built at the intersection of trade routes.  In the rocks were located not only necropolises, but also entire residential quarters. </p><p>  And outside, in the depths of the canyon, an entire amphitheater was built.  Historians and archaeologists believe that the first levels of the structure carved in the rock, like all buildings in Petra, were used for purely ritual purposes.  They were built by the Nabataeans before the arrival of the Romans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jordan photo" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/468336.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  Later, when the Tenth <span>Roman Legion was</span> located in these places <span>, the</span> amphitheater was expanded to several thousand places.  It was located in the lower city, which, like the upper rocky one, was decorated with various sculptures, frescoes and decorative carvings. </p><p>  Judging by them, one can imagine how densely populated, active and majestic the city of Petra (Jordan) was once, a photo of which it is simply impossible not to take. </p><p>  Nowadays, more than half a million tourists come here annually to see the sights of the ancient capital. </p>
