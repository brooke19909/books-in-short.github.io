    <p>  Vehicles today are an integral part of human life.  After all, with their help we get freedom and speed of movement.  But not everyone knows who invented the first car, and what was the history of this useful invention.  But the first cars looked very little like modern wonders of technology. </p><p>  <strong>The first car in the world</strong> </p><p>  It is believed that the first vehicle of this kind was created back in 1769.  The inventor was Nicola Joseph Cunio.  Of course, this was not the transport that we used to see.  Kunyo‚Äôs creation was a cross between a real car and a steam locomotive.  Yes, the engineer used the steam engine.  The speed of transport was not very impressive - only four kilometers per hour.  But it is also worth noting that the steam car was originally created with the aim of transporting <span>artillery pieces.</span> </p><p>  Subsequently, the first car for the transportation of passengers was created.  Such a machine could accommodate four people.  In those days, becoming the owner of a car was very, very prestigious.  But the creation of Kunyo had one significant drawback - the lack of a normal braking system.  Due to too frequent accidents on the road, the car was banned. </p><p>  <strong>The first car with a gasoline engine</strong> </p><p>  In fact, it is almost impossible to single out the person who created the first car on his own.  Indeed, for several tens or even hundreds of years, constant research has been conducted, the results of which made the appearance of the first machine possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, in 1885, <span>Gottlieb Daimler</span> patented the first gasoline-powered transport.  This engine was suitable for both cars and motorcycles and boats.  A few months later, the first <span>car</span> was patented <span>, the engine of</span> which worked exclusively on gasoline.  The author of this invention was <span>Karl Benz.</span>  Interestingly, the first cars had only three wheels - the fourth appeared later, in 1893. </p><p>  Since then, the automotive business has been constantly growing - new, improved models appeared, which were very popular.  By the way, the company achieved the greatest development before the <span>start of the First World War,</span> but during the war, this part of the industry began to fall apart. </p><p>  Interestingly, the first prototype of a modern car was a model called Mercedes, named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek, a co-owner of Daimler.  The first Mercedes in the world appeared in 1900. </p><p>  A new breath was given to the automotive industry in 1926 - it was then that the merger of Benz and Daimler firms took place.  This gave new opportunities and a new impetus to the development of plans and models.  Of course, a lot of time has passed since then, and the car manufacturing and selling business has not lost its relevance. </p><p>  <strong>The first Soviet car</strong> </p><p>  In fact, the history of automotive industry with the <span>Soviet Union is</span> not so well known and explored.  It is believed that the first samples of transport vehicles began to be assembled after the end of the First World War on the territory of the Russian-Baltic Plant.  But such work was not crowned with special successes - only 450 cars were produced. </p><p>  The first car, which then went into mass use, is GAZ-A.  By the way, this model was created under a license from Ford, but then it was finalized according to the requirements of the USSR.  A significant date for each motorist is December 6, 1932.  It was on this day that the first model left the container. </p><p>  Interestingly, the engine of such a car in hot weather could work perfectly even on kerosene.  Another unique difference is the tape <span>hand brake.</span>  For safety reasons, all the glasses were made in three layers, but the speed on the speedometer was noted with the help of numbers, and not the arrows more familiar to us. </p>
