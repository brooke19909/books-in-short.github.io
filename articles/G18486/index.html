In our article we want to talk about one of the hotels in Alanya - Grand Bayar Beach Hotel 4 *. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Grand Bayar Beach Hotel 4 * is a good four-star hotel, built on the Mediterranean coast, in the town of Alanya, in the Obagel region.  It is located just a hundred meters from its own sandy beach.  The hotel complex consists of one five-story building, built in 1996.  The last major overhaul was carried out in 2003. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558348.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a small territory and a total of 3000 square meters.  The nearest airport in Antalya is 110 kilometers away.  There is a bus stop just fifty meters away, which allows you to travel independently. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Grand Bayar Beach Hotel 4 * has at its disposal 50 standard rooms with sea views and 35 standard apartments with garden views, as well as five family rooms.  All rooms are equipped with a balcony, TV, minibar, shower, air conditioning.  Cots are available upon request.  Towels and bed linen are changed according to the schedule, three times a week.  The rooms are new and clean, as renovations were made not so long ago. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Food in the complex </h2><p>  Grand Bayar <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> offers the beloved All Inclusive system, like many hotels in Turkey.  The complex has an open restaurant for 250 visitors and one indoor restaurant for 150 guests.  There are also two bars on site offering tourists liquor and cocktails, ice cream and snacks. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Grand Bayar Beach Hotel (ex. Turkmen) 4 * has a beautiful pool and a comfortable relaxation area.  The hotel has a laundry service, there is a paid safe, a conference room, and a doctor is on duty.  The territory of the complex is not very large, it can rather be called compact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel ex turkmen 4" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558350.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Guests have access to a hammam, shops and a beauty salon.  The service is organized at a decent level and unobtrusive.  The staff speaks German, English and Russian.  Animation entertainments are held several times a week in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã(German and Russian). </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  Grand Bayar <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Alanya)</span> has a number of advantages, among which - excellent location and a good beach.  The hotel was built on the coast.  The hotel is only a road away from the beach.  However, crossing it is not very convenient, the traffic here is quite busy, and there is no traffic light.  But it doesn‚Äôt matter either, since an underpass is laid under the highway.  Passing it, you immediately find yourself on the coast.  The beach is equipped, as expected, with umbrellas and sun loungers.  Pebble and sandy beach is very convenient for relaxation. <strong></strong></p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Grand Bayar <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Turkey),</span> as we have already mentioned, is located in Alanya, which is a typical town of Antalya province.  The city has a strategically important location on the peninsula of the Mediterranean Sea, and therefore, since ancient times, was a fortified point of many empires (Ottoman, Byzantine, Roman).  Alanya acquired serious political significance in the Middle Ages.  It was at that time that the main attractions were built here: the Alanya fortress, Tersane, the Kyzyl-Kule tower. </p><p>  The wonderful Mediterranean climate, historical sights and natural beauties make the city very attractive for those vacationers who love the sea, but also do not want to be bored.  Since 1958, tourism has been the main source of income. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558353.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The coastal area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort is very open, with a minimum amount of greenery, not counting palm plantings.  It includes Konakli, Mahmutlar, Avsallar, Inzekum.  In general, the city is focused on poor tourists who prefer an economical vacation option.  It is for this reason that local hotels close in the winter, the territories of hotels are very small, and in the summer a lot of young people relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  The nearest international airport is in Antalya.  The road from it to Alanya is about 1.5-2 hours.  You can get there by bus.  In Alanya, the bus station is three kilometers from the center, and minibuses run around the city. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  Alanya can be safely called one of the most pleasant cities in Turkey.  Of course, this resort can not be compared with the bustling Istanbul, but here there are undeniable advantages.  It is not in vain that the city has gained such popularity among tourists.  In the vicinity of the resort you can admire the ancient ruins of the port of Aytap, Alara Khan, the town of Siedra, the village of Leartis.  The city‚Äôs business card can be called the famous <span>Cleopatra beach</span> and the Kyzyl-Kule tower.  The history of the beach is interesting.  Once, Marc-Anthony presented Cleopatra with a part of modern Turkey.  So, sand was transported to the Queen‚Äôs favorite beach from the north of Africa, since it does not contain dust at all.  Therefore, the water on the beach is never muddy.  The length of this piece of coast is about thirty kilometers.  This beach is definitely worth seeing. </p><p>  The list of objects required to be seen includes the Alanya fortress, which is considered the main historical attraction.  It is perfectly preserved and appears before vacationers in all its glory.  No less interesting can be considered the Kyzyl-Kule tower, located in the port of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4 alanya" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  No less interesting is the Alanya Museum (archaeological).  Since excavations are ongoing in Turkey, it is always replenished with new artifacts.  Among tourists, caves are very popular.  Excursions on them are incredibly entertaining.  One of them is located at the beginning of Cleopatra's beach, so it is easy to reach it on foot. </p><p>  Another widely visited place in the city is the Tersane shipyard, located near the Kyzyl-Kul tower.  In the evening, Tersane is blessed with numerous lights, which makes it look even more beautiful. </p><h2>  Grand Bayar Beach Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the complex, I want to discuss the reviews of guests who visited it.  Tourists note the excellent level of staff at Grand Bayar Beach <span>Hotel 4 * (Alanya).</span>  Workers are polite and friendly, helpful on any issue.  At the reception they serve quickly and efficiently, making out without delay and extorting money.  Maids are cleaned regularly and efficiently. </p><p>  The complex has a fairly modest size.  His apartments are also small, but kept clean.  Not so long ago, repairs were made at the Grand Bayar Beach Hotel 4 *.  Standard, as often happens, is the most popular category of rooms.  All plumbing is new and working properly.  Bathrooms are well equipped with no dirty smudges or mildew.  But the bathrooms themselves are very tiny. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4 turkey" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms are equipped with good furniture with comfortable beds and mattresses.  The windows in the apartment overlook the city, coast or pool.  When booking rooms, you should definitely indicate what type of room you want to get the room with.  Then when you check in there will be no unpleasant surprises.  You will be settled exactly where you wanted. </p><p>  The food in the Grand Bayar <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Turkey,</span> Alanya) is excellent.  The hotel offers the tourists the All Inclusive system.  Perhaps the buffet is not very sophisticated, but tourists are very pleased with the quantity and quality of food.  The restaurant serves lamb, chicken and beef meat dishes.  There are always a lot of appetizer salads on the tables, from the side dishes there are potatoes and pasta.  There are fruits, but their assortment is small.  Most often served watermelons and oranges.  But as for the sweet, the choice of desserts is simply royal. </p><p>  The hotel has a small pool for adults and a separate one for children.  Vacationers highly recommend visiting the massage parlor at the hotel, because it employs excellent specialists who know their job. </p><h2>  Beach holidays: reviews </h2><p>  The complex has its own beach, located a five-minute walk.  The road leads to it through an underpass under a busy road.  The hotel is built on the beach, only the highway separates it from the beach.  The coast itself is not very wide, but has a sandy coating.  But at the bottom at sea sometimes pebbles are found.  There is a bar on the beach, but it has nothing to do with the hotel, and therefore you will have to pay for all drinks ordered in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4 alanya" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the height of the season, an incredible number of vacationers are ashore, so sometimes it becomes a bit crowded.  However, this cannot be said to be a hotel flaw, since in this region all hotels have the same small sections of the beach.  Apparently, this is due to the initial planning of the territory during construction. </p><p>  In the evening, the hotel organizes recreational activities.  But more often, the administration takes everyone to a local disco.  In general, supporters of active nightlife remain very satisfied.  In addition, in the evenings you can make a promenade along the sea, admiring the beauty of the coast.  There is a market within walking distance of the complex, where tourists purchase fruits and souvenirs.  There is a bus stop near the hotel.  Alanya city center can be reached by bus in ten minutes.  In the city itself, tourists expect an incredible amount of attractions and entertainment. </p><p>  The hotel has representatives of travel agencies selling sightseeing trips.  But the prices for tours are quite high.  However, there are travel agencies near the hotel, all their trips are much cheaper. </p><p>  And yet, most of the tourists who visit Turkey for the first time prefer to travel to Alanya and explore its sights on their own.  The city is small, and therefore all the most interesting places are located next to each other, so you won‚Äôt have to walk a lot.  But if you are planning a jeep trip or a trip to the mountains, then you can‚Äôt do without a professional guide here.  Tourists highly recommend visiting boat trips, which are liked by both adults and children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4 turkey alanya" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558376.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, in the summer it is problematic to visit local attractions because of the heat, but in the fall and in May it is quite real.  Men are very fond of this type of entertainment, like lake or sea fishing.  Well, shopping lovers can visit textile and jewelry shopping centers.  The male half will certainly be interested in traveling along mountain rivers with waterfalls, a jeep safari and rafting, and exploring caves. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The Grand Bayar Beach Hotel 4 * is quite suitable for an economical vacation on the beautiful coast of Alanya, if you are not too demanding on infrastructure.  Rest in a complex located on the beach will be unforgettable for you.  The hotel fully corresponds to the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio, and therefore tourists with a limited budget or vacationers who do not want to overpay for additional benefits can consider it as an option.  Moreover, the complex is located in an excellent location and in your free time you can always walk along the sea. </p>
