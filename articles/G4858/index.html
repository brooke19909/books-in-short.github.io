    <h2>  Rules for finding a budget holiday </h2><p>  If you plan to independently organize for yourself a budget vacation at sea, then you should be guided by the following rules: </p><ol><li>  The first thing that will help to save money is the refusal to rest during the high season.  When planning a vacation, you should focus on the beginning or end of the season.  For domestic resorts, this is May, early June and September.  Firstly, at this time there is no such tangible heat, and secondly, the sea is warm.  And the prices are significantly different.  If swimming in the sea is not a matter of principle for you, and you are ready to relax by the pool and go on excursions, then in countries such as Bulgaria and Turkey, you can economically relax from October to April.  During this period, even the most luxurious hotels give significant discounts, so the rest becomes much more affordable.  Many complexes of foreign resorts have heated pools, which save the situation when the sea is cold. </li><li>  If you want to spend your vacation in Bulgaria and Turkey, then you should stop your choice not on half board, but on the beloved <span>All Inclusive</span> concept <span>.</span>  Initially, it may seem to you that you are overpaying the extra money, but in fact, the purchase of drinks and food will cost you much more. </li><li>  In order to organize the most budget vacation at sea abroad, you must purchase last-minute tours or use the early booking service. </li><li>  Do not forget that leisure alone is much more expensive than in a company. </li></ol><h2>  Sochi and Adler </h2><p>  Sochi and Adler - this is an obvious solution to a budget holiday at sea in Russia.  Tickets for the Moscow ‚Äì Adler plane are relatively inexpensive - from about 5,800 rubles.  In this direction, the Pobeda low-cost airline is still flying.  In this company, you can buy cheaper tickets - from a thousand rubles, but it should be borne in mind that they are quickly taken apart. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can rent a house in Sochi from $ 20 (1200 rubles), in Adler it is much cheaper - from $ 10 (600 rubles).  Eating at the resorts is possible in budget canteens. </p><p>  In Sochi, three-star hotels ‚ÄúWindrose‚Äù and ‚ÄúValentine‚Äù offer inexpensive rooms; the cost of a double room in them will cost 3,000 and 3,200 rubles per day.  For the resort, such prices can be considered quite affordable.  Both institutions have a good location - in the very center of the city. </p><p>  The two-star Nairi complex offers double rooms with a balcony for 2700 rubles.  The hotel has a sauna, bar, massage, pool and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget vacation at sea in Russia" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1935625.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fans of comfortable rooms and good service can recommend the four-star establishments Park Inn by Radisson and Zhemchuzhina, a stay in them per day will cost 4,600 and 5,200 rubles, respectively. </p><h2>  Accommodation in Adler </h2><p>  For those planning a budget vacation at sea in Russia, Adler may be an ideal option.  The resort has not only expensive hotels, but also quite budgetary establishments and even guesthouses.  The choice of housing is quite large.  Among the proven hotels, we can recommend the three-star Almira (3000 rubles) with excellent rooms and good service, the more expensive Vesna complex (5000 rubles), which has the most positive reviews and excellent infrastructure (pool, sauna, tennis courts, massage). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Accommodation in four-star Adler hotels will cost a little more.  "AS-Hotel" offers double apartments from three thousand rubles.  This is a fairly budget option, since in more famous institutions, rooms cost from seven thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Crimea </h2><p>  Speaking of budget holidays at sea with children, it is worth paying attention to the Crimea.  In 2017, the cost of a ticket from Moscow to Simferopol by plane will cost about 7,000 rubles, and in the fall and spring - even cheaper.  From Simferopol you can reach any resort on the peninsula. </p><p>  Budget food in Sudak, for example, will cost 200-300 rubles in the dining room (dinner, lunch, breakfast).  If you want to order food in restaurants, then the amount of food costs will increase to 500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget vacation at sea with children" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1935626.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most budgetary vacation at sea in Russia can only be subject to living in the private sector.  In Crimea, for example, you can choose to relax small villages - Olenevka, Nikolaevka, Storm.  In such places in guest houses you can find rooms even at three hundred rubles a day.  In larger and more famous resorts, prices are higher.  The minimum cost of living increases to 600 rubles per room.  The average cost of living in 2017 in the private sector starts from a thousand rubles for double apartments.  In general, the villages can be safely considered as a budget holiday on the Black Sea with children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for food, as a budget option, you can consider different eateries and dining rooms, national cafes, dining rooms at guest houses with home cooking, fast food establishments.  Remember that the more you move away from the coast, the lower the price of food.  In dining rooms and inexpensive cafes you can eat for two hundred rubles, and in an inexpensive restaurant for no less than 400 rubles.  More affordable food prices in small resort towns.  Accommodation and meals in Yalta will cost much more than in other places, although budget places can be found here. </p><h2>  Resorts of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov </h2><p>  Budget holidays on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov can be offered in the villages of Peresyp, Kuchugury and Ilyich.  These small villages have good sandy beaches and underdeveloped infrastructure.  Here you can find accommodation mainly in guest houses and the private sector. </p><p>  A little more expensive will be a stay in the village of Golubitskaya and Yeysk, which has pretty decent hotels, a promenade, a cafe and a park.  The village of Golubitskaya also has a well-developed infrastructure.  There is a night club, water rides, mini-hotels and <span>recreation centers.</span>  Renting a house in the village of Ilyich in 2017 will cost 1.5-3 thousand rubles, in Taman and Peresyp - up to 2.5 thousand rubles, and in the village of Golubitskaya - up to 6 thousand rubles.  Private accommodation costs an average of 250-600 rubles per day per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget vacation on the black sea" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1935627.jpg" width="600"></div>

For a wonderful month's rest, it‚Äôs enough to have $ 400-500 in your pocket (not counting the cost of the flight). </p><h2>  Goa (India) </h2><p>  Goa also belongs to the popular budget destinations.  Here with $ 100 you can relax and not deny yourself anything, especially if you decide to visit North Goa. </p><p>  Rest at the resort for Europeans is very cheap, especially away from cities.  The cost of vacation in Goa increases in the winter, because at this time the high season begins. </p><p>  For a budget holiday, you can recommend buying a ticket in the offseason, then a tour with a flight can cost from $ 400.  If you prefer to stay not in a hotel, but in a cheap guesthouse, you can save up to 30% of your budget.  Goa is popular among our compatriots due to its good tropical climate and the ability to relax almost all year round. </p><h2>  Abkhazia </h2><p>  Do not forget that a budget holiday at sea can be offered by Abkhazia.  Since it is located next to Russia, there is no need to spend money on an expensive flight.  Many tourists go to Abkhazia because of the opportunity to relax inexpensively on the Black Sea, especially since Russians do not need any additional documents (passports and visas).  And the road to the Abkhaz resorts does not take much time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most budget vacation at sea in Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1935635.jpg"></div>

But Portugal in August is comfortable for relaxing in every sense.  The water temperature on the Atlantic coast is +20 degrees, and the air temperature is + 25-27 degrees. </p><p>  Incredibly comfortable relaxing conditions on the island of Madeira.  In Portugal, there are many well-preserved historical monuments that will be of interest to tourists. </p><p>  Good for the August holidays and the Canary Islands.  At this time, the daytime temperature reaches +29 degrees, and the ocean warms up to +23 degrees. </p><p>  In August, most European resorts are not very comfortable for relaxing due to the heat, but at the same time the flow of tourists to them does not weaken.  Turkey, Greece, Spain and Cyprus are still popular.  Often, vacationers prefer to go to the more northern areas of the resorts: to Corfu, to Paphos, Rimini, etc. </p><p>  As for budget resorts on the Black Sea, in August Abkhazia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Sochi, Adler and villages on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov are still relevant.  At this time, prices at domestic resorts are not the most affordable, but you can find acceptable options. </p>
