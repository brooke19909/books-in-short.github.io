But it‚Äôs not enough to connect, it is necessary that the product comes out beautiful and durable.  Work begins with knitting the very first row, the so-called typesetting edge.  It can be performed in several ways.  Further work depends on the skill of the needlewoman. </p><h2>  Ways to work with thread </h2><p>  Each knitter works in her own manner.  And it cannot be said that everyone uses knitting needles and thread equally.  Someone prefers to have the spokes on top.  In this case, the brush is also located above the spoke and the canvas.  Other craftswomen choose a different method of work, holding the knitting needle like a pen, from the bottom.  In any case, all needlewomen work in such a way that you just start to smile. </p>

    <p>  Interesting ways to work with the thread.  If the needlewoman prefers the thread to be in her left hand, she uses the continental method of knitting, whereas if it is about the right hand, this type of work is called English. </p><p>  Masters of right-handed and left-handed people work differently.  They have different directions of knitting.  Some people prefer to turn the work from right to left, while others - from left to right.  One of the methods of knitting does not provide for turning the fabric at work.  The more experienced the needlewoman, the faster and more intricate the work is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Set with a long thread </h2><p>  Any knitting begins with a set of loops on the knitting needle.  Craftswomen use two main ways.  Some prefer to loop from a long thread, and others from a short thread, or from the beginning of a ball. </p><p>  To start a set of loops from a long thread, it must first be unwound from a ball.  Often needlewomen measure the length that they think is appropriate and perform the first loop.  The rest are knitted next.  As a rule, having completed the required number of loops, they find out that there remains a decent piece of already unnecessary thread.  It should either be trimmed or continue knitting, weaving it into the product.  It also happens that the unwound thread is not enough to complete the series.  In this case, the needlewoman has to dissolve the work and start all over again by unwinding a longer thread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cruciform set of loops" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34349/1032460.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  A set of loops is performed as follows.  The craftswoman takes one or two knitting needles, on which she draws the initial set of loops.  You can execute them in various ways.  In this case, the loops are fixed using the very long end of the thread.  The method is suitable for knitting from yarn of the same color, and for working with two colors. </p><h2>  Short thread set </h2><p>  Some craftswomen prefer to work differently.  They either use the end of the thread, not exceeding 10 centimeters, or work directly from the ball. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A <span>sliding knot</span> is made on the spoke <span>.</span>  He becomes the original loop.  The next one is knitted from this loop, which should also be returned to the knitting needle.  Now there are already two loops.  The rest are performed in a similar way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cross stitch set" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1032532.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <p>  Skilled craftswomen know many options for a set of loops.  They are performed on auxiliary threads, and on waste ones, and with the help of a contrasting color.  There is also a method in which, using a hook, a chain of air loops is preliminarily performed.  She becomes the basis of knitting products. </p><h2>  Ways to work with a long thread </h2><p>  In the vast majority of cases, needlewomen prefer to start knitting with the first method of looping - using a long thread.  It is basic and can be done in many ways.  Which option to prefer in this or that case, the craftswomen decide on their own or are guided by the recommendations for the product scheme. </p><p>  The completed patterned edge can turn out to be decorative, and elastic, and tough.  You can work with either one thread or two, three, and so on. </p>

    <p>  If the craftswoman can choose the desired set of loops, then the product will turn out beautiful, and its edges will be strong and elastic.  In the future, the thing will not lose its original form. </p><h2>  "Bulgarian Conception" </h2><p>  A cross-shaped set of stitches with knitting needles is one of the preferred options for knitting the edge of the product.  Also, this method is called the "Bulgarian Conception."  A cruciform set of loops is one of the oldest ways.  Apply it when you need to tie a product in which there is no elastic.  As a rule, the basic pattern for such things starts from the very edge.  Nevertheless, a cross-shaped set of loops with knitting needles is also suitable for knitting gum with a 2x2 rapport.  The edge of the thing will turn out original. </p><p>  A set of loops in a cruciform manner provides the product with a smooth, neat edge.  At the same time, the volumetric interweaving of the threads used is an additional element of decorating things.  If you want the edge of the product to be strong and keep its shape well, a double cross-shaped set of loops is suitable. </p><p>  A prerequisite for using this variant of the typesetting edge is that after it, needlewomen knit a number of purl stitches.  It is considered zero, that is, the initial row, from which work is being conducted. </p><p>  As a rule, one or two knitting needles are used to knit a cruciform set of needlewomen.  It depends on the thickness of the yarn.  It is important to make sure that the length of the main and additional threads is the same.  Only in this case the edge of the product will turn out to be excellent. </p><h2>  Dialing </h2><p>  Very many women prefer knitting to all types of needlework.  A cross-shaped set of loops allows you to create products that perfectly keep their shape and at the same time are performed without elastic.  The edge itself looks neat, and the resulting thickened edge also performs a decorative function. </p><p>  It is difficult to work with this type of set of loops, so it is used by skilled craftsmen with experience.  Nevertheless, having experimented a little, even a needlewoman with little experience will understand what a cross-shaped set of loops is.  A master class on this type of knitting is simple. </p><h2>  Master Class </h2><p>  First you need to take the thread and fold it in half.  Work begins in the usual way, as with the simple dialing method with a long thread.  It is placed in the left hand so that the end bends around the index finger and hangs freely from it. </p>

    <p>  The first loop also does not represent anything unusual - it is made in a classic way.  But then you need to change the position of the thread.  You should grab it with your thumb.  They need to move in a circle and counterclockwise. </p><p>  Then the needles are inserted under the formed double thread.  They should be on the inside of the job.  Next, you need to grab a single thread, which is located on the index finger.  After this, the second loop is pulled. </p><p>  And again, you need to change the position of the thread in the hand.  This time, the finger should move clockwise.  Now the needles are inserted from the outside.  They should be under the resulting double thread. </p><p>  Next, the craftswoman should grab the thread that turned out on the index finger and extend the third loop. </p><p>  A cross-shaped set of loops consists of alternating arrangements of the thread and methods for capturing it.  The main thing is that the craftswoman should not get confused in the process of work. </p>

    <p>  It should be remembered that when the needles are on the inside of the work, at the loops you can see the formed bulkhead located at the top.  In the same cases when the spokes are inserted from the outside of the product, the jumper is at the bottom.  If the needlewoman remembers this feature, then a cross-shaped set of loops with knitting needles can be performed without difficulty. </p><p>  After the resulting typesetting edge, you need to knit a number of <span>purl stitches.</span>  After that, you can start working directly on the pattern. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Using a cross-shaped set of loops with knitting needles, needlewomen make sure that the edge of their product looks neat and even.  It comes out beautiful and durable.  Performing such a set is not easy, but possible. </p>
