Fascinating with numerous interweaving patterns, lace masks can fulfill your dream.  They successfully emphasize the beauty of the eyes and makeup, as well as the fine lines of the face of the owner. </p><p>  The first lace face masks appeared in the XVI century and were used during ceremonial receptions.  Today, the number of cases when the mask will be appropriate is much greater.  Moreover, the models have become more original and intimate. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lace masks" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41000/1138899.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  When can I wear a face mask? </h2><p>  There are several cases for which an accessory has simply been created.  A lace face mask can be worn while not looking weird or funny at the following events: </p><ol><li>  <span>New Year.</span>  No explanation is even needed here.  Lace masks will be equally useful on corporate parties, during a home holiday with friends and family.  Such a mask can be a beautiful and stylish addition to an ordinary dress, sometimes it can become an independent element of the New Year's outfit.  For example, a white lace eye mask will perfectly complement the <span>costume of an angel,</span> and black will become a chic attribute to the appearance of a female cat.  And these are just examples, because there can be many options for using a mask in a Christmas outfit.  It all depends on your imagination! </li><li>  Special cases.  These may include birthdays, bachelorette parties, <span>costume parties.</span>  The only thing you can‚Äôt forget is that a lace mask will draw attention to yourself and, accordingly, to you.  Therefore, this option is not for modest and shy young ladies who prefer to stay in the shade and do not like to be the center of attention. </li><li>  Non-child games.  In combination with a transparent peignoir or beautiful linen with stockings, a lace mask will act magically on your beloved man.  Such a seemingly insignificant detail is able to diversify the sexual life of a couple and give both partners new emotions.  Remember: men love with their eyes.  Then why not give your beloved new spectacles? </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lace eye mask" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41000/1137260.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Looking for a dream ... </h2><p>  Suppose you have firmly decided for yourself that you need an accessory.  Now a logical question arises: "Where can I buy it?"  There can be several options: order in the online store, go through the boutiques of your city in search of the cherished cute little thing, or even make it yourself.  At the same time, the last option has a significant advantage - no young lady will definitely have such a mask.  In addition, it will be possible to decorate it based on your personal taste preferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a lace mask with your own hands? </h2><p>  It is not so difficult.  Even a high school student who does not have the skills of cutting and sewing can make a lace mask.  Experienced needlewomen every now and then lay out a variety of technologies for their manufacture: from the simplest to the most complex options, such as crocheted patterns.  Below we consider the two simplest options that do not require special skills in needlework.  At the same time, the models made according to these schemes will look very impressive. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself lace mask" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41000/1137261.jpg" width="333"></div></h2><h2>  Lace miracle </h2><p>  To make a mask, you need to take <span>ribbon lace.</span>  It can be found in specialized stores for needlework and sewing or ordered on the Internet.  In addition, you will need two satin ribbons for ties, a needle and thread for processing the contours of the product and scissors. </p><p>  Making such a mask will take only half an hour!  It is necessary to cut off a strip of lace of the required length and make almond-shaped cutouts for the eyes in it.  If necessary, process them with basting stitches.  After that, sew two ribbons to the finished mask, which will act as ties.  As they say, all ingenious is simple! </p><p>  The same manufacturing method can be reduced even more by choosing a beautiful thin lace, in which you will not need to make cuts for the eyes.  It‚Äôs enough to just sew the ribbon ties to the base, and the lace mask, created with your own hands, is ready for use. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lace face masks" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41000/1137270.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Drawn" openwork mask </h2><p>  A lace <span>mask with your own hands</span> can be not only cut or sewn, but also painted.  And the final result looks very impressive and is not inferior to analogues with lace. </p><p>  In order to make ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù fishnet masks, you will need: </p><ul><li>  tulle or clean cloth; </li><li>  food wrap; </li><li>  Scotch; </li><li>  Super glue; </li><li>  a sketch of a lace mask (one of the options for models in the photo); </li><li>  black dye for fabric in a tube; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  2 satin ribbons. </li></ul><p>  It is most convenient to draw a mask on a table without a tablecloth.  The sequence of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We put a sketch of the future mask on the table, cover it <span>with</span> cling <span>film</span> and fix it with tape so that nothing slips during operation. </li><li>  We put the tulle upstairs and begin to paint with the paint the contours of the future mask according to the sketch. </li><li>  After the work is completely dry (the time depends on the type of paint), we only need to cut out the mask and make cuts for the eyes. </li><li>  Glue satin ribbons for fastening to the finished mask.  Done! </li></ol><p>  As you can see, even an inexperienced needlewoman can make lace face masks.  The main thing is to arm yourself with inspiration and several tools at hand.  And the money saved can be spent on other purposes, because the cost of such masks is quite high.  Especially if they came from Venice itself. </p>
