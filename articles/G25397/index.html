Over the past couple of decades, many Russians even acquired their own housing here in order to return every year for several weeks, or even months, on the coast of the magnificent Adriatic Sea.  As for tourists from Russia, most of them opt for the western and central coastal cities: Budva, Tivat, Kotor, Herceg Novi, Bar, etc.  In the easternmost settlement of Montenegro - Ulcinj - Europeans often come.  However, there is a sufficient number of tourists from our country.  Be that as it may, Ulcinj boasts a huge number of hotels for every taste and budget, as well as magnificent nature, climate, unique architecture and the presence of historical attractions.  One of the best hotels in this region is Otrant Beach hotel 4 *.  Today we want to get to know this hotel more closely, to find out what tourists expect here, and also to figure out what impressions our compatriots left after relaxing in it. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="otrant 4" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/492688.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Location of the hotel complex "Otrant" 4 * </h2><p>  This hotel is conveniently located on the southeast coast of the <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> owned by Montenegro.  This area is famous for its healthy climate, a lot of exotic plants, the presence of rivers and lakes.  Hotel Otrant 4 * is located on the many kilometers clean sandy beach of the Great Plaza.  The city center of Ulcinj, famous for its unique architecture and magnificent fish restaurants, is only three kilometers away.  The hotel is 90 km from Tivat airport, 70 km from the airport of <span>the Montenegrin capital</span> - Podgorica.  Thus, the journey from the air harbor to the hotel complex will take about one and a half to two hours.  However, time on the road will fly by unnoticed, as you will get the opportunity to look at the magnificent beauties of Montenegro's nature.  Since this country has access to the sea, there is also a seaport.  It is located in the city of Bar, remote from Ulcinj at a distance of 25 kilometers.  From here you can take a ferry to Italian Bari. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Montenegro, Otrant <span>Beach 4 *:</span> hotel description </h2><p>  This hotel was built several decades ago.

    <h2>  Otrant 4 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  In general, it should be noted that this hotel was liked by most Russians who stayed in it during their vacation in Montenegro. </p><p>  So, as for the rooms, here experienced tourists recommend, if possible, to settle in the main building, and not in the villas.  The fact is that in the main building in all rooms there are balconies and there are no problems with humidity.  The villas are often damp, and you can often see insects in the room.  For the rest, the hotel guests were quite satisfied with the quality of the repair in the rooms, furniture and equipment.  The cleaning was also regular. </p><p>  There was also no particular disagreement on the issue of nutrition.  So, most travelers were satisfied with the variety and quality of their meals.  Of course, "all inclusive" in Montenegro is markedly different from the same system in Turkey or Egypt.  Therefore, people who rested only in these countries are sometimes a little disappointed.  But this is a feature of Montenegro, which should be taken for granted.  Also note that our compatriots recommend paying not "all inclusive", but half board in order to have lunch at one of the many restaurants in Ulcinj, where you can taste delicious local dishes at very reasonable prices. </p><p>  Travelers had no complaints about the staff of the Otrant 4 * hotel.  So, all the staff, from receptionists to receptionists and waiters and maids, were always very friendly, helpful and helpful.  In addition, the staff here mostly speaks Russian, so you certainly will not have problems with the language barrier. </p><p>  I liked the travelers and the animation in the hotel.  Moreover, family tourists were pleased with the fact that it is designed not only for adult guests, but also for children.  Therefore, no one was bored here. </p><p>  I liked our compatriots and the beach.  Especially appreciated by tourists who had previously rested in Budva, devoid of sandy beaches.  Especially the local beach was appreciated by parents with young children, as the entry into the water is very gentle, without stones.  Therefore, kids can absolutely safely splash around the shore.  Some adult tourists complained about the need to go more than 50 meters to a depth. </p><p>  Summing up, I want to say that our compatriots found the Otrant Hotel in Ulcinj (Montenegro) quite consistent with the declared four stars and their value.  Most tourists were quite happy with their stay here and do not exclude the possibility of returning here again.  In addition, they will be happy to recommend this hotel complex to their relatives and friends. </p>
