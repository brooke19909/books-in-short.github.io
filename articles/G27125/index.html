It is at this moment that it is worth pausing and giving the body time to "reboot".  Nothing invigorates a person, does not give a greater surge of energy, like relaxation.  The noise of the sea and the sun can make us feel carefree and independent of all problems.  An ideal option for such a vacation is Adler - one of the urban areas of Sochi.  Despite the colorful city and its cultural and entertainment program, first of all, the vacationer is interested in the conditions in which he will live.  Against the backdrop of a huge number of hotels, it is worth highlighting the guest house "Santa Barbara" in Adler.  With his incredibly beautiful appearance, he makes you fall in love with yourself at first sight. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Santa Barbara Guest House is very well located in relation to the main infrastructures.  If you go 10-12 minutes, you can see the beach, which is especially popular with both locals and vacationers.  The house is also located just a 10-minute walk from the train station in Adler.  The local beach is pebble.  Its length is about 15 km, which allows all tourists to comfortably swim, sunbathe and enjoy their vacation.
