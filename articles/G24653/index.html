The thermal resorts of this country have a wonderful climate and magnificent natural landscapes.  It should be noted that hydrotherapy in sunny Italy has been used since the days of the Roman Empire.  It was during these times that water therapy and visits to thermal spas were considered a characteristic feature of urban life, as well as a symbol of financial well-being. </p><p>  The proximity of many Italian thermal spas to major cultural centers of the country today has turned them into an ideal starting point for exploring the culture and history of this magnificent country.  The richness of the cold and hot sources of groundwater is explained by the geological structure of the <span>Apennine Peninsula.</span>  There are many volcanoes on its territory, and its bowels are cut by a network of underground canals. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Levico Terme" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1430506.jpg" width="600"></div>
