Circle a round object on cardboard and cut out the part.  This will be the basis of the product.  Punch holes along the edge of the circle with a hole punch.  The gaps between them should be no more than 0.5 centimeters.  The more often you make holes, the more magnificent and beautiful the crafts will turn out.  On colored paper, draw long rays (10-15 cm) in the form of sharp triangles and cut them out.  The number of these blanks should be equal to the number of holes.  With a sharp edge, pass each ray into the hole, bend the tip and glue it from the wrong side to the round base of the craft.  Put the figure under a heavy flat object.  If desired, the product can be painted with colored pencils or felt-tip pens: eyes, mouth, freckles.  Craft "Sun" done by hand.  Such a figure can be a <span>wall panel</span> or a Christmas-tree decoration, if you make a loop on it.  Also, such a product is an excellent toy that develops the motor skills of the baby's hands and allows him to study colors with interest.

Only here is yarn used to make beams.  It is cut into pieces of 8-10 centimeters.  Next, the strings are folded into bundles of 5-6 pieces.  These blanks are threaded into the holes and tied into knots.  If the yarn is uncomfortable to stick in the holes, then do this with a knitting hook.  To the base of the product, to the cardboard circle, you can use a scotch tape or hot glue to attach a wooden skewer or a cocktail tube.  Then the do-it-yourself ‚ÄúSun‚Äù hobby will become a wonderful attribute for a puppet theater. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a craft sun" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/367938.jpg" width="452"></div></h2><h2>  Disposable tableware as a material for creativity </h2><p>  In this part of the article, you will learn how to make the ‚ÄúSun‚Äù craft out of a paper plate.  In addition to her, such materials will be needed in the work: paper of yellow and orange colors, glue, accessories, ‚Äúeyes‚Äù or two buttons. </p><p>  We carry out the product according to the following description.  From colored paper we cut out rays of any shape.  They can be in the form of stripes, long triangles, waves and even palms.  Place the plate with the wrong side up.  On the base we fasten the beams close to each other.  <span>From paper cut out a</span> circle whose size corresponds to the diameter of the bottom.  Glue this part on top of the rays.  We turn the product over and paint its front side with paints.  We draw the details: bangs, nose, smile.  Glue the eyes-buttons.  Leave the craft to dry.  You can use this figure as an attribute of a carnival costume, pendant, wall decoration. </p><p>  From the article, you learned three ways of how to do the craft "Sun" with your own hands.  Offer these ideas to your children, and they will join the creative process with excitement and great pleasure. </p>
