Absolutely everyone wants to plunge into the atmosphere of this season.  There are various options for summer holidays.  Some choose trips to hot countries, for example, to Turkey, Egypt or Cyprus.  Others just leave for Europe.  However, many people remain in their homeland.  There can be many reasons, which is why in Russia there are many <span>recreation centers,</span> hotels, and rest houses.  But what to do to people who are not going to go there?  Visit beaches and places that are more or less nearby, since there are a lot of them on the territory of the Russian Federation.  Today I would like to talk about the "Flagship" (beach).  Mytishchi, where this resting place is located, is located near Moscow.  Therefore, it is loved by many tourists. </p>

    <p>  Follow these simple rules - and you will get the most out of your vacation and be safe.  But do not forget about other people who, like the rest, came to rest.  Do not loudly turn on your music, scream, litter on the beach, especially leave glass bottles that are dangerous objects in such a place.  Be polite with people, treat them the way you want to be treated.  Do not make a fire on the beach and think about the safety of those people who are with you. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flagship beach how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21254/646438.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  A great place where you can spend time with your loved ones and just friends is ‚ÄúFlagship‚Äù (beach).  The prices here are relatively small, there is a wide range of services, a large territory, a clean beach.  In addition, the beach is located near Moscow.  Having visited this place once, you will want to come here again and again.  No one will remain indifferent and will not forget time spent in nature, near the amazingly beautiful Pirogovsky reservoir.  This proves once again that without going somewhere abroad to the resorts, you can have a great time at home, relax and gain strength for future work.  After all, what we lack today is a time for rest, for knowing ourselves, for spending time with loved ones. </p>
