    <h2>  "White Sail", recreation center: reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the rest in the "White Sail" for the most part, of course, are the best. </p><ul><li>  On the territory of the base during the day soft soft music is played. </li><li>  There is a well-equipped beach with sun loungers and benches.  The beach has clean white sand. </li><li>  There is an opportunity to play beach volleyball. </li><li>  For small children, a bed with bed linen and a highchair are provided. </li><li>  The chefs cook perfectly, the food is very tasty. </li><li>  The territory reserved for the recreation center, although large, but very clean, is constantly cleaned here. </li><li>  Vacationers note that the houses have modern soft beds, clean linen. </li><li>  Tourists who come in a large company, especially like sports equipment rental. </li><li>  The guests really like the complex dinners in the cafe.  This is especially convenient for those tourists who came to relax for just one day. </li></ul><p>  Well, one review of the White Sail base is in a slightly different vein: unfortunately, satellite TV does not always catch in the woods.  In general, the guests have only the most positive impressions and the desire to come here again. </p>
