    <h2>  Useful information for guests </h2><p>  It will be useful for you to familiarize yourself with the following rules governing hotel accommodation: </p><ul><li>  check-out hours during which check-in and check-out are carried out are set at 14:00 and 12:00, respectively; </li><li>  Cots are available for 1000 rubles per day; </li><li>  extra beds for both adults and children also cost 1000 rubles; </li><li>  in this hotel you can stay with your pets, after specifying the conditions and cost of the service; </li><li>  You have the opportunity to use the terminal for non-cash payment of services. </li></ul><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Ideal for accommodation in Izhevsk - "Hotel-Park".  Reviews about this place contain the following positive comments: </p><ul><li>  the hotel has a very quiet and calm atmosphere; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel is located in a forested area, there is very clean, pleasant air; </li><li>  a large green area where you can walk; </li><li>  the room area is large enough and the layout is comfortable; </li><li>  due to the fact that breakfast lasts until noon, you can sleep in the morning; </li><li>  if the hotel has free rooms, then the guests are populated, without waiting for the checkout time; </li><li>  there are no public transport nearby; </li><li>  the price includes not only breakfast, but also a half-hour access to the pool (you can choose the time individually); </li><li>  great hearty breakfast; </li><li>  even if you leave very early, you will still be fed breakfast (or offered to bring lunch box with you). </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Rest in this institution is characterized by the following negative aspects: </p><ul><li>  reception staff are not very welcoming guests; </li><li>  the rooms are not very carefully cleaned, and therefore the smell of dust is felt; </li><li>  there are problems with the mixer in the bathroom (cold and hot water change dramatically); </li><li>  there are no special shelves for cosmetics in the bathroom; </li><li>  in the hallway there is a lack of hangers for outerwear (it is very inconvenient to constantly hide it in a closet); </li><li>  inconvenient location - it is possible to get only by taxi (or if you ordered a transfer); </li><li>  piles of building materials spoil the beautiful area around the hotel; </li><li>  there are no cafes or shops nearby; </li><li>  poor soundproofing in the rooms. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Park Hotel in Izhevsk is a luxurious establishment where every guest will feel like an important person.  Here, even standard rooms are characterized by a beautiful interior decorated in an intelligent classic style.  True, the equipment is not entirely thought out, since there are not enough shelves and hangers.  Breakfast is included in the price, as well as a half-hour visit to the pool (however, as guests say, this opportunity is not always possible).  It is impossible not to say about the most beautiful territory with a unique landscape design. <br><br>  As for the location of the hotel, this is both a virtue and a disadvantage.  The hotel is located in a forested area on the outskirts of the city.  There are no public transport stops, and therefore you can get here only by taxi or hotel car (for a fee).  Nevertheless, such a location gives you the opportunity to relax in silence and breathe in the fresh forest air.  And since outdoor recreation is always appetizing, you will certainly appreciate the fact that guests are provided with a rich breakfast. </p><p>  Thus, the Park-Hotel hotel (Izhevsk) is suitable for business people who want to relax in the lap of nature from the city bustle, as well as for tourists who wish to spend time in the fresh air. </p>
