In Russia, a funded pension system is progressing.  For her, you need to find a good pension fund that would allow you to calmly trust old-age savings for future storage.  Today we have to find out what the Social Fund is.  How happy is the organization with the population?  What rating does it have?  What are the pros and cons of this company? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is ZAO NPF Sotsium?  This company is a fund that provides the population of the Russian Federation with <span>pension insurance</span> services <span>.</span>  No more activities.  There is a corporation for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf society" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1529293.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first branch of the fund was opened in 1994.  In 2014, NPF Sotsium became a joint stock company.  The sole shareholder is Ingosstrakh.  The organization has many branches and offices throughout the country. </p><h2>  Distribution in Russia </h2><p>  Sotsium is a <span>non</span> - <span>state pension fund</span> that is known in Russia.  As already mentioned, the organization has many branches in the country.  In almost every locality in Russia, you can find a branch of the "Socium". </p><p>  This allows you to think about the integrity of the organization.  The thing is that NPF Socium receives positive reviews for its prevalence.  You can not be afraid that we are talking about some small fraudulent office.  But is this company really bona fide?  Is it worth investing here your money deferred for old age? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rating in Russia </h2><p>  Many have doubts.  And not just like that.  After all, NPF Sotsium is a pension fund that is far from a leading position in the ranking of the best pension insurance companies in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf society reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1529291.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This organization is located in the TOP-40 NPFs of the country.  The approximate position of "Social" - 36-38 place.  Too far from leadership.  Therefore, many potential investors are beginning to doubt further cooperation.  As a rule, the farther from the leading places in the ranking of Russian NPFs a corporation is located, the lower its credibility.  And the higher the likelihood of a sudden license revocation. </p><h2>  The trust </h2><p>  NPF reliability rating also plays an important role.  At "Socium" this indicator leaves much to be desired.  Today, the level of trust (reliability) is held at A +.  This component stands for High Reliability.  But he still does not suit the population. </p><p>  The thing is that the trust rating of NPFs, which is credible, is A ++.  It is to organizations with such a trust that potential investors are eyeing.  Given the fact that Socium has a low rating among similar pension funds, the assessment of A + reliability does not affect the interest of the population in the company in the best way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About service </h2><p>  Service at NPF Sotsium receives mixed opinions.  Some customers say that employees in the departments are conscientious, attentive and responsive.  They try to pay attention to each visitor, answer all questions asked. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf society personal account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1529287.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  At the same time, there are reviews indicating a negligent and sometimes even rude attitude of workers towards visitors to Socium.  Some employees are not professional.  And the speed of service leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  What to believe?  There are more negative reviews about NPF Socium.  But all of them are not confirmed by anything.  There are queues in the branches of the pension fund, which suggests the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa long service. </p><h2>  About personal account </h2><p>  The rest of the clients are given a variety of opportunities to work with the pension fund without much difficulty.  For example, NPF Sotsium has a Personal Account on the official website.  It allows you to receive account statements, as well as control cash.  Convenient, fast, reliable. </p><p>  Only often, customers talk about failures and other malfunctions when working with the "Personal Account" at "Socium".  Sometimes it is not possible to log in, in some cases it does not go out to order an extract from the personal account.  Failures occur frequently, which causes a lot of problems to customers.  They have to personally come to the offices of Socium to get information about the status of the account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF Reliability Rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1529288.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Payouts </h2><p>  NPF Sotsium receives negative reviews for payments to customers during periods of need.  There are also positive opinions, but they are much smaller.  Most often, you can see information about the fact that the payment of "Social" produces with huge delays.  Some have been unable to get their money for a long time.  NPF Socium is sometimes even accused of fraud and misappropriation of money to depositors.  All this is extremely common.  Among the confirmations of such a negative, only news about defrauded investors who go to rallies to attract the attention of the population can be distinguished. </p><p>  But among the numerous negatives, there are sometimes reviews indicating that NPF Socium makes payments in full and without any delay.  Someone is surprised at the negative reviews.  Therefore, it is difficult to say exactly how Social is a conscientious company. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  The thing is that NPF Sotsium is far from the best place to form the funded part of the pension.  The organization has a very dubious reputation, as well as a low rating for the country.  The level of reliability also leaves much to be desired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zao NPF society" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1529290.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, it is not worth calling Sotsium scammers.  The organization really is, it has been operating for a long time.  But with some flaws.  Almost all pension funds have them. </p><p>  It is recommended not to consider NPF Sotsium as a potential place to keep pensions in the forefront.  Reliability of the company is not different.  To date, the organization has a license, but given the regularly published negative reviews, it is likely that it will be recalled soon.  It is better to find a more reliable and stable corporation for the formation of the funded part of the pension in Russia.  There are a lot of them.  Socium is a good, but not very reliable and stable organization. </p>
