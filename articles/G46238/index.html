You will learn about this and not only by reading this fascinating article. </p><p>  Some of the most beautiful cities in Russia - Sochi and Kislovodsk - are famous for a large number of climatic and balneological resorts.  Both in the Krasnodar Territory and in the territory of the Caucasian Mineral Waters there are several dozen ski resorts.  Residents of these two tourist destinations have long dreamed of becoming closer to each other, because this is a great opportunity to diversify your leisure time and visit those places where you have never been before, expand your horizons and, in the end, improve your health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunnel Kislovodsk Sochi" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2157286.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of geography </h2><p>  Geographically, these cities are located close to each other when viewed from a bird's eye view.  If you go from one city to another by car, it will take about 11 hours.  The thing is that the route passes to the detour of the Caucasus mountains, so the path takes much longer than it might seem at first glance.  You might think that there is nothing to be done - Mother Nature has ordered it so!  However, humanity has long learned to overcome natural barriers, although it is sometimes difficult and even dangerous.  In pursuit of economic and ergonomic benefits, few are stopped by natural factors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Communists dreamed about it </h2><p>  The idea to bring the Krasnodar Territory and the <span>Caucasian Mineral Waters</span> closer came about a long time ago, back in the 60s of the last century.  Only now they began to translate it into reality relatively recently.  This project has been frozen several times: sometimes due to insufficient funding, sometimes due to insufficient elaboration of the project.  The main ground part of the route, connecting some cities, has long been built and even restored several times.  It remains to build quite a bit - we are talking about several tens of kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Who will drill the tunnels and who will sponsor </h2><p>  The construction of a new route involves drilling large layers of rock several tunnels in the mountains - this is the main inhibitory factor in the construction.  Indeed, if you look deeper, you can see how difficult work is in this direction: in order to build the Kislovodsk-Sochi tunnel in a certain area, you need to drill piles of stones and mountains.  The track has already been more than half completed, but construction has been suspended due to the fact that the path runs through a very high mountain in a seismically dangerous zone.  To <span>build a tunnel</span> between Kislovodsk and Sochi, the Russian government attracts various investors, including China.  In July 2017, one of the well-known Chinese construction companies took the initiative and proposed to do the most difficult work of this project.  As a result of negotiations, Russia agreed to mutually beneficial cooperation with China. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After consideration of the project by the government, it will become known how everything will be implemented.  So far, two options have been presented: with the help of public-private partnerships or completely at the expense of the budget of the Federation.  Let us now wait for what will come of it. </p>

    <h2>  Exact figures of the project "Tunnel Kislovodsk - Sochi" </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the exact numbers: according to the latest data from the media from April 2017, the route is planned to be opened by 2020.  It will, apparently, be paid, since a lot of finance has already been invested in it.  The planned total investment will be approximately 200 billion rubles.  It was previously said about 60-80 billion, but the budget has risen sharply.  Why so expensive, you ask?  The thing is in the tunnels - the bulk of the funds will go just for their construction and infrastructure equipment. </p><h2>  How much to pay </h2><p>  The fare on this short route will be about 1000 rubles per person.  The fare was calculated due to the fact that the traveler will save about 1,500 rubles on fuel.  As a result, everyone will remain in the black: both tourists and investors. </p><p>  The length of the Kislovodsk-Sochi highway will be 334 kilometers, which is almost two times shorter than the old highway.  Accordingly, the travel time from one point to another will be half as much and will be about 5 hours.  What will be the length of the Kislovodsk-Sochi tunnel?  It is planned to build two tunnels, each 12 kilometers long. </p>

    <h2>  Discussion of the tunnel project in Sochi through Kislovodsk </h2><p>  Many residents of both the one and the other land do not wait for the construction of this route, they are discussing this significant event in social networks in every possible way: someone does not believe that this route will be completed once, someone sincerely hopes that it will happen and they can easily overcome the path from the Caucasian Mineral Waters to the Krasnodar Territory and vice versa.  As mentioned above, both parties are very interested in this. </p>

    <p>  Very often, in news bulletins, residents can hear a description of the Kislovodsk-Sochi tunnel, but, as a rule, this is just a description when driving through a tunnel, this video is broadcast by private individuals either as a rally or to laugh at the corrupt Russian system .  Someone vehemently condemns that the construction of this project was entrusted to Chinese builders, some say that Russian builders do not know how to do anything, some are outraged that the money from our country will go to China, and some say that with From an economic point of view, this project is not entirely beneficial for Russia.  Everything, as usual: pessimists, optimists and neutrals. </p><p>  As for well-founded concerns: the route may run through the Biosphere Reserve and <span>Sochi National Park</span> - this is the main dilemma of ecologists and builders. </p>
