They talk, read the news, work and just relax.  The World Wide Web is recognized as the best way to disseminate information.  Sometimes here they try to ask for money.  Communities are being created on the Internet to help raise funds for those in need.  Someone just gives out his finances.  Next, we will talk about how to properly ask for money for certain needs on the World Wide Web.  What difficulties can you face?  How to avoid them?  Should I even use this method?  The answers to all this and not only are published below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thepennyhoarder.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Need money" class="if uuid-2496493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496493.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons for Begging </h2><p>  To ask people for money through the Internet in the modern world is not difficult.  The main thing is to remember that the success of ‚Äúbegging‚Äù depends on the whole on how the request is presented. </p><p>  Why do people ask for money?  The reasons may be different.  For example: </p><ul><li>  relative's illness; </li><li>  the need for urgent and costly assistance to children; </li><li>  job cuts; </li><li>  divorce; </li><li>  being a victim of a major theft of money; </li><li>  crisis in the country; </li><li>  bankruptcy of the bank in which the funds of the person were stored. </li></ul><p>  These are the main serious reasons why beggars appear on the Web (let's call them that).  Sometimes people ask for money on the World Wide Web: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  because laziness to work; </li><li>  for the purpose of fraud; </li><li>  due to inability to maintain a family budget. </li></ul><p>  Asking for money online is actually simple.  The main thing is that the reason is serious.  Then the chances of success will increase significantly.  Just so few give their hard-earned money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toughnickel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ask for money online" class="if uuid-2496495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496495.jpg"></div><h2>  Charity Online </h2><p>  It is hard to believe, but today quite a lot of foreigners are engaged in charity work.  Wealthy people give out money just like that.  This can be used. </p><p>  What to do?  You have to search the Web for famous rich people who give out money.  They can simply send offers with treasured transactions or publish data on social networks about their ‚Äútreasures‚Äù on social networks.  The last trick is used by the rich man from San Francisco.  He hides money in different places, then informs people about it and watches what is happening. </p><p>  Well-known rich people like Bill Gates also do charity work.  Usually they transfer money to various funds.  But you can try to write them in person.  It is possible that your story touches the rich man and he will donate part of his money for one or another need. </p><p>  Important: this technique is almost unrealistic in Russia.  This fact must be taken into account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to beg </h2><p>  Where to ask for money on the Internet for free?  There is no single answer to this question and it cannot be.  The World Wide Web is currently teeming with various resources.  And with their help, people are begging. </p><p>  Where can I ask for money on the Internet?  Here are the most popular methods for translating ideas into reality: </p><ul><li>  appeal to various funds (for example, charity); </li><li>  creating posts on social networks; </li><li>  leaving requests in a variety of thematic forums; </li><li>  Writing ads on electronic ad sites on the Web; </li><li>  use of e-mail newsletters; </li><li>  begging in messengers. </li></ul><p>  Today on the Web you can find not only sites and groups of charitable foundations, but also communities in which people just donate things and clothes.  Therefore, far from always, users have to engage in begging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rv-mo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Request for help" class="if uuid-2496497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496497.jpg"></div><h2>  Own website is the key to success </h2><p>  How to ask for money online?  If you think about it, this is not an easy task.  Indeed, many may not trust information from the World Wide Web.  Therefore, you have to thoroughly prepare. </p><p>  The user can create a separate site.  It is customary to indicate detailed information about yourself and a request for a money transfer on it.  The details on which transactions can be carried out are also indicated here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Usually this option is just help with virtual begging.  Users who have separate pages with requests are trusted more willingly.  Most often, users ask for funds through social networks. </p><h2>  What may be required </h2><p>  Everyone is able to ask people for money via the Internet.  But not always respond to requests.  More and more users ignore beggars.  There are reasons for that, but we'll talk about them later. </p><p>  Before doing virtual begging, a person will have to prepare.  Only in this way will it be possible to increase the chances of success. </p><p>  What is useful for the implementation of the task?  Ideally, this is: </p><ul><li>  a worked out (preferably heartbreaking) story, due to which the need for money arose; </li><li>  "live" profiles on social networks; </li><li>  details of accounts to which it is proposed to transfer money; </li><li>  site with a detailed history of the supplicant (recommended). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="checkadvanceoverdraftservice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="No money" class="if uuid-2496498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496498.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, scans and photographs of various documents will be useful.  For example: </p><ul><li>  medical report; </li><li>  passports </li><li>  court decision. </li></ul><p>  All that can prove and confirm the fact of real need is a trump card in the sleeve of the petitioner.  After all, it is possible that the funds are really needed. </p><h2>  Contact Details - Half Success </h2><p>  To ask the rich for money on the Internet, as practice shows, is problematic.  Especially in Russia.  Therefore, most often they ask for help from ordinary citizens.  As much as he can, he will allocate as much.  This is a fairly common occurrence. </p><p>  If you want to arouse trust in the audience, it is recommended to indicate the person‚Äôs contact details in messages and posts.  The more of them, the better.  The main thing is that the requestor can answer the contacts left.  And so that information about him can be easily verified. </p><p>  Posts and requests with a minimum of information about those in need of help are skeptical.  This is a normal occurrence.  After all, no one wants to be deceived.  For this reason, it is recommended to indicate in the messages: </p><ul><li>  F. I. O. person; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  registration (preferably); </li><li>  phone number; </li><li>  addresses of pages on social networks; </li><li>  Email </li></ul><p>  In this combination, the request will be perceived as real.  But this is not the key to success.  Whether the labors will bear fruit, no one knows.  It all depends on how much people trust the petitioner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wpstuffs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transferring money to other people" class="if uuid-2496494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496494.jpg"></div><h2>  How to write a story </h2><p>  We found out where to ask for money on the Internet.  Usually, users are begging through social networks and in charity groups.  These resources allow you to convey information to a larger audience of people. </p><p>  As already mentioned, in this case, the history of the occurrence of serious expenses plays a huge role.  The more detailed it will be painted, the higher the chances of success. </p><p>  The story needs to be worked out well.  You must be convincing and believable to describe the circumstances.  It is necessary to consider everything that can play into the hands of the supplicant.  For example, to describe a difficult childhood, because of which a girl married a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù person, just to escape from her parents' home.  Or long-term pregnancy planning, which ultimately turned into the birth of a sick child.  The main thing is not to lie. </p><p>  If the reason is invented (this also happens), you will first have to sit down and paint in detail a sentimental story on paper.  Only in this way can a person convince users of the credibility of the story, and even then not always.  As a rule, modern users do not even believe real stories if it is difficult to confirm them.  Say documents or other materials. </p><h2>  Long registration on the site </h2><p>  How to ask people for money on the Internet?  The next tip is a long stay on a particular virtual resource.  "Fresh" pages and accounts on forums / social networks may hint at fraud and deception. </p><p>  That is why begging users are better off using their old active pages.  If there are several profiles, indicate this in the ad. </p><p>  People recently registered on the site (if this is not a specialized resource for those in need) and asking for money from other residents of the service cause obvious distrust.  And this is quite normal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifecheating.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Make money online or ask" class="if uuid-2496496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496496.jpg"></div><h2>  Brief instruction </h2><p>  How to ask for money on the Internet?  We examined the main points that each user may encounter.  But how to act in order not to get confused? </p><p>  Suppose money is really necessary.  Then the preparation of a detailed story about what is happening will take a minimum of time.  This is a key point.  After all, if there is a narration of a real picture, the user will be able to convince the audience of his need. </p><p>  To successfully ask for money on the Internet, a person will have to: </p><ol><li>  Choose the resources on which the post will be published.  It is advisable not to neglect groups of <span>charitable foundations.</span>  It is recommended that you first come to the relevant organizations in person.  If he succeeds in convincing the fund of its difficult situation, it will itself begin to publish requests for help on the Web. </li><li>  Register on selected sites.  It is recommended to do this in advance.  And to choose for this social networks in which the user works constantly. </li><li>  To invent and write a story of what is happening.  The more details, the better. </li><li>  Be sure to indicate the exact amount of donations.  If money is needed for running expenses (life after a difficult divorce in the presence of a newborn child, for example), it is better to ask for help not only with money, but also with products / things. </li><li>  Indicate contact details. </li><li>  Attach photos of the supplicant and any evidence of need. </li><li>  Spread the announcement and wait for the result. </li></ol><p>  As practice shows, if you enlist the support of charitable organizations and <span>aid funds,</span> you can hope for success.  Especially if there is a need for an expensive treatment for a child.  People donate money to babies more and more. </p><h2>  Advantages of Admission </h2><p>  Begging on the Web has both pros and cons.  First, let's talk about the good.  We found out how to ask for money on the Internet.  Among the advantages of this technique are: </p><ul><li>  wide audience reach; </li><li>  You can enlist the support of charitable foundations; </li><li>  people will transfer as much money as they can; </li><li>  the ability to quickly raise funds for certain needs; </li><li>  donations are collected from strangers, for this it will not be a shame to relatives; </li><li>  providing assistance not only with money (for example, clothing, food, shoes). </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, everything is not as simple as it seems.  Begging on the Web is becoming more and more common.  Therefore, such a technique sometimes appears in a negative light. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iqreview.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Offer to help with money" class="if uuid-2496499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2496499.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  How to ask people for money on the Internet, figured out.  And with the positive aspects of this action, too. </p><p>  Why does this technique have disadvantages?  And which ones?  The negative aspects of begging on the Web include: </p><ul><li>  a huge number of beggars; </li><li>  lack of real reasons for help; </li><li>  growth in the number of scammers. </li></ul><p>  It is because of the last point that people do not always succeed.  Many simply condemn begging on the Web.  But if you confirm your difficult life circumstances, collecting money will be much easier. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Where to ask for money on the Internet for free?  The answer to this question was presented to our attention.  Now everyone knows how to cope with a similar task. </p><p>  We examined the key points of the process.  It is advisable not to ask for money without real need.  After all, fraud is a criminal offense.  And modern users can at any time "bite" the deceiver.  Anyone can ask for money on the Internet from foreigners or local residents! </p>
