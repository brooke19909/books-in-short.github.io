    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  As mentioned above, military leaders took over the leadership of the state.  They were called caliphs.  Hence the name of the state.  The most successful is considered to be Omar.  During his years in power, Islam and the <span>Arab caliphate</span> were widely developed in the surrounding territories.  The influence of religion under him spread to almost the entire Middle East.  Almost all the neighbors soon after the adoption of power by Omar learned what the caliphate is.  The definition directly indicates the nature of government.  As military leaders came to power, their territories were accordingly the main target.  So, under Omar, Egypt, Syria, and Palestine were conquered.  These lands used to belong to the Christian world.  The closest enemy of the state was Byzantium.  However, despite her former power, she also had to find out what the caliphate is.  Defining a strategy in the conquests for Omar did not seem complicated.  This was especially true of Byzantium.  The long war with the Persians, numerous internal contradictions seriously undermined its power.  This allowed Omar to select several territories and defeat the Byzantine army in a number of battles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Caliphate military achievements </h2><p>  In a sense, the warriors were doomed to luck in their campaigns.  First of all, army mobility should be noted.  It was provided at the expense of light cavalry, which had a significant advantage over the heavy cavalry and infantry of the enemies.  In addition, after the seizure of territories, the Arabs strictly observed the commandments of their religion.  They took property only from the rich, and the conquerors did not touch the poor.  This, of course, caused sympathy for them among the local population.  Arabs allowed religious freedom among the conquered peoples.  As for their own religion, the conversion to it was more of an economic nature.  After the conquest, the Arabs taxed the population.  Those who accepted their faith were freed from a significant part of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how was the Arab caliphate governed" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1059920.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <h2>  First internal contradictions </h2><p>  Most of the population perceived the invaders as liberators.  The conquered people as a whole had a positive idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the caliphate is.  The definition of invaders as liberators was also determined by the fact that the conquerors retained political independence of the people in a number of issues.  In the conquered territories, they created paramilitary settlements.  Arabs led a secluded life, being in their patriarchal-tribal world.  However, this state of affairs did not last so long.  Noble Arabs who lived in the rich cities of Syria and Egypt gradually adopted the habits of the local nobility.  This led to the first split in their society.  Adherents of traditions and patriarchal foundations could not come to terms with the behavior of those who decided to abandon the customs of their fathers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Schism in the nobility </h2><p>  The first collapse of the Arab caliphate occurred in 661.  The conflict between supporters of the new way of life and traditionalists tried to weaken Muhammad‚Äôs son-in-law, Ali.  But all his attempts were unsuccessful.  As a result, the conspirators of the traditionalist group killed Ali.  In his place came the emir of Mu'awiyah.  At that time in Syria he was the head of the Arab community.  Mu'awiyah immediately broke off relations with the supporters of traditionalism.  The Caliph Palace was moved to Damascus.  Over the next period, the state significantly expanded its borders. </p><h2>  Muavia activities </h2><p>  By the 8th century, the state subjugated North Africa.  In 771, attacks on European territories began.  The fact that in three years managed to capture the entire <span>Iberian Peninsula,</span> speaks of the strength that the Arab caliphate possessed.  The empire under Mu'awiyah achieved a power that history did not yet know.  The possessions of Macedon, Rome did not extend as widely as the state of the Umayyads.  Since the Arab caliphate was governed by the adherents of the new system, it finally lost its former patriarchal clan traits.  For example, before a religious leader was chosen by general suffrage.  Mu'awiyah established a hereditary transfer of the title.  The Caliph‚Äôs palace acquired secular features. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disintegration of the Arab caliphate" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1059921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tax system </h2><p>  Three main fees have been introduced.  Previously, tithing went to community income.  Now this tax went to the caliph's treasury.  Also, all residents were required to pay land tax.  The third gathering was jiziya.  Previously, this tax was levied only on non-Muslims living in the territory.  The collection was monitored by numerous officials.  The state itself was becoming more and more like the despotism of the ancient era. </p><h2>  Religious movements </h2><p>  During the Umayyad years, special attention was paid to the formation of a single state.  To do this, Arabic was introduced as the main language.  A key role in this period was assigned to the Qur'an.  He imagined a collection of sayings of the Prophet, which were recorded by his first disciples.  After Muhammad died, several additions were compiled with the help of which the book of the Sunnah was created.  On the basis of these two Talmuds, officials ruled.  The Qur'an identified the most important issues regarding the life of the population.  The people recognized this book unconditionally.  As for the Sunna, the attitude of religious communities towards it was different.  On this line, another split in society subsequently occurred. </p><h2>  Abbasids </h2><p>  The Umayyads held power for 90 years.  In 750, Abul-Abbas, considered a distant relative of Muhammad, destroyed the last caliph and all the heirs, declaring himself the head of state.  The Abbasids were a more solid dynasty than the Umayyads.  It lasted until 1055.  Abbas was from Mesopotamia.  He did not want to keep in touch with the Syrian rulers and moved the caliph's palace to Baghdad. </p><h2>  New system </h2><p>  The structure of the state under the Abbasids was in many ways similar to the Persian despots.  Under the caliph was the vizier - the first minister.  The whole state was divided into provinces led by emirs.  Each official was assigned a specific field of activity.  Under the Abbasids, the number of departments increased sharply.  At first, this contributed to the governance of a large country.  Mesopotamian influence affected one of the key economic sectors - agriculture.  Irrigation was widespread.  Officials from a special department had to control the construction of dams and canals, monitor the state of the entire system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heyday of the Arab caliphate" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1059922.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What are the achievements of the Arab caliphate? </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to say about the increased military power of the state.  The regular army consisted of 150 thousand people.  Among them were mercenaries from barbarian tribes.  The caliph also had his own guard.  Warriors were prepared for her from an early age.  By the end of his tenure in office, Abbas received the title of "Bloody" for his tough measures used to restore order in the conquered territories.  However, it was largely thanks to them that the Arab caliphate flourished.  First of all, the active development of agriculture should be noted.  This was facilitated by a consistent and thoughtful policy of the authorities.  The territory of the country was in different climatic conditions.  This made it possible to fully provide the country with the necessary products.  At the same time, much attention was paid to floriculture and gardening. </p><h2>  Inheritance </h2><p>  Speaking about what achievements the Arab caliphate is known for, one cannot fail to note the competent leadership of the Abbasid dynasty.  They managed to prevent excessive independence of emirs and other high-ranking officials.  In Europe, the land that was provided to the local nobility for service was almost always preserved in hereditary ownership.  Arabs in this matter adhered to the ancient Egyptian order.  All lands belonged to the head of state by law.  He was entitled to allot allotments for their service to his subjects.  However, after their death, the land again returned to the caliph.  Only he could decide whether to leave the inheritance to the heirs or not.  In the early Middle Ages, most conflicts arose because of the power that the counts and barons took away on the lands transferred to them by the king.  The ruler could only manage his own territories.  Some of the king's subjects possessed more extensive lands than he himself. </p><h2>  Trade </h2><p>  Under the Abbasids, the Arab world has become one of the key industrial centers.  Having conquered many nations that had ancient craft traditions, the conquerors enriched them and developed them.  In the Abbasid era, trade in high-quality steel began.  Damascus blades were very much appreciated in the West.  The Arabs not only fought, but also traded with the Christian world.  Brave merchants or small caravans went far west and north from the borders of the state.  Items that were made in the 9-10 centuries.  under the Abbasids, they were found even on the lands of Slavic and Germanic tribes, near the Baltic Sea.  Muslim rulers have long fought against Byzantium.  It was caused not only by the desire to seize new territories.  Byzantium had long established trade relations around the world.  Because of this, she was the main competitor to merchants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how was the Arab caliphate governed by haruna" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1059923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Public unrest </h2><p>  Despite prosperity, there has never been complete peace in the state.  The peoples of the conquered countries all the time sought to regain their independence.  They constantly revolted against the invaders.  In addition, the emirs in the provinces were dissatisfied.  They did not want to be dependent on the head of the country in all administrative matters.  The collapse of the Arab caliphate began almost immediately after its formation.  The Moors separated first.  These North African Arabs conquered the Pyrenees.  In the middle of the 10th century, the <span>Cordoba emirate</span> separated <span>.</span>  He officially secured his sovereignty.  The Moors managed to maintain their independence for quite some time.  Despite the wars with the Europeans, as well as the powerful attacks of the Reconquista, when almost all of Spain returned to the Christian world, until the middle of the 15th century there was a Moorish state in the Pyrenees.  As a result, it decreased to the Granada caliphate.  This small area around the Spanish city of the same name is considered the pearl of the Arab world.  It impresses with its splendor European neighbors. </p><h2>  Uprising in the eastern territories </h2><p>  They occurred from the second half of the 8th to the end of the 9th century.  The uprisings were predominantly national in nature and were directed against the rule of the Arabs.  The teachings of the Hurramites acted as an ideological shell.  They were also called Mazdakites, named after the Zoroastrian priest Mazdak.  The largest uprising occurred in the second half of the 8th century under al-Mahdi.  After the execution of Abu Muslim in 754, many preachers sought to become his heirs.  These, in particular, included Hashim ibn Hakim.  In the past, he was an associate of Abu Muslim.  Hashima was also called al-Muqannah.  He covered his face so that, as followers said, protect his companions from his radiance.  Opponents of Hashim said that he used a blanket to hide his ugly appearance.  Al-Mukanna was an old enemy of the Abbasid dynasty.  At one time, he was seized and imprisoned in a Baghdad prison, from where he escaped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the achievements of the Arab caliphate" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1059924.jpg" width="273"></div>

    <h2>  New fight for the throne </h2><p>  After the death of al-Mahdi, in 785, two sons claimed his place.  One - Musa al-Hadi, was the head of Dzhurjan, the second - Harun al-Rashid, ruled Azerbaijan and Armenia.  Each of the successors had its own administration and advisers.  Al-Mahdi, realizing that an <span>internecine war</span> could begin after his death <span>,</span> went to al-Hadi to persuade him to abandon the throne in favor of Harun.  However, he suddenly died on the road.  As a result, Musa took his place. </p><h2>  Change of power </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Harun voluntarily recognized the rule of al-Hadi, rumors appeared that he wanted to kill the caliph.  Then their mother Khayzuran intervened in the situation.  She believed that the Arab caliphate under Harun would be more developed.  As a result, she poisoned al-Hadi.  Over the years of his power, he managed to become famous as the culprit of the reprisal against the Alidian leaders in the Mecca region in 786.  This was probably one of the main reasons why Khayzuran decided that the country should not be in the state it was governed by.  The Arab Caliphate under Harun experienced the consolidation of the former and the formation of new ethnic communities.  With the second heir coming to power, Khayzuran gained enormous influence on the political life of the state.  She used this until the very last days. </p><h2>  Strengthening the monarchy </h2><p>  A policy aimed at strengthening central authority and the formation of statehood following the Sasanian example was begun under the Umayyads.  It was successfully continued by the Abbasids.  In fact, the country developed as it was governed.  The Arab Caliphate under Harun successfully implemented this policy.  Due to the fact that the Abbasids received power with the support of the Iranian military, the role of their ideology in the army and the state became dominant.  The main core was formed by Khorasan Persians.  They were adopted by the Abbasid family as "sons."  They managed to eliminate the constant pressure of the Arab-Bedouin forces on the caliph power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arabic caliphate empire" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1059925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Impact reduction </h2><p>  Since the mid-9th century, the collapse of the Abbasid monarchy has become irreversible.  North African provinces began to separate, followed by Central Asia.  Inside the <span>Arab world, the</span> confrontation between Shiites and Sunnis has intensified.  By the middle of the 10th century, the first captured Baghdad.  After this invasion, they for a long time became rulers of the remnants of the once powerful caliphate of Arabia.  Under their authority were also small territories in Mesopotamia.  From that moment, the Islamic world lost its unity.  In 1055, the state was conquered by the Seljuk Turks.  In the Middle East, the Saracens established themselves.  In the 11th century, they conquered Sicily, but subsequently they were replaced by the Normans.  Turks from their territories in Asia Minor went to Byzantine lands.  For several hundred years they were able to conquer the entire Balkan Peninsula.  Moreover, they severely oppressed the Slavic peoples who inhabited these territories.  In 1453, the Ottoman Empire completely captured Byzantium.  As a result, the city received a new name - Istanbul - and <span>became the capital of the</span> state. </p>
