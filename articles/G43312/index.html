    <p>  Comfortable slippers have always been very much appreciated.  Returning after a hard working day, I so want to dump the burden of worries.  Soft and comfortable things help us with this.  If you have a variety of flaps of material, drapes, pieces of leather and fur, then you can sew slippers with your own hands.  This item of home shoes will appeal to family members and will be a good gift for close friends. </p><p>  Let's look at the simplest slippers.  With their own hands, even someone who does not have sewing skills can make them.  We will need several pieces of felt, sharp scissors and only twenty minutes of free time.  To begin, we make a pattern using a sheet of paper or an old newspaper.  We take the insole of a suitable size and circle it with a marker.  We retreat two centimeters on each side and draw a second outline.  Cut out the detail of the sole. </p><p>  To construct the detail of the top, fold the sole in half and circle the toe.  Cut the resulting workpiece along and push it a few centimeters for a free fit.  Re-circle, adjusting the contours of the part, and add one and a half centimeters from each edge. </p><p>  From pieces of felt we cut out two details of the sole and the top in a mirror image.  Now you need to fix the top on the bottom workpiece.  Since we decided <span>not to use a</span> thread with a needle, we will use the simplest way to connect parts.  We take the top of the slipper and, stepping back one centimeter from the edge, make small slots.  We arrange them in the outer semicircle. </p><p>  Now we put the top blank on the sole.  We note the location of the sections.  Using small scissors, we cut the spikes in the shape of the letter "T" one centimeter high.  We add both parts.  We insert the spikes into the slots, firmly fixing the upper part on the sole.  Thus, you can make both men's slippers and children's.  If you want to decorate the finished product, use the finished thermal stickers or carefully cut the pattern on the upper part. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do you know how to make slippers with your own hands from knitted socks?  Very simple and fast.  <span>Knitwear</span> perfectly warms us in the cold season.  But the sole of your favorite socks is quickly worn away.  This renders the product unusable.  But you can breathe life into old, but very beloved socks.  To do this, just supplement them with the sole. </p><p>  We need a piece of felt, a bright satin thin ribbon, a thick needle and an awl.  We make a pattern of the sole and cut it out of the felt, adding one centimeter on each side.  We retreat from the 0.5-centimeter slices and make punctures with an awl at a small distance from each other.  Put the toe on the sole.  We connect the parts with a needle and ribbon, beautifully lining slippers around the edge. </p><p>  The top of the socks can simply be bent or rolled into a roller.  Decorate the finished product with a small bow made of satin ribbon in the tone of decoration or with fur bombs sewn to a bright lace. </p><p>  Having old bootlegs, gloves, and small pieces of leather, you can sew comfortable slippers with your own hands.  Leather is a universal, durable and beautiful material from which unique things are obtained.  Selecting multi-colored rags and pieces with different textures, you can create a single canvas.  It will be a good basis for blanks from which you sew leather slippers. </p><p>  How to make a pattern, you already know.  Will have to further strengthen the sole.  For this, not two details are cut out, but four, they are interlaced with thin foam rubber.  The sole looks like a sandwich.  The upper part can be made single.  The parts are fastened together with a thin leather cord threaded through pre-prepared holes. </p><p>  Choose any option you like to make home-made shoes and create.  Start work with the simplest products, gradually complicating your task.  So the necessary experience and skill will come.  Perhaps you will become the creator of exclusive models of shoes, and your name will go down in fashion history. </p>
