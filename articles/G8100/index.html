    <p>  Waterworld Crystal (Turkey) also has its own water park with numerous slides for adults and children: “black hole”, “cobra”, “space boat”, “alloy”, “flying boats”, “free fall”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Waterworld Crystal Resort Spa (Turkey, Belek, Bogazkent) is located on the coast, the distance to the sea does not exceed 100 meters.  The beach is 500 meters long.  The coast has a sand and pebble coating and is equipped with awnings and sun loungers. <strong></strong></p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Waterworld Crystal 5 * is located in the small village of Bogazkent, which is currently still a very young resort.  Not so long ago, new fashionable hotel complexes appeared on the local coast, which many tourists have already appreciated.  Rest here is preferred by those people who value peace, tranquility and comfort.  The resort is no less attractive for couples with children, as in Bogazkent there is a lot of entertainment for kids.  The resort has gained popularity due to the clear sea and beautiful beaches, surrounded by groves of cypress trees and pine forests.  But those who should not go to Bogazkent are those who do not think of relaxation without an active nightlife.  The young resort can not boast of a large number of night clubs.  Almost all entertainment is concentrated in the territories of the entertainment complexes themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel crystal waterworld" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2049016.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The sandy coast of the resort stretches for six kilometers.  It is distinguished by beautiful sand and clear water.  The local coast was chosen by carriage carriage turtles.  For this reason, the area is a national reserve. </p><p>  Bogazkent is a bird's paradise; 39 species of birds live in the resort.  During the year, another 1698 species of birds fly here.  Nature lovers will love it here.  If you want to see the sights, then you should go to the ruins of ancient Perge or Aspendos, the trip to the Manavgat waterfall is no less interesting.  Not far from Bogazkent is Belek, you can not only walk there, but also do some shopping. </p><h2>  Waterworld Crystal Reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  Tours at the Waterworld Crystal Resort Spa, although popular, hotel reviews are quite controversial.  The hotel has a very large and well-equipped, but not entirely clean territory.  But first things first. </p><p>  The number of rooms of the institution is quite good, although not all apartments are in equally good condition.  The room may be good, or maybe not.  All tourists note the poor quality of cleaning, or rather, its complete absence.  Maids come regularly, but they do not do wet cleaning.  Moreover, even tips do not save the situation.  Often, vacationers complain that they are settled in uncleaned apartments.  Noise isolation of rooms is practically absent.  Since many families with children have a rest, squeaks and screams are heard around.  In the afternoon, putting kids to sleep in such a noise is very difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal waterworld reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2049018.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Linen and towels are extremely rare.  Perhaps this is due to negligence of the staff itself, and perhaps this is the norm for the institution. </p><p>  As for food in the Waterworld Crystal (Belek), the reviews of tourists about it are also quite contradictory.  The main restaurant offers a wide range of dishes, but not all of them find delicious.  Mostly Turkish food predominates.  In addition, most dishes are very similar to each other.  In general, the food is quite good.  But the choice of food for children is small, there are practically no soups, and the rest of the dishes are quite sharp and salty.  The bars offer normal quality drinks and cocktails.  Hotel guests praise the desserts and pastries, which the chef makes just superb.  All the sweet tooth will surely enjoy the desserts. </p><p>  The hotel has a considerable selection of à la carte restaurants, but only one of them can be visited for free.  Which one is better is hard to say.  It all depends on your gastronomic tastes. </p><p>  The main restaurant lacks staff and this is very noticeable.  The waiters, with so many visitors, just can’t do the job.  Very often you can see a line of tourists or uncleaned dishes.  The hall of the institution is not very clean.  According to tourists, this service does not correspond to the status of the hotel.  Apparently, the administration saves on employees, and this despite the fact that the complex is very large and completely filled with people. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Waterworld Crystal makes a rather mixed impression among tourists.  Someone is satisfied, but most of the reviews are negative.  It seems that the institution consists of a network of contrasts.  On the one hand, the hotel has a large territory, and on the other, this territory is very elongated, and not along the coast.  In fact, only the side of the establishment faces the sea.  In exactly the same way, they are built along the territory and the building.  The complex has two large beautiful pools.  They are very beautiful and clean, swimming in them is a real pleasure.  Nearby are equipped recreation areas with sunbeds and awnings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal waterworld turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2049017.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the daytime, animation for adults is not very active.  Most of the events are held near the pool.  Very interesting water park, which is pretty good.  He works five hours a day.  In principle, this time is enough to get the hell out of it, but with a large hotel load, queues accumulate on each hill, so most of the time you just wait for your descent, which lasts much less than its expectation.  Children and adults enjoy the water park very much, because this amazingly interesting entertainment is just the thing for a beach holiday. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Crystal Waterward has its own beach.  The distance to it depends on how far you live from the coast.  We have already mentioned that the hulls are perpendicular to the shore.  The sandy beach is quite spacious.  It has sun loungers and awnings, which are enough for all guests.  However, the sand itself is very dirty; it is not sieved.  All the garbage left by tourists, as well as cigarette butts, simply remains on the coast.  For children who are always swarming in the sand, this is unacceptable.  Sunset at sea is gentle, but the bottom is rocky.  Pebbles, although not very large, but sharp.  Therefore, if you have not brought your shoes that are suitable in such cases, you will have to buy them.  There are enough shops within the hotel and beyond with such marine accessories.  Special shoes are indispensable.  Otherwise, the coast pleases with its beauty and warm sea. </p><h2>  Service facility </h2><p>  The hotel is family oriented.  And there really are a lot of kids in it.  However, not everything is provided for children here, especially food.  The hotel has a very nice mini-club, but unfortunately, there are no special events with children.  But the evening mini-disco is. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very different: from wonderful to not very nice people.  This is probably the reason for such a large number of shortcomings.  The administration of the institution, in pursuit of savings on employees, completely forgot about the decent level of service that any hotel should have, especially if five stars are on its signboard. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The Crystal Waterworld hotel complex has good potential and an excellent base, but not everything is as good with the service in this establishment.  In general, you can spend a good vacation here if you are ready to turn a blind eye to some points.  Not everyone will like the lack of cleaning, a rare change of linen and other nuances, especially when you come to rest with a child.  Of course, everyone wants to relax on vacation, and not fight with everyday problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal waterworld belek" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2049020.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is very conveniently located, so it is quite easy to get to it from the airport.  In addition, you can quickly get to a shopping trip or an excursion to Belek.  The institution, of course, has a number of advantages that are neutralized by a large number of misses in the work of the staff. </p>
