  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose broadcast digital receivers?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On-air digital receivers are another name for set-top boxes or tuners (sometimes the term ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù is used).  Recently, a lot of publications have appeared about these devices on the Internet.  This can be explained by the complete transition of all Russian television stations to digital broadcasting, which is due to take place this year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irvannu.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv receiver" class="if uuid-3167555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167555.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, precisely such devices are placed in electrical goods stores in the most prominent places, because today they are in great demand and can be ranked among the most popular goods.  Experts say that the quality of most of the digital terrestrial receivers available on the market meets the established requirements.  However, there are some nuances that should be remembered when going to the store in order to purchase a digital tuner for the TV.  A few recommendations on this subject will be given in this article. </p><h2>  Standard </h2><p>  For an on-air digital receiver to be used to watch twenty free television channels in Russia, you need to make sure that it is designed to receive a signal in dvb t2 format.  If the instructions for the device do not have this abbreviation, then it may be unsuitable for watching TV.  Also, it will not be superfluous to pay attention to the existence of a warranty period for the product you like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be taken into account the available opportunity to return the goods you do not like in a timely manner.  Currently, it is equal to two weeks from the date of purchase.  Therefore, it is best to check the purchased digital airtime receiver as quickly as possible, and if it does not meet your requirements, take it back to the store. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  It is worth considering whether you will need any additional functions of digital terrestrial receivers.  This can be a broadcast recording, a ‚Äútime shift‚Äù of a broadcast show, an electronic program, and so on.  If no additional options are required, then there is no need to overpay the extra money and buy expensive models with a set of functions that will never be needed.  Many experts agree that in the first place, attention should be paid to the quality of the resulting image and sound.  Indeed, this is what the main purpose of digital terrestrial consoles consists of. </p><h2>  Record </h2><p>  If you are a regular viewer of any television broadcasts, then the recording function of the ether to an external medium may come in handy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makemoneyoline3.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash card" class="if uuid-3167546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167546.jpg"></div><p>  Some digital terrestrial receivers have it.  Another ‚Äúplus‚Äù will be the ability to work the device offline, that is, with the TV turned off.  If the broadcast you are interested in is late at night, it is best to be able to record it offline (and therefore silent). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  The receiver of digital terrestrial channels, as a rule, has a connector for connecting type hdmi or RCA. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prefix connectors" class="if uuid-3167528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167528.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes on the rear panel of the device both of these "outputs" are present.  Using one of them and a connecting cable, a connection is made to the corresponding TV connector.  If the digital terrestrial receiver and TV have different "sockets", then an adapter is required.  As a rule, such a device can be found at any outlet specializing in electrical goods.  In large stores, an assortment of several models from different manufacturers is presented. </p><p>  If we are talking about connecting an old Soviet TV to the digital airtime, then for this purpose we need another adapter, which is called an RF modulator, it converts the signal received from the ‚Äútulip‚Äù or hdmi to the one required for the antenna ‚Äúinput‚Äù of the Soviet TV . </p><p>  In addition to connecting to a TV, you will also need to connect a digital terrestrial receiver with an antenna capable of receiving a signal in the decimeter range.  Such devices are not very rare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rainbowflag.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tv antenna" class="if uuid-3167542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3167542.jpg"></div><p>  Sound can be output through the TV‚Äôs built-in speakers or fed to the ‚Äúinput‚Äù of the audio system using two component cables with RCA connectors. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  When the tuner is connected, it remains only to configure it to receive television channels.  This process is excellent in automatic mode. </p><h2>  Models </h2><p>  In stores, as already mentioned, there is no shortage of digital terrestrial receivers.  Globo is one of the models to pay attention to.  The robust metal case of this device hides electronics that can produce uninterrupted channel display, as well as playback of some media files. </p><p>  There are many other worthy models that will provide you with a wonderful holiday by the TV. </p>
