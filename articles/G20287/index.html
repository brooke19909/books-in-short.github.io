I would like to come back here to wander the streets of Tbilisi, go skiing from the mountains, and visit the Wine Festival in Kakheti.  Moving along the Georgian Military Highway, you need to stop to see the country's pearl - the Zhinvali Reservoir. </p><h2>  Zhinvali hydroelectric station </h2><p>  The reservoir was created artificially after the Zhinvali Hydroelectric Power Station was built on the Aragvi River in 1985.  The reservoir serves as a source of drinking water and electricity for the capital.  The distance from the dam to Tbilisi is 40 km. </p>

    <p>  The dam of the station is a bulk pebble structure, whose height is 102 meters and a length of 415 meters.  Zhinvali reservoir was formed as a result of the fact that a mountain river was blocked.  It holds 520 million cubic meters of water.  The building of the power plant is underground, it has 4 hydroelectric units that generate 484 million kW / h of electricity per year.  The hydroelectric station also supplies water to Mtskheta, Rustavi and surrounding areas.  The volume of water in the reservoir allows irrigation of land in the gorge of the Iori River. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Zhinvali Reservoir: A History of a Flooded City </h2><p>  Zhinvali reservoir was built on the site of the village center Zhinvali, which included 18 villages.  At the time of <span>Queen Tamara,</span> who ruled in the XII century, it was a large Georgian city.  Archaeological excavations testified that even in the Neolithic era, the territory was densely populated.  After the decision was made in 1971 to build a hydroelectric complex on the Aragvi River, a scientific expedition was organized to finish excavations at the site of the future lake.  However, these works could not be completed; many historical and cultural monuments were under water. </p>

    <p>  In the Middle Ages, Zhinvali was at the crossroads of trade routes.  The city had many temples, palaces, residential quarters, good transport infrastructure.  Excavations indicate that many artisans, talented artists and architects lived there.  At the site of the ancient settlement, 17 coins were discovered during the reign of Queen Tamara.  Prior to this, only two findings were known, one of which was in the historical museum in England, and the second in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  After flooding, the entire ancient city was under water.  Scientists have not been able to explore 7 or 8 places of worship.  Valuable historical documents, weapons, gold items, church icons remained under water.  The <span>city</span> gates, which were considered a unique work of art, and the temple of the veneration of the Holy Cross, built in the XII century, were <span>flooded</span> .  When there is a drain in the reservoir, part of the temple becomes visible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Zhinvali pond - a landmark of Georgia </h2><p>  Zhinvali reservoir - a very beautiful place on the highway.  From the view that opens from any of its sites, breathtaking.  The lake is surrounded by <span>mountains</span> on all sides <span>.</span>  <span>The mountains</span> around the reservoir are covered with deciduous and pine forests.  Among the trees, beech, several types of oak, chestnut, yew, and ordinary pine prevail; there are areas with juniper groves.  The shape of the shape of the reservoir resembles a shamrock.  The water in the lake is very clean, saturated with useful minerals, has a bright turquoise color, so residents of Tbilisi can only be envied. </p>

    <p>  The first place to stop on the road from Tbilisi to Kakheti is the Zhinvali Reservoir (Georgia). <strong> </strong>  Further along the highway are Mtskheta - the capital of Georgia during the Middle Ages, numerous temples and monasteries, signal and watch towers and Ananuri fortress.  In some places, a section of the route hangs over the abyss, bridges were built to cross the rivers. </p><h2>  Ananuri Castle - a landmark of the Georgian Military Highway </h2><p>  Picturesque Zhinvali reservoir (see photo in the review) - <strong> </strong>  one of those places that tourists love.  Next to it is Ananuri Castle.  It was built in the era of early feudalism, in the XVII century, at the confluence of the rivers Vedzathevi and Aragvi and served as a reliable defensive structure that blocked the road from the <span>Darial gorge.</span>  For a long time, the castle was the residence of the Aragva eristavs - representatives of the Georgian nobility, who ranked third after the tsar and princely persons. </p>

    <p>  The upper part of the castle is well preserved to this day.  Two large towers and a number of small ones were built here.  All buildings are surrounded by a fortified wall.  One tower has a circular shape, currently there are no ceilings.  In a large square tower, not only the floors, but also the steps have been preserved.  At the end of the XVII century, the Assumption Church was built on the territory of the fortress, which is an architectural monument and is protected by UNESCO.  The temple has a classic shape and a dome decorated with bunches of grapes and a cross.  Inside, individual pieces of frescoes and wall paintings have been preserved. </p><p>  A small piece of the old Georgian Military Highway and Ananur Bridge, abandoned after the construction of a new highway, pass by the castle.  The old site was in the flood zone, but when the water falls, part of it appears from under the water. </p><h2>  How to get to the reservoir </h2><p>  Ananuri fortress and Zhinvali reservoir are located on the Georgian Military Highway.  How to get from Tbilisi if a tourist makes an individual trip?  It is most convenient to use a car, but since the track has very difficult descents and ascents and sharp turns over the precipice, it is better to trust local drivers who know all sections of the road well.  In addition to the car, you can get to the destination by bus or minibus.  They walk in 10 minutes.  Travel documents must be bought in the direction of Gudauri or Stepantsminda.  You can also choose the direction to Pasanauri. </p>
