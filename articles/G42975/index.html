    <h2>  Prestigious offers </h2><p>  In the capital there are unique places that are famous not only for their beauty, but also for healing factors.  Well-equipped, with developed infrastructure, such motels in Moscow are successful among the government of the capital and their family members.  And the first would like to call the health resort "Lake White". </p><p>  It is surrounded by a luxurious forest, birch and pine.  But the main thing is the lake itself, which gave the name to the hospital.  Sanatoriums of the Moscow City Hall are highly comfortable, but a miracle of nature of this magnitude is only here. </p><p>  This reservoir was formed by karst residues, but the bottom goes downhill very smoothly, and its surface is flat.  The coast is covered with fine sand.  On the well-groomed territory there are two comfortable buildings and a cottage town.  The cost of accommodation starts at 2100 rubles per day, including meals.  Reviews suggest that accommodation takes place in superior rooms, in which everyone will feel at home.  The staff is attentive and polite, and all this despite the affordable prices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Gagra is especially loved by our compatriots, therefore it is better to book vouchers in advance.  Outside the building is difficult to see, it is covered with trees.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6.3 hectares in the park area.  So, you are waiting for walks through the shady alleys, clean air and evenings in the gazebos.

There are rooms for one, two or three tourists.  Each of them is equipped with beds and cots for extra bed, bedside tables and household appliances.  Room cleaning is available upon request, and linen is changed every five days.  Judging by the reviews, this is one of the most comfortable resorts with magnificent territory for walking.

For an economical vacation, you can choose the spring and autumn months. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  In Moscow and Moscow region, a huge number of excellent resorts equipped with the latest technology.  If it‚Äôs about vacation, and you feel that the body is thoroughly exhausted, then be sure to think about spending time on the basis of one of them.  This is a great way to prevent disease, as well as cure existing ones.  In addition, at <span>the recreation center</span> there is time to just breathe air, walk in the shade of trees, read books.  That is, to do what is so lacking in everyday life. </p>
