They are called Ruskeale Falls.  Each of them is beautiful and unique in its own way. </p><h2>  Ahvensky </h2><p>  Perhaps the most famous waterfall in the area.  After all, there were filming two famous films.  In the 70s of the last century, the film crew of the film ‚ÄúThe Dawns Here Are Quiet‚Äù worked here, reconstructing the tragic events of the Great Patriotic War.  And at the beginning of our century (2005), the filming of the mystical film "The Dark World" took place, the plot of which is built around the existence of a parallel civilization.  Until now, a model of the hut has been preserved on the river bank, near which the beginning of the film was shot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruskeala waterfalls" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1117034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The waterfall is located in the Tohmajoki channel (translated from Finnish as "mad"), a picturesque and winding river that flows from Lake Ruokoy√§rvi and flows forty kilometers into Lake Ladoga.  This is one of its largest tributaries. </p><p>  The name of the waterfall can be translated from Finnish as ‚Äúperch threshold‚Äù, and local residents often call it ‚Äúat three bridges‚Äù, since the river crosses the highway three times in this place.  The river is a place of pilgrimage for many extreme rafting men, and the most desperate of them risk crossing the river Akhvensky, whose drops reach 3-4 m. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The color of the waterfall is interesting - brownish, of different shades.  This is due to iron compounds and organics contained in river water from nearby swamps.  A decent ‚Äúpadon‚Äù formed in the place where the waterfall fell ‚Äî a notch washed by a rapid stream of water.  Further depth decreases.  The waterfall, despite the fact that the main course of the river freezes back in December, exists until January-February, slightly reducing its full flow. </p><p>  Ahwenski is a waterfall that has long been chosen by tourists.  There is a convenient access to it, and therefore on the shore you can find the amenities of civilization - awnings, gazebos, a toilet, equipped <span>fire places,</span> benches.  In a nearby cafe you can enjoy hot tea and a bite to eat. </p><h2>  Ryumyakoski </h2><p>  The second most beautiful waterfall in the Tohmajoki channel is Ryumakoski.  Despite the bad wetlands in some places, it is well worth seeing.  The waterfall flows into a small lake with high rocky shores.  Standing on such a shore, you can admire the roaring water for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruskeala waterfalls how to get" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1117031.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is one of the places of pilgrimage for extreme tourists, like other Ruskeal falls.  How to get to it by car if the road is very boggy?  The answer is obvious - only on foot.  For the unique beauty and form, the swimmers gave this place the romantic name ‚Äúcharm of roses‚Äù.

The photo is impressive.  After all, this <span>is the highest waterfall</span> in Karelia.  The falling stream of water from a height of nineteen meters remains the cleanest and most untouched of the four due to its inaccessibility.  Its second name is the White Bridge.  It is connected with the Finnish road passing earlier over the river.  It is located ten kilometers from the village of Leppasilt.  The waterfall is located in the Kulismayoki channel, next to it you can see the remains of a <span>stone bridge.</span>  It reaches its peak in spring - at the beginning of summer. </p><h2>  Kivach </h2><p>  Kivach, which means ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù, is in fact the most powerful waterfall in Karelia and the third largest in lowland Europe.  The water of the Suna River flows in two main ledges from a height of 11 meters.  Moreover, the total length of the cascades of the river reaches two hundred meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruskeala waterfalls photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1117040.jpg" width="500"></div>  The channel of the waterfall is divided by a rock massif into two unequal flows - one more, the other less.

After the construction of a group of hydroelectric power stations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe waterfall, the flow somewhat decreased. </p><p>  But not the only <span>sights of Karelia</span> are Ruskeal falls.  <span>Marble Canyon is</span> also attractive for tourists. </p>

    <p>  It is created by nature and human economic activity.  From here, a lot of different marbles were supplied to the capital and other cities.  Water in the canyon comes from groundwater sources and the Tohmajoki River. </p><p>  Ruskeala waterfalls are great for outdoor activities.  Here you can swim along a stormy river and just admire the beautiful views. </p>
