    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Today you can find many architectural projects that are admirable.  These include the project of the LCD "Solar System".  The reviews mention both the beauty, borrowed from the samples of classical architecture, and the modern proportionality of the building, which promises residents an exceptional comfort, and visual joy for the eyes, since high-rise construction still carries echoes of minimalism here, but it also perfectly combines with absolutely fantastic landscape views.  Boulevards and streets are not boring for walks - there are various facades abounding with architectural details, and, being at home, you can enjoy panoramic views from the windows, especially attractive from the upper floors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I must say that in urban planning, architectural planning today is of the greatest importance, both the well-being and mood of the inhabitants depend on it.  Aesthetics of space in a modern urban environment is rarely solved as well as it was done in the design of the LCD "Solar System".  Reviews do not get tired of repeating this at all levels, from the media to the lucky owners of these apartments.  And the creators are probably proud of the beauty and unique appearance of the complex, which is able to please the eye.  And proud of the right.  The world-famous architect Maxim Atayants has been working with the Urban Group company for a long time, and each complex he built has his own character and brings a wonderful mood. </p>

    <h2>  Project </h2><p>  This project is truly revolutionary, and not only for domestic architecture.  Effectively, like candles on a rich table, there are skyscrapers, where a house in the form of a ring rises in the center of the Solar System LCD (Khimki) with a "festive cake".  Probably, the architect was inspired when designing it with ancient Roman views - it turned out to be an amphitheater with a green yard of one hundred square meters inside.  This is the core, the sun, the Sun, from it the rays go the streets on which the rest of the house-planet is located.  Not so often you can admire the ring-shaped buildings, even in Moscow there are only two of them, and those of the distant seventies, made of panels on nine floors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each house-planet has its own yard.  Of course, according to the principle of a clear separation of the courtyard and the street space, now every microdistrict is being built, quarterly buildings in the Solar System residential complex have been preserved.  At the same time, the houses are located so that each courtyard seems to have expanded its borders and has become much larger.  The facades are extremely interesting.  They are as if divided into different levels.  The first level - the lower one - is not very high, it is distinguished by multi-colored facades, air balconies, arches, columns and many other details.  The second tier retreats; walking from below it is visible only fragmentarily.  There are more calm tones that lead to the third - upper - level.  It is absolutely laconic in style, because it is in the background and is not visible from below at all - the ledges interfere with the look.  It is perceived by the background to the first two levels.  But only in the afternoon.  When dusk sets in and light flashes in the windows, the third level becomes the most beautiful, similar to the starry sky.  All this combines here - modern urban dynamics, speed, drive and space aspiration! </p>

    <h2>  Wizard Palette </h2><p>  The Urban Group company is not building simple residential complexes, each of them is like a separate city, where construction began several centuries ago, and all the architects had a sense of proportion, taste and unusual imagination.  The city is changing from quarter to quarter, one style is replaced by another, but so organically, so smoothly ... That is how the Solar System was conceived.  The decoration of buildings is a unique experiment, completely destroying all the high-altitude monotony inherent in modern urban planning.  The building is clearly typical, but how interesting it is!  Probably, the residents will be happy around the clock and all year round, because it is hardly possible to find such a friendly environment, which is obtained in the LCD "Solar System".  The developer may well consider this project one of the most successful, and not only among the works of his own company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A high-quality, comfortable environment has been formed here, and therefore architecture is perceived from anywhere - even close, at least from afar, at least from the height of the birds.  And each time the look does not find the same.  Apparently, in the LCD "Solar System" the layout of the neighborhoods is so conceived.  If you look from the street, the buildings seem to be small and small, but if you look at the project from afar, houses grow like rocks.  The farther the distance, the city seems higher.  The effect of this diversity is enhanced by the use of different materials.  Below - cheerful stucco, multi-colored, like spring, all in colors - blue, bright terracotta, yellow.  And after the ninth floors, brutality begins - the brick is fawn, gray, buffy ... It has already been said about the architectural details, they fit perfectly into the ensemble, create the mood, I want to look at them leisurely and for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  In the capital a very long time ago an idea called "safe yard" appeared and is being implemented.  Here she gets a high-tech solution, creating safety for pedestrians at the highest level, while not at all depriving them of comfort.  The fact is that all areas for pedestrians, all yards, and even more so - playgrounds in the residential complex are made much higher than the level of the roadway and parking lots.  LCD "Solar System", whose address on the Transport passage is expanding due to the numbers of new buildings literally before our eyes, is simultaneously building both pedestrian bridges and stylobates (towering platforms near the basement, the construction of which significantly saves space). </p><p>  Stylobates connect all yards and all pedestrian zones.  A child can be easily released to school alone, he will never have to cross the roadway.  However, it will still have to be escorted: there are so many interesting things along the way, the route is picturesque, and overcoming it can be late anywhere.  Such a solution of pedestrian zones, world architecture does not see too often.  There are few projects in China, Singapore and the United States.  Yards with such a system of walking paths have become as separated from the street as possible, communication, children's games reign here, that is, this is an exceptionally convenient collective space. </p>

    <h2>  Comfort </h2><p>  In the Solar System residential complex, the deadline for the completion of the main number of buildings is planned for 2017, and the last completed apartments are already on sale.  Therefore, the developer took care of everything in advance regarding the convenience of living.  Everything here is divided into levels - both the high-rise buildings themselves and the space at its foot.  Such a solution makes street panoramas even more interesting and diverse.  The yards, completely freed from cars, are spacious and free, on top you can only walk or bike - along the alleys, around sports and playgrounds, recreation areas.  The whole parking is underground, from there the cars leave already outside the residential complex. </p><p>  Everything has been done here for the convenience of residents: five kindergartens on the ground floors of the buildings significantly save parents' time on the road, a school with an open-type stadium to gain plenty of health in the fresh air, creative workshops - again, on the first floors, children's clubs and studios , pharmacies and beauty salons, grocery and non-grocery stores, cafes, bank branches ... What more could you want?  The infrastructure is thought out to the last detail.  The innovative project has formed an extensive system of the most pleasant solutions, creating an absolutely modern housing, with increased security requirements and an unbroken rhythm of life. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  So, eight buildings have already been completed, seven more are on the way, and the completion of construction is planned for 2019, in the second quarter.  Not only is this housing complex outwardly good.  Apartments in the LCD "Solar System" to match all the other innovations.  There are really rare housing formats, and their range is quite wide.  Monolithic brick houses of various heights - from three to seventeen - included more than forty options for a variety of layouts.  In the Solar System residential complex, housing prices are not so high, despite the fact that the developer offers at the usual Moscow cost an interesting set of apartments of rare formats. </p><p>  These are living rooms in which there are two magnificent windows, for example.  And what's more - there are limited edition apartments - exclusive, single, in which the view from the windows extends 270 degrees.  A huge selection of apartments is offered for offices, since for Khimki this option is very relevant, the atmosphere here is very business and entrepreneurial.  Only four kilometers from the capital, why not equip an office in such a blessed place.  The opportunities for entrepreneurs are simply huge, you can freely open at least a medium, at least a small business.  If you buy a specially equipped apartment-office, you can work right at home, without leaving anywhere. </p>

    <h2>  Availability </h2><p>  How to get to the LCD "Solar System", everyone decides for himself.  The choice is for every taste and every opportunity.  You can come here on Leningradskoye Shosse, Novokurkinskoye, Dmitrovskoye by your own car or taxi.  There is also a high-speed route No. 11. A company shuttle from Khimki railway station and from the Planernaya metro station can deliver it here - for residents of the Solar System residential complex, it is free and extremely comfortable.  Ground transportation, like throughout Moscow, works perfectly.  New comfortable trains also go often.  You can choose the transport you like, the choice is huge.  Departures to all major highways directly from the residential complex are available.  Both personal and public transport takes ten minutes to the Moscow Ring Road, three minutes to the Leningradskoye Shosse, and fifteen minutes to the Rechnoy Vokzal and Planernaya metro stations.  At Sheremetyevo Airport, even a little less. </p><p>  The company shuttle will deliver with comfort that is not inferior to the business class of any airline, as it is now a new and promising form of public transport.  Soft comfortable chairs, magazines, free internet, all this is surprisingly tuned for a longer trip.  People are surprised at such a quick and short road.

    <h2>  And that's not all </h2><p>  Since the "Solar System" is practically not distant from the capital (four kilometers is not a serious distance), you can visit the equestrian center at Planernaya, a golf club and any of the two large fitness clubs in the same place.  And in the residential complex itself <span>, gyms, a fitness club</span> and much more are equipped.  Not far from the paintball club (there are several others - a bit further), the <span>stadiums "Arena-Khimki"</span> and "Mayak", the Central Olympic Center "Olympian".  Moscow Golf School will also be happy to welcome players from a new residential complex nearby.  Of the educational institutions (in addition to existing ones and planned on the territory of the complex), eight kindergartens, five schools, an MAI branch, and a technical school (space power engineering) are closely located. </p><p>  More than twenty pharmacies of different directions and more than twenty clinics, five hospitals - there is plenty to choose from if it becomes necessary to amend health.  Of course, in the territory of the residential complex there are not only banks, there is also a post office.  Orthodox believers can attend nearby churches.  This is the temple of the Epiphany, the church of Saints Peter and Paul, the temple of the martyr Uara.  Not too far away is the Alexander Nevsky Temple in Novokurkin. </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  Urban Group is a famous company, the residential complexes built by it became the winners of competitions and received international prizes.  LCD "Solar System" won the European Property Awards - the prestigious London Prize - in two categories at once.
