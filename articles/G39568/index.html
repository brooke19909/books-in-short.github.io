No need to stand in the multi-meter queue for tickets or at the entrance.  It is enough to get up early and, armed with a good mood, go for a walk in the magnificent garden. </p><h2>  Garden history </h2><p>  The history of the orange garden in Rome begins in the tenth century.  At that time, the Eternal City was ruled by the large famous Crescenzo family.  The place where the park is now located was great for building the castle, which they did.  For many years, the family ruled the city from the castle.  At the beginning of the thirteenth century, Giacomo Savelli, a famous story under the name of Honorius the Fourth, was elected as the next Pope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rhomeguesthouse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="oranges in the garden" class="if uuid-3239306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239306.jpg"></div><p>  The castle on the Aventine hill passed into the hands of the pontiff and was turned into an impregnable fortress.  The architects hired for construction erected around the castle the impregnable walls that still surround the orange garden in Rome.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, local authorities decided to open a platform for free visits, as this is one of the best panoramic places in the city.  In 1932, orange trees were laid here, which have since been kept in perfect order.  Each resident and guest of the city can climb the Aventine Hill, admire the city and breathe in the sweet aroma of orange flowers, which is so strong that it is heard throughout the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bb-roma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="orange garden" class="if uuid-3239281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239281.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The Orange Garden in Rome is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the city, not only among young people, but also among representatives of the older generation.  Great views, clean air filled with aromas of orange make you come back here again and again.  Getting to the garden is easy. The garden is located on Aventino Hill.  It is not far from Piazza Petra d'Illiria and Clivo di Rocca Savello, from the city center can be reached by walking. </p><p>  Buses number 715, 160 and 81 go to the side of Savello Park. If you choose this path, exit at the Terme Deciane-Santa Prisca stop.  You can also, of course, be reached by taxi.  The driver will take you directly to one of the three entrances.  If you have chosen the metro, then you need the Pyramido station.  The exit from the metro is located in the hill itself and you find yourself immediately in the garden.  The watchmen open the garden early in the morning and close after sunset.  Free admission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oddviser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="night garden" class="if uuid-3239280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239280.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Few people know, but five centuries ago, the orange garden in Rome was decorated with a magnificent fountain, which was made by the famous Roman sculptor Pietro Gucci in the early sixteenth century.  In 1932, the fountain was transferred to Montanara Square, and forty years later, in the Palazzo Loncelotti area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The atmosphere of the garden sets up a romantic cultural mood, so it is not surprising that theatrical performances are held here.  In 2009, a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãan interesting oval shape was opened here named after Fayorenzo Fayorentini.  The famous Italian actor and screenwriter gave birth to a musical competition, which is held for beginner composers. </p><h2>  Keyhole </h2><p>  A trip to Rome cannot do without classic attractions.  However, there are places that travel guides do not talk about.  And if you reached the Aventine hill, the southernmost of the seven, then be sure to climb to its highest point.  There you will find a unique keyhole, which Russian-speaking guides in Rome hardly talk about.  Looking into it, you can see three unique state formations - Italy, the Order of Malta and, of course, the Vatican. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.romeing.it" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.romeing.it/things-to-see-in-rome/"><img itemprop="image" alt="keyhole" class="if uuid-3239284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239284.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  The most popular tours to Italy are weekend tours.  The question of what to see in Rome in 3 days is the most talked about when planning a route.  We offer the following places to visit.  So. </p><p>  Bridge Piazza Navona.  Being in a city with a thousand-year history and not visiting a place of the same age will be simply blasphemy.  This is one of the oldest pavements, which remembers almost all the rulers of the great empire, all the Italian high society beauties who walked along it.  In addition, the famous Four Rivers fountain is located here.  Legend has it that the stone masterpiece was named after the waters of four rivers: the Nile, Danube, Ganges and La Plata, located on four sides of the world. </p><p>  Castle of the Holy Angel.  This magnificent building began to be erected in the second century AD.  Over its long history, this building served as the house in which the popes lived, it was a prison, a warehouse and even a tomb.  Today, the castle houses a military history museum.  It is interesting that the castle got its name in honor of the archangel Michael, who, as legend has it, came down from heaven and appeared before the eyes of Pope Gregory.  The castle is connected to the other bank of the Tiber by a very beautiful bridge that was built during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain &quot;Four Rivers&quot;" class="if uuid-3239291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239291.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Italy is a country open for tourists, and almost every third managed to enjoy its wonderful atmosphere and share their impressions and reviews.  The first thing that tourists who walk in the orange garden in Rome advise is not to try oranges that are hanging on branches or lying on the ground. The temptation is great, but these varieties are not grafted and are not intended to be eaten because of their bitterness and dryness.  These plants are created exclusively for decorative purposes.  That is why they have such a persistent sweetish aroma that spreads throughout the district. </p><p>  Tourists also enjoy magnificent panoramic views of the city that open from Aventine Hill.  But a special expanse here for gourmets and connoisseurs of real Italian cuisine.  Everyone knows: to feel the taste of Italy, you need to eat where the locals are.  The Orange Garden is located in the historical part of the city, so the nearby streets are flooded with small cozy cafes where you can prepare the freshest coffee at an affordable price, serve hot pizza and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpurely Italian desserts. </p><p>  Before you travel, be sure to get yourself comfortable flat shoes.  This, it would seem, the simplest advice is most often neglected, rubbing and breaking legs in the blood during long walks. </p>
