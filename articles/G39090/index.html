    <p>  The steam cleaner of this model is very attractive in appearance.  The white case in combination with a powerful black pipe creates a stylish and beautiful look, and a new streamlined shape gives the device perfection and elegance. </p><p>  The quality of cleaning has also improved.  Now the cleaning surface of the steam cleaner has a ribbed shape, and the entire working area is covered with a dense cloth.  This increases the cleaning efficiency and completely eliminates the uneven distribution of hot steam flows.  The cost of the device ranges from 15-20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Of course, when working with the device, you must observe some safety precautions.

Cleaning should be done carefully so as not to damage the thin coating, and at the end of work, allow the surfaces of the equipment to dry well in order to avoid shorting. </p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that the steam cleaner can cope with all types of pollution, except for multilayer, old greasy stains and layers of lime.  For such work, you need to use a special nozzle or use a set of brushes with hard brass pile. </p><p>  You can purchase a device that combines a hot stream of water and steam.  This is a special, improved model of the company "Karcher" (steam cleaner).  The price of such a device is slightly higher, but the cleaning efficiency increases several times.  Due to the simultaneous action of steam and a hot stream of water, persistent contaminants soften and can be easily removed. </p><h2>  Usage Tips </h2><p>  If you want cleaning to take a minimum of time, and the rooms shine with cleanliness and freshness, use a Karcher steam cleaner.  For home, you can‚Äôt find a better helper.  In addition, the steam cleaner not only fights pollution, but also perfectly removes the smell of tobacco and yellowness from white surfaces. </p>
