    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Dimitrios Village Beach Resort Spa 4 * reviews get mostly good.  Guests assure: you should go here if you want a budget vacation with children.  The attention is paid to the good Russian-speaking staff, comfortable rooms, comfortable beds, good plumbing, and delicious food.  For children - swimming pools, convenient approaches to the sea and dams for the smallest, as well as a good selection of food on the menu. </p><p>  If parents want to be together, then this is not a problem.  Children here are under the supervision of animators and nannies, who are happy to deal with them and in every possible way amuse the kids.  We can say that there is even a small kindergarten organized.  The guys do crafts, ride a water slide, dance, draw, play - in general, they also don‚Äôt get bored here. </p><p>  But in general, a lot of people can relax here.  If you want to have fun or plunge into the vibrant nightlife of Greece, you can take a bus to the center of Rethymnon and be there in three minutes. </p><p>  Still lodgers on occasion of any important event are presented with surprises.  For birthday, for example, a greeting card and a delicious cake are delivered to the apartment. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  This hotel should not be sent to people who want, as they say, to have fun in full and take everything from relaxation.  The hotel is not designed for young people and tourists who value such a vacation.  It is more for families with children.  As a matter of fact, therefore in this hotel there is rarely a soothing silence.  Still, children tend to make noise.  It is better for this type of vacation to look for another hotel. </p><p>  By the way, even in a restaurant, in case of ordering the half-board service, it is better to take money.  Since all drinks are paid at dinner, and you cannot bring your own, of course, they will make a remark.  Such a nuance.  But you can put up with it.  In any case, drinks in a restaurant are inexpensive (obviously cheaper than in other cafes or taverns). </p>

    <h2>  Good to know </h2><p>  A lot of interesting things were told about Dimitrios Village Beach Resort Spa 4 *.  Reviews of tourists from many people who have not yet been here cause a desire to come and experience everything on themselves. </p><p>  A couple of nuances can be indicated in the end.  Firstly, on the beach (sandy, by the way) there are free umbrellas and sun loungers, but towels are not provided.  Therefore, it is worth taking them with you.  Or use the ones that issue in the room.  Change them, by the way, every other day.  Like the laundry.  The cleaning is good, quality, the rooms are always clean. </p><p>  And it‚Äôs worth knowing that when applying for an apartment reservation, you will need to enter your credit card details there.

This must be taken into account.  And plan your trip so that nothing has to be canceled. </p>
