    <p>  The meaning of the <span>Kolovrat symbol is</span> very interesting.  The sign itself embodies the path of the sun - the most important star in the sky.  He was also considered the road of the gods - Khors and Svarog, associated with the heavenly body.  Part of the name "colo" refers to a wheel or circle, which underlie the amulet.  They depict it in the form of a circle, in the center of which eight rays converge.  Their ends are bent in one direction, which symbolizes rotation and movement. </p><p>  For the ancient Slavs, Kolovrat was of great importance.  Their whole life was connected with the sun: work, holidays and major events were tied to sunny dates.  The luminary itself was a symbol of life, fertility, energy and strength.  He was worshiped, prayed, deified, and generous gifts brought to him.  The rotation of the sun, which found its reflection in the solar symbol of Kolovrat, not only gave life to our planet.  It demonstrated that everything in the universe moves in a circle: from planets to atoms, the existence of which was then unproven. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kolovrat symbol meaning" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/221395.jpg" width="449"></div>

Its meaning becomes understandable, but what is its background?  Our ancestors, of course, watched the starry sky, so they could not miss the features of the trajectory of the solar path.  If you draw an imaginary line in the starry sky from the polar star in places of the winter and <span>summer solstices</span> to the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, you can clearly see the elements of the Kolovrat.  And if you connect the places of these constellations on the map during the solstices and equinoxes, you get an image of the Slavic symbol. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the Kolovrat was of great importance in Russia.  Archaeologists often find this image on the temple, fragments of weapons, dishes, clothes.  These findings led to the conclusion that the sign had a strong protective effect.  The symbol of divine sunlight drove off <span>unclean power,</span> burned the entire infection, both spiritual and physical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolovrat preserved the meaning" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/221397.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kolovrat is a talisman whose significance can hardly be overestimated.  He reminded the human race of Right - the world of the living, the world of omnipotent spirits, the covenants of the Gods.  He displayed the structure of the world and protected from all evil, he allowed to receive the protection and help of the gods.  And the symbol was a means of communication with another world, secret and invisible.  Indeed, the Kolovrat had a different value, even the opposite, depending on which side its rays "rotated".  Salting, that is, in the direction of the sun, was used by men, Antisolon was worn by women. </p><p>  Today there is a surge in people's increased interest in their origins.  They are interested in the ancient heritage of their ancestors, their worldview.  Therefore, Slavic charms, including the solar Kolovrat, are in demand.  It‚Äôs time for us to throw off the culture imposed by strangers, to find ourselves and our true ‚ÄúI‚Äù. </p>
