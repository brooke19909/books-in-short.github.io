    <h2>  Introducing Fly FF245 </h2><p>  In September 2016, buyers were able to get acquainted with the new model of the company Fly.  It is a simple mobile phone with a keypad.  Outwardly, no remarkable elements were used.  The shape of the case is quite typical for such devices.  The designers decided to adhere to a clear geometry, allowing roundness only in the corners. </p><p>  The <span>Fly FF</span> 245 is a regular candy bar.  Its front panel is divided into two blocks: at the top - the screen, at the bottom - the keyboard.  For the manufacture of the body was selected plastic.  There are two speakers: the first (conversational) is displayed above the screen, the second (stereo) is on the back cover near the camera lens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The keyboard unit is pretty pretty.  The control panel consists of five standard buttons.  The joystick is large, square in shape.  Designed for five positions: center key, down, up, right, left.  Numeric buttons Fly 245, reviews of which we will voice a little later, are rectangular.  Their sizes cause a mixed opinion.  Most believe that the keys could be made slightly larger. </p><p>  On the back cover are the LED flash, camera, speaker and the name of the manufacturer.  At the bottom there is a microphone, connectors for connecting a USB cable and audio equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Brief characteristics </h2><p>  Continuing the review of Fly FF 245, we will also consider the characteristics of the main elements. </p><ul><li>  Type of device - classic mobile phone. </li><li>  Case - monoblock. </li><li>  Weight - 137 g. </li><li>  SIM-cards: quantity - two, type - standard, method of operation - alternating (one radio module). </li><li>  Display: size - 2.4 ∫, type - color, matrix - TFT, resolution - 240x320 px. </li><li>  Battery: technology - lithium-ion, capacity - 3700 mAh. </li><li>  Camera: resolution - 0.3 MP, video mode. </li><li>  Processor: the number of cores is one, the frequency is 260 MHz. </li><li>  Memory: RAM - 32 Mb, ROM - 32 Mb. </li><li>  Memory card: type - microSD, volume - 32 GB. </li><li>  Communications: USB, WAP, Bluetooth, GPRS. </li><li>  Dimensions: 13x5.4x1.6 cm. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews of real people </h2><p>  Fly FF 245 reviews get not only laudatory.  This mobile phone is quite simple.  As a rule, most buyers purchase it as a second phone for making calls.  The camera is very weak.  With its help it is difficult to take a picture not only of high quality, but more or less legible.  Unfortunately, the display is not admirable either. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But what really deserves respect is the Fly 245 battery. With low hardware, the phone can work in <span>standby mode for</span> 740 hours. Through the headphones, the owners of this model can listen to music for 90 hours without recharging. As for connoisseurs of constant talking, they can not break away from their favorite activity for 14 hours. Strengths include working with all common communication standards and support for two SIM-cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly iq 245 plus" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1704327.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fly Smartphone </h2><p>  The Fly 245 touchscreen phone went on sale in 2012.  At the time of release, its cost ranged from 5,000 rubles.  It is a monoblock with a touchscreen.  In the design of the case, corporate features of the company are visible.  The phone is completely devoid of sharp corners and edges.  Smooth lines prevail.  The exterior design can be safely called elegant.  It is complemented by compact dimensions.  With a weight of 120 g, the phone‚Äôs height is 11.4 cm. The width of 6.1 cm makes it easy to control your smartphone with one hand, without fear of accidentally dropping it.  As for the thickness, then by modern standards it is very large - almost 1.3 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Fly IQ 245, like a typical touchscreen phone, has a large screen that occupies almost the entire front side.  Under it there is a control panel.  The developers brought 4 keys to it: standard ones - ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, and additional - ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù.  An LED indicator of events is located above the screen, the proximity sensor, of course, there is a hole in the earpiece. </p><p>  The rear panel is also unlikely to attract the attention of buyers.  Here, apart from the camera lens and the speaker opening of an intricate shape, there is nothing.  Mechanical keys are located at the ends of the case.  For example, the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù volume is displayed on the right side face.  There are no buttons or connectors on the left side.  The manufacturer made the upper end functional by placing an on / off key on it, ports for connecting a USB cable and headphones.  As you can see even with a cursory inspection, the Fly 245 touchscreen smartphone is a typical ‚Äústate employee‚Äù with standard elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly iq 245 specifications" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1704333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the screen </h2><p>  Given that the smartphone model came out five years ago, it cannot boast of high display characteristics.  The technology by which it is produced is TFT.  The diagonal by today's standards is small, it‚Äôs only 3.5 ". Information is not clearly displayed on the screen, some blur is immediately apparent. This is explained by the low resolution, which is 480x320 pixels. You can even notice in some places how the image is pixelated. The reason for this is a small density indicator - 165 pp. The phone‚Äôs modification, the Fly IQ 245 Plus, is also equipped with the same screen, and we will talk about their differences later. </p><p>  The entry-level smartphone cannot boast of wide viewing angles.  Already at a tilt of 45 ¬∞, changes in the level of brightness and contrast become noticeable.  This, in turn, leads to a significantly dimmer color reproduction.  The developers have provided a multi-touch function.  With its help, the screen is capable of simultaneously detecting two touches.  The sensor has earned a lot of praise from the owners.  It works great.  The sensitivity is high, quickly responds to touch. </p><p>  The TFT-type matrix does not work well when working in bright sunshine.  On the street, users often feel discomfort, since the information displayed on the screen is almost impossible to read.  You can fix the problem only by setting the brightness to the maximum level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly ff 245 specifications" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1704372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  When conducting a review of Fly IQ 245, the processor characteristics indicate that the gadget belongs to the budget segment.  The model was released five years ago, and the developers installed a rather weak chipset of the Taiwanese company MediaTek on it.  This is a model MT6573.  The processes are implemented according to the architectural type of ARM v6.  The processor is based on only one core, which operates at a frequency of 800 MHz.  If we talk about the modification of the Fly IQ 245 Plus, then we can see that the manufacturer slightly increased performance.  This phone has a chipset, the computing module of which is capable of overclocking to 1024 MHz.  This is the only difference between these phones of the British company.  Unfortunately, to say that the model with the Plus prefix works much faster, it is impossible.  For an objective assessment, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the characteristics of the memory.  The size of the "RAM" was 256 MB.  Only about 70 MB was available to the user.  By current standards, such parameters are considered more than critically small.  Few people believe that a device with such volumes can pretty well cope with the tasks. </p><p>  The same amount (256 MB) is offered to the user for storing personal information.  But in fact, owners will be able to dispose of only 80 MB.  Support for the memory card saves the situation, however, it is not provided in the kit.  Those customers who wish to expand the capabilities of their gadget can additionally purchase a flash drive up to 32 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 245 instruction" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1704336.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  The Fly IQ 245 phone works with a 3.2 megapixel camera.  No autofocus.  The manufacturer did not integrate the flash.  Low quality photos.  The camera shows a low level of dynamics, detail and a high level of saturation.  If you take a picture at a distance of 1 meter to the object, it will come out normal.  It is possible to record video. </p><p>  In order to enter the camera, you must use the appropriate shortcut.  The interface is pretty simple.  On the right is the gallery, where you can switch between photos and videos, it is possible to turn on the shutter.  On the left are additional options and how many frames are left. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Both modifications - both the youngest (IQ 245) and the older (Fly 245 Plus) - are equipped with a battery manufactured in compliance with lithium-ion technology.  The battery capacity is 1300 mAh.  The manufacturer provides some information about the battery.  For example, with constant conversation, the device will be able to function for about 4 hours.  In standby mode, it can withstand 150 hours. </p><h2>  Operating System: Interface Features </h2><p>  When a user turns on his Fly 245 phone, the instructions for making settings will be useful to him first.  Immediately after activating the device, it goes to the desktop.  There are no quick settings for time or date.  All that the user needs to do, you have to look for yourself. </p><p>  The smartphone runs on the Android operating system version 2. The launcher from the manufacturer is not installed, so the interface is provided, so to speak, in its purest form.  Most likely, the decision to do so was made on the basis that the RAM is too small.  If the user needs it, he will install additional software on his own. </p><p>  There are five desktops in the phone.  On all, you can put applications, widgets, folders and various kinds of links.  The notification menu is filled with alerts.  But there you can configure the buttons responsible for quick access to any file from applications or settings.  On this screen, you can place any keys: those that allow you to work with the screen, sound or wireless network.  If you hold the power button for a long time, a special window will appear.  It will offer several menus: the choice of silent mode, "airplane" and the function to turn off the device. </p><p>  The phone works with one radio module, so when you talk on one SIM card, the second one will be automatically turned off.  If you visit a special section that deals with the configuration of the relevant parameters, then you can select the default subscriber number.  The smartphone does not work with the 3G network, so there is no need to rely on high-speed Internet.  If you need to upload something, it is best to use a wireless connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly ff 245 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1704334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Installed software </h2><p>  The set of programs installed at the factory is no different from the configuration of previous models.  In the phone, you can find utilities from both Google and Fly. </p><p>  The built-in player is standard, which works with the most common media formats.  For a large number of users, the application‚Äôs options are enough, if something more ambitious is needed, you can always download the software yourself.  The player also works with only one video format, and is capable of playing medium-quality files. </p><p>  The existing radio program only works in tandem with the headphones.  The latter in this case play the role of a conventional antenna that catches signals. </p><p>  For those who prefer to use file managers, a special explorer is installed here by standard.  It can easily find the necessary files. </p><p>  As a base, a program for reading books was also installed.  It's about the famous FBReader. </p><p>  In addition to everything described above, there are also two programs that will allow you to watch live television directly from your phone.  What is needed to watch broadcasts?  Nothing but a stable and powerful wireless connection. </p><p>  As with many phones, YouTube is installed here.  There is also a standard browser that works quite quickly and easily loads many pages. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Consumers note the following advantages in the Fly 245 phone: comfort when working with it, an intuitive interface, and a fairly loud speaker.  In addition to all this, some notice that the screen received a good level of brightness, the sensor is capacitive, it‚Äôs easy to work with it, the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is lightweight, and a lot of the necessary applications are installed.  Design, the presence of two slots for SIM cards, the ability to install a memory card - all this can also be attributed to the positive sides.  Price and functionality that is fully matched to value attract many consumers. </p><p>  But, like any other device, the described is not without its drawbacks.  Most buyers attributed the camera to such.  If you actively use the phone during the day, you will have to charge it on the same day.  Unfortunately, its internal and random access memory is not a strong point of this device.  The back cover, the quality of the screen matrix and the fact that the phone itself often gets lost are additional drawbacks that are also worth paying attention to. </p><p>  Consumers immediately say that the main purpose of the phone is to make calls, send messages.  That is, as much as possible to facilitate the contact of the owner with the outside world.  That is why many users quickly forgive the smartphone for a little functionality and a small number of options.  Almost everyone claims that the phone is well done.  Although not the best materials have been used, nothing creaks anywhere and does not fall off.  The speaker is loud and loud, so the probability that the call is "lost" and will not be heard is almost zero. </p><p>  Unfortunately, to deal with the phone, you will have to download instructions from the Internet.  The kit comes with only a small operating booklet, which only explains the general points.  The implementation of the menu settings few people cause difficulties, since they are as clear and easy as possible. </p><p>  Users notice that the back cover of the phone is hard to remove.  At first glance, it seems a little frail, but opening it is not so easy.  Do not be afraid that it will break under pressure - this should not happen.  To prevent the battery from draining quickly, you should turn off all synchronization, which is available on the phone and can be active.  It is she who consumes a lot of battery life. </p><p>  Some users complain that it is difficult to read books and browse sites on the Internet through a native browser.  The font is too small, which for some people is almost unreadable.  That is why the book reader is not used by all owners. </p><p>  To summarize the feedback from consumers, the following should be said: most of them advise the phone.  It will be an excellent device that makes calls and sends messages, allows you to go online to watch the news.  You should not count on anything more. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  In its price category, the Fly 245 device can be called one of the best.  It has its drawbacks, but they easily overlap with the advantages.  The phone can be recommended to anyone who does not want to spend too large amounts on the purchase of the device, but wants to work with two SIM cards. </p><p>  Consumers note the main disadvantages: poor camera, difficulties in mastering ergonomics and problems with the signal. </p><p>  Of the advantages it is worth noting the display, performance, support for two SIM cards, low cost, loud speaker. </p>
