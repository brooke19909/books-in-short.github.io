But the Paris commune tried to implement the most successful attempt to change the world for the better.  Its existence was not long, it lasted only 2 months: from March 18 to May 18, 1871. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History Paris Commune" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/667944.jpg" width="400"></div>  This community was called the ‚Äúrevolutionary government of the workers‚Äù or ‚Äúthe state for equals,‚Äù as history testifies.  <span>The Paris Commune</span> was created with the aim of organizing equal conditions for all residents of the French capital, which would greatly facilitate the existence of the working class and restore justice.

    <p>  The principle of equality in everything is especially pronounced in Russian communes, which appeared immediately in the post-revolutionary period.  These organizations were the labor cells of a renewed Soviet society, in which relations were built on the warmth of internal communication.  An example for this was a good family, and it was based on love that could cure most mental illnesses.  The commune is a haven providing a psychologically comfortable life and taking care of all who needed it and was ready to live according to the established rules of community. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unlike the social cells of past times, modern communes are guided by slightly different principles, acting as fighters against the existing system and propagandizing anarchy. </p><h2>  Children's commune - a school of life for street children </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, in order to build an updated Soviet collective, children's communes began to be created, which are educational institutions for combating child homelessness.  As a vivid example, which was a social experiment, the Children's Community named after Dzerzhinsky, Colony named after them, stands out.  Gorky, as well as the Bolshevskaya commune, who took under their roof a large number of children left without parents after the past wars (World War I and Civil).  The total number of young tramps in 1922 was approximately 7 million. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the commune is" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/667928.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In children's communes, where work and study were mandatory for everyone, life was based on the principle of self-organization and self-government, which established norms of behavior and monitored their implementation. </p><p>  Units of different ages of 7-15 people were created, which enabled older children to educate younger children, which ensured the connection of generations.  Each detachment had its own place in the dining room and bedroom, and the commanders gathered once a week to solve organizational and economic issues.  The principles developed in the colony forever pulled the children from the flocking nomadic environment into which they were thrown by the horrors of homelessness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anton Makarenko: methods of education </h2><p>  Anton Makarenko - a famous teacher and writer who led the colony of them.  Gorky, - in the educational process he often used the so-called explosion method, invented and successfully tested by himself.  Its essence was a strong one-time impact on a person brought to the extreme point of the conflict, with the goal of making decisive changes within himself: to be a <span>member of society</span> or to leave him.  After all, the created team implied the restructuring of the people who fell into it in accordance with their own principles: respect for themselves and others, trust, constant study and productive work. </p>

    <p>  The children's commune used the explosion method when attracting new guys.  Communal units approached the homeless on the street, inviting them to go live and work.  And the answer had to be given immediately, on the spot.  If the homeless agreed, then he went to the commune with a detachment of smartly dressed children, with an orchestra and a banner.  Thus, the rite of passage took place, the purpose of which was to shock, surprise, make an unforgettable impression.  In the commune, new members were fed, washed, dressed in clean clothes, the old ones were burned right away, which meant farewell to the past.  Nobody wanted to run away from such a beautiful life, but in order to stay in it, they needed to study and work.  The criminal inclinations of the pupils were directed in the right direction, uniting the team with such risky enterprises as the organization of detachments to combat moonshining and illegal logging. </p><h2>  The principles of life in the commune </h2><p>  The commune adopted strict rules and strict discipline, close to military and being the same for everyone: from teachers to pupils.  The slightest deviations from the rules were subjected to careful analysis.  The aesthetic side of life was also given great importance: cleanliness, order should have been in everything, starting from one's sleeping place and ending with the territory on which the commune was located.  This disciplined the pupils and taught them to respect the world around them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first communes" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/667957.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  Of course, a fracture of habits occurred over a long period.  One could not expect miracles from former alcoholics, thieves, drug addicts.  The teachers, knowing this, have established <span>mutual responsibility:</span> one for all, all for one.  Former homeless children who wanted <span>to change their lives</span> and take the right path, established for themselves and others three basic rules: </p><ol><li>  If you want - live, do not want - leave! </li><li>  I decided to live in a commune - study and work! </li><li>  Everyone is responsible for everyone. </li></ol><p>  For the most unorganized pupils there was a <span>collective form of</span> public shame, but the main method of influencing those who did not want to work was to publicly announce them as ‚Äúdisabled workers‚Äù.  Strangely enough, those who uploaded were put in better conditions.  For truants, hooligans and loafers was organized "11 list".  In case of absenteeism at <span>lunch time,</span> in front of everyone's eyes, the table at which they were supposed to sit was covered with a black tablecloth and served all the best that the dining room could offer.  A pre-prepared orchestra, playing Chizhik, was seated around, and the resolution of the general meeting was read that "such persons should be kept on list No. 11 for 5 days."  The ritual, which lasted several minutes, provoked general fun and perplexed those who were not embarrassed before.  In this way, a radical breakdown of consciousness and a revision of the attitude of pupils to work were carried out. </p><h2>  Commune - Factory of the best </h2><p>  The existence of the commune paid off not only for its needs and needs, but also benefited the state.  In the Dzerzhinsky commune, the first power tool factory in the Soviet Union was created, and a little later a camera factory, which brought the country annual profit of about 5 million rubles.  Also a positive side was the development of the Communards of complex professions. </p><p>  Well-educated and well-mannered people who have become worthy citizens of their country ‚Äî these are the very things the commune released from its walls.  These are hundreds of people who at some stage simply were lucky enough to change their lives for the better in time thanks to competent teachers, a friendly team, and, of course, themselves. </p>
