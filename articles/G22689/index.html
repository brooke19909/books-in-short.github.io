Which LED bulbs are best for home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The number of fans of LED lamps is growing every day.  And this is not surprising.  Electricity prices are constantly rising.  Unfortunately, nothing can be done about it.  The only sure way is to save money.  Everyone is trying to save in their own way.  Some often try not to turn on the light, while others use LED lamps. </p><p>  Of course, this saving option is more convenient, but here there are some problems.  If the <span data-mce-mark="1">LED lamp blinks,</span> there are several explanations for this.  The advice of experienced professionals will help find the cause of this unpleasant phenomenon.  In most cases, it can be eliminated independently. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the lamp </h2><p>  The mechanism of an LED lamp is much more complicated than that of an incandescent lamp.  But when people used only the second option, then there were no problems at all.  LED bulbs are completely different.  They have a converter in the form of a voltage source.  The device only needs to be turned on, and the current will rush from the base to the electronic converter, and then to the LEDs, which are arranged in series.  <span>The life of LED lamps is</span> much longer than that of incandescent lamps.  They are economical, therefore, are in high demand among consumers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp blinks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1992272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In lamps with high-quality LEDs, a driver is built-in that is able to convert unstable voltage to direct current.  As for the lamps of lower quality, inside them, instead of the driver, is a power supply based on a quenching capacitor.  Often, it is he who is the reason why the <span>LED lamp blinks.</span>  The stability, durability of the lighting device depends on the quality of the assembly. </p><h2>  Flashing lamp when the light is off </h2><p>  There are quite a few reasons why the <span>LED lamp blinks in the off state</span> .  The first of these is a wiring fault.  First you need to pay attention to where the phase wire leads.  It is considered normal when it is connected to one of the contacts of the switch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp life" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1992267.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In another case, it will simply be impossible to correct the situation.  But, if the lamp still flashes when the connection is made correctly, one of the reasons may be a malfunction in the network.  When another power wire is located next to the disconnected cable, potential may appear on it.  Sometimes it is necessary to take care of replacing the wiring. </p><p>  Another cause of flickering can be very poor quality lamps.  You can fix the problem by purchasing a new lighting device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Right choice </h2><p>  In the store you can just get lost in the variety of offers.  It's hard to decide immediately <span>which LED lamps are best for the home</span> .  They differ in form, power, manufacturer.  The most reliable lamps are Feron, Osram, Philips or Era.  Customer reviews of these models are mostly positive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which LED bulbs are best for home" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1992264.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  There are also low-quality products.  This <span>LED lamp also blinks when it is on.</span>  <span>Therefore, it is</span> advisable to seek advice from the seller in the process of choosing a light source.  He will be able to suggest the best option.  Many people complain about the Cosmos and Start firms.  It is better to trust those who have experienced the inconvenience of using low-quality goods, putting such a lamp aside. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Nobody argues that LED lamps are much better than usual.  They have much more pros than cons.  They can consume less energy.  At the same time, they surpass other varieties in brightness and safety.  The glow will be more comfortable for human vision.  There are cold, warm and neutral shades of rays.  For any type of interior, you can choose the best kind of lighting device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The LED lamp blinks in the switched off state" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1992268.jpg" width="549"></div>

    <p>  <span>LED lamp life</span> is approximately eleven years of continuous use.  This is a very good result.  It is also worth noting the safety of a unique product.  Inside the lighting device there is absolutely no mercury or other substances unsafe for the human body. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Among the minuses it is impossible not to mention the high price.  For most people, this drawback is considered one of the most significant.  Not every resident of the country is able to buy a lamp at home at a price of 300 to 2000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The LED lamp blinks in the switched on state" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1992270.jpg" width="584"></div>  Also, in some cases, the owners of the device note that the LED lamp blinks in the off state.  This disadvantage can be eliminated.

    <h2>  Myths </h2><p>  There are people who think that LED lamps can work forever.  Unfortunately, there is no truth in these words.  Any electrical appliance may break sooner or later.  The same goes for LED bulbs.  But no one guaranteed their eternal functioning.  As the end of life approaches, this light source begins to fade.  The brightness of the glow gradually decreases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lights blink after turning on" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1992269.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Lamp operation is not always so long.  Sometimes an ordinary old-style lighting fixture lasts longer.  Therefore, trying to decide <span>which LED lamps are best for the home</span> , it is imperative to consider their quality.

    <p>  Fans of buying light bulbs in the market should be aware that the proposed product may be of poor quality.  Therefore, if the <span>LED lamps blink after turning on, the</span> reason may be hidden in this.  Unscrupulous sellers are ready to sell low-quality, spoiled goods in a normal and completely non-wrinkled box.  That is why you should always check the product without leaving the tent.  This is done using special testers.  If there are none, then you should bypass these sellers. </p><p>  A spoiled product is money down the drain.  Buying a lamp in an online store also has its drawbacks.  The consumer‚Äôs attention is attracted by a huge assortment of goods and a better price, but the online store is not always ready to send a product that meets the declared characteristics.  If the <span>LED lamp blinks, this may indicate just its poor quality, from which no one is safe when shopping online.</span>  The most correct decision would be to purchase a light source in an ordinary shopping center.  If you have any complaints, employees are always ready to replace low-quality goods. </p><h2>  Expert Advice </h2><p>  Today, LED lamps save energy.  Their service life is long.  It is not only an economical, but also a safe source of light.  Its temperature (shade) of the glow can be any.  Therefore, the presented device is in great demand today. </p><p>  Despite all the pros, and these harmless lamps have flaws.  Some do not like their <span>cold white light.</span>  Others simply prefer old-style bulbs, as they are used to them. </p><p>  If the <span>LED lamp blinks, the</span> cause may be a malfunction of the device or wiring.  Also, as experts say, such a problem occurs when the lamp is connected to a switch with a <span>light indicator.</span>  Its charge is enough for the lighting device to recharge.  At the moment of discharge, flicker is observed.  To prevent this, you need to turn off the indicator or change the switch. </p><p>  Changing the lamp itself to another type of lighting device is impractical.  Today it is the most economical, durable and comfortable type of lighting fixtures.  Perhaps in many years the LED lamps will be replaced by something else, but for now they are the best option available, even despite some minor flaws. </p><p>  Having considered the possible reasons why the <span>LED lamp blinks,</span> you can eliminate such a nuisance yourself, and then the lamp will serve its owners for many years. </p>
