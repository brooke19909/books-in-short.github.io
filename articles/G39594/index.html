Because from the moment a person picked up a stick, he realized that he could force his own kind to act in the right way.  In the process of the evolution of society, the field of military art was also developed.  That is, people are constantly looking and are looking for new ways to destroy each other.  But, in addition to this part of the military craft, the management sector has also developed.  In other words, the process of direct command and control of the army has become more efficient and makes it possible to more fully realize the potential of the entire army.  However, some army coordinating institutions have a rather long history.  They have been formed over many centuries.  It is quite possible to classify among them the post of supreme commander-in-chief, who today plays a significant role in many military processes and actual conflicts.  It should be noted that this post is not only a great responsibility, but also a spectrum of a huge number of powers.  In addition, the person holding this post is entrusted with the performance of a number of functions, which will be discussed later in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supreme commander" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27807/1160011.jpg" width="530"></div>

As already mentioned by the author earlier, this is a definite institution in the field of military command and control.  In other words, the supreme commander as a post is an aggregate of a certain kind of obligations, functions and responsibilities.  But there is another interpretation of the presented term.  According to her, the supreme commander-in-chief is a specific person who is endowed with a large number of powers in the field of military command and control that coordinates absolutely the entire array of troops of a given state. </p>

    <h2>  Commander-in-Chief as a Senior Official </h2><p>  The article will be considered by the supreme commander in chief precisely as a person belonging to the highest echelon of power.  As a rule, this person is central to the entire military hierarchy of the state.  In some cases, the supreme commander is solely the man who exercises command of the army and navy.  In other cases, these powers are vested in the <span>head of state.</span>  This trend is a kind of tribute to democratic relations within many existing states.  In addition, the concentration in the hands of the democratic leader of the authority to exercise the command of the troops allows you to protect the country from the seizure of power by the military elite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supreme commander of the armed forces" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1156055.jpg" width="540"></div>

In this case, it is not clear why the functions of the head of state and the central figure of the military sector were divided.  It is known that for the first time the term "commander-chef" was used by Charles I, king of Scotland, England and Ireland.  He combined the powers of a ruler and a commander in chief.  Thus, many historians believe that it is from this moment that the institute mentioned in the article appears.  In other words, Charles I is the first supreme commander in world history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supreme commander of the Russian army" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27807/1158179.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The post of commander in chief in Russian history </h2><p>  The Supreme Commander of the <span>Armed Forces</span> first appeared in the "Table of Ranks" not so long ago.  His post was first established on the territory of modern Russia during the First World War.  For the first time, Prince Nikolai Nikolaevich the Younger was appointed to the post.  It happened on July 20, 1914.  The institute was created with the aim of reorganizing the current structure and centralizing military power in the hands of a representative of the royal family.  In addition, such a step was correct from the point of view of common sense, because by that time public dissatisfaction with the regime of autocracy in the empire was already ripening.  During the First World War, the post of commander in chief more than once was transferred to various prominent commanders of the imperial army, right up to the signing of the Brest Peace Treaty.  From that moment, the commander-in-chief was appointed only to coordinate the activities of the army and navy. </p><h2>  Further post development </h2><p>  Today everyone knows who the supreme commander is and what this position is.  But when the Soviet Union emerged as a separate integral state, then, as a result of the agreement already mentioned, this post was not approved due to the absence of military conflicts.  The Supreme Commander of the Second World War (WWII) was appointed from among the political elite.  It was August 8, 1941, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.  It should be noted that he remained in this position even after the immediate end of the war.  But in the USSR it was decided that a reorganization of such a post as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief was required.  The Great Patriotic War ended, Stalin died, and on the verge of a new conflict with the United States.  Therefore, secretly, this position was taken by the chairman of the USSR Defense Council. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supreme commander of the great patriotic war" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1156060.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <h2>  Institute in modern Russia </h2><p>  To date, the supreme commander of the Russian army is a position held by the highest leader of the entire array of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supreme commander" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1156062.jpg" width="430"></div>  This status is not only supported by the organizational structure of the army, but also legally regulated.

    <h2>  Position regulatory framework </h2><p>  In accordance with the fact that the Russian Federation is a legal and democratic state, almost all issues of public regulation are regulated by law.  The supreme commander is no exception.  It acts on the basis of the norms of various normative acts.  Thus, the system of normative regulation of the position consists of the following regulatory acts, namely: </p><p>  1) The Constitution of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  2) Federal law "On martial law." </p><p>  3) The Federal Law "On Defense". </p><p>  Also, these acts spell out what powers the Supreme Commander of the Russian Federation has. </p><h2>  Credentials </h2><p>  The Supreme Commander of the Russian Federation is endowed with a number of specific powers that are not owned by other persons in the hierarchy of state power.  The person holding this position is authorized to: </p><ul><li>  In the event of an immediate threat of the Russian Federation to introduce <span>martial law</span> on the territory of the state <span>.</span> </li><li>  Monitor the implementation of martial law. </li><li>  To ensure the functioning of the highest bodies of state power during this regime. </li><li>  Create plans to attract the <span>Armed Forces</span> in order to ensure martial law. </li><li>  Provide a halt to the activities of political parties and other propaganda groups on the territory of the state in war. </li><li>  Ensure compliance with the prohibitions on holding rallies and campaigns in a state of martial law. </li><li>  The Supreme Commander is entrusted with the task of approving the <span>military doctrine of the</span> Russian Federation. </li><li>  In addition, the Commander-in-Chief appoints and dismisses the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. </li><li>  The person holding this position determines the <span>military policy</span> on the territory of the state. </li><li>  The commander-in-chief can mobilize the army if there are grounds for this. </li><li>  He also decides on the direct deployment of the armed forces. </li><li>  The Commander-in-Chief issues decrees on the draft of citizens for military service. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the powers presented, the president (as the supreme commander in chief) is entrusted with a number of other specific functions that are also important for ensuring the defense capability and military power of the state.  To date, the post presented in the article is held by the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. </p><h2>  Normative acts issued by the commander in chief </h2><p>  To exercise his powers and organize the activities of the Armed Forces, a person holding this position has the opportunity to issue certain kinds of normative acts in the sphere of his direct activity.  In accordance with this, within the framework of his competence, the supreme commander has the right to issue orders and directives. </p><p>  In addition, to encourage activities to ensure the defense capability of the state, he awards the people who deserve it with diplomas, and also thanks them. </p><p>  In conclusion, it should be noted that the institution presented has a number of characteristic features in the vastness of the fatherland.  In addition, the <span>legal regime for</span> its regulation still needs some refinement, so that the exercise of the powers of the person holding the position is carried out more efficiently and fully. </p>
