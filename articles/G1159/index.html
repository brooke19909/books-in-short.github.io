The village is located only seven kilometers from Kemer.  And it is not so far from Antalya Airport to get to it. </p><p>  Goynuk is famous for its stunning scenery.  This is one of the most picturesque places on the coast.  In fact, the difference between Kemer and the village of Goynuk is not so great.  Many tour operators do not even make a village, including it in the main resort area of ​​Kemer.  For tourists, the difference in the coverage of the coastline only matters.  In the village of Goynuk, the coast is more rocky, there are many cliffs and gorges formed by the mountains approaching the sea itself.  In the village, rest will be interesting not only for families with children, but also for those who are interested in mountain tourism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boran mare beach kemer 5 beach" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1985639.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In ancient times, local lands were under the control of robbers.  And only in the eleventh century did Turkmen nomads appear here.  It was they who, struck by the beauty of the coast, gave Goynuk his current name.  Currently, the village has a beautiful coast, which is covered from all sides by mountains.  The town itself is small, but not without charm.  It is planted with pomegranate and orange trees. </p><p>  The main attractions of the resort are natural landscapes, mountains, grottoes, caves, cozy coves and beaches.  Moreover, the main pearl, of course, is the canyon, which is even considered a natural monument.  Horseback riding and hiking are organized along the canyon, so everyone can go on an exciting mini-trip. </p><h2>  Reviews about “Boran Mare Beach Club” (Kemer) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, we turn to the many positive reviews of its guests.  It is not often possible to meet an institution that leaves all tourists with exceptionally positive emotions.  That such is the <span>Club Boran Mare</span> Beach Hotel 5 *. </p><p>  All tourists are incredibly satisfied with their stay at this hotel, and there are several reasons for this.  And even if there are minor flaws in it, this does not bother anyone, thanks to the skillful leadership of the owner of the institution and excellent staff.  It is worth noting that the hotel complex is fully Russian-speaking.  Here, absolutely everything is understood and spoken in Russian - from the maids to the owner himself, who is regularly at the reception and monitors the arrival of guests, their settlement and generally sets the tone for the entire hotel and staff.  It is very pleasant when a person is so positive and keen on his work.  The employees of the complex are always attentive and warmly welcome tourists.  In general, the hotel has its own unique, very positive and pleasant atmosphere.  Probably, for this reason, many tourists come here not for the first time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boran mare beach kemer 5 entertainment" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1985641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After all, not every Turkish hotel, even the most fashionable, can boast of good staff.  But after all, the quality of leisure of guests and their service largely depends on workers. </p><p>  Hotel Boran has a small area, but it is incredibly well-groomed and beautiful.  Buildings are buried in green plants and flowers.  Moreover, the complex has everything you need for a good good rest. </p><p>  Hotel Boran Mare Beach Kemer 5 * (the description of the rooms is given by us earlier in the article) offers its guests accommodation in fairly good apartments.  Of course, the “standards” are quite modest in size, but they are quite suitable for a sea holiday.  The rooms have everything you need.  Maids regularly change clothes and clean.  Vacationers have no complaints about cleanliness.  As for tips, their absence in no way adversely affects the quality of service. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel offers all-inclusive meals.  The main restaurant is a very spacious and beautiful establishment.  Its staff is very clear and fast.  There are never queues or clusters of dirty dishes on tables that spoil your appetite.  Cleanliness and order - the motto of the institution. </p><p>  Numerous positive reviews of guests about nutrition give reason to say that it is established at the proper level.  A large assortment of delicious buffet dishes delights guests.  Among them there is a lot of food, which is quite acceptable even for capricious children.  The menu always has a good selection of sweets, desserts and fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boran mare beach kemer 5 food" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1985642.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel bars serve good Turkish drinks and also offer all kinds of snacks.  In general, in terms of nutrition, the complex deserves all praise.  Extra pounds after rest in it are guaranteed. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is located in an incredibly picturesque place.  The very nature of these places sets up relaxation and complete relaxation.  The hotel's beach is well equipped, it has sand and pebble flooring, changing rooms, showers, umbrellas and sun loungers.  On the coast there is a pier from which it is very convenient to swim if you do not want to enter the sea on pebbles.  The number of sunbeds on the beach is large, but because there is enough space at all.  Well, the clean sea, combined with beautiful nature is beyond praise.  Every day, all kinds of entertainment are organized on the coast, so a beach holiday does not end with an idle reclining on sun loungers. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The Boran Mare Hotel leaves only the most positive emotions in the hearts of holidaymakers.  And the reason for this is the attentive and friendly staff who speak Russian.  If you experience difficulties with foreign languages, you are afraid of the language barrier, then you will definitely like this institution.  Even the animation here is in Russian. </p><p>  In general, daytime activities bring a pleasant variety to an idle holiday.  Everyone can attend yoga and water aerobics classes.  Tourists especially praise the mini club.  Children happily run into it, waiting for new entertainment.  The kids club staff also runs programs in Russian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boran mare beach kemer 5 service" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1985644.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the evenings, a mini-disco is held for kids, and for adults, exciting show programs.  Perhaps for young people who want to have fun until the morning, the animation seems weak.  But for a family holiday it is quite sufficient, because it is very important for parents to take something very interesting for their children in order to distract their attention from the tablet.  At the hotel you can forget about gadgets, as children of all ages are passionate about their activities.  What else is needed for a good holiday? </p><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  Settling happens very quickly, regardless of what time you arrived - early in the morning or late in the evening.  Tourists note that they did not charge extra for an earlier settlement or a later departure.  As a rule, all hotels charge extra for every extra hour.  But in Boran Mare, the rules are different.  Such pleasant nuances are the best characteristic for an institution.  The hotel can be recommended for a great family vacation.  If you plan to spend a vacation with children, then you simply can not find a better place. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Goynuk is a small village, so there are no special attractions in it.  Behind them it is worth going to Kemer.  But lovers of mountaineering must visit the canyon.  The gorge reaches 350 meters in height, while its width is only six meters, and the length of the gorge is fourteen kilometers.  However, not everyone can master a walk in such a place.  Part of the road passes through shallow water, so you need to have comfortable shoes that are not afraid of water.  Yes, and a swimsuit also does not hurt.  In general, a walk can be recommended to those who are ready for the fact that they will have to overcome more than one kilometer on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boran mare beach kemer 5 room description" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1985657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for Kemer, it is not difficult to get to it.  Between settlements traditional dolmushi ply.  In the city itself there are many interesting things, especially for shopping lovers.  A couple of times a week in Kemer there is a bazaar with a characteristic oriental flavor.  It is worth a visit to purchase a variety of souvenirs, leather goods, suede and ceramics. </p><p>  Kemer will also be interesting to history buffs.  Seven kilometers from the city are the ruins of ancient Phaselis.  No less interesting are the ruins of ancient Olympos.  Not far from Kemer, an ethnographic park was created in which you can see how the nomad tribes lived. </p><p>  Tourists are always impressed by Yanartash Mountain, from the depths of which a flame breaks out.  She is always shrouded in smoke.  There are several explanations for this phenomenon.  Experts say that the cause of fire is the accumulation of gases at the surface of the earth.  But there is a more fantastic version that the locals will tell you, telling an old legend. </p>
