Its width is 60 cm, height - 85 cm, and depth - 44 cm. The weight of the device reaches 59 kilograms.  However, all these figures are growing slightly due to the availability of packaging.  Together with it, width - 64 cm, height - 88 cm, depth - 53 cm. Weight - 62 kg.  If you take into account the hatch door, the depth becomes 46 cm. The legs (supports) are small in size - only 1 cm. </p><p>  The LG E10B8ND washing machine, the instruction for which is included, satisfies everyone with its size.

    <h2>  The benefits of a washing machine </h2><p>  The device works quite quietly.  It is heard only when the machine drains or draws water.  The mounts are stable, so it stands well on the floor.  Management is quite easy, understandable, with the instruction there are no problems either. </p><p>  The LG E10B8ND washing machine emits wonderful sound signals that will notify a person of the end of the wash.  In addition, the presence of a direct drive adds the advantages of this model.  The design has a minimalist bias, this allows it to fit perfectly into any interior. </p><p>  After washing, the hatch opens immediately, you do not need to wait a few minutes, many consider this a virtue.  The drum is designed in such a way that small things do not get into the gum.  Even when spinning at high speed, the machine does not jump on the floor, it stands perfectly on any surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine lg e10b8nd customer reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1294121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Technology </h2><p>  Unfortunately, some functions are not available to consumers due to the low cost of goods.  It is, for example, steam washing.  An excellent feature that allows you to get rid of excess dirt.  Consumers of fast washing, which was called Turbo Wash, are also deprived.  Drying Eco Hybrid is not available.  But this does not matter, because the <span>LG E10B8ND washing machine, the reviews</span> of which are simply amazing, is equipped with direct drive and an amazing drum.  There is a mobile diagnosis, which in most cases is effective in the fight against breakdowns.  And six movements of care will help to clean well heavily soiled things.  Even without the first three possibilities, the capricious housewives like the washing machine.  Therefore, you still need to think about buying it, especially for a small price. </p>

Also included is a small hose, which is clearly not distinguished by its length. </p><p>  After disconnecting the <span>plug, the</span> device remembers the last mode that was used.  According to customer reviews, the machine does not cancel the process, so you have to wait until it finishes work.  <span>The LG E10B8ND washing machine (</span> customer <span>reviews</span> voiced this problem) is equipped with a not very convenient door seal design.  Often, after the washing process, water remains in the gum of the hatch. </p><p>  If you listen a lot, you can hear a small whistle when the engine is running, but, as a rule, a person‚Äôs ears do not catch this. </p><p>  This model may have different names.  Index "E" (sometimes "M") indicates that the device is intended for sale in certain stores.  The LG E10B8ND washing machine has a factory name that is spelled with "F".  This is a minor minus, but some buyers are misleading. </p><p>  Many people think that there are too many programs, often housewives use only 6. They wash their everyday clothes most often with a quick wash. </p>
