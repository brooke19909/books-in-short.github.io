  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Base reinforcement - selection rules</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the construction of low-rise buildings, the strip foundation is most often used.  This type of base is suitable for relatively light small houses on dense and stable ground.  For less strong soil, columnar or floating bases are appropriate. </p><p>  Strip foundations by structure are divided into: </p><p>  - block; </p><p>  - reinforced concrete; </p><p>  - mixed. </p><p>  By installation depth: </p><p>  - buried; </p><p>  - shallow; </p><p>  - in the <span>basement of the building.</span> </p><p>  The foundation of this type is a continuous tape system, which is the support and base for all walls, both external and internal bearing. </p><p>  The most popular strip foundation is made of <span>reinforced concrete,</span> that is, with the presence of metal reinforcement, which adds strength and stability to the entire structure. </p><p>  The reinforcement for the strip foundation is selected carefully and very carefully, since this is an important stage in the construction of the building.  The choice depends on the purpose of the building and its scale.  For example, reinforcement for the foundation with a diameter of 10-12 mm is suitable for the construction of a garage, and for a house in the country this thickness will not be enough. </p><p>  Reliability and durability of a building directly depends on the quality of the foundation, and, accordingly, its component part, reinforcement, so the process of erecting the foundation and choosing reinforcement should be very strictly controlled. </p><p>  Material for foundation reinforcement. </p><p>  The reinforcement for the foundation is made of steel in the form of rods having perpendicular protrusions - corrugations.  Their task is to ensure maximum adhesion to concrete.  This steel is made by hot-rolled production technology, which significantly increases its strength and wear resistance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So what kind of reinforcement is needed for the foundation?  Builders advise using this element with a "check" mount when two rows of wire are perpendicular to each other.  It is also recommended to use bonded reinforcement, since during <span>welding the metal</span> becomes much thinner, which means that the structural strength decreases, which should not be allowed.  All wires are bonded using a special knitting gun or steel glowing wire.  The fittings should be in the thickness of the foundation, while not sinking to the bottom.  The most convenient and fastest way to achieve this is to create stability with the help of bricks and just stick the ends of the mesh into the ground.  Another method is to use special eraser holders. </p><p>  Approximate standards for laying reinforcement in the foundation are two layers of three rods in each.  But, the optimal depth of erection of the foundation itself can be determined only by carefully studying all the parameters of the soil.  Therefore, for the correct calculations of the depth and the number of layers of reinforcement, it is necessary to contact specialists who will make all the necessary calculations and give their recommendations. </p><p>  <span>Reinforcement of the strip foundation.</span> </p><p>  A trench of the required size is breaking out.  Crushed stone or sand is poured into it (the height along the perimeter should be at least 500 mm).  Then, formwork is placed above ground level (zero mark).  Then the reinforcement for the foundation is installed.  Horizontal pairwise laying is carried out with a distance between each rod of about 300 mm.  Vertical - about 200mm.  To ensure the greatest strength in the connection of jumpers, vertical reinforcement for the foundation is required. </p><p>  Concrete, whose brand is lower than M200, is not suitable for the construction of such a foundation. </p><p>  Do not forget about the need for at least three ventilation holes in the base.  This feature of installation increases the structural strength, as well as protects against deformation.  At the end of the work, the formwork is removed. </p>
