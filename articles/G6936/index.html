As a rule, everyone goes for relaxation to the screen.  However, what to do if the <span>TV does not turn on, the</span> light does not light or blink?  If a new LCD device or any other quite expensive option fails, it is clearly necessary to contact a service center.  You can also try to fix the problem yourself, at your own peril and risk.

    <h2>  What to do first? </h2><p>  First you need to inspect the equipment.  The manual describes solutions to some basic and non-hard failures.  For example, the problem of a non-switched-on TV may well be that it was connected incorrectly or the operating mode was selected, the power button was accidentally pressed or broken.  In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the power supply could burn out. </p><p>  Before you look for solutions to resolve problems, if the TV does not turn on, the light does not light, you need to determine what kind of device you purchased.  There are liquid crystal, plasma and picture tubes.  In case of small malfunctions, in principle, there will not be much differences in the repair, the only difference is in the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù of the internal design of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung TV does not turn on" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1593132.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Key failure indicators </h2><p>  Before you start troubleshooting, you must try turning on the TV again.  It is possible that the problem is in the power button, which for some reason has ceased to work stably.  The indicator can either light up or not, so you should also pay attention to it.  In the first case, the problem is definitely not nutrition. </p><p>  Often consumers are faced with this problem: the Toshiba TV does not turn on, the light is on, and there is no damage.  So what's the problem?  We will examine further in the article.  You need to pay attention to the fact that it does not matter from which manufacturer the broken TV is: the solution to the problem will be the same.  However, consumers who prefer Toshiba, Samsung, LG, Philips, unfortunately, encounter such malfunctions quite often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips TV does not turn on" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1593118.jpg" width="600"></div>

It may be that the remote control is broken. </p><p>  So, if the control button did not help turn on the device, you need to pay attention to how the indicator behaves.  What happened if it glows green?  As a rule, this is the problem that accompanies those owners who have noticed that the Samsung TV does not turn on.  The light is green when the device is in sleep mode. </p><p>  Sometimes the problem lies in the disabled "Network" function.  It should be always on.  Otherwise, the TV will not work and will stop responding to the remote. </p><p>  A flashing and off indicator indicates other problems.  They are described below. </p><h2>  The indicator is off and the TV does not turn on. </h2><p>  If the indicator does not light, and the TV itself does not show signs of life, then the problem is often a broken power supply or lack of electricity.  If the bulb just burned out, then the device would work without any problems.  Before you panic and get in touch with your master, you can try to find out the cause yourself and eliminate it. </p><p>  You should not immediately call expensive specialists if the Samsung TV does not turn on.  Is the light on?  Not?  Read the tips below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV does not turn on Supra light is on" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1593134.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The most common breakdown options </h2><p>  One of the commonplace problems is a breakdown in the outlet or lack of electricity.  Here you need to look for the resolution of the fault in the panel or in the network connector.  Sometimes the reason is a complete lack of electricity.  As a rule, in this case the whole house is disconnected.  Check that with a socket, you can use a special screwdriver or tester.  If there is no power, then go to the inspection of the machine.  To guarantee a better test result, click the plug a few times.  If this does not help, then you should call an electrician. </p><p>  If the TV is a kinescope, then a <span>blown fuse</span> may be a common cause of failure <span>.</span>  It is because of him that food ceases to be supplied.  In the event that the part in the device is located in an easily accessible place, then you can replace it yourself, without unnecessary expenses for a specialist. </p><p>  Philips TV does not turn on.  Is the light on?  If not, then it is likely that the consumer has incorrectly selected the active mode.  Many modern devices have special functions that allow it to enter a "sleeping" state.  In this case, the TV responds to the remote control.  Just go to the menu and select the ‚ÄúTV‚Äù mode. </p><p>  If the TV is connected through an extension cord, then it is worth checking its operability.  In the case when the device turns on during direct operation with an outlet, the problem lies precisely in the ‚Äúintermediary‚Äù.  It is quite obvious how this malfunction is solved - with a new or repaired extension cord. </p><p>  The TV may not turn on if it has any broken parts.  We are talking about chips or capacitors, as well as the power supply, buttons.  In this case, it‚Äôs best not to try to fix the problem on your own, because wrong actions can lead to big problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the toshiba TV does not turn on" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1592804.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other types of breakdowns </h2><p>  Quite often, owners notice that the TV does not turn on, the light does not light, and strange hiss and clicks are heard from the speakers.  Devices of different companies can, having the same problem, give completely different ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù. </p><p>  What should you pay attention to? </p><ul><li>  The TV does not turn on. </li><li>  The indicator blinks, or it completely stops burning. </li><li>  From the speakers comes hissing, whistling or clicking. </li></ul><h2>  The most common causes of this behavior of technology </h2><ul><li>  Heating of either the housing or the internal parts of the TV is the most common problem for plastic elements.  In this situation, the non-inclusion of the device, the absence of the glow of the indicator and clicks will be characteristic of a working model.  To fix the problem, just let the equipment rest for at least an hour. </li><li>  The TV does not turn on, the lamp does not light up - such nuances are characteristic of the triggered protection of the device.  As a rule, if the power supply breaks or other basic parts, the TV switches to a special mode.  This avoids the most serious problem that will result from a small malfunction.  In this case, the device is unlikely to show signs of life.  To fix the problem and switch to operating mode, you need to repair the main problem. </li><li>  The TVs will whistle and the indicator will not light up if too much load is applied to the power supply.  You can fix the problem by replacing the transformer, microcircuit or transistor, as a rule, it is they that cause a similar problem. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the TV does not turn on the light is on what to do" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1593115.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  TV Supra does not work </h2><p>  If the TM ‚ÄúSupra‚Äù TV suddenly started to click when it was turned on, and the indicator stopped lighting (or started blinking), then you should not be scared right away.  Such a problem with the models of this manufacturer is a normal phenomenon.  Quite often, it happens that the Supra TV does not turn on, the light is on, off, or blinking. </p><p>  The first thing to do is to replace the electrolytes in the chip.  As a rule, this action helps to solve the problem.  If such actions were not effective, and the above methods also could not provide the desired result, you will have to carry the device to a service center. </p><p>  About the same needs to be done if the LG TV does not turn on.  The light is on or off - this is not a significant issue.  Often, devices from this manufacturer break down due to problems with microchips. </p>
