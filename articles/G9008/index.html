Luckily for you, while most of the western world has been addicted to cars and building motorways, many European cities are focused on developing pedestrian, bicycle and public transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vovanovaque.com" data-author=": vovanovaque, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water vehicles" class="if uuid-3237884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237884.jpg"></div><p>  A city like Prague is affordable and convenient to travel.  Millions of tourists visit the Czech capital annually, and for this a well-constructed denouement is necessary.  In addition, all routes in the city are duplicated in English.  However, there are some nuances that you should know. </p><p>  To help you easily navigate this city, the article will provide detailed information on public transport in Prague.  You will find out everything you need - from buying tickets and reading municipal cards to transfers at Prague Airport.  The fare and interesting objects that you can visit during a trip around the capital will also be indicated. </p><h2>  Municipal Transport Tickets </h2><p>  The route network is quite large.  Therefore, immediately upon arrival, you must have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe means of transportation.  Despite the fact that the city is very popular, in Prague there are places where it is better to get there by public transport.  In this case, you will need to purchase a municipal ticket for travel.  It is worth noting that public transport in Prague is comfortable and modern.  It has air conditioning and free wi-fi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For one trip, it is recommended to buy one short-term ticket.  You can choose a 30-minute or 90-minute pass, depending on the duration of your trip.  After your ticket is confirmed, you have unlimited transfers between any means of public transport, including the metro system and all city trams, and buses.  Such coupons are also valid for night trams and buses, as well as for the funicular that travels to Petrin. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.08138889999999" data-lng="14.393888899999979" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/9/4/0/17940.png"></div><p>  Tickets are sold in yellow vending machines and information windows located at all metro stations.  Old machines accept only <span>Czech coins</span> (crowns), and coupons with newer devices are paid with cards.  Tickets can also be purchased at most tobacco stores, at some supermarkets and tourist information centers throughout the city. </p><p>  It is worth noting that all children under the age of 6 years and people from 70 years old can ride for free.  The cost of travel in Prague by public transport is not high.  As tourists themselves note, travel here is one of the cheapest in Europe. </p><p>  30 minute tickets: </p><ol><li>  Adults - 24 kroons (70 rubles). </li><li>  Children - from 6-15 years old 12 kroons (35 rubles). </li></ol><p>  90 minute tickets: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Adults - 32 kroons (90 rubles). </li><li>  Children - from 6-15 16 kroons (48 rubles). </li></ol><h2>  Short-term tourist routes </h2><p>  Public transport in Prague gives vacationers the opportunity to enjoy the views of the city.  In addition to short-term tickets, 24-hour and 72-hour travel cards are also available for purchase.  Depending on the length of your stay, this may be the most helpful option. </p><p>  The passes are valid for 24 and 72 hours from the moment of confirmation and are accepted on all city trams, buses and metro.  Tickets are sold in pavilions located at some major stops and in tourist information centers. </p><p>  Ticket offices are located at the following metro stations: </p><ol><li>  Dejvitskaya. </li><li>  Hradchanskaya. </li><li>  Mustek. </li><li>  Florenz. </li><li>  The Main Traits. </li><li>  Impressions of Holesovice. </li></ol><p>  Most of them work from 6:30 to 18:30. </p><p>  24 hour subscription: </p><ol><li>  Adults - 110 CZK (310 rubles). </li><li>  Children - 6-15 years old and elderly people 60‚Äì65 years old 55 CZK (240 rubles) </li></ol><p>  A 72-hour pass for all costs 310 kroons or 450 rubles. </p><h2>  Long Term Coupons </h2><p>  If you plan to stay in Prague for one month or longer, monthly, quarterly, 5-month and annual travel cards with a photo are issued.  Long-term passes can be purchased at ticket offices and tourist information centers.  There are no conductors in public transport in Prague.  Therefore, the necessary coupon should be purchased in advance. </p><p>  Fare: </p><ol><li>  Monthly - 550 CZK (850 rubles). </li><li>  Quarterly - 1,480 kroons (3,700 rubles). </li><li>  For 5 months - 2450 kroons (6500 rubles). </li><li>  Annual - 4750 kroons (12.5 thousand rubles). </li></ol><p>  Payment for travel in Prague by public transport is carried out on the coupon immediately, at the entrance.  It must be passed through the yellow recorder.  It is located at the entrance to the transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ticket Check </h2><p>  It is better not to take risks and not to travel without travel coupons.  Ticket inspectors regularly check passengers on the subway, as well as on trams and buses.  If you are caught without a valid ticket, you will be fined up to 1,500 kroons (4 thousand rubles) or 800 kroons (2200 rubles) if you pay it on the spot. </p><p>  All coupons must be confirmed by a seal, which is placed when punching a check in a yellow machine in transport.  In the metro you will find them right in front of the escalators, and in buses and trams they are located on supports near the doors.  Again, after putting a mark, such a coupon will be valid when traveling after, in any other municipal transport. </p><h2>  The action of the city car park at night </h2><p>  The modes of public transport in Prague are divided into day and night.  The first trips in the subway can be made starting at 4:45 in the morning.  Work stations until midnight.  If you travel after 12 nights, you will need to use one of the night trams or buses.  Night trams (numbers 51 to 58) run from 12:30 to 4:30 with an interval of 40 minutes. </p><p>  Their routes are much longer than daily, and it may take a long time to get to the desired place.  The night bus (numbers 501-513), works after midnight until 4:30 with an interval of up to 60 minutes. </p><h2>  Etiquette and driving rules </h2><p>  As for what you can and cannot do on public transport, the rules are pretty standard.  You can not smoke, carry weapons, there are trams and buses.  Dogs are allowed on all modes of transport, but they must wear muzzles. </p><p>  You may notice that older people, people with disabilities and pregnant women always have an advantage when it comes to seating.  It is considered extremely rude not to give up your place, and the locals will definitely point you to this. </p><h2>  Metro in the city </h2><p>  Built in 1974, the Prague metro carries about 1.6 million passengers a day and is the fifth busiest underground system in Europe.  It consists of three lines, and the construction of the fourth line began only in 2019.  Not to mention that it is fast, clean, safe and the denouement allows you to get to any point in the capital.  If you are interested in the question of how much the metro costs in Prague, then at the beginning of the article the prices for all types of travel cards are indicated.  They are universal and suitable for travel on any municipal transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justapack.com" data-author=": .justapack, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro line" class="if uuid-3237878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237878.jpg"></div><p>  Line A (Green) runs from east to west from Depot Hostivarz to Nemonice Motol.  It currently has 17 stations.  This is the line through which you can leave for the Vaclav Havel Airport and back.  Unfortunately, for the current 2019, such a route is still available only by transfer by bus, but plans to expand line A are under development.  It plans to open a direct direction to the airport by metro by the end of 2020. </p><p>  Line B (yellow) runs from east to west from the Black Bridge to Zlichin and is the longest of the three lines with 24 stations. </p><p>  Line C (red) runs from north to south from Letnany to the city border and is the oldest line.  It has 20 stations. </p><p>  Passengers can move between metro lines at the following three stations: </p><ol><li>  Mustek (lines A and B). </li><li>  Museum (lines A and C). </li><li>  Florenz (lines B and C). </li></ol><p>  At rush hour trains arrive every 1-3 minutes.  After hours and on weekends, trains arrive at intervals of 4-10 minutes. </p><h2>  How to read the metro map </h2><p>  To help you navigate the metro system, all stations have a large map in the center between both platforms.  Your current stop will always be highlighted, as well as clearly marked places where you can transfer to another branch. </p><p>  If you are looking at a map, first find your current station.  Then find the destination station.  If it is located to the right of your current location, take the train from the platform to your right.  If the final stop is to your left of your current location, take the train from the platform to your left. </p><p>  For a more complete overview of the entire metro system, see the large-scale, glazed map located in the center of each stop. </p><p>  Entering the carriage, you will see a similar map above each door, on which lines and stations are indicated.  There are even a few useful images showing stops of popular attractions such as Prague Castle and Old Town Square.  Announcements about where the composition is located are made at each station. </p><h2>  Trams </h2><p>  The Prague network is the third largest in the world, after Moscow and Budapest, and one of the oldest in Europe.  In fact, the very first carts were harnessed by horses and date from 1879.  Today, an extensive network consists of 25 day routes, 9 night and one historical.  It extends over more than 500 km and carries more than 300 million passengers a year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pragueexperience.com" data-author=": pragueexperience, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern tram" class="if uuid-3237879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237879.jpg"></div><p>  Most Prague trams run daily from 4:30 to midnight with an interval of up to 10 minutes, while some travel only at certain times, for example, on weekdays or rush hours.  Night trains (numbers 51 - 58) run from 12:30 to 4:30 with an interval of 40 minutes. </p><p>  One of the greatest advantages of tram riding is that you can see many more city buildings.  It is also one of the fastest ways to get around Prague.  Before you go by tram, you will need to buy a ticket for public transport in advance.  Yellow test machines are located inside each vehicle on supports near the doors. </p><h2>  How to read the Prague trams schedule </h2><p>  At all stops, a table of wagon numbers and their accompanying schedule is displayed.  First, find the desired number on the map.  Next you will see a list of all stops on this route.  The current station will be highlighted and underlined.  Below the current stop is a list of the remaining ones.  If you are above the current station, you are traveling in the wrong direction. </p><p>  To the right of the stops is a schedule with departure times.  The first row is the weekday schedule (pracovn√≠ den), the second on Saturday (sobota) and the third on Sunday (nedƒõle). </p><p>  In the tram, the upcoming stops will be displayed on a digital screen.  Each time a tram approaches the station, two names are announced.  The first is the name of the current stop.  The second is the name of the following. </p><h2>  Key tram routes in the city </h2><p>  The roads of Prague pass through many historical places.  Trams ride slowly.  That allows tourists to enjoy the views of the capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Historic tram" class="if uuid-3237887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237887.jpg"></div><p>  The best destinations for vacationers: </p><ol><li>  Tram routes 22 and 23 are the most picturesque in Prague. </li><li>  Directions 22 and 23 pass by the National Theater, the Staromestsk and Malostranska metro stations and then to Prague Castle. </li><li>  Route 16 passes through the river from Andela through Karlovo to the place, Namest Mira and through the Vinohrady district. </li><li>  Route 17 runs from Vysehrad to Letna Park. </li><li>  Route number 9 runs through the entire city through Wenceslas Square to the Small Town (Mala Strana). </li></ol><p>  Historic Route 91 is an old tram of the 1920s that runs from March to mid-November.  It leaves from the Vozovna St≈ôe≈°ovice stop every hour from noon to 5:30 pm and passes through the city center.  Tickets cost 35 CZK for adults and 20 CZK for children under 15 years. </p><h2>  Buses  Nuances </h2><p>  The first regular bus services began operating in 1925.  Since then, the network has expanded, covering the outskirts of Prague and areas inaccessible to the tram or metro.  From 4:20 to midnight, day buses run at intervals of 6‚Äì8 minutes during peak hours and from 10‚Äì20 minutes during non-working hours. </p><p>  On weekends, buses arrive every 15-30 minutes.  Night buses (numbers 501-513) run from midnight to 4:30 with an interval of 30 to 60 minutes.  As with the tram, the schedule is displayed at each stop and read the same way. </p><h2>  Key bus routes </h2><p>  Bus 119 connects the Vaclav Havel Airport in Prague with the Nadra≈æi Veleslavin Station (metro line A, Zelenaya). </p><p>  Currently, this is the only public transport that directly connects the airport and the city center.  Bus transportation in this direction will be the best solution if you need to quickly and inexpensively get to the city. </p><h2>  How to get from the airport to the city center </h2><p>  If you are visiting Prague, most likely your first stop is the Vaclav Havel Airport (Letishte Vaclav Havel).  Ruzyne International Airport, located about 12 km west of the city center and consists of two main passenger terminals: </p><ol><li>  Terminal 1 (flights outside the Schengen area). </li><li>  Terminal 2 (flights within the Schengen area). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="czech-transport.com" data-author=": czech-transport., "><img itemprop="image" alt="international Airport" class="if uuid-3237880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237880.jpg"></div><p>  Although there are several ways to get from the airport to the city center and back, many tourists are advised to use the public transport system.  Prague bus stations are located near the city center.  This is the fastest and cheapest way to get to the right area.  Below are options for how else you can get into the city. </p><h2>  Taxi or Uber from city to airport </h2><p>  Private transport is also not inferior in popularity.  The cost of a taxi from the airport to the city center will cost you about 25 euros (1,500 rubles) and will take 30-45 minutes, depending on traffic jams.  For a slightly cheaper option, Uber will be priced from 15 to 20 euros (1 -1.2 thousand rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague.fm" data-author=": prague, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taxi in the capital" class="if uuid-3237890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237890.jpg"></div><p>  The average cost of a taxi in the city will be around 10 euros (700 rubles).  At rush hour it is better to use public transport.  Prague taxi is very busy.  There are very few drivers in the summer and winter seasons, and they are constantly busy due to the influx of tourists. </p><h2>  Airport shuttle </h2><p>  A shuttle service to the Prague airport or bus station offers relatively cheap public transport connections to the city center.  This service is provided at both terminals and is available only upon reservation.  It costs about 6 euros per person (450 rubles), and each passenger is allowed two standard pieces of luggage. </p><p>  The final stop is at N√°rodn√≠ 40, next to the Premiant Tour kiosk.  It is a short walk from Wenceslas Square and next to the metro lines A (green) and B (yellow), which are accessible through the entrance of M≈Østek. </p><h2>  Public transport to the airport </h2><p>  Regular public transport is the fastest and cheapest way to get to the city center.  A 90-minute ticket costs 32 kroons (90 rubles) and is valid on all city buses, trams and the metro. </p><p>  The cars are located at the bus stop in front of Terminal 2 (exit D) and accept Czech coins (kroons) or a credit card.  You can also buy a ticket at the Prague public transport kiosk in the arrivals hall. </p><p>  In any case, make sure you buy a 90-minute ticket for 32 crowns for adults and 16 crowns (48 rubles) for children.  This time is enough for the whole trip.  Experienced travelers are also advised to take a free city map at the Prague public transport kiosk before leaving the arrivals hall. </p><p>  Bus 119 to the city center leaves every 6 minutes.  The first and last bus runs from 4:23 to 23:42, including weekends.  Immediately after you boarded the bus, confirm your ticket in one of the yellow vending machines at the racks near the doors.  From the moment of confirmation, your coupon is valid for 90 minutes. </p><p>  Stay on bus 119 to the final stop on N√°dra≈æ√≠ Veleslav√≠n (metro line A, Zelena).  It takes about 15 minutes.  After that, take your bags and go to one of the entrances to the metro.  On the platform, wait on the right side of the metro heading towards the city center. </p><h2>  Express bus </h2><p>  Such a bus is a little more expensive, but more convenient, since it does not require a transfer.  Tickets cost 60 CZK (160 rubles) or 30 CZK (80 rubles) for children, they can be purchased at the terminal or from the driver. </p><p>  The bus runs between the airport and the main railway station in Prague (Praha Hlavni Nadrazi) from 5:30 to 21:00 with an interval of 15 to 30 minutes.  The queue for him is usually small.  Schedules may vary depending on the season.  Tourists recommend immediately checking it at the exit of the railway station or airport. </p><h2>  Funicular </h2><p>  Funiculars are also an integral part of the metropolitan integrated transport system.  These cable cars connect the √öjezd ‚Äã‚Äãtram stop.  They began to function again in April 2016 after a lengthy reconstruction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.feelhome.cz" data-author=": feelhome, "><img itemprop="image" alt="City funiculars" class="if uuid-3237893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/3237893.jpg"></div><p> Such vehicles have a length of 50 meters and move at a speed of 4 m / s.  One way ticket costs only 24 kroons.  The Prague funicular operates from 09:00 to 23:30.  In summer, it runs every 10 minutes, and in winter - every 15 minutes in both directions.  Transport is part of the capital's public transport network, so you can use the same tickets and travel cards that are used in the metro, trams and buses to travel on it. </p><h2>  Water vehicles </h2><p>  The Prague integrated transport system provides several ferries across the Vltava River.  Since it almost never freezes, some ferries operate year-round.  This type of transport is used mainly by tourists.  Its routes pass in historical and picturesque places. </p><p>  Typically, such crossings are used in order to get to Troy Castle and Prague Zoo.  Transport is presented in the form of small covered boats for up to 50 people.  River canals run throughout the capital.  Therefore, the boat is calmer and faster you can get to the right place.  However, water transport in Prague runs much less frequently, and the number of tourists who wish to ride it is large. </p><p>  The average price of an adult ticket is 180 CZK, for children 100 CZK.  In the city center, where the marinas are located, there are also private companies that offer picturesque excursions along the rivers of the capital.  However, the price of such a route will be several times more expensive. </p>
