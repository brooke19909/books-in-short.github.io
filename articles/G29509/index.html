Depending on the needs, a person chooses a specific model.  Consider the main characteristics and how to choose a web camera and what features of the device to pay attention to first. </p><h2>  Features of the technique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Autofocus - dynamic picture" class="if uuid-2322824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2322824.jpg"></div><p>  Skype is not possible without such a device on a computer as a webcam.  In addition, these are unlimited opportunities and communication with relatives and friends who are not nearby right now. </p><p>  But before choosing a camera for your computer, you should familiarize yourself with the characteristics of a particular model.  After all, the video image must be of high quality, and the picture should not go slower than the sound.  In this case, the device must have high performance and good parameters. </p><p>  If necessary, a web camera can be used not only for communication, but also for video or photography. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Webcam Models" class="if uuid-2322828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2322828.jpg"></div><p>  Before choosing a <span>web camera with</span> or without a <span>microphone</span> , you should familiarize yourself with its characteristics and features of each model. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What features should I pay attention to first of all? </p><ol><li>  Matrix (maybe with CMOS or CDD technology, experts note that the second type has the best quality, but costs a high price category). </li><li>  Resolution (similar to what digital cameras have, the most popular resolution is 0.3 MPh, although now there are new products with a higher resolution, where the picture comes out much better). </li><li>  Sensitivity to light (devices with higher parameters allow video recording in the dark, such models come with infrared illumination). </li><li>  The number of frames (in order for the video and sound to go without hanging, a sufficient number of frames per second can be no more than 20). </li><li>  Connection (almost all devices are available without a USB port, but there are options with connecting to USB2, they are characterized by high speed). </li><li>  Focal length (a feature that is only available on expensive models). </li><li>  The ability to take pictures (there are in many models, even in budget ones, but may differ in quality, which is somewhat inferior to analogs in digital cameras). </li><li>  Microphone (for this you will need to additionally install drivers in order to record sound). </li></ol><h2>  Kinds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.logitech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of webcams" class="if uuid-2322823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2322823.jpg"></div><p>  There are several types of devices, you need to familiarize yourself with the characteristics of them before choosing a web camera and making a purchase. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Webcams Full HD and higher </p></td><td><p>  A matrix with the ability to perceive a picture in Full HD quality format and above makes it possible to obtain a clear and realistic image, a variety of colors and sharpness at height.  It is characterized by stability, the ability to focus individual objects, equipped with infrared illumination and ultra-sensitive microphones. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Webcams with a microphone </p></td><td><p>  The sound reproduction quality depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, which is built into the camera, the automatic adjustment of sounds and stereo quality are important. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Autofocus webcams </p></td><td><p>  When recording pictures in motion, there must be a quality focus that can catch the smallest movement and transmit in sufficient quality.  Then such a video is easier to process. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Webcams with headset included </p></td><td><p>  An excellent two-in-one marketing move, but often in this combination the headphones are of poor quality, so when choosing a headset, it is necessary to check for operability. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Close-up webcams </p></td><td><p>  A necessary function that protects the glass on the camera from sunlight and protects against damage and scratches. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Webcams with USB </p></td><td><p>  The speed of information transfer depends on this connection. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Webcams for Windows </p></td><td><p>  The largest operating system, which has many functions for the subsequent processing of video and photo without installing additional equipment. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Tracking webcams </p></td><td><p>  A necessary option for video surveillance indoors, but in this case the camera shoots video from one angle, without the possibility of rotation and most often without sound </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Any device, regardless of model, may have additional characteristics.  Before choosing a webcam, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the functionality, both primary and secondary, of the selected model. </p><p>  For medium and lower cost webcams, the focus is fixed at a distance of up to 2 m from the lens.  It can be configured both manually and automatically.  Video bloggers note that autofocus is a great option to make shooting more dynamic. </p><p>  If you plan to conduct video conferences using the device, then audio beading should be selected with stereo audio support.  If the camera does not have a built-in microphone, then any headset will come in handy to the computer. </p><p>  Most webcam models are attached to the computer with a clothespin.  It is important here that the bracket securing the device to the monitor is made of high quality and durable materials. </p><h2>  Selection rules </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.deskdecode.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The microphone is responsible for sound quality." class="if uuid-2322826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2322826.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a suitable device, it is worth considering many factors.  Experts recommend that before choosing a webcam, pay priority attention to the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  purpose, that is, the purpose of use (only having decided on what the device is for, you can evaluate its characteristics by the selected parameters); </li><li>  appearance and mount (the most suitable option for a flat monitor is a device with a clothespin); </li><li>  cord length (for a computer, you need to choose models with a long cord; for a laptop, an option with a shortened cable is suitable); </li><li>  high resolution (before choosing a webcam for skype, you should evaluate the quality of the image and video transmission, the higher the resolution, the better the picture); </li><li>  pay attention to the ability to configure the camera (the more options you can configure different functionality, the better); </li><li>  it is better to choose a microphone with a noise reduction function; </li><li>  with infrequent use of the camera and only in household use, options from the average price category are suitable, for online conferences it is worth taking a closer look at more expensive analogues. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacturers and prices </h2><p>  To answer the question of how to choose a good webcam, you should familiarize yourself with the manufacturers that are represented on the market.  At the moment, companies such as Logitech, Genius, Creative stand out in this niche.  They have the largest number of diverse models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.logitech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connection Methods" class="if uuid-2322825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2322825.jpg"></div><p>  The price category is also diverse.  It all depends not so much on the manufacturer‚Äôs company, but on the main and additional functionality of the device.  <span>The price</span> range varies from 200 to 10 thousand rubles.  Before choosing a web camera for your computer, you should not be guided by the price, but by the characteristics of the device, because not always the most expensive option will be better and more convenient to use. </p>
