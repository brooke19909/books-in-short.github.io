  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vocation of the Varangians as a key stage in the formation of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The formation of the Russian state is inextricably linked with such an event as the <span>calling of the Varangians to Russia.</span>  Today, there are heated discussions between historians about whether this event takes place in the history of the country or whether it is skillfully invented by chroniclers.  First you need to figure out who these very Vikings are - the descendants of Russian princes.  According to the theory of some scientists, the Scandinavian Vikings were called Varangians in antiquity.  From some sources, the Byzantine origin of the Vikings is also known.  This term refers to warriors who are in a special position at the court of the Byzantine emperors, starting from the 11th century.  According to ancient Russian sources, mercenaries from across the sea (in this case, the Baltic) were considered Varangians, regardless of their nationality. </p><p>  According to the annals, in the fall of 862 the calling of the Varangians happened, this date, of course, is rather arbitrary, however, it is it that appears in many written sources of those years.  The main source, which contains detailed information about the origin of this event, is The Tale of Bygone Years.  However, the Vikings in Russia appeared long before their calling.  It is known that, starting from the ninth century, Slovenian tribes, Chud, Krivichi and others regularly paid tribute to the soldiers who came from across the Varyazhsky <span>(Baltic) Sea</span> , that is, the Vikings.  By 862, these warriors were expelled from Russian lands by the combined forces of Slavic tribes, however, shortly after this event, fierce internecine wars began between the tribes themselves.  It was then that their representatives decided to call on the prince from the side and went in search of him overseas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first Varangians called to rule in foreign lands were three brothers: Rurik, Sineus and Truvor, who occupied the cities of Izborsk and Ladoga, as well as the shores of White Lake.  By the way, today there is a certain point of view according to which the names Sineus and Truvor are fictitious chroniclers.  At the same time, there are many sources indicating that these names really existed and were very common among the ancient Scandinavians.  Management of the first princes of the land was to collect tribute from them in favor of maintaining the army in case of war.  In 864, <span>Prince Rurik</span> moved from Ladoga to the new and well-fortified city of Novgorod and gave the Kraichi capital Polotsk, Beloozero, Murom and Rostov to the board of directors.  This distribution of land contributes to the formation of the first in the north of Europe autocratic state called Upper Russia.  Thus, the Varangians were called to the Russian lands and the rule of <span>the Rurikovich dynasty,</span> which ruled the country right up to the end of the 16th century, was laid. </p><p>  This event does not cease to excite the minds of modern scholars and history buffs.  For example, in the chapter ‚ÄúTales of Bygone Years‚Äù devoted to calling, you can find a lot of contradictions.  If the Varangians were expelled from the Russian lands, why did they decide to turn to them for calling the prince?  Historians explain this strange behavior of our ancestors as follows: the tribes, freed from the requisitions of some invaders, were preparing for a new, more crushing onslaught of others.  The threat of the attack of the Scandinavians on the northern Russian lands was very real.  The calling of the Varangians to rule and the choice of Rurik as a manager contributed to the preservation of peace in the Slavic lands, and also protected them from attacks by previously hostile Scandinavians. </p><p>  The formation of the Russian state is associated with the name of Rurik.  The existence of this historical figure today is confirmed by many facts, however, disputes about who Rurik really was are still underway.  Some scholars identify him with a wandering Danish knight R√∂rik, who was an excellent warrior and bravely served his masters, competently defended their lands and made successful raids on the lands of neighbors.  By the time the Varangians were called to the Russian lands, Rorik had gained invaluable experience as a diplomat, commander and adventurer.  Perhaps it was he who was called as a prince by the envoys of ancient Russian tribes. </p><p>  Despite all the disputes of scientists about whether the elders of the tribes did the right thing, calling on the foreigner to rule their lands, this event had a great influence on the development of the country as a whole.  The Varangians brought with them good weapons that could protect against the onslaught of the enemy, perfect ships, contributed to the organization of trade between Russia and other European states.  At the same time, they received honey, wax, and grain from the Slavic peoples.  The Scandinavians were enriched with Arabic gold, which poured into their lands along the famous sea routes ‚Äúfrom the Vikings to the Arabs‚Äù and ‚Äúfrom the Vikings to the Greeks‚Äù. </p>
