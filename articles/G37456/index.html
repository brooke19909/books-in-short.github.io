    <h2>  History of soap making </h2><p>  Using soap every day, we know very little about it, as a rule, this knowledge is limited to issues related to its use.  Meanwhile, it is an ancient subject and has a very interesting history.  According to the existing legend, the first washing properties of soap components were used in Rome. </p><p>  On the mountain of Sapo existing there, rituals of sacrificing animals to the gods through their burning were performed.  In the rain, ash from the fire and the fat of dead animals were washed away into the river.  Over time, people noticed that clothes were washed in this river much faster than in others. </p><p>  The start of soap production can be dated to the 6th century BC.  e, and the first soap makers are Phoenician and Gallic tribes.  If you rely on written sources, the first records of soap date back to the 1st century AD.  The most common activity was in the places where the raw material base existed, namely, where there was a lot of soda, olive oil, fats and wood for burning and obtaining ash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Soap composition </h2><p>  To create soap, it is necessary to have certain components available, if at least one is missing, then nothing will work: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soap base homemade soap recipes" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25481/626612.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  - fat or oil, it does not matter if they are of animal or vegetable origin; </p><p>  - alkali (caustic soda); </p><p>  - water. </p><p>  The process of making soap is very simple - to connect all the components and wait for the soap to solidify.  They used to do this, but today, with a huge choice, certain requirements are put forward for soap, especially manual robots, including aesthetic ones.  Although the production process is simple, however, there are many secrets, as, indeed, in any business.  Despite the fact that the composition of the soap does not include many components, people still managed to make it easier for themselves to create it at home.  So there were <span>recipes for handmade</span> soap from a soap base. </p><h2>  What is a soap base </h2><p>  In the process of soap making it can be called the beginning of all principles.

Most often, buyers of such soap seek to purchase a natural product, without chemical additives, but today it is difficult to create it so that it meets all the requirements, and even at an affordable price.  It is for this reason that the soap base is in demand among fans of creating soap at home. </p><h2>  We make soap.

    <ol><li>  Soap base (transparent) - 100 g. </li><li>  Honey food flavoring - 4-6 drops. </li><li>  Refined jojoba oil - 0.25 tsp. </li><li>  Natural honey - 0.5 tsp. </li></ol><p>  1. It is necessary to determine the right amount of base. </p><p>  2. We cut the soap base.  It is possible on cubes, it is possible to grate on a coarse grater.  Melt.  To do this, you can use a microwave or gas, but you must remember that in no case should the base boil.  And the optimum temperature is 60-65 degrees.  A good helper in maintaining the temperature for you will be a thermometer, preferably an electronic one. </p><p>  3. Add oil, flavor, honey.  It is important to adhere to the doses given in the recipe, since excess components can affect the quality of the soap and its ability to harden. </p><p>  4. If in the future it will be necessary to add dye to the soap, then this must be done carefully.  Firstly, for uniform distribution over the soap, the latter must be constantly stirred, and secondly, so that the soap does not ‚Äúpaint‚Äù in the future, it is important not to overdo it with the quantity. </p><p>  5. The mixture must be thoroughly mixed with a small whisk or wooden sticks and, spilling into molds, allowed to cool.  In this case, spilled liquid can be sprinkled with alcohol to avoid the formation of bubbles. </p><h2>  Soap Supplements </h2><p>  If you want to make colored inserts, for example, flowers, shells, etc. into soap from a soap base, it is better to take handmade soap recipes with a transparent base.  The inserts themselves are made by means of special forms, while a white base can be used.  Inserts are made on the same principle as soap: </p><ol><li>  Cut the soap base. </li><li>  Melt, not bringing to a boil. </li><li>  Add paint (if the liners are of different colors, then the mass should be divided before painting) </li><li>  Allow to freeze. </li><li>  It can be additionally coated with pearl paint. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soap from the basics recipes soap making recipes" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25481/626598.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  To add liners to the soap: </p><ol><li>  Melt the soap base. </li><li>  Add all ingredients indicated in the soap recipe. </li><li>  Pour a small layer of liquid into the mold. </li><li>  Insert liners into it.  If there are fears that they will melt, then you can first place them in the refrigerator. </li><li>  Pour the rest of the liquid, while cooling it a little, stirring with a spatula, and pour, without getting a jet on the liners. </li></ol><h2>  Handmade soap recipes from a soap base </h2><p>  Handmade soap can be made with various additives.  They may be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Clay. </li><li>  Almond bones. </li><li>  Coffee. </li><li>  Juices. </li><li>  Dried flowers. </li><li>  Oils, honey. </li><li>  Milk. </li><li>  Berries of sea buckthorn and not only. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soap from the basics recipes soap making recipe" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25481/626605.jpg" width="422"></div></li></ol><p>  Perhaps the recipes for handmade soaps from a soap base with the addition of dried flowers will cause difficulty in understanding.  But there is absolutely no difficulty in making such a soap.  For example, consider a recipe with the addition of calendula flowers: </p><ol><li>  Soap base (white) -50 g. </li><li>  <span>Clary sage essential</span> oil - 0.25 tsp. </li><li>  <span>Food coloring</span> brown 3-4 cap. </li><li>  Calendula dried flower - 1 or 2 tbsp.  l </li><li>  Form and mixer. </li></ol><p>  1. For the preparation of the broth - 100 ml of water, boiled and 1 tbsp.  l  colors.  Give the broth stand up to two hours. </p><p>  2. Melt ¬Ω of the soap base.  Add to the base a decoction of calendula and 2 or 3 drops of paint.  Beat the base and all components without removing from heat until the mass increases.  The broth should be added carefully, since the soap in the future can be very fragile.  Yes, and whipped, it is also fragile </p><p>  3. Pour the mixture into the mold by filling it halfway, but this must be done quickly so as not <span>to let the soap</span> freeze. </p><p>  4. Prepare the second part of the soap in the same way, but add 1 drop of the dye. </p><p>  5. Pour the second part of the soap into a mold already poured.  Garnish calendula flowers from the decoction with flowers, while they should be slightly "drowned" in soap. </p><p>  Having cooled the soap, you can use it. </p><h2>  Handmade soap reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, recipes for handmade soap from a soap base are in great demand.  A lot of people study them and try to create </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make soap from a soap base with your own hands" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25481/626624.jpg" width="385"></div>  soap yourself.
