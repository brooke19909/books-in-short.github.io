    <h2>  Background of colonization </h2><p>  Until the fourteenth century, Spain fought for its independence.  From the south and east, Moors and Saracens constantly arrived on their lands.  Long centuries of struggle eventually ended with the final expulsion of the Arabs from the continent.  But after the victory, many problems immediately opened up.  Waging war for several centuries, Spain created several orders of chivalry, and there were many more soldiers than in any country in Europe.  The rulers of <span>the Habsburg dynasty</span> understood that sooner or later this would lead to social rebellion.  The greatest danger, in their opinion, was the landless younger sons of the knights - the hidalgo. </p><p>  First, in order to direct their thirst for a better life in the direction necessary for the government, a crusade to the East begins.  However, the Saracens show fierce resistance, which forces the crusaders to retreat.  The colonies of Spain in Africa were small and practically did not bring any profit.  At this time, various goods from India were extremely sought after. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="former colonies of spain" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1455173.jpg" width="405"></div>  According to Europeans, this continent was not only in the east, but also in the south.  Therefore, expeditions were regularly equipped to find the shortest path to it.

At the end of the summer of 1492, three ships came out under the Spanish flags.  They were equipped from the treasury of several European countries.  In the middle of autumn of that year, Columbus landed in the Bahamas.  Four months later, the <span>island of Haiti</span> was discovered <span>.</span>  In search of gold, the Spaniards sometimes went to land and moved deep into the jungle.  On their way, they met resistance from local tribes.  However, the level of their civilization lagged behind the European by several centuries.  Therefore, the conquistadors, clad in steel armor, had no difficulty conquering the natives. </p><p>  Eight years later another expedition sailed, already consisting of a one and a half thousand crew with provisions.  They surveyed a large part of the coast of South America.  New islands were discovered.  After this, an agreement was concluded between Portugal and Spain, according to which the new lands were equally divided between the two empires. </p><h2>  South America </h2><p>  Initially, the Spaniards began to explore the west coast of America.  This is the territory of modern Brazil, Chile, Peru and other countries.  The new lands established the Spanish order.  Administrations settled in large settlements.  Then the armed detachments set off to conquer new lands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colony spain list" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1455174.jpg" width="600"></div>  Then migrants arrived from Europe.  The local population, in particular Bolivia, was taxed.

These are gold, silver and various spices.  If it was not always possible to get to gold, then the conquistadors found plenty of silver.  Loaded ships monthly arrived at the port.  A huge amount of imports ultimately led to the decline of the entire empire.  Inflation began, which led to poverty.  The latter gave rise to several uprisings. </p><h2>  North America </h2><p>  The colonial countries of Spain had some sovereignty.  They obeyed Valladolid on federal rights.  On occupied lands, Spanish culture and language developed.  In the colony of Rio de La Plata, problems were brought by local Indians.  They hid in the jungle and occasionally raided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="countries of the colony of spain" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1455175.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, the government of the Viceroyalty had to hire soldiers from neighboring colonies to fight the partisans, who, in addition, also organized robberies and pogroms.

    <p>  For four decades, the Spanish colonists managed to open more than twenty colonies in the New World.  Over time, they united into large vice kingdoms.  In the north was the largest colony - New Spain, which was opened by Hernan Cortes - a legendary person who is often associated with the mythical city of Eldorado. </p><p>  Prior to the active intervention of Great Britain, conquistadors created colonies of Spain along the coast of South and North America.  List of modern countries that used to be colonies of Spain: </p><ul><li>  Mexico. </li><li>  Cuba. </li><li>  Honduras. </li><li>  Ecuador. </li><li>  Peru. </li><li>  Chile. </li><li>  Colombia. </li><li>  Bolivia. </li><li>  Guatemala. </li><li>  Nicaragua. </li><li>  Part of Brazil, Argentina and the USA. </li></ul><h2>  Administrative device </h2><p>  The former colonies of Spain in this area are the USA (southern states) and Mexico.  Unlike the colonies on the southern mainland, here the conquistadors met a more developed civilization.  Once upon a time, the Aztecs and Mayans lived on these lands.  They left behind a huge architectural heritage.  Cortes expeditionary forces met with highly organized resistance to colonization.  In response, the Spaniards acted extremely brutally against the indigenous population.  As a result of this, its number was rapidly declining. </p><p>  After the creation of New Spain, the conquistadors moved west and founded Louisiana, East and West Florida.  Some of these lands were under the control of the metropolis until the nineteenth century.  But as a result of the war with the <span>United States of America,</span> they lost everything.  Mexico defended its freedom a few years before. </p><h2>  Orders in occupied territories </h2><p>  Power in the colonies was concentrated in the hands of the Viceroy.  He, in turn, was personally subordinate to the Spanish monarch.  The Viceroyalty was divided into several areas (if it was large enough).  Each region had its own administration and church diocese. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="countries former colonies of spain" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1455176.jpg" width="300"></div>  Therefore, many former colonies of Spain still profess Catholicism.  Another branch of government was the military.  Most often, the backbone of the garrison was knight-mercenaries, who after some time returned to Europe.

    <p>  High immigrants in the kingdoms could only come from the mother country.  These were hereditary nobles and wealthy knights.  The descendants of the Spaniards born in America, according to the law, owned the same rights as representatives of the metropolis.  However, in practice they were often oppressed, and they could not occupy any high position. </p><h2>  Relationship with the local population </h2><p>  The local population was made up of representatives of various Indian tribes.  Initially, they were often subjected to murder and robbery.  However, later the colonial administrations decided to change their attitude towards the natives.  Instead of robberies, it was decided to exploit the Indian population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="was spain a colony" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1455178.jpg" width="600"></div>  Formally, they were not slaves.  However, they were subjected to some harassment and were subject to high taxes.  And if they did not pay them, then they became debtors to the Crown, which did not differ much from slavery.

    <p>  The colonies of Spain adopted the culture of the mother country.  At the same time, this did not cause an acute conflict.  The local population is very willing to adopt the traditions of Europeans.  For a fairly short period, the natives learned the language.  Assimilation was also facilitated by the arrival of the lone Hidalgo Knights.  They settled in the vice kingdoms and married <span>Indian women.</span>  What is the colony of Spain, is best seen on the example of Louisiana. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are colonies of spain" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1455179.jpg" width="600"></div>  Indeed, in this Viceroyalty for several decades, feudal relations have developed between the local population and the administration.

    <h2>  Colony loss </h2><p>  The crisis in Europe peaked in the eighteenth century.  Spain started a war with France.  Inflation and civil strife led to the decline of the empire.  The colonies took advantage of this and began to wage war of liberation.  Moreover, in some cases, the driving force was not the local population, but the descendants of the former colonists, many of whom were assimilated.  Many historians are wondering if Spain was a colony of its viceroys.  That is, the hostage profits from distant lands.  Probably.  And soon she tried to maintain influence in American lands at all costs.  After all, after their rejection, Spain itself almost fell apart. </p>
