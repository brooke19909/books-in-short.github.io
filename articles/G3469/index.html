    <h2>  About accommodation </h2><p>  So, the Bavico Nha Trang Hotel, located just 500 meters from the famous Alexander Yersen Museum and 30 kilometers from Nha Trang <span>Airport,</span> offers several apartment options.  So, the first is a 2-seater ‚ÄúPremier‚Äù (either with one large bed, or with two standard).  Superior 2-bed apartments and deluxe apartments are popular.  There are "premium" apartments that are designed for three guests.  Family rooms are also available at the hotel - they can accommodate four people.  And the executive suite, designed for two, completes this list.  Well, the choice is rather big, but I would like to tell about all the listed numbers in all details. </p><h2>  Deluxe Double Room with River View </h2><p>  So, at the beginning it was said that the Bavico Nha Trang Hotel is a budget hotel.  And this is actually so.  For example, renting a double ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù for 14 nights will be possible for about 70 thousand rubles.  For two people, mind you!  And this with taxes, fees and breakfast included in the price!  Plus, this type of apartment makes it possible to cancel a reservation free of charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now about the conditions.  This is a modern, stylishly decorated room with modern furniture.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is rather big - 41 square meters.  You can choose from either two separate standard beds, or one, but very wide.  The windows offer a picturesque view of the river, and inside there are lots of other amenities - a telephone, a TV with cable channels, a safe, air conditioning, a work desk, sofa, parquet floor ... and that's not all!  There is also a wardrobe, a bathroom with a bath and shower, a hairdryer, free toiletries, slippers and towels.  Fresh linen, an electric kettle and a minibar are also provided.  Well, as you can see, the price fully complies with the conditions.  Inside the room there really is everything that may be required for a good rest and stay. </p>
