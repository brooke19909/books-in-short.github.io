    <h2>  Birth of the Alexander Forest </h2><p>  The first landings were laid in the XIX century, in 1876, on the lands of the Don Army as a way to combat drought, an attempt to soften the steppe climate and to increase crop yields.  The territory was expanding all the time.  Currently, the Alexander Forest occupies more than 5.5 thousand hectares, of which more than four thousand hectares are occupied by forest plantings.  These are various species of deciduous trees: oak, ash, aspen, alder, maple, acacia, mulberry, linden, birch.  The forest is surrounded by agricultural land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Forest Rostov Region" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1550518.jpg" width="600"></div>
