Options for solving the problem</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to upload music to Android?  For some, this is a problem.  Perhaps you also came across her.  And this is not surprising, since every day there is a large amount of music that you want to listen to, but there is no way to download it to your smartphone. </p><p>  It even happens that you heard a familiar tune that sounded on your friend‚Äôs phone, and you really want to transfer it to yourself.  Or vice versa, you have interesting music that you would like to share with others.  But how to do that? </p><p>  In this article, we will discuss several proven ways by which you can either download the song you like or transfer it to another. </p><h2>  Via USB cable </h2><p>  First, we‚Äôll look at how to download music to Android from a computer via a USB cable.  This is the fastest way so far.  It‚Äôs best to send an entire album, rather than each song in turn.  To do this, place all downloaded content in a separate folder (you can create a new one) and then transfer it to your phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to download music via USB" class="if uuid-2544708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2544708.jpg"></div><p>  All you have to do is connect the USB cable to your smartphone and to the computer itself.  Some devices require additional connection via smartphone settings.  To do this, go to the notification panel and check the corresponding tab, after which the icon of your smartphone (phone memory and SD card) will appear on the computer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth remembering one very important rule: after the files have been transferred to the phone, you need to unmount the smartphone in the computer itself (through the window in the lower right corner).  Only then can the cable be disconnected.  Many do not give proper attention to this and then wonder why their phone starts to slow down. </p><h2>  Through the Internet </h2><p>  But what if the USB port is broken on your mobile device or there is no cable at all?  In this case, you can download music to your phone (‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù) directly via the Internet. </p><p>  For such purposes, there are many programs that are not only very easy to use, but also available for almost all smartphone models.  You can also use the exchange sites.  They contain several tens of thousands of works of various music, which are categorized and downloaded in two clicks. </p><p>  Using such sites is very convenient, as they are adapted not only for the computer, but also, most importantly, for the smartphone. </p><h2>  Via Card Reader </h2><p>  Another way to upload music to Android is to use Card Reader.  What it is?  This is a special device thanks to which your personal computer can see the memory card (Micro SD). </p><p>  What do I need to do?  First, download all the necessary music to your computer, for example, in a separate folder, then insert your memory card (Micro SD) into the Card Reader and connect it to the computer.  Ultimately, your computer will see a memory card, and you can transfer to it all the selected music. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="myclick.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Via card reader" class="if uuid-2544712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2544712.jpg"></div><p>  What should be taken into account?  One of the most important and unchanging rules is to first disconnect Card Reader from the computer and only then pull it out of the system unit.  Otherwise, the memory card may be severely damaged or even become unusable. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that not all computers are equipped with a slot for Card Reader.  Therefore, make sure that it is on your PC in advance. </p><h2>  Through the cloud </h2><p>  Today, one of the most convenient and at the same time safe places for storing information is cloud storage.  Why?  Firstly, it does not occupy any place in the memory of your smartphone.  Secondly, only you have access to the cloud, and only you know where it is located.  In addition, if you have installed cloud storage on your smartphone, you can put a password to it in case you lose your phone. </p><p>  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what cloud storage is, what types of information storage exist, and how to upload music to Android using only the cloud. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siteofcms.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Google drive" class="if uuid-2544714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2544714.jpg"></div><p>  Cloud storage is a virtual disk with limited free space that can be used to store any content.  These include Yandex.Disk, Google Disk, Mail Disk, and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nawindows7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex drive" class="if uuid-2544719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2544719.jpg"></div><p>  In order to upload music via Android to the cloud, you must register in advance on any of the cloud storages listed above and transfer music and other files using a smartphone or even a computer. </p><h2>  Supporting Programs </h2><p>  Now consider this case: you drive a car with a friend and suddenly hear your favorite song.  But she heard from his phone.  What to do?  Take his phone with your favorite music or try to transfer it to your Android?  If your friend didn‚Äôt offend you, then it‚Äôs likely that you decide to simply download music from one device to another.  But how to upload music to Android without using a USB cable or the Internet? </p><p>  For such purposes, there is Bluetooth.  This is a standard program that is available on almost every electronic device.  With it, you can download not only music, but also any other file, for example, pictures, films and even games.  But the speed of such a transfer is quite low, so many prefer to use auxiliary programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apkmen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Support Program" class="if uuid-2544690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2544690.jpg"></div><p>  One such program is SHAREit.  Thanks to it, you can transfer a file of any size in a few seconds.  Today, SHAREit is considered one of the fastest programs for transferring content.  If you are looking for a way to download music to Android, then the best option is to install the SHAREit application, which will be an excellent auxiliary tool for your smartphone. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Let's repeat that we learned new from this article.  For example, we found out how to download music to Android from the Internet.  A lot of exchanger sites that are fully adapted for a smartphone will help us with this. </p><p>  In addition, you can transfer files through a USB cable, Card Reader, cloud storage or an auxiliary program.  Therefore, your arsenal now has many ways to transfer content from one device to another.  Choose the most convenient and start using. </p>
