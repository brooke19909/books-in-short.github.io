    <h2>  Who is this gadget for? </h2><p>  The price, hardware and software component of this phone clearly indicate that it refers to entry-level solutions or, as they are also called, budget class.  He does not have any highlight, for example, in the form of a curved display.  But there is a complete set of the most popular functions to date.  The design of this device is typical for a series of mobile phones of this manufacturer for this year.  The most interesting color variant of the case is the LG Leon H324 Titan.  Reviews highlight him as the most striking and unusual. </p><h2>  Device delivery set </h2><p>  An entry-level device initially could not boast of a good bundle.  It includes a minimal set of components, which only provides a minimum level of operability of the device, and there is definitely nothing superfluous in it.  And the equipment for this gadget is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Actually the device itself with the battery installed. </li><li>  A standard charger with a USB port. </li><li>  A universal interface cord for charging the battery or for synchronizing with a PC. </li><li>  <span>Warranty card.</span> </li><li>  Guide to use the device. </li></ul><p>  As noted earlier, the case of this gadget can be of three colors: gold, titanium and white.  All of them easily collect dirt.  Yes, and damage them is not difficult, especially stands out in this regard LG Leon H324 Titan.  Reviews confirm this without fail.  Therefore, to eliminate such problems, it is necessary to purchase a protective film immediately after purchase and stick it together with the case.  Also, the owner of such a device needs to additionally purchase an external drive.  Well, a stereo headset will also be useful.  Without it, the radio will not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Most of the front panel of this gadget is a display with a diagonal of 4.5 inches.  Above it is a speaker, touch elements and a <span>front camera</span> for video calls.  A plastic strip with the manufacturer's logo is displayed under the display.  But the control panel is moved to the bottom of the screen and consists of 4 buttons: in addition to the three standard ones, there is also an additional one that provides quick switching between active SIM cards.  On the top of the smartphone is an audio port, and on the bottom is MicroUSB.  The volume control and lock buttons are displayed on the back cover.  There is also a peephole of the main camera and LED backlight for it.  As noted earlier, there are three color options for this device: white, titanium and gold.  Users highlight the smartphone LG Leon H324 Titan.  Reviews indicate its unusual color.  Well, the "Gold" option is very similar to last year's "apple" gadget in color. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Reliable and energy-efficient processor installed in LG Leon.  Reviews highlight its low level of performance.  There is nothing more to expect from the CPU, introduced two years ago.  All this is MT6582 of MediaTek.  It includes 4 computing modules of the A7 architecture.  When solving the most complex problems, the frequency of each of them can increase to 1.3 GHz.  This is quite enough to solve most problems: reading books, listening to music and radio, playing videos, navigating, and so on.  Even with the simplest games, he will cope without problems.  But the latest generation of 3D games with the most serious requirements for the hardware stuffing of a smartphone on this device will not start: there will not be enough computing power of the CPU. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Display and video accelerator </h2><p>  Of course, the screen is one of the main advantages that LG Leon smartphone boasts against the competition.  Reviews highlight its excellent quality.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using True IPS technology.  Accordingly, color rendition, viewing angles and energy efficiency of its complaints do not cause.  Another plus of the screen is the absence of an air gap between the touch surface of the front panel and the matrix of the screen.  The display resolution in this case is 854x480.  The pixel density is 220 ppi, it is quite difficult to distinguish a single pixel.  That is, the image on the display is quite high quality.  To process graphic information, this device is equipped with a Mali-400MP2 graphic card.  Of course, it can no longer boast high performance, but it is enough to unload the central processor, which because of this only deals with software calculations and is not "distracted" by graphic information. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The quality of the photo and video of the main camera can be called acceptable.  She has a 5 megapixel sensor.  There is an autofocus system and an LED flash.  Accordingly, the photos are obtained from her of good quality.  But the front camera in this device is really modest.  She has a sensor only 0.3 megapixels.  This is enough to make video calls.  But something more is not expected from her. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Most of the questions are caused by the memory subsystem in LG Leon.  Reviews indicate a lack of RAM.  Its here is only 768 MB.  At the same time, about 500 MB of them are occupied by system processes.  The user can only rely on 268 MB.  For one or two simple applications this will be enough.  Well, if you try to run a larger number of programs, the phone will greatly ‚Äúslow down‚Äù.  A definite solution to the lack of RAM can be the installation of a special program for its regular cleaning.  But still, it would be better if there were 1 GB in the gadget.  The capacity of the internal drive is 4 GB.  About half of them are filled with system software.  The remaining volume is clearly not enough for comfortable work.  Therefore, the owner of a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù smartphone can not do without an external flash drive.  Its capacity in this case can reach 32 GB. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The capacity of the complete battery in this gadget is 1900 mAh.  Given the device‚Äôs display diagonal of 4.5 inches, a fairly energy-efficient processor and the inability to run demanding applications, the reduced battery capacity is enough for 2 days of battery life with an average level of load on the device.  With a more intensive level of use of a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone, the given value is enough for a day.  If you reduce the load on the gadget, you can get three days of battery life.  These are very modest indicators today.  A specific solution to this problem may be an external additional battery, but it will have to be purchased separately for an additional fee.  This is a significant minus, but in this case, this gadget will not let you down under any circumstances. </p>

    <h2>  Interface set </h2><p>  A typical list of interfaces is equipped with the LG Leon phone.  Reviews highlight such of them: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù is the main way to receive and send information to the Internet. </li><li>  Bluetooth is an ideal way to connect wireless headphones and exchange information with other smartphones. </li><li>  GPS allows you to turn this smart phone into a navigator without any problems. </li><li>  Full support for all existing mobile networks, including 4G. </li><li>  Wired interfaces are represented by MicroUSB and 3.5 mm AudioJack ports. </li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  One of the latest versions under the number 5.0 of the Android operating system is installed on the LG Leon H324 smartphone.  Reviews highlight this plus of it.  But this raises a rather significant problem: outdated hardware and fresh system software are not compatible.  The full potential of the latest version of Android on such a 32-bit chip cannot be revealed.  Yes, and the amount of RAM in 768 MB leads to the fact that even such simple applications as "Phone Book" and "SMS", "slow down" on this device.  Of course, a certain optimization of the program code on this device has been performed, but this is clearly not enough to solve the problem of lack of hardware resources.  MT6582 was perfect for version 4.4, but for 5.0 it is no longer enough.  And this is a miscalculation of Korean engineers. </p>

    <h2>  How much can I buy it now? </h2><p>  To date, the <span>LG Leon H324</span> smartphone is priced at $ 110 <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> indicate that the cost of this device is significantly overpriced.  A device with similar or even better hardware parameters, but less well-known brand, is estimated at $ 80.  For example, the Dodgee X5 boasts almost the same parameters (the difference in the amount of RAM is 1 GB versus 768 MB and the presence of an air gap between the sensor and the screen), but it costs $ 30 less.  This difference is critical for a budget-class smartphone; a potential buyer of such a device will certainly not overpay an additional $ 30 per brand. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  This smartphone boasts a number of advantages: a high-quality screen, impeccable assembly of the case, a fairly powerful computing platform.  But all of them are leveled by one significant minus - high cost.  The price of this device is clearly overpriced.  In this price category, the priority is lower cost with similar characteristics.  The only category that will be interested in this gadget is fans of the products of this South Korean manufacturer who highlight the color version of LG Leon Gold.  Reviews indicate a certain degree of similarity with last year's iPhone 6. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  If not for the inflated price, then it would definitely become a hit of sales of LG Leon.  Reviews on this clearly and unambiguously indicate.  But the extra $ 30 in the cost of the device is becoming a serious obstacle to this.  So it turns out that in terms of sales the same LG Leon H324 Gold loses to its direct competitors.  Reviews highlight its unusual color and high quality of the device as a whole, but the unreasonable price policy of the manufacturer prevents the active distribution of this gadget. </p>
