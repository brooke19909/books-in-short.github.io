Golden Bahia De Tossa &amp; Spa 4 * complex (Spain) is significantly removed from the beach, which is 800 meters from this hotel.  At the same time, she does not organize any transfer to the coast, so tourists should get to it daily at their own expense by taxi or walk.  But there are also advantages here.  For example, on the way to the beach you can see a beautiful panorama of a medieval castle of the 12th century, built right on the coast. </p><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  <span>The hotel was built in 2003.</span>  <span>It is located on the outskirts of the city and consists of one five-story building, from which several wings depart.</span>  <span>Next to the building is a large swimming pool and an adjacent sun terrace.</span>  <span>In total, the Golden Bahia De Tossa &amp; Spa 4 * hotel has 380 rooms, which can simultaneously accommodate up to 1000 guests.</span>  <span>You can come here on vacation with young children, but at the same time, pets are strictly prohibited.</span>  <span>Registration of guests here runs from 14:00 until midnight.</span>  <span>Leave your rooms after the rest is necessary from 07:00 until noon.</span> </p>
