After all, this allows you to study more information about the country you are going to, its features, culture, as well as find a more profitable flight option and decide on a hotel.  The last point, many tourists are advised to pay increased attention.  After all, your impressions of the vacation will largely depend on it.  Therefore, in order not to spoil their long-awaited vacation, travelers try to collect as much information as possible and study the maximum possible number of reviews of those who have already stayed in a particular hotel.  Today we decided to bring to your attention the already generalized comments of tourists from Russia who have recently visited the Phuket Orkid Resort in Thailand.  I must say that, judging by the reviews, our compatriots really liked the hotel, and they are ready to recommend it as a great place to stay for their friends, relatives and colleagues.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket orchid resort 4 phuket" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1098791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  The accommodation at the Phuket Orchid Resort 4 * hotel, reviews of which we are considering, almost all of our compatriots were quite satisfied.  According to them, their rooms were quite spacious, bright, comfortable and clean.  The furniture in the apartment is not new, but of good quality.  Guests note comfortable beds and spacious wardrobes.  As for technology, some complaints were caused by the operation of air conditioners.  So, for some guests they, they said, did not cool well, while others, on the contrary, could not set it up so that the room was warmer.  But this did not become any serious problem that could ruin the vacation.  Also, guests note as one of the features that the room keys are ordinary, not in the form of a card.  In addition to this, at the reception you will be given a key to the safe.  For many tourists, this was slightly unusual, but it did not cause any particular inconvenience.  As for the pluses, the guests liked the large balconies, modern TVs with Russian-language channels, and tea and coffee sets in the rooms.  According to our compatriots, there is no hairdryer in the apartment.  However, if necessary, you can take it to the reception.  They won‚Äôt take money from you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel phuket orchid resort 4" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1098792.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, some of the guests say that they cleaned their rooms very efficiently, regularly washed the floors, wiped off the dust, changed towels (both for the bath and the beach) and bedding.  However, some tourists claim that the cleaning in their apartments left much to be desired.  According to them, they rarely changed their bed linen, towels were reluctantly updated, and the dust was practically not wiped.  Some guests expressed the opinion that much depends on the maids themselves.  So, someone was lucky to live in a building where a cleaning lady is very responsible for her work, but someone does not.  However, in general, there were no special complaints from travelers on this issue.  If the vacationers weren‚Äôt happy with the cleaning, they could always inform the reception about it, hoping for an improvement in the situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket orchid resort 4 pics" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1098793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, the Phuket Orkid Resort Hotel rarely adheres to the checkout time when checking in.  Therefore, even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, if there are available rooms for the category you have reserved, the keys to the apartments will be issued to you almost immediately.  Tourists have found this approach a big plus.  After all, you can immediately settle in your room and begin to relax.  If for some reason you cannot be settled immediately upon arrival, there is no reason to be upset either.  After all, you can leave your things in the luggage room and take a swim in the pool, sunbathe on a sun lounger, refresh yourself with a drink in the bar, take a walk in the surroundings, have breakfast or lunch, or go straight to the beach. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  Moreover, if you plan to leave the Phuket Orchid Resort <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Phuket,</span> Thailand) only in the evening, then you can extend your stay in the apartments for an additional fee or leave things at the reception and continue to use the hotel infrastructure until the moment you leave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel phuket orchid resort 4 phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1098794.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots, when booking accommodation in Phuket Orkid Resort, chose the option that includes breakfast only.  Judging by the reviews, the guests did not regret this decision.  As for breakfast, they, according to tourists, are repeated every day, however, the choice of dishes and products is wide enough so that you do not have to eat the same thing all the time.  So, in the mornings in the hotel restaurant you can eat soup, meat and fish dishes, sausages, cheese and sausage slices, delicious pastries, vegetables, fruits, various side dishes.  Also always available drinks in the form of milk, yogurt, juices, tea, coffee.  So you can‚Äôt stay hungry here. </p><p>  During the day you can eat both in the hotel restaurant and outside the hotel.  Experienced travelers advise the second option, since it will often cost less, in addition, you can try a variety of dishes.  Tourists also recommend not to be afraid to buy food in mashinashniki (mobile food stalls).  In addition, you can always buy various products both in the local market and in supermarkets and shops, of which there are many in the vicinity of the hotel. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Our compatriots found a big plus the fact that the Phuket Orchid Resort 4 * hotel, the photo of which can be seen in this article, is located almost on the seashore.  So, to the beach you will only need to cross the road.  However, experienced travelers remind that the traffic in Thailand has its own characteristics.  Therefore, the road should be crossed very carefully, because here it is not customary to let pedestrians pass, even if they walk along a zebra. </p><p>  So, the beach next to Orkid Resort is called Karon Beach.  Our compatriots were very pleased with him.  There are no sun loungers and umbrellas, so you can sit on mats or rugs brought with you.  Also in one of the neighboring shops you can buy a sun umbrella.  Experienced tourists advise vacationers to visit Kata Beach.  It can be reached from the hotel in about 20 minutes.  According to travelers, the sea is calmer here, so spending time with children is much more comfortable than on Karon Beach. </p>
