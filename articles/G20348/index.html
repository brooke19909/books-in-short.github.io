    <h2>  Insurance company "47 Trust" </h2><p>  The construction company "47 Trust" was founded back in 1963, and therefore has vast experience and high authority among other companies in the field of construction of houses.  According to available merits, construction companies of St. Petersburg place this organization among the main leaders in the real estate market in this region.  The company operates in the northern capital and in the Leningrad region.  Moreover, it performs the functions of an investor, a general contractor, a developer, and a customer. </p><p>  47 Trest CJSC erects brick, panel, monolithic brick houses, carries out reconstruction of both individual houses and entire areas.  An example of such an excellent job is the quarter on Turbina Street.  The contest "Builder of the Year 2009", which was attended by almost all construction companies in St. Petersburg, was won by this company. </p><h2>  The objects </h2><p>  Among the facilities that were commissioned by 47 Trust, there are many truly significant.  These are residential buildings in Krasnoselsky, Petrodvortsovy, Kirovsky districts, vast quarters on at least five city streets, which value their architectural appearance, as well as a cottage village in Strelna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Few construction companies in St. Petersburg receive such high trust from the city authorities.  A residential building is currently under construction on Shlisselburgsky Prospekt.  He is not very easy to perform.  The name "Fishing Sail" speaks about this.  Also, a cottage village in Old Peterhof (Peterhof Manor), RC Romanovsky Mansion, residential buildings in Strelna are being completed.  And this is not all the projects in progress. </p>

    <h2>  Setl city </h2><p>  This development company has literally thrived on the Russian real estate market since 1994.  Reviews of construction companies in St. Petersburg will certainly put its name among the first, since today Setl City (a division of the largest holding company Setl Group) is considered one of the leaders in the investment and construction market in the region. </p><p>  The company specializes as a builder and customer, builds various real estate objects not only in St. Petersburg and the region, but also in Kaliningrad, and also carries out the development of commercial and residential real estate. </p><h2>  To keep the style </h2><p>  Among the already completed and commissioned Setl City objects belong very interesting projects.  For example, LCD Tokyo, LCD LakeHouse, LCD Nord, LCD Capital of Residences, LCD Avangard, LCD Southern Crown, LCD Continental and you can still list for a very long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Too many other facilities are currently under construction.  There are also dozens of them, and all are designed to complement the beauty of the city and support its architectural style, which not all construction companies in St. Petersburg can do so well.  The company is working in this direction very carefully and carefully. </p>

    <h2>  "Standard LenSpetsSMU" </h2><p>  The construction company Etalon LenSpetsSMU, which is part of the Etalon Group holding, operating not only in the North-West, but also in the Moscow region, was fortunate enough to be the largest developer in St. Petersburg and the region.  The organization‚Äôs track record has far more than one and a half hundred completed large projects to create residential and commercial facilities.  Etalon LenSpetsSMU JSC is not only the construction of buildings and structures, but also geological surveys, design work, and the functions of a management company, general contractor and customer. </p><p>  All the construction companies of St. Petersburg are equal to the success of Etalon LenSpetsSMU JSC.  There are always vacancies in this organization, since the field of activity is wide.  In general, in the field of construction, only the city is currently announcing about 26 thousand vacant jobs.  Etalon LenSpetsSMU is currently engaged in the construction of eight large residential complexes, including the famous Swallow's Nest, Emerald Hills, Tsar‚Äôs Capital, Jubilee Quarter and others. </p>

    <h2>  "CDS" </h2><p>  Group of companies "CDS" ("Center for shared construction") was founded in 1999 and for some time did not flourish as a small company.  However, she managed to grow and become a whole corporation, leading construction, investment activities and independently carrying out absolutely all stages in the construction cycle.  The company achieved particular success in the field of mass construction and in 2007 became the winner of the region‚Äôs prize in this nomination, and in 2009 it entered the top ten firms. </p><p>  The main activity is the construction of economy-class residential real estate with apartments of not too large a meter, but with an obligatory balcony or loggia and with a kitchen of at least 8 square meters.  Today, CDS is building at least twelve <span>residential complexes</span> in the city and its suburbs, and the Kantele cottage village in Repin.  It is impossible to list what the company has already created, since the buildings erected by the CDS can be found definitely in any district of St. Petersburg, but not in the singular. </p>

    <h2>  "Group Leader" </h2><p>  This is a diversified company.  Since 1992, she has been involved in the implementation of various production projects.  She started building houses in 2002, but not only in St. Petersburg.  The company has a much larger number of facilities in Moscow and the Moscow region.  However, in St. Petersburg it is ranked with the most successful construction companies.  Therefore, "Leader Group" falls into this list.  Since a large number of own resources allows the company to carry out construction completely independently.  All objects handed over by this company are of high quality. </p><p>  Almost all projects are individual, as they are also independently executed.  Leader-Group holds in its portfolio of finished objects more than a million square meters of housing, which was built by the company in whole microdistricts.  Also, many shopping and hotel complexes, business centers and other public buildings won praise.  The company is equally highly rated by construction specialists in Moscow and construction companies of St. Petersburg. </p>
