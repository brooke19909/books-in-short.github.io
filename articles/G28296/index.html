Hotel reviews in North Goa</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To decide whether to dare to relax in an Indian hotel with three stars, let's analyze the conditions in one of them.  For example, take the Highland Beach Resort 3 *.  This hotel is located in the Candolim resort of North Goa.  We will talk about the specifics of this state of India.  As well as about when it is best to go on vacation to Goa.  We will judge the hotel solely by the reviews of those tourists who have already managed to visit there.  This hotel is chosen by the British.  Russian tourists, as well as travelers from neighboring countries, are typed in the season no more than ten percent of all guests.  This circumstance can be considered as a plus (count on a relaxing holiday), and a minus (at the reception rely only on your knowledge of English).  In general, the hotel positions itself as a SPA hotel.  And since it has an equipped conference room, it can host seminar participants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Highland Beach Resort 3" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1171959.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  The specifics of North Goa in India </h2><p>  This is the smallest state in the country.  And in terms of population - one of the last.  But this is not the specificity of Goa, located in the southwest of the Hindustan Peninsula.  The fact is that this state has long been a <span>colony of Portugal.</span>  Therefore, it is the most Europeanized territory of India.  Catholic churches and monasteries, Mediterranean urban development - such is the surroundings of Goa.  Although there is also enough amazing India here.  This state has an unofficial border dividing its territory into two parts - southern and northern.  The full name of our hotel is Highland Beach Resort 3 North Goa.  Therefore, we will talk about the specifics of the northern part of the state.  In the seventies of the twentieth century, hippies began to settle here en masse.  Later they were joined by the rastamans and downshifters of our day.  Until now, their settlements surprise tourists.  Here you can attend parties on the ocean, listen to trance-style music, admire their simple way of life.  Prices in North Goa are lower than in South.  But the resting public is simpler. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather on goa" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1171977.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather in Goa </h2><p>  The state is located in the subequatorial climate zone.  Therefore, there are two pronounced seasons.  The first lasts from the hottest month of the year - May.  Humidity at this time is 75%, so the heat is under +33 gr.  very difficult to tolerate.  In June it gets colder due to cloud cover and precipitation.  There are a lot of them in Goa.  Rains pour from a bucket, but, which is nice, only during the monsoon.  The last season begins in June and ends in October.  Another month the weather in Goa remains cloudy.  Sometimes there is a sudden heavy rain.  Somewhere in December, the tourist season begins.  It reaches its peak on Christmas and New Year, lasts all January and February, and ends in March.  Precipitation during this period is extremely rare.  Temperatures (at night plus twenty, during the day it reaches thirty-one Celsius) are very comfortable for Europeans, and the sea calms down and does not storm.  If you go to Goa, then only from November to March. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Highland Beach Resort 3 North Goa" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1171970.jpg" width="545"></div>
