The monument is constantly in the spotlight and attracts with its own dissimilarity with other interesting structures of the resort metropolis.  Built in the distant 1914, the cottage of Stamboli (Feodosia) felt and suffered battles and perestroika.  Its beautiful buildings were enjoyed by more than one generation of local residents and visiting guests of the city.  The cottage-palace of Stamboli (Feodosia) is made in the unsurpassed style of the East.  Visually, the building immediately stands out among other buildings of the same importance for the resort town. </p><h2>  Short description </h2>

    <p>  In 1914, according to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãone famous designer from St. Petersburg - Oscar Emilievich Wegener - the cottage was built to finance one of the wealthy families of Stamboli.  The fate of the chic mansion after the military upheavals and vicissitudes of the twentieth century, it would seem, was a foregone conclusion, but today this excellent building is the pride of the Theodosians and visitors to the city. <br>  It is difficult to call this magnificent building a villa, it is more like a castle, beautifully decorated with wall paintings, gardens, marble fountains.  In the city, the cottage of Stamboli (Feodosia) is considered one of the most unusual and even mystical buildings.  This is a real monument of historical heritage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  Today it has a restaurant open, unfortunately, there is no way to admire the beauty of the castle.  The villa was built in the style of modernism in a Moorish manner.  The two-story building is made in a very rich and beautiful finish.  A variety of marble, rare woods, loggias and turrets were inseparably combined into an extraordinary creation of twentieth-century building art. <br>  The main gallery of the palace offers a beautiful view of the city's embankment and the Black Sea coast.  Dacha Stamboli (Feodosia) is the last such building on the Crimean peninsula, presented in such incomparably luxurious features. </p><h2>  Immortality lives here </h2>

    <p>  After completion of construction in Russia, a chain of negative events swept: World War I, the coup, World War II.  Subsequently, all buildings without exception were aimed at the wishes and needs of the population.  Later, despite all the attempts and opportunities to destroy the villa, it still survived.  That is why the Stamboli cottage in Feodosia is of such great importance for the whole Crimea.  Her story is amazing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Historical essays </h2><p>  The only representation regarding the copyright of the Stamboli estate plan is missing, as no documentation has been preserved.  According to existing information, the creators of the castle can be famous designers.  Four years was built cottage Stamboli (Feodosia).  A substantial investment was spent on its construction.  The building cost the owners truly crazy money.  In terms of modern currency, it cost at least one billion. <br>  Initially, they wanted to present the cottage to Stamboli's wife, Rachel Ilyinichna, on their wedding anniversary.  It was the last building created on the south coast.  Then the war began. </p><p>  The owner of the cottage did not live long in the castle.  In 1916, I. Stamboli, suspecting unpleasant events, sold all his enterprises and factories.  Together with his family, he flew abroad, opening a tobacco production there.  With great dignity, Stamboli cottage (Feodosia) survived the difficult times.  Photos, unfortunately, can only show its external greatness.  But the atmosphere that prevails here is better to be felt by visiting this place personally. </p><h2>  The fate of the cottage </h2>

    <p>  The poet <span>Maximilian Voloshin</span> proposed liquidating the cottage, the singer Kimeriy considered such buildings to be tasteless palaces in the manner of ‚Äúbathhouses, kiosks and brothels‚Äù.  These people offered to completely demolish them so as not to demoralize the tastes of people. </p><p>  In 1920, the Cheka‚Äôs office was located in the building, where captive enemies were brought in the evening.  Then they were executed. </p><h2>  Hard times </h2><p>  Later, this two-story building acted as a spa complex.  Here was opened the first sanatorium on the southern coast with 100 beds.  It was named after I.V. Stalin.  In wartime, the building of the sanatorium was again useful.  It housed a hospital for Russian wounded soldiers, and during the occupation, the injured Germans were already brought here.  The territory, which was near the dacha, was given for burial for soldiers and officers.  At the end of the war, the building and the bridge nearby were mined; they planned to blow them up during the retreat, but nothing came of it.  Strange, but the war, by some magical incident, passed over the building, although on the nearby avenue all the famous and historically important buildings were destroyed. </p><p>  Since 1944, after the liberation of the city, a children's health camp was founded in the building.  In 1952, the building was completely reconstructed; the 9th block building of the Vostok health resort was founded in it.  And until the 60s of the twentieth century, the estate of Stamboli was the border of the city of Feodosia.  Later, there was a drug rehabilitation center named after <span>A.R.</span>  <span>Dovzhenko.</span>  The changes that took place in the early 90s of the 20th century also affected this memorable monument.  For some time, a commercial bank was located on the territory of this historical monument.  In the future, a place here was taken by a cafe with the same name as the estate, which allows it to be quite popular. </p>
