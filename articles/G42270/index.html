    <h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  The advantage of this new building in Irkutsk is considered to be a ready-made widely developed infrastructure of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Only 5-10 minutes walk is separated from all necessary facilities.  Nearby are: </p><ul><li>  secondary school No. 21; </li><li>  Leonov secondary school; </li><li>  9 kindergartens; </li><li>  children's clinic; </li><li>  large supermarkets, pharmacies, shopping and entertainment center. </li></ul><p>  Among the new buildings in Irkutsk, the Vysota project requires close attention of those who are looking for an inexpensive apartment in a comfortable house with all the necessary infrastructure.  Dozens of people have already managed to purchase comfortable housing here, as evidenced by numerous reviews on the network.  Most of the people who left reviews were satisfied with their apartments.  However, the project also found drawbacks, in particular, the deadlines for commissioning were noted.  Common causes of complaints include ongoing construction under windows. </p>
