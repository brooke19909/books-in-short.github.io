The choice of a resort primarily depends on the taste preferences of the person himself.  Someone wants to settle down on the seashore in this position and spend their whole vacation, while others, on the contrary, want to get acquainted with the history and culture of the country, prefer an active and eventful vacation. </p><p>  But what about those tourists who want to soak up the warm sand, and at the same time diversify their holidays with rich excursion programs?  An excellent option in this case would be Thailand.  Its endless sandy beaches, clear sea water, stunning nature and exotic attract tourists from all over the world.  This is largely due to the popularity of the resort.  Moreover, Thailand is a great opportunity to enjoy all the delights of a beach holiday in winter, when in many cities of Russia the thermometer does not rise above 10-15 degrees below zero. </p><h2>  When to go </h2><p>  The season here lasts from November to April, when the most comfortable temperature for relaxation with a minimum amount of precipitation is set.  The weather in Pattaya in September is not so affectionate, this period falls on the so-called rainy season.  Rainfall is rarely lingering here, but nevertheless, this feature must be taken into account when planning a vacation. </p><p>  In the rainy season, tour operators reduce the price of tours.  This is a great opportunity to finally visit an Asian resort quite inexpensively.  Yes, some days of your vacation will not be the most radiant and clear, but they can be completely safely taken for excursions, visits to cultural and historical sights of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  We decide on the hotel </h2><p>  Thailand, and in particular the most popular resort - Pattaya, offers all the conditions for a bright, interesting and most comfortable stay.  Here you, of course, will not find luxury hotels located on the coast - all beaches are municipal and are separated from the city by a wide road.  Nevertheless, worthwhile options for living, distinguished by a good location and service, are still available.  In choosing a hotel, you must be extremely careful and attentive, because not all of them correspond to their description.  Before the trip, be sure to get acquainted with the reviews of real guests.  Hotel Joy Residence 3 * is often offered to Russians.  What kind of hotel is this, how comfortable is it to relax? </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, first of all, let's look at the institution, its condition and how the owners position it.  Joy Residence Hotel was awarded 3 stars in some descriptions and only 2 in others. Do not be scared, because most of them in Pattaya are modest hotels with simple furnishings.  This is a small hotel with 20 comfortable rooms, located near the Bali Hai pier. </p>

    <p>  The location of Joy Residence 3 * can hardly be called ideal, and all because it is remote from the famous Jomtien beach - is 10-15 minutes away by public transport.  Yes, most <span>Pattaya hotels</span> are located on the 2nd and 3rd coastline, but in this case, all tourists will have to spend a lot of time daily on the road.  The city-style hotel is surrounded by bars, restaurants, cafes and shops.  It is quite crowded, in the evenings clockwork music sounds, a lot of passers-by. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are an avid traveler, it will be useful for you to know that all the sights of the city, the best nightlife are quite far away - 20-30 minutes away by local transport.  The legendary night entertainment street, city pier, from where you can get to Koh Lan, the largest shopping centers, an amusement park - all this is far from being within walking distance.  If this disadvantage does not bother you, you are looking for an opportunity to relax in an Asian country inexpensively, the hotel is a good fit. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  If you are looking for a small hotel with a minimum number of residents, the proposed option will be optimal for you.  There are only 20 rooms, but each of them is equipped with a private bathroom with a hairdryer and all necessary bath accessories, as well as a chic furnished balcony with stunning views of the surroundings of the city. </p>

    <p>  All vacationers "Joy Residence" can use the wireless Internet for free - it operates throughout the hotel.  Tourists will receive a password from it during check-in.  Modern air conditioning is responsible for the freshness and coolness in the rooms - its power is enough to cool the air temperature in a matter of moments.  A TV with satellite channels will allow you to get acquainted with the latest world news, as well as watch a movie before bedtime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists note the spaciousness of rooms, the absence of interruptions in the supply of hot water.  The hotel is quite young, but the state of technology in some rooms is poor.  Tourists complain about the poor antenna, which makes the presence of a TV completely useless.  If other technical problems are found in the room during check-in, it is necessary to contact the reception with a request to fix the breakdown or relocate to another room. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted right away that the Joy Residence 3 * hotel is definitely not suitable for lovers of a calm, quiet and peaceful stay.  Despite the remoteness from the city center, it is very noisy in the evening: the cries of local residents and other tourists can be heard from vacationers.  Even balcony doors, which often also do not close well, do not save.  The only chance to escape from the noise is to move to another room, and even then, subject to its availability.  If you are traveling with young children, pay particular attention to this item. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Like most other city-style hotels, Joy Residence 3 * does not have a huge adjacent territory.  Nevertheless, all tourists and vacationers will be able to use the free parking.  I must admit that in Thailand this is especially important, because often tourists move around the city and its environs on rented motorbikes.  In this case, they do not have to worry about the safety of the rented transport. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the hotel Joy Residence 3 * there is a small outdoor pool equipped with sun loungers and parasols - a great alternative to the local beach.  If you are limited in time or do not want to go to the seashore, you can always sunbathe and swim in the hotel.  So, let's say, the weather in Pattaya in September or any other month of the rainy season does not always favor rest on the coast: the sea at this time is quite turbulent and cool. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  You can have breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  Breakfast is typical for Asian resorts: rice, sausages, cold cuts, toasts with butter, fruits, fresh vegetables, coffee, tea and juices to choose from.  In order to satisfy the feeling of hunger, it‚Äôs very good.  Within walking distance from the hotel there are enough cafes, bars and restaurants offering not only to get acquainted with the exotic of local Thai cuisine.  Here you can always taste the more familiar European and even Russian dishes.  In a word, you definitely won‚Äôt stay hungry. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  If you appreciate the friendliness of the staff, the quality of service, you will definitely like Joy Residence 3 *.  The service here, assuring real vacationers, is really great.  Rooms are cleaned daily, towels and bed linen are changed as needed.  The staff is friendly, polite, listens to the wishes of each client. </p>

From the hotel to him - 10-15 minutes by public transport.  The beach is urban, in the season a lot of vacationers gather here, but for each of them there is a place. </p>

    <p>  The beach is pretty clean, the coastal area is cleaned daily by friendly and smiling Thais.  Sunset at sea gentle, comfortable.  The sea is clean enough.  Of course, it is difficult to call it crystal clear, because Pattaya, in addition to everything else, is also a port city.  If you want to lie on the white sand and swim in the clear sea water, feel free to go by ferry to the nearest <span>island of Koh Lan.</span> </p><p>  Within walking distance is another beach - Cozy Beach.  It is not crowded, but not as well-maintained and clean as the just mentioned Jomtien.  During high tide, a huge amount of seaweed spoils the rest. </p><h2>  Let's summarize </h2><p>  If you are looking for the best value for money, the Joy Residence 3 * hotel is perfect for you.  Of course, in all you can find flaws, if you want to.  If you travel to Asia, fully enjoy the tranquility and regularity of life here. </p><p>  Of course, the hotel has its drawbacks, it is difficult to call it the best on the coast, nevertheless, for a very reasonable price, you can spend your vacation in a stunningly beautiful Asian place, enjoy its originality, culture, exotic. </p><p>  That is why we strongly recommend that you pay attention to this small, modest and rather inexpensive hotel Joy Residence 3 * (Pattaya, Pratamnak Hill). </p>
