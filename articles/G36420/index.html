But it is they who indicate what type of food abroad in hotels.  There are situations when the price of accommodation is high, here is a potential client and thinks that food is also included in this amount.  But this is often not the case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.foodiesfeed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dinner at the hotel" class="if uuid-2359933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79565/2359933.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of food </h2><p>  When traveling, you should definitely know what types of food in hotels abroad, especially if the budget is limited.  Let us dwell on eight main ones. </p><p>  BB - bed and breakfast is one of the most popular types of food in hotels.  Buffet-style meals, free drinks (tea, coffee).  This option is perfect for those who want to have a quick breakfast in the morning and continue their journey, rather than wasting time looking for a cafe nearby. </p><p>  The type of food at the HB hotel is half board.  Buffet for breakfast and dinner.  Alcoholic drinks are not included, only non-alcoholic. </p><p>  Another type of food in hotels is FB.  This is a <span>full board</span> with three buffet meals.  Alcohol is not included, but some alcoholic drinks may be served at an additional cost. </p><p>  FB + implies the same as FB, but some alcoholic beverages are available. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ALL is the favorite type of food in hotels, not because of food, but because of drinks.  Buffet for all meals (sometimes an afternoon snack).  Free local alcohol.  Other alcohol - at an additional cost or not at all. </p><p>  AIL includes the same as ALL, only the choice of drinks and dishes is not so great.  Some hotels may offer alcohol at an additional cost. </p><p>  Another all-inclusive option is ALP.  Meals are offered the same, and some alcoholic drinks that are served at an additional cost according to the ALL system are free in this case. </p><p>  UALL - the ultra all-inclusive system, that is, the maximum choice: foreign-made spirits, three meals a day, various sweets.  The hotel often has restaurants with multinational cuisine.  And for dinner, customers can choose any of them on an all-inclusive basis.  They do not need to pay extra for anything. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cleartrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lunch menu" class="if uuid-2374332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45860/2374332.jpg"></div><p>  Deciphering the <span>types of food</span> in hotels will help you quickly choose the right option. </p><h2>  No food </h2><p>  There are hotels that do not provide food at all.  RO - this is the name of this type of food in hotels.  Decoding RO means room only, that is, only a room.  Most often, these letters can be seen in offers of hostels or hotels where the price for a room is quite low.  In some cases it is possible to eat for an additional fee, but usually it is only breakfast.  This issue should be clarified when booking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Power Features </h2><p>  The most interesting question that arises when looking at the price of a hotel: is it necessary to pay extra for meals? </p><p>  If the type of food "boarding house" or "all inclusive" is indicated, then the food is already included in the price.  Usually this option is offered if you have your own kitchen or restaurant. </p><p>  In hotels of average level and above, the price is indicated with breakfast, most often it is a buffet.  Although sometimes it may not be included in the price.  Therefore, you must first discuss the issue of food, because it can be paid simultaneously with the room.  Paying it on the spot is often much more expensive. </p><h2>  Kitchen in hotels </h2><p>  To save on food, you can choose the kitchen option and cook yourself.  For example, in many hostels there is a kitchen with the necessary set of dishes and household appliances.  In addition, dishwashing detergents, tea, coffee, sunflower oil, and sauces are provided.  Often, the guests themselves leave something from the food so as not to take it back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creativecakefactory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kitchen at the hotel" class="if uuid-2359927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79565/2359927.jpg"></div><p>  Food does not have to be bought at a nearby supermarket.  In many mini-hotels, the refrigerator is filled with groceries.  For a certain surcharge, guests can use them for their own needs, and the number is not limited.  It is quite convenient, looks at home and does not hit too much in the pocket. </p><p>  However, a room with a kitchen in the hotel is a great option for those who stay in it for a long time, at least for a week.  If only a couple of days, then you need to calculate whether it is profitable to buy products in order to cook something from them two or three times. </p><h2>  Type of food depends on the resort </h2><p>  It is necessary to take into account the characteristics of the country and the resort.  For example, if it is Turkey or Egypt, it is best to have full board and all inclusive.  After all, the food in the hotel restaurant is adapted for customers.  The hotels have, of course, local dishes, sweets, but you can always find the usual food. </p><p>  Anyone who took, for example, half board, claims to have spent significantly more money.  And although local cafes often offer dishes that are familiar to us, judging by the reviews, in the East they are not very good at preparing European dishes.  In addition, many do not like the local cuisine because of the unusual taste and an abundance of spices. </p><p>  If we are talking about Europe, then you can take only breakfast.  Most often they offer continental and it is included in the price.  Other meals in European hotels are not very diverse.  And, for example, lunch or dinner costs a little less than in a cafe outside.  In addition, alcohol is not included, and its cost is the same as in the bars of the city.  But if there is no desire to look every day for lunch, of course, it is better to take food at the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafe in the city" class="if uuid-2359917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79565/2359917.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it always worth taking breakfast? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to know what kind of breakfast is offered.  If this is a buffet, then for many it is very convenient, because you can choose food from several proposed options. </p><p>  Here you also need to consider the category of the hotel.  Because they offer a rather modest selection of dishes (sausages, 2-3 types of cheese and ham, bread, hot drinks, juice).  In others, on the contrary, there is a huge selection of food, and some dishes are even prepared at the request of the client. </p><p>  If the hotel itself offers a certain type of breakfast, this may not appeal to everyone.  Indeed, in this case it will not be possible to change anything.  Fortunately, many people ask about guest preferences in advance.  For example, a client can choose between scrambled eggs and porridge or honey and jam. </p><h2>  Types of Breakfast </h2><p>  Hotels in which you can choose a certain type of breakfast must indicate this.  Many of the travelers often confuse what is included in each of them.  Therefore, we consider a few basic ones: </p><ul><li>  Continental - croissant (possibly another bun), several types of jam or honey, tea, coffee, cream. </li><li>  English - bring tea or coffee to your room.  They offer scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs and other egg dishes, bacon, sausages, rolls, jam, honey, toasts, cereals, cereals with milk. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="cookingtheglobe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="English breakfast" class="if uuid-2366789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79565/2366789.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Advanced is similar to continental, only a selection of sausages and more cheeses, there is also yogurt, cereal, cottage cheese, juice.  Buffet system. </li><li>  American - a large selection of drinks: fresh, compote, drinking water with ice cubes, cereal, pie, some meat. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.hipmunk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="American breakfast" class="if uuid-2359903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79565/2359903.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Breakfast with alcohol - wine or champagne, cold dishes, salads, soups, desserts.  Typically, such breakfast is served from 10.00 to 11.30, and on official occasions. </li></ul><p>  We hope that deciphering the types of food in hotels will help you choose the best option and not stay hungry on a trip. </p>
