    <h2>  Hedef Beach Resort &amp; SPA 5 *: photo of the hotel and its location </h2><p>  This hotel complex has a very good location on the first coastline in the resort village of Konakli.

    <h2>  Sea beach </h2><p>  The hotel has its own sand and pebble beach.  Here you can use sun loungers, umbrellas and mattresses for free. </p><h2>  Hedef Beach <span>Resort hotel</span> and SPA 5 *: 2014 reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists decide on the choice of a hotel, including on the basis of the impressions of travelers who have already stayed here.  Therefore, we bring to your attention the generalized reviews of our compatriots who spent their holidays in Hedef Beach Resort &amp; SPA in 2014. </p><p>  In general, tourists found this hotel appropriate for its price and declared star rating.  Many guests appreciated the friendly and efficient staff, well-decorated clean rooms and a large swimming pool with slides, which not only kids but also adults enjoyed riding. </p><p>  As for the beach, opinions are divided here.  Someone was very pleased with the comfortable awning, the proximity of the sea and clean water.  Someone was disappointed that garbage was constantly visible in the sand.  However, the latter fact is associated not with the sluggishness of local cleaners, but with the lack of manners of some vacationers who throw cigarette butts and other garbage directly onto the ground, without bothering to walk a couple of meters to the ballot box. </p><p>  All guests who came to rest with families appreciated the children's animation at the hotel.  So, according to them, pleasant young people entertained the children from morning till night, and the kids were delighted with this.  As for adult animation, most travelers would rate it as a solid "four." </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  As for the cost of rooms in Hedef Beach Resort &amp; SPA 5 *, it can‚Äôt be called high, despite the stated stardom of the hotel.  So, a seven-day stay in this hotel will cost you an average of 700 euros. </p>
