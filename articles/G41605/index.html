Among them was Chelyabinsk.  Experimentus, according to visitors, is the city‚Äôs most amazing museum.  In it you can (and even need) to touch all the exhibits with your hands: turn all the screws, press all the buttons and even participate in complex experiments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="experimentus Chelyabinsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136570.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And do not think that such an excursion will be interesting only to schoolchildren: among visitors to the museum you can see children from three years old, schoolchildren and their parents, students and even people of very advanced age. </p><h2>  From the history of the museum </h2><p>  The Experimentus Museum of Entertaining Science in Chelyabinsk is still very young.  He first opened his doors at the end of July 2011.  The event took place on Ordzhonikidze Street.  But, despite this, the museum became very popular not only in Chelyabinsk, but also in Russia and even beyond its borders. </p><p>  Since the opening day, the museum has been visited by guests from the United Arab Emirates and the USA, Canada and Germany, Australia and Spain, Israel and France, Slovakia and Puerto Rico, Belarus and Italy, Turkey and Kazakhstan, England and China, the Netherlands and Austria. </p><h2>  What is the museum created for? </h2><p>  The activities of the Experimentus Museum are aimed at popularizing science.  Its main goal is to clearly demonstrate that science is interesting and entertaining.  Here they will prove to you that chemistry, physics, biology and other related sciences can cause genuine interest in kids, who in these walls feel themselves to be real scientists, and adults, and sometimes even older people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ordzhonikidze street" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136630.jpg"></div>

The exposition occupies three large halls.  A careful study of the exhibits will require at least three hours, however, especially interested visitors stay here for a whole day. </p><p>  A wind tunnel, a wheel with which you can get electricity, a parabolic antenna, a magnetic labyrinth - all these exhibits not only make a huge impression, but also train.  In the Experimentus Museum you can see the real tornado, see on the thermal imager screen how the human body radiates heat waves and gives off heat, easily lift a huge, twenty-four kilogram weight with two fingers, sit on a chair made of nails and climb twenty centimeters from floor surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="experiment museum" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136554.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And if you do not just want to understand the essence of the phenomena, you will be able to experiment yourself, of course, with the help of an instructor.  For example, you can build an airplane model or learn how to tie knots in a variety of ways.  Although the Experimentus Museum is intended for children, most exhibits are delighted by adult visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is nice that the museum‚Äôs exposition is constantly changing, new exhibits made by employees of this institution appear.  The Experimentus presents many optical illusions.  The most interesting of them is the mirror.  When turned off, it is of no interest, but as soon as it is turned on, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe museum reflected in it increases significantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of entertaining science experiment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136556.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The walls of the ‚ÄúExperimentus‚Äù in Chelyabinsk are glued with drawings with graphic illusions, and many puzzles for quick wits are laid out on the tables.  In addition, you will be offered to circle the drawings only by their reflections, and this, believe me, is not so simple. </p><p>  Inertia is perfectly demonstrated by pendulum balls hanging on threads.  They create a beautiful wave.  And another pendulum, located nearby, moves randomly.  The Experimentus Museum conducts interesting experiments with electricity: those who wish can twist the handles of an electric machine and see the magnetic field with metal shavings.  The most spectacular exhibit is a large plasma ball, inside which small lightning discharges flash. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="experimentus reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136559.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Another fascinating task that at first seems very simple is to draw a metal ball through a maze with a magnet.  Here is presented not just one, but several models of ‚Äúperpetual motion machines‚Äù that have not haunted humanity for several centuries. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  For an hour in the "Experimentus" (Chelyabinsk) guided tours are conducted.  After completion, free time (hour) is provided during which the group can independently get acquainted with the exhibits and conduct experiments. </p><p>  For group visits there is a discount of fifty rubles per ticket.  For a group of children of fifteen people, one adult must be present, which is free of charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="experimentus chelyabinsk Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136553.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, Experimentus in Chelyabinsk is a great place to conduct practical classes in physics and chemistry.  Visiting it, both children and adults learn a lot of interesting things, get vivid impressions. </p><h2>  Quest tour </h2><p>  This is a slightly different tour, it is held in a new format.  The cunning anti-professor Charlatanus hid a special device creating black holes in the museum‚Äôs laboratory.  Tourists have only an hour to find it and render it harmless, otherwise a huge black hole will appear at the place where the museum is located and will drag the whole city into itself. </p><h2>  How is the quest excursion going? </h2><p>  At first, the group takes the usual, but somewhat shortened tour (30-40 minutes), after which the quest takes place in the museum.  After its completion, all children will receive souvenirs from the Experimentus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="experiment address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2136550.jpg"></div>
