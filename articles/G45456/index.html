    <p>  A bond refers to debt securities, it certifies a loan agreement between its issuer and the holder. </p><p>  Derivative financial instruments are based on price assets, which include: prices of goods or basic securities, credit or <span>foreign exchange markets.</span>  Such assets certify the holder‚Äôs right or obligation to acquire or sell the underlying asset according to certain criteria (price, quantity and time).  This group includes bills of exchange, options, bills of lading and many other instruments. </p><p>  A bill of exchange is an unconditional obligation of the person issuing it to pay the holder a certain amount on time. </p><p>  An option provides for a right, not an obligation, to acquire an asset at a fixed cost. </p><p>  Bills of lading represent the unconditional obligation of the sea carrier to deliver the goods in accordance with the terms of the contract. </p><p>  The variety of securities leads to the fact that the investor in the process of choosing investment instruments faces a wide choice.  In order not to be mistaken, choosing a method of investment, it is necessary to carefully study the investment quality of securities. </p>
