We can say with confidence that these wonders of nature are not widely known.  We will not describe everything, but focus only on one.  Rainbow Waterfall (Kaluga Region) is truly a paradise.  It attracts numerous excursions and tourists traveling alone.  The Rainbow Waterfall on <span>the Nara River</span> is located near the capital of Russia - about 45 kilometers from the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rainbow waterfall Kaluga region" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440454.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  This area is very rich in sources and keys.  They, in turn, are a kind of arteries that connect with each other and form a giant stream, falling from a height of five meters.  Nara - the left tributary of the Oka River - originates in Lake Peletsky.  In this area, the water stream makes a sharp bend.  This enables the observer to admire the unique views opening onto the Rainbow Waterfall.  In the valley, which occupies a small territory, seven springs rise outward. </p><h2>  Uniqueness </h2><p>  It is impossible to perceive the flow breaking down as a stream.  Rainbow Waterfall is an amazing natural phenomenon.  And the picturesque surroundings regularly attract guests here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rainbow waterfall on the Nara river" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440470.jpg" width="236"></div>  The waterfall includes the Nara bend with a high steep left bank, and the <span>indescribable beauty of the</span> valley, which is surrounded by high hills.  It really amazes with its magnificence.  The waterfall is relatively small, located in the thickets.  Only three streams flow from there.  Rainbow waterfall flows along the slope of the mountain, densely covered with green moss.  The water in it is icy, and fast streams spray in all directions.  The source spring originates very high and goes down, making a pleasant murmur.  Further, a steep cliff appears on its way, and it rapidly breaks down already as a waterfall.  The bend of the river itself creates an exceptional setting for it.  On a bright sunny day, it shimmers like a perfect multi-faceted diamond.  If you watch him at such moments, then you can easily understand why he was nicknamed Rainbow.  This is truly the greatest jewel created by nature itself. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rainbow waterfall how to get" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440455.jpg" width="236"></div>

Nevertheless, summer time is more suitable for family holidays.  During this period, the shallowing of the waterfall is possible, but this will not affect the overall picture of the region.  Warm and clear weather, a pleasant blowing breeze and the peak of flowering flora definitely will not spoil the experience.  This confirms the huge number of people who want to spend the weekend here right in the tents and feel the amazing unity with nature.  For lovers of aesthetic beauty, the best time to travel to the waterfall will be spring.  It is on these days that water always overflows rainier than the rest.  Snow-white snow slowly melts and merges with the stream, complementing and enhancing the flow of water.  The range of its overflows becomes truly extraordinary.  Unfortunately, in the fall due to adverse weather conditions it is not possible to visit the waterfall very often.  Only the period from early September to early October is considered relatively suitable for travel.  An important condition is dry weather.  Without exaggeration, in winter this place looks like a fairy tale.  Visitors immediately find themselves in a snowy forest.  A wonderful spring opens up to their eyes, which falls down the slope with a crystal ice stream.  In winter, its power noticeably weakens, but the stream does not freeze at all and flows smoothly into the river.  This spectacle is able to charm everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow region waterfalls" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440456.jpg" width="236"></div>

To visit the waterfall at this time, you have to take a serious risk.  Driving along these tracks is quite difficult, so an experienced driver must be behind the wheel.  On the day of departure, close attention should be paid to precipitation.  If the rain has just ended or is still in progress, then you should postpone the trip, since dry weather is a prerequisite for a safe path.  Another equally important requirement is the availability of the right shoes.  It should be noted that the soil in this area is mostly swampy, there are many streams, and the approaches to them are filled with water.  Shoes should be waterproof and so that their feet do not slip out. </p><h2>  Amazing Rainbow Waterfall.  How to get to such a miracle of nature? </h2><p>  Despite certain difficulties, every year the number of tourists and bus excursions only increases.  You can reach the waterfall on foot, if, of course, someone is able to overcome fifteen kilometers from the station "250 km of the regional railway."  But it is best to hit the road with a special bus tour or in your own car.  If the second option is chosen, then you should turn onto the <span>asphalt road</span> before the gas station and the monument to the heroes of World War II, before reaching the village of Papino.  A reference point can also be a pioneer camp, which you need to drive and then turn left.  Then you should overcome the dirt road leading through a large field.  As soon as this stretch of the path is left behind, there will be several options for the further road to the destination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rainbow waterfall" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/440457.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  Selection of the optimal route </h2><p>  For those who are fond of mountaineering.  You need to get to the end of the road leading through the field.  Then turn right and walk a few meters until the mountain slope is in range.  It is along this slope that you will have to go down straight to the waterfall itself. </p><p>  For those who are looking for extreme sensations.  You should also get to the end of the road, which runs through the field.  You need to leave the forest that grows on the left slope, behind and further follow the road that is to the right of the others.  Then there is a descent to the river through the lawn, and then a left turn. </p><p>  For romantic natures.  For this category of people, it is enough to drive a gas station and a bridge across the river and immediately turn right.  There is a ride on a fairly flat road.  After arrival, you can arrange a small picnic and enjoy the beauties of nature. </p>
