Here, amazing nature, the air saturated with the smells of herbs and the sea, the gentle sun, the abundance of fruits and the sincere hospitality of local residents.  All this awaits those lucky ones who will come to rest in the boarding house ‚ÄúCrimean Primorye‚Äù in the village of Kurortnoye.  Reviews of tourists about the time spent here are different, because each person has his own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to spend your vacation and what conditions should be provided.  We offer you to take a short virtual tour of the village and the boarding house in order to form your own independent opinion about them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Crimean Primorye reviews" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1866840.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  There are no ugly places in Crimea, but perhaps the area near Kara-Dag is the most picturesque.  Here on the very shore is a small, cozy village of Kurortnoye.  I would like to note that in the Crimea there are as many as three villages with this name.  In our article, we are talking about the Resort, located between Theodosia and Sudak.  Both are a little over 25 km from there, and the famous city of Koktebel is only 13 km on the road.  In the central part of the village there is the Crimean Primorye boarding house (on Morskaya street, 3).  Reviews about this location are only enthusiastic.  The windows of all rooms in the boarding house offer breathtaking <span>views of the</span> sea ‚Äã‚Äãand mountains, which always creates a wonderful mood and a sense of harmony, peace of mind.  In addition, a big plus for vacationers is that all the important infrastructure of the village is literally a few steps away.  You can take a walk to the embankment, shops, pharmacies, cafes, market, bus station from the boarding house in a matter of minutes.  For vacationers with children, this is especially important. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From any city in Russia, the main thing is to get to Simferopol.  For this, it is more convenient to use the services of airlines.  From the airport, it‚Äôs enough just to get to the Crimean Primorye boarding house.  Reviews of tourists note that it is best to follow the <span>capital of Crimea</span> to the village of Kurortnoye on a regular bus.  In season there are routes directly from the airport.  The road takes almost 2 hours, the ticket price is from 200 rubles.  The pension offers a paid transfer from Simferopol and back, but it, according to vacationers, costs more.  It is also easy to get to Kurortny from Feodosia by bus or minibus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean Primorye boarding house Morskaya street 3 reviews" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1866821.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  All tourists note that the Crimean Primorye boarding house has an unusually beautiful territory.  Reviews about her are only favorable.  The huge rose garden is particularly admiring.  The boarding house is as if buried in a fragrant sea of ‚Äã‚Äãmagnificent roses.  The area is almost 10 hectares, the bulk of which falls on a magnificent park.  Previously, it was a favorite place for walking and recreation for all residents of the village.  Now the territory of the boarding house along with the park was fenced and strangers were not allowed here.  Here, among centuries-old cypresses, pines and junipers, alleys are broken, benches are installed, there are even sculptural forms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the territory there is a place for a paid parking lot, sports and playgrounds are equipped in the shade of the trees, there is a pool and a cinema.  The boarding house began to function in Soviet times, so there is still a slight touch of the atmosphere of previous years, but this does not interfere with a wonderful vacation.  However, those who came to Crimea are also happy to hold a business meeting, symposium or conference.  For such clients, the boarding house provides conference rooms equipped with modern technology and electrical equipment for 300 participants and 80 participants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean Primorye boarding house reviews latest" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1866844.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Enclosures </h2><p>  Arriving on vacation in the Crimea, in the village of Kurortnoye about the boarding house "Crimean Primorye" reviews leave different.  This largely depends on the living conditions, which vary slightly in each building.  In total, the boarding house has 4 buildings and several two-story wooden cottages.  The buildings are old-built, so none of them have an elevator.  <span>The cottages are modern,</span> have a good design and all amenities. </p><p>  Building No. 1 is two-story, located almost on the seashore, hosts guests all year round.

It looks pretty modern.  This building houses the administration and reception.  There are rooms for 1 and 2 guests.  Moreover, the balcony is only in double rooms.  About the Crimean Primorye boarding house, reviews of tourists note that the second building is located next to the pool, so it is noisy in the afternoon.  But this building is always very clean, and you can get an iron and an electric kettle from the concierge. </p><p>  Building number 3 is four-story, located 30 meters from the sea.  This building offers rooms of two categories: </p><p>  - with amenities (bathroom, shower); </p><p>  - with partial amenities (in the rooms there is only a wash basin, and a bathroom and showers on the floor). </p><p>  Building number 5 is located in a park area, from the sea it is 100 meters.

    <h2>  Leisure outside </h2><p>  Many interesting excursions can be visited by those who came to the boarding house ‚ÄúCrimean Primorye‚Äù.  The Republic of Crimea reviews are only enthusiastic.  A resort town is famous for its unique nature and reserve, located on the slopes of Kara-Dag.  It organizes walking tours.  A dolphinarium is located next to the reserve.  A trip to Feodosia with a visit to the Aivazovsky Museum is also popular.  On their own, vacationers can take a bus to Koktebel, where there is a water park.  On foot you can go to Fox Bay.  Go there for about an hour.  In the afternoon, boat trips are offered on the promenade.  In the evening there are no noisy discos in the village, but there are cafes on the promenade where singers and musicians perform. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  It's no secret that for the sake of the wonderful sea, many people go on vacation to the Kurortnoye village, to the Crimean Primorye boarding house.  Reviews of local beaches, however, are not very enthusiastic.  The health resort is located almost on the coast, so you can quickly walk to the nearest beach.  It is municipal, so there are always a lot of people.  For guests of the boarding house loungers are given out free of charge, and this is perhaps the only advantage.  Most of all complaints are caused by the beach cover, which is medium, and in some places large pebbles.  Sunset at sea, although gentle, but also not very convenient, as it is lined with large and medium boulders covered with marine vegetation and because of this is rather slippery.  But the water in the sea is excellent, very clean and warm.  There are other beaches in the village, located in the direction of Fox Bay.  They are not so crowded, but also pebble and practically not equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house Crimean coastal republic Crimea reviews" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1867149.jpg" width="492"></div>
