After all, it is here that the unique palace ensemble of the 18th century is located.  Previously, the city located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland was called Oranienbaum.  It was a country residence of Russian rulers and their favorites.  In this article you will find the most interesting information about the sights of Lomonosov (photo of ancient palaces and their description). </p><h2>  History of Oranienbaum </h2><p>  During the Northern War, Russia included Swedish lands on the coast of the Gulf of Finland and <span>the Neva River.</span>  Here Peter I laid the foundation for St. Petersburg.  The lands around the new city were bestowed upon the emperor‚Äôs entourage.  The founder of Oranienbaum is considered the favorite <span>A.D. Menshikov.</span>  In 1707 he erected the first wooden palace here.  Three years later, in the residence began to build stone buildings.  Thanks to talented gardeners and architects, an incredibly beautiful park has appeared here.  Under Elizaveta Petrovna, beautiful palaces passed into the possession of Peter Fedorovich.  Here is his summer residence, in which the prince was resting with his wife.  At this time, the world famous architect Rastrelli worked in Oranienbaum.  According to his project, the Stone Hall and the Picture Courtyard were built on the territory of the residence.  Later, the architect Rinaldi worked here, who built the Chinese Palace, <span>Petrovsky Park</span> and Katalnaya Gorka. </p>

    <h2>  Oranienbaum today </h2><p>  Today, the former Oranienbaum is transformed into the city of Lomonosov <span>(Leningrad Region).</span>  Sights of the former princely residence still attract tourists from all over the world.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is 162 hectares.  In 2011, large-scale restoration work was carried out here.  Today, the former residence of Menshikov is especially popular among travelers and takes place alongside Peterhof and Tsarskoye Selo.  It is important to note that most of the buildings here have been preserved in their original form, since the town was not damaged during the wars and revolutions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, we will consider the main attractions of Lomonosov (Oranienbaum). </p><h2>  Grand Menshikov Palace </h2><p>  This building is a wonderful example of the <span>baroque of Peter's</span> times.  The palace was erected according to the project of the outstanding architect F. Fontana.  Rastrelli was engaged in the reconstruction of the building during the time of Peter III. </p><p>  Initially, the construction of the palace was caused by strategic goals.  As you know, in 1704, Peter I ordered the construction of <span>the Kronstadt fortress</span> on the coast of the Gulf of Finland.  His favorite Menshikov was appointed supervisor of the construction process.  From the palace, which today is one of the main attractions of Oranienbaum, the prince could see the fortress through a telescope. </p><p>  Today in front of the palace is a beautiful park - the Lower Garden. </p>

    <h2>  The amusing fortress of Peter III </h2><p>  The next owner of the residence - Peter III - erected the Amusing Fortress here.  On its territory there were barracks, an arsenal and other buildings and warehouses.  Near the fortress was built a small palace designed by the Italian A. Rinaldi.  It has survived to the present day and is one of the most beautiful monuments of Russian architecture of the 18th century. </p><p>  Today, all tourists have a unique opportunity to visit the rooms of the palace, in which Peter III himself rested.  In one of the premises of the building - the Picture Hall - there are valuable works of Dutch, Italian and Flemish painting.  These paintings were part of the collection of Peter III.  Also here you can see the personal belongings of the prince, clothes and furniture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Considering the most interesting sights of Lomonosov, one cannot help but recall the "Own cottage" by Catherine the Great.  Today this ensemble consists of two parts: the Chinese Palace and the Katalnaya Gorka. </p><h2>  Chinese palace </h2><p>  The Chinese Palace is a unique architectural monument of the second half of the 18th century.  Externally, the building is not very splendid.  But the interior of the palace is striking in its grandeur and beauty.  Its interior embodies oriental motifs.  But the real work of art is the so-called Bug Cabinet.  On its walls there are more than 20 paintings by P. Rotary, which harmoniously fit into the interior of the room. </p>

    <h2>  Roller coaster </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most interesting and unusual project of A. Rinaldi.  The ensemble called ‚ÄúKatalnaya Gorka‚Äù included a pavilion (preserved to this day), large colonnades, as well as slides for wheelchairs. </p><p>  Today everyone can visit the pavilion building.  Its magnificent interior and graceful forms are impressive.  Especially valuable is the Porcelain Study.  He is considered one of the best examples of interior art.  The walls of the room are decorated with porcelain, ordered by Catherine the Great in Meissen. </p>
