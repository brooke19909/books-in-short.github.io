Mysterious stories, immortalized by the very nature of this amazing land, today attract thousands of tourists.  One of the stories has become the hallmark of a unique place that is known to tourists as the Tsei Gorge in North Ossetia.  Many centuries ago, local hunters went daily for prey.  And they saw in the mountains the golden-horned handsome tour, big and powerful, like a boulder. </p><h2>  A nice place </h2><p>  Many daredevils tried to make him their prey, but each time a fabulous animal departed from its pursuers.  And then one of the hunters dared to ask for the help of St. George.  For luck, the young shooter promised to give the golden horns of the defeated round to the patron of Ossetians.  However, having killed the animal, he violated this oath and left the precious trophy to himself. </p>

    <p>  He was severely punished by St. George.  He turned the trickster into a stone block.  The outlines of the rock are similar to the male profile in the hood, which once again reminds of a legend.  And during the melting of the glaciers, it seems that tears are running down his face with which the young hunter is trying to beg forgiveness from the patron. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Tsei Gorge is rich in mountain peaks of bizarre forms.  Here you can observe an amazing combination of natural phenomena.  The bright sun wakes up early and leaves late for rest.  Therefore, the days are bright and bright, and glaciers and snowy tops shimmer in golden rays.  In the gorge, amazingly clear clean air.  No wonder people who suffer from pulmonary diseases take a trip here.  By the way, research in this area began at the end of the nineteenth century, one of the directions was devoted to the impact of natural conditions on various ailments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Dr. Firsov observed patients and noted that after a certain time spent there, the condition of patients with tuberculosis significantly improved.  True, civilization fully came here much later.  Instead of trails, a mountain road was built, and the Soviet government opened the first sanatoriums in the twenties of the last century. </p><h2>  Ski tourism </h2><p>  In addition to healing opportunities, the Tsey Gorge attracts fans of ski tourism.  It is compared with the best Alpine resorts.  Located between Everest and Elbrus, the gorge is equipped with beautiful slopes with lifts, recreation facilities.  And do not think that only extreme people can enjoy high-speed descents here.  Family holidays in a ski boarding house are no less popular. </p>

Among many iconic places in North Ossetia, the Recom sanctuary, which is considered exclusively male, stands out.  This is the temple of Uastirdzhi, the patron saint of travelers, warriors and hunters.  It is located in a fairy glade among dense pines and granite rocks.  In order to get to it, you must go along a narrow path over a cliff, where Ceydon, a stormy mountain river, roars below.  It is noteworthy that the temple is assembled from logs without a single nail.  Recom decorate the heads and skulls of animals sacrificed to the saint. </p>

    <p>  According to legend, Uastirdzhi himself built the temple, and the place became holy after God dropped one of the three tears here shed over the dead great warrior Bartazd.  Women are not allowed to be inside the sanctuary, it is reserved only for representatives of the stronger half.  There are several such structures in the gorge.  You can see them by visiting the Tseyskoe Gorge and going through an excursion route. </p><p>  There are many glaciers here, the largest of which are Tseysky and Skazsky.  It is from them that mountain streams and rivers flowing into Ceydon originate.  In some places, the channels are blocked by boulders, because of which waterfalls of various heights arise, and the flow becomes rapid and rapid. </p><h2>  Vegetation: trees, flowers and herbs </h2><p>  The vegetation here is so diverse that it is still surprising even for pundits.  <span>Mixed forests,</span> alpine meadows, rocky vegetation and shrubs.  In addition, the Tsey Gorge offers relaxation to inveterate foresters.  In the season, you can take your time to collect a rich harvest of lingonberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, as well as various edible mushrooms. </p>
