Vararak surrounded by unique rocky ridges and green forests.  The founding fathers of the city are Manuchar Bek Melik-Hussehnyan and the former general of the county in the 1870s, Russian General P. Staritsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 21st century, tourists can visit many interesting sights in Goris (Armenia), which include: </p><ul><li>  monastery on the cliff of Tatev; </li><li>  observation deck with a gazebo near the monastery; </li><li>  Stone forest; </li><li>  suspension bridge and funicular, etc. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoover.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery s Goris" class="if uuid-2843745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2843745.jpg"></div><h2>  Goris story </h2><p>  Since ancient times, trade caravans from Tiflis to Tabriz, connecting Russia and Persia, passed through these places.  Along the mountain roads was brought fodder, intended to supply the local garrison of Russian troops. </p><p>  As a result of the end of the Russian-Persian war, which took place in 1826-1828, this territory as part of Eastern Armenia was included in the Russian Empire.  Then there was the village of Gerusa, lying in the depths of the gorge.  As the historian V. Potto wrote in a book devoted to the results of the Russian-Persian war, this place was remarkably standing around stone pillars of volcanic origin.  This created an atmosphere of mystery and uniqueness of a village located in the mountains of the Caucasus. </p><p>  Gerusi had its own beautiful huts (houses) and towers, a chapel and a water mill, through which a fast stream of a mountain river thundered.  The vegetation was represented by old branchy plane trees, which were located in a semicircle and descended into the Gerus gorge terraces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the surviving records, the locals and soldiers of the Russian army interpreted the name of the city differently: Goris, Gorus, Gurisi, Keres, Koris, Curis, etc. The modern name Goris was first mentioned in the memorial book of the local clerk Movses "Ishatakaran" in 1647- m </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": D. Stanley, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stones on the mountain" class="if uuid-2843756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2843756.jpg"></div><h2>  New city construction </h2><p>  In 1867, according to the decree of the Russian Emperor Alexander II, in order to improve the management of the Caucasus and Transcaucasian territories, the Elisavetpol province was formed in Armenia, which included 5 counties.  One of them, located in the southeast in the Syunik region, was called Zangezursky.  He was one of the largest, stretching from the lake.  Sevan to r.  Arax.  It was the city of Goris that was appointed the administrative center of this county. </p><p>  P. Staritsky was appointed here as the chief, who for construction chose a new place on a more gentle section of the plateau.  So a new city was laid in the midst of pastures, meadows and cattle pastures. </p><p>  The administrative center was built in the original architectural style: the streets passed in a straight line, and the quarters had the shape of squares.  Therefore, the layout of Goris resembles a chessboard.  There are 2 versions about the authors of this style in the city: according to one, it was German or French architects, and on the other, local experts Djanushyan, Kozlov, Kharchenko, and the latter also supervised the construction work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The houses were built in 1-3 floors of local material: basalt and tuff.  Each provided a small garden.  Also in the city were erected cultural, social and industrial facilities. </p><p>  In accordance with the plan, builders had to bookmark 36 streets intersecting perpendicularly.  Placed in the southeastern part of the area, along its perimeter - 2-story public and commercial buildings.  Nearby was laid out a city garden and a church was erected. </p><p>  One of the first was built a public school for children and a county prison, later they were supplemented by a post office, a hospital (for 4 beds) and a pharmacy.  Having appreciated the prospects of the city under construction, prosperous peasants from nearby villages of the county began to move here.  Therefore, the number of shops and stores there were several dozen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.azatutyun.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Goris city" class="if uuid-2843742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2843742.jpg"></div><h2>  Goris settlement and population </h2><p>  By 1885, according to the descriptions of the ethnographer S. Zelinsky, 55 residential buildings with a population of 400 people were built in Goris (Armenia).  The county was controlled by 43 officials, and 62 horse-drawn police officers and 71 military officers provided order. </p><p>  In 1898, with the financing of the merchant G. Mirumyan, the first hydroelectric power station was built here, however, its capacity (48 kW) was enough only to illuminate the buildings of superiors and wealthy residents. </p><p>  Goris received the official status of the city in 1904 by the permission of Emperor Nicholas II, when its population numbered about 2.5 thousand people.  By the second half of the 20th century.  the number of inhabitants was already 17.5 thousand. </p><h2>  Tatev Monastery: name and legends </h2><p>  South of Goris is a monument of ancient architecture - Tatev Monastery, founded in the 9th century.  at the place where in ancient times a sanctuary was built.  The building rises right on the edge of a huge gorge several hundred meters deep. </p><p>  Translated from Armenian, "tatev" means "give wings."  The origin of the name is explained in several legends at once.  According to the first - the builder of the monastery, having finished work and looking down from the height of the mountain, began to ask God to give him wings.  After fulfilling the request, he flew away. </p><p>  According to the second version, after the construction of the temple in Tatev was completed, it was necessary to put an end to its dome.  This was decided by one of the master‚Äôs students, who personally made it secretly at night.  Crowded with pride from his achievement, he climbed the dome at night and raised a cross, but did not have time to go down. </p><p>  When the master came out in the morning, his disciple, frightened and afraid of punishment for self-will, appealed to God with the words ‚ÄúTal Tev!‚Äù  and rushed into the abyss.  The third version is similar to the previous one, only the fall was made by the master himself after he decided that he had made the most outstanding creation in life. </p><p>  The historical hypothesis of the origin of the name is more likely, it tells that the name of the monastery was given in honor of one of the disciples of the apostle Fatey, whose name was St. Eustateos, which in Armenian translates as Tatev.  He preached Christianity in Armenia, and then died in torment for the faith. </p><p>  Above his grave the temple of the Tatev Monastery was erected, which was consecrated by St.  Gregory the Illuminator.  Its ruins can still be found near the walls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.wandelion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tateevsky monastery now" class="if uuid-2844660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2844660.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the construction of the monastery </h2><p>  The foundation of <span>the Tatev monastery</span> in Armenia occurred at the turn of the 9-10th century.  and was made by the Armenian ruler of Syunik Ashot, the princes G. Supan II and B. Dzagik.  According to another version, it was founded in the 4th century, because, according to historical data, in these years a church was already built here and several monks lived.  With the advent of the Syunik Metropolitanate, the monastery began to expand. </p><p>  In the 14th century  a university begins to work here, and the number of monks reaches already 1 thousand. In these years 47 villages already belonged to the monastery, from which tithing was levied.  This made it possible to maintain an increasing number of brothers, a library and a university.  According to the chronicles, almost a thousand relics of saints were stored here.  However, during the invasion of Tamerlane in 1387, Tatev was looted and burned.  And in the 15th century.  here came the Turkmen nomads who completed the destruction of the monastery. </p><p>  The next heyday of Tatev fell on the 17-18th century.  - monks, abbot, servants and clergy lived here.  However, in 1931 an earthquake occurred that completely destroyed all the buildings. </p><p>  The restoration and restoration of the church, cells and walls of the monastery were carried out from 1974 until the end of the 1990s. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.wandelion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The interiors of the temple" class="if uuid-2844663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2844663.jpg"></div><h2>  Tatev University </h2><p>  The educational institution on the territory of Tatev Monastery in Armenia consisted of 3 faculties: </p><ul><li>  the first studied the works of ancient philosophers, arithmetic, astronomy, medicine and anatomy, geography and chemistry, history and literature, as well as rhetoric and the art of conducting a sermon; </li><li>  on the second, students studied the history and fundamentals of painting, studied drawing, calligraphy and painting, as well as the art of census books; </li><li>  the third taught the theory and history of music and church singing. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to the University of Tatev, the monastery became a major center of pan-Armenian spiritual life and teaching of sciences and arts.

Intricate figures and fantastic monsters are scattered throughout the valley, surrounded by broad-leaved forest. </p><p>  They were formed from the constant action of strong winds, hot sun and rainwater.  Stone formations resemble powerful trees in their appearance and are formed by volcanic tuff rocks.  In shape, they look like cone-shaped towers and obelisks.  Their fantastic look is complemented by a multi-colored game of several shades: from brown-brown to gray-black. </p><p>  Having made a trip to Armenia and arrived in Goris, tourists can see the wonders of nature from a special viewing platform with a gazebo, which was made at the entrance to the city. </p><p>  On the opposite bank of the Vararak river, there are ancient cave settlements of Bartsravane, Khndzorsk, Keres and Shinuire.
