Then Apple was just exploring a new market, and no one could have imagined how incredibly popular its products would be in a decade. </p><p>  Today, the iPod can be used to watch videos and images, connect it as a portable disk to a computer and video equipment.  Yes, and <span>what is the iPod</span> Touch, if not the iPhone, which is just devoid of the phone‚Äôs function.  But let's get it in order. </p><p>  The success of Apple is associated with several factors: the unique design of its products, the use of innovative technical solutions and competent marketing policy.  Consider, for example, what the 2001 iPod is.  It used the most compact hard drive that could be found at that time.  The successful arrangement of navigation buttons, which over time will turn into the famous TouchWheel wheel, fits into Apple's recognizable design concept.  And above all - the highest quality headphones and the development of music formats that preserve the most reliable sound quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is an iPod" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10630/6103.jpg" width="366"></div>

    <p>  No doubt the iPod has always been an expensive toy.  Offering the best, Apple relies on the status of its products.  Even the iPod Mini and its replacement Nano are now more expensive than their competitors.  But buying an iPod, you get not only a player, but also an image.  Perhaps these explanations are enough to understand why the iPod generally gained popularity at the time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now let's talk about what an iPod is in terms of marketing.  There are currently 4 iPod models for various consumer groups.  If you only need to listen to music while walking and playing sports, iPod Nano or <span>iPod Shuffle is the best choice.</span>  For fans of multimedia entertainment and adherents of all the newest and "tricked out" is offered iPod Touch.  And if, on the contrary, you are conservative and prefer to have more options at a higher price, the Classic model is made for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is iPod Touch?" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10630/6100.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The iPod has become a kind of protector and savior of the music industry, as the company has always upheld U.S. <span>copyright laws.</span>  The software on the device works in such a way that you can only download and download tunes to the player from one computer.  This will most likely be the personal computer of the player‚Äôs owner.  It installs iTunes, which is required to manage iPod content. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to flash iPod" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10630/6727.jpg" width="383"></div>  It is assumed that the owner of the iPod will buy music and other content from the Apple Store.  Since not everyone agrees to pay more for the contents of the device beyond the cost of the device, there are a lot of instructions on the Internet on how to flash an iPod, and on free resources periodically post new music and movies purchased at the Apple Store.  However, more and more people agree that you still need to pay for high-quality digital products.  You can find things in the iPod content store that you won't find anywhere else on the Internet.

    <p>  A device that combines the best and most exclusive is what iPod is for its owner today.  It is Apple‚Äôs excellent instinct for the demand for exclusive things that our player and other devices have gained their popularity today.  And she is still growing. </p>
