    <h2>  Nessebar </h2><p>  This ancient Bulgarian city is located in the very south of the resort area under the eloquent name Slenchev Bryag (Sunny Beach).  Nessebar is the oldest city in Europe.  Its history has about three millennia.  If the new part, where our apart-hotel is located, is located on the mainland, then the old part is on a small peninsula that extends directly into the sea.  With land it connects a narrow four-hundred-meter strip of land. </p><p>  Once in the old Nessebar, you will be fascinated by it.  The ancient port and medieval churches, narrow streets and souvenir shops, fortified walls and old houses made of fired brick - you can wander around for hours.  But the most important highlight of Nessebar is the temples.  The oldest church is the Metropolitan.  It was built on the foundation of a former ancient Greek temple dedicated to Apollo.  But other churches are not inferior to this in beauty and interior decoration - Christ Pantocrator, St. Paraskeva, St.  Stefan ... No wonder Nessebar is considered a museum city and is under the auspices of UNESCO.  And in new areas there are water parks and entertainment centers where free buses go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Visa to Bulgaria" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514533.jpg" width="450"></div>

They issue it in the usual manner, because the information that you can get such a stamp in your passport upon arrival is incorrect.  This would be contrary to EU rules.  To get to Sea Grace Aparthotel 3, you need to fly to <span>Burgas Airport.</span>  These are the air gates of Bulgaria closest to Nessebar and Sunny Beach.  The airport is twenty-five kilometers from the hotel.  From there you can take the express train going to Nessebar.  Some tourists prefer a shuttle bus that stops in Sunny Beach, and then a minibus. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the so-called New Nessebar, and walk to the old center for about a quarter of an hour.  To the sea - eight to ten minutes.  Very close to the hotel are supermarkets, shopping centers, discos, night clubs and other entertainment.  Almost at the entrance to the hotel there is a bus stop, so you can easily get to the old town and Sunny Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="24 hour service" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514518.jpg" width="600"></div>
