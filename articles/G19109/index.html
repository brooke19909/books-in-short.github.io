  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brain structure: cerebellum, functions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From the anatomy, we know that <span>the brain</span> consists of such departments as the medulla oblongata, mediastinum, diencephalon, hindbrain and <span>endbrain.</span>  In turn, the hindbrain is subdivided into the <span>Varolian bridge</span> and cerebellum, the structure and functions of which we will consider in this article. </p><p>  It should be noted that in the cerebellum there are two hemispheres, an intermediate section and the so-called worm, the surfaces of which are separated by parallel grooves, between which there are convolutions, while its entire surface is eight hundred and fifty centimeters square.  The groups of convolutions form the cerebellar lobes, its furrows are continuous and pass from the worm to the hemispheres. </p><p>  Each crinkle is a thin layer of <span>white matter</span> coated with gray (bark) one millimeter thick.  The cerebellum, whose functions are related to its structure, has lower legs (have a direction to the <span>medulla oblongata),</span> middle (go to the bridge) and upper (go to the quadruple).  It is also associated with all other parts of the central nervous system through numerous pathways through which impulses from muscles, ligaments, cerebral cortex and tendons are transmitted, the cerebellum also transmits impulses through these channels to other parts of the NS.  Thus, this part of the brain is involved in the regulation of motor activity, making movements accurate, smooth and proportionate. </p><p>  It is important to note that as an organ that is part of the movement control system, the cerebellum functions as follows: </p><p>  1) regulation of muscle tone and body posture; </p><p>  2) coordination of fast movements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3) coordination of purposeful movements; </p><p>  All these functions are best disassembled in accordance with the classification of the cerebellum.  Let us consider in detail what functions the cerebellum performs, in particular each of its departments. </p><p>  The worm is associated with controlling the balance of the body, tone and posture.  It is in this zone that information about the state and position of the locomotor apparatus comes in, then after its processing certain commands are sent to the <span>vestibular apparatus.</span>  It should be noted that the removal of the cerebellar worm leads to an increase in the extensor tone, there is also an imbalance, synergy, center of gravity, and ataxia occurs. </p><p>  The intermediate department is responsible for targeted movements and their correction, as well as for choosing the best position for performing the movement.  Its defeat leads to hypermetry, imbalance. </p><p>  The cerebellar hemispheres are responsible for the occurrence of very fast, definitely directed movements that occur independently of the information coming from the spinal cord.  These movements can be observed in sports or when playing musical instruments.  Lesions of this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain cause the appearance of ataxia of the extremities, trembling, oversight, muscle hypotension and megalography. </p><p>  More recently, scientists have proved that the cerebellum has other functions, for example, it is to some extent responsible for the functionality of organs and tissues.  If you remove the cerebellum, then there will be a violation of the heart and blood vessels, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract. </p><p>  Thus, we note again that the cerebellum, whose functions determine the nature of the pathology in case of its violation, is involved in the regulation of the functioning of internal organs.  Its defeat causes the appearance of such basic symptoms as asthenia (muscle weakness), astasia (trembling muscle movements) and atony (weakened muscle tone).  Also quite often it is possible to observe the development of dysmetry - loss of accuracy of movement, ataxia - deformation of the gait, adiadokhokineza - loss of ability to perform a sequence of movements. </p><p>  Thus, the cerebellum performs a number of functions that ensure the normal functioning of the body.  In addition to coordination of movements, it regulates the work of all internal organs and systems of a person. </p>
