The Two or Three in the Kingdom of Smiles is not a similar hotel in <span>Egypt or Turkey.</span>  Take the Kamala Beach Inn (2 * <span>hotel, Phuket,</span> Kamala, Thailand) as an example.  This is a great place where you can have a good and inexpensive vacation with the whole family.  We will build our description of the hotel not only on the information provided by the hotel itself, but also on the reviews of vacationers.  Sometimes they are more objective than photographs.  What is the place of the hotel in the <span>ranking of hotels in</span> Phuket?  Recently, her signboard was decorated with another, third star.  Did it affect the quality of services or just increase the price of accommodation?  This we learn from the information below about the hotel Kamala Beach Inn 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala Beach Inn Hotel Phuket" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219691.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <h2>  Phuket Island (Thailand) </h2><p>  Reviews call it the capital of the sex industry, which can compete with the famous Pattaya.  But it is not so.  The island is quite large.  It is the largest in Thailand.  Therefore, the whole cheerful <span>nightlife is</span> concentrated in the town of Patong.  In the south of the island, the predominantly Muslim population lives.  It can not be said that the morals here were as strict as in the Emirates or, moreover, in Saudi Arabia, but the resorts at this tip of Phuket are more calm.  The beach "Kamala Beach" and the nearby village of the same name just belongs to such places, although it is located to the north, and not south of Patong.  Fans of nightlife here may seem bored.  But if you are aiming for a relaxing beach holiday, then here you are.  Fans of swimming with a mask will also have something to do here - a wonderful coral reef is located near the shore.  Among the attractions of Kamala are the Buddhist temple (at the southern end of the village), the Palace of the Elephants, the observation deck on the hill of Khao Fonturat, the Phuket Fantazi amusement park famous throughout the island.  It is also worth visiting the market, which takes place in the town every Friday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket hotel kamala beach inn reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219687.jpg" width="515"></div>

But to the sea just literally five minutes.  The Kamala resort with its shops and souvenir shops is about two hundred meters from the hotel.  Tourists call this location just perfect.  The place is quiet, especially in the evenings and at night.  But the entire infrastructure is within walking distance.  There is no shortage of cafes and restaurants.  Wandering merchants-merchants will not let you starve to death and provide delicious snacks in the form of fresh fruits, soft drinks and ice cream.  From <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport</span> to the hotel - about thirty-five kilometers.  The only negative location, which is noted by the reviews, is the lack of large supermarkets.  In the village of Kamala there are small shops "Seven / Eleven" with a standard set of products.  The nearest outlet is Big C Market.  This grocery store is located a hundred meters from the hotel.  You need to drive nine kilometers to the large shopping center "Jungle Ceylon". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala beach inn 2 thailand on phuket hotel rating" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219684.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  What is a hotel Kamala Beach Inn 2 * (Thailand, on the island of Phuket)?  The hotel rating gives her a rating of four points, which is not so bad.  And on the portal "Bucking" - 4.8.  The hotel recommends forty-one percent of tourists.  Of course, the territory of this hotel is small.  It itself consists of several two-story white buildings, on which branches of flowering wisteria beautifully curl.  Directly in front of the buildings is a swimming pool.  On its other side are sunbeds and deckchairs for sunbathing.  Reviews regarding where to settle - on the first or second floor - are contradictory.  Some advocate for the lower tier.  Left the room - and the pool.  But on the second floor it is less noisy and has its own private balcony.  It has a table and two high chairs.  The same equipment is available on the ground floor rooms.  But their guests have to be content with a semi-fenced veranda.  When checking in, tourists recommend asking in the second building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  This small hotel has no room division into categories.  All rooms are standard.  According to vacationers, the rooms are tastefully furnished with new and high-quality furniture.  What surprised guests at the Kamala Beach Inn?  The hotel (Phuket as a popular tourist destination has high requirements for the stardom of hotels) provides free Wi-Fi.  In addition, each room has a fridge, minibar and hairdryer.  Many tourists did not expect a hotel with two stars of such services.  The rooms are cleaned every day.  The staff is very friendly, trying to help everyone.  Drinking water is given only upon arrival.  Then you need to buy in the store.  Towels are changed every day, but bed linen every three days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala Beach Inn 2 Hotel Phuket Kamala Thailand" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219682.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel offers breakfast.  These are standard buffet meals.  Daily guests are served with toast, coffee or tea, sausages, rice, fried and boiled eggs, cabbage.  From fruits - pineapples and watermelons.  Many tourists did not pay for breakfast at the Kamala Beach Inn (hotel).  Phuket offers many different temptations, including gastronomic, at affordable prices.  The presence of a refrigerator in the room made it possible to store products purchased in the Big C store.  Ready meals are also sold there (fried fish, chicken legs, etc.).  In front of the store there is a currency exchange office with a good exchange rate.  There is no shortage of catering facilities in the resort of Kamala.  They are designed for any wallet.  You can also have dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Tables are served in the open air, in the romantic light of torches.  Chefs can surprise you with the delights of both Thai and European cuisine.  Recently, a bar has appeared at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Kamala Beach Inn 2 about Phuket" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219690.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  Since this is an economy class hotel, it is rarely empty.  And most often it is filled to capacity.  But reviews of the Kamala Beach Inn 2 * hotel (Phuket) claim that even in peak season the hotel does not have a sense of crowding.  Good soundproofing of the rooms is only half the explanation for the tranquility and bliss that reign on the hotel.  The hotel staff perfectly copes with their duties.  No matter how busy the hotel is, for each guest the receptionists will find time.  They work around the clock and speak English very well.  The hotel territory is literally surrounded by greenery.  Despite the low star rating, the hotel offers its guests a lot of services.  There is also a laundry with dry cleaning, and a safe for storing valuables.  The most useful, according to tourists, is the point of renting motorbikes and cars, as well as free parking in front of the hotel.  Wifi pulls even by the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala Beach Inn 3 Phuket Thailand reviews" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Of course, they go to Thailand overseas.  But if it is stormy, or the ebb is observed, it is so pleasant to soak in the fresh water of the pool.  And at the same time and sunbathe, lying on free sun loungers.  Kamala Beach Inn (Hotel, Phuket) has a spacious adult swimming pool.  It is wonderfully landscaped and fits perfectly into the landscape.  Evening lighting makes it just magical.  The second building has a shallow pool for babies.  The water in both tanks is very clean.  There are enough sunbeds, and there is no need to occupy them early.  Vacationers massively splash in the pool only in the short lunch time.  At another time, there are few people here.  For those who plan to spend the whole vacation mainly in the hotel, reviews recommend settling on the first floor of the third building.  Rooms overlook the pool.  <span>The</span> hotel does not issue <span>beach towels</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews at Kamala Beach Inn 3 Phuket" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1219681.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The most famous beach in Phuket is Karon Beach.  There the sand creaks underfoot, like starch.  Kamala Beach is located about seven minutes from the hotel.  It is also sandy, with a very gentle entry into the water, which is good for bathing children.  Those who like to immediately find themselves in the depths traveled (or walked) a little further - to Surin Beach.  The prices for renting beach equipment there are lower than on Kamal.  And the water - because of the deep bottom - is less muddy.  Surin can be reached by public transport (blue tuk-tuk).  A one way ticket costs only twenty baht.  Tourists recommend at least once a trip to Karon Beach.  You can get there by taxi for six hundred baht.  Despite its great fame, this beach will always provide you with a place in the sun - it is so wide and long.  Holidays in Thailand should be used in order to travel around Phuket if possible.  The Kamala Beach Inn Hotel reviews are called the ideal starting point for excursions around the island. </p><h2>  What tourists say </h2><p>  If you are aiming for a chic vacation in spacious apartments with all-inclusive service and animation, then you are clearly not here.  This is a budget hotel for tourists who come to swim in the sea and see the sights of Thailand.  But in this country you can find cheaper housing.  However, in such guesthouses there is often no hot water, and the rooms are furnished with only a bed and a bedside table.  But our hotel has completely different reviews.  ‚ÄúOh, hotel Kamala Beach Inn 2 *!  Thailand (Phuket) has not yet seen such an excellent budget resort "- this is how you can summarize the guests' feedback about the rest.  According to tourists, hotels with two or three stars are the perfect middle ground between the Spartan lifestyle of hospices and expensive boutique hotels of premium class. </p><h2>  Value for money </h2><p>  Not so long ago, the hotel signboard was decorated with another star.  What do the reviews say?  At the Kamala Beach Inn 3 (Phuket), the rest became more comfortable, and the infrastructure of the resort hotel became more developed.  Now here you can hire a babysitter.  Works at the hotel and travel agency.  It can not only book interesting excursions around the island and the country as a whole, but also book tickets for a bus, boat, train, plane.  Many tourists claim that for the price that the hotel asks for, it provides much more services than expected.  Rooms at Kamala Beach Inn have air conditioning, a TV, fridge and even a hairdryer.  Such equipment of guest rooms is rarely seen in hotels in Egypt or Turkey. </p>
