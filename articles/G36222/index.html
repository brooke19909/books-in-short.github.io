    <p>  Tourists are most interested in the possibility of skiing, so you need to know that the village of Elbrus (KBR) is located 15 km from the famous peak, named among the 7 wonders of Russia.  <span>The rural settlement</span> is located directly on the highway, which leads to the famous mountain. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If there is a road from far away, it makes sense to use air traffic.  There are airports in the cities of Minvody and Nalchik, from which it will not be difficult to get to the village of Elbrus, as well as to other settlements of Elbrus. </p><p>  The distance from Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, to the village is 130 km.  Theoretically, buses run from Nalchik to Elbrus, but there is a nuance: national flavor.  With drivers of tiny minibuses, you must first personally arrange so that they take travel companions with them.  Therefore, it is easier to find a car traveling in the same direction on Internet resources by offering to pay for gas, or take a taxi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It takes at least 2.5 hours to travel by car or taxi, while keeping in mind that there are many traffic police posts and video surveillance cameras on the highway.  However, the track is not overloaded with traffic, only cows create interference that calmly walk along the road and do not pay attention to passing vehicles. </p><p>  From the airport in Mineralnye Vody, you will have to do an even longer trip - 3.5-5 hours. </p><p>  The path to the village goes through the mountains and passes, however, due to the optical effect, it seems as if the road runs down.  The quality of the asphalt pavement on the road to Elbrus is good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elbrus settlement" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2053243.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Mountain tour of the village </h2><p>  The village of Elbrus is small, only 3 thousand inhabitants live in it.  You can get around the village in half an hour.

That's the whole village. </p><p>  But the infrastructure of the rural settlement is quite modern: </p><ul><li>  there is a kindergarten and a school; </li><li>  there is a hospital and a stationary point; </li><li>  house of culture; </li><li>  mosque. </li></ul><p>  Of course, there are cafes and shops in the village where tourists can easily find everything that is needed for relaxation and climbing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Village Management: Administration </h2><p>  The head of the administration of the village of Elbrus manages the life of the ski resort, solving everyday problems.  38 people work in the local administration, 3 of them are deputy heads of the rural settlement.  In the structure of the administration of the village there are 5 departments (education, culture, land use, finance, economics) and 1 committee (on physical education and sports). </p><p>  The administration is located in Tyrnyauz and works according to the standard schedule from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>

The village is located in a valley, a narrow ribbon stretching along the <span>Baksan Gorge.</span>  The altitude in the village is 1775 m, this helps to easily adapt to the height. </p><p>  The village is surrounded by a ridge of peaks covered with snow even in summer: Gubasanti, Irikchat, Donguz-Orun and others.  Many rivers fill the air with freshness, and pine forests with coniferous aromas.  Noisy waterfalls, deep, even during the day, dark ravines, forest trails overlooking the alpine meadows - all this can be seen by going for a walk around the village. </p>

Here are the laboratories that belong to the Elbrusier National Park. </p><p>  You can admire the beauty of harsh mountains if you go hiking along the Adyl-Su gorge along the Adyl river.  On the other side of the village is a picturesque gorge Irik-Chat, which ends with a powerful waterfall.  On the same gorge, tourists climb the glacial plateau, reach the source of Dzhily-Su, or climb from the east to the top of Elbrus. </p><p>  Narzan springs come to the surface near the village.  However, there are especially many of them in the Glade of Narzans near Chegem, where even the stones have a strong reddish tint due to the abundance of iron compounds in the water.  There is a silver narzan spring in the village of Neutrino, the taste of the water is soft and delicate. </p><p>  In the neighboring village of Tegenekli there is a museum dedicated to Vladimir Vysotsky, because it was in these places that the famous film "Vertical" was shot. </p><p>  In the village of Tyrnyauz, the museum of local lore opens its doors to visitors.
