    <p>  The Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg is one of the most popular places in the city, its attraction and pride.  Currently, it is called the <span>Botanical Garden of</span> the V. L. Komarov <span>Botanical</span> Institute of the <span>Russian Academy of Sciences,</span> and earlier it was given the name of the Imperial Botanical Garden. </p><p>  This corner of nature simply attracts lovers of greenery and plants.  Its visitors are residents and visitors of the city.  The Botanical Garden is a unique creation that combines gentle care and labor of people, flowering and the beauty of nature. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg was founded by decree of Peter I in 1713 as the Pharmaceutical Garden, in which it was necessary to grow herbs and plants used in medicine.  It was located on Raven Island, which was later renamed Pharmaceutical.  The territory gradually increased, now the modern garden occupies more than 16 hectares.  Since its inception, the Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg has been closely interacting with various medical, scientific and educational organizations and enterprises of the country, it holds lectures for university students, creates exhibits and excursions for preschool children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, it was in a deplorable state, there were few plants - only about 1,500 species, there were only two departments ‚Äî the botanical and the medical.  In 1823, the garden, it was decided to rename the Imperial, so work began on its reorganization and improvement.  In addition, new plants were discharged from abroad, buildings were rebuilt and reconstructed, the territory was ennobled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="botanical garden st petersburg photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/445966.jpg" width="600"></div>  A little later, a museum and a library appeared.  The Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg was used not only for medical, but also for scientific activities.  At the end of the XIX century, his employees made expeditions around the country for plant samples, scientific goals began to be of paramount importance.

    <p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg belonged to <span>the USSR Academy of Sciences,</span> and the created Botanical Institute was engaged in its development and arrangement.  Moreover, scientific activity has gained wide scope.  USSR scientists worked on the development of suitable conditions for different plants, problems of growth and acclimatization.  During the Great Patriotic War, the garden suffered from bombing and suffered huge losses.  Almost the entire collection of flora was lost, especially rare tropical species of plants, palm trees, greenhouse flowers and much more.  In wartime, the boiler room was damaged, and all heat-loving plants died forever.  Only a few species that were saved by the employees were saved: rare specimens were taken to apartments or left in a small greenhouse, which was heated by stoves.  In the post-war period, the garden was gradually restored.  Of course, it took a lot of time and was worth the incredible efforts of all the staff and just caring people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Departments of the Botanical Garden </h2><p>  For a more successful functioning, all activities carried out in the Botanical Garden are divided into different departments and areas of activity.  The Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg is not only a park, but also several greenhouses, in which tropical and subtropical climate plants are represented, the arboretum is the pride of the garden, numbering several thousand species of trees, a herbarium collection of hundreds of herbaria created by botanists on over the years. </p>

    <p>  From the beginning of its foundation, the Botanical Garden replenished its collections only with the help of foreign countries - seeds and seedlings were purchased in England, Germany, Holland.  Since 1830, special expeditions have been undertaken by scientists in the Transcaucasus, the Caspian, Baku and Kamchatka regions to replenish the collections of the garden and to promote scientific activity.  From overseas trips brought plants from the <span>island of St. Helena,</span> Rio de Janeiro, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Brazil. </p><p>  The Botanical Garden took an active part in the equipment not only of its own expeditions, but also expeditions of other societies and organizations.  In addition, plants were brought here by many travelers voluntarily - from the Tien Shan ridge, Issyk-Kul, from the Ussuri Territory. </p><p>  One of the recently acquired plants that the Botanical Garden is proud of is sakura brought from Japan.  Plans for the near future are to create a unique Sakura Alley. </p>
