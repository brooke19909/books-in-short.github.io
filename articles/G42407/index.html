Arriving home after work, everyone wants to put himself in order, to get enough and briefly disconnect from reality with the help of a spectacular performance.  For decades, television has been successfully coping with this human need, presenting various entertainment programs and watching films of their choice to the attention of households.  TV has become a commonplace for all people without exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shesbed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv repair device" class="if uuid-3108984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3108984.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, this technique performs the function of the main media, allowing vacationers to find out news about events occurring within the state and beyond.  In addition, a lot of useful headings are offered to the attention of viewers, allowing you to get informative information about various ways of spending leisure time and getting useful tips at home and in a personal plot.  TV attracts millions of people daily to its screen.  And if we add here a club of interests that attracts fans of sports and all kinds of championships in other areas of entertainment, it will become clear that television is ready to fill all the free time of any person.  The device of the TV, its history, the principle of operation - further in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  In their dreams, people from ancient times invented mystical ways to transmit images over a distance.  Confirmation of this can be found in the tales of various peoples of the world, just one saucer with an apple rolling on it leads to childhood memories.  For hundreds of years before the onset of the 20th century, people unsuccessfully tried to bring this idea to life. </p><h2>  Revolutionary discovery </h2><p>  The first discovery was made back in 1843, by natural scientist A. Ben, who built the device using wax-metal plates.  His invention was capable of transmitting images from a distance.  However, the main discovery belongs to W. Smith, who in the second half of 1873 established that semiconductor elements have the ability to change resistance when changing the brightness of lighting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.darwinsocialnoise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen device" class="if uuid-3110063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3110063.jpg"></div><h2>  Electronic telescope </h2><p>  This discovery served as the basic principle of the later created picture tubes.  Various experts have been developing devices that allow you to create a scan of the image at the stage before the start of the 2nd World War.  The best idea belonged to the German inventor P. Nipkov, who invented an electric telescope that scans using holes arranged on a disk.  However, he was still far from the current TV device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The invention of Zvorykin </h2><p>  The first television studios began their work in 1930, broadcasting was carried out in America and some European countries.  The prototype of the first radial tube, the operating principle of which was laid in the basis of the kinescope, was created in 1933. Its author was an immigrant from Russia named V. Zvorykin.  For the first time he presented his work in the USA and gave it the name "iconoscope". </p><h2>  Differences in modern TVs by type </h2><p>  Today, television is a must-have device that can be found in every home.  You can find enough people all over the world who are so attached to television programs that they simply cannot imagine their life without television.  Modern TV devices are distinguished by the following types: </p><ul><li>  picture tubes; </li></ul><ul><li>  Plasma </li></ul><ul><li>  projection; </li></ul><ul><li>  liquid crystal. </li></ul><p>  Nowadays, everyone has the opportunity, sitting at home on the couch, turning on one of these devices, watch the events taking place anywhere in the world. </p><h2>  TV operation device </h2><p>  The first TVs transmitted an image using a kinescope.  For a long time this type of device was the only possible option, and year after year, the designers worked only to improve the quality of the device.  However, modern scientists have found new ways of transmitting images, putting into practice new ideas and changing the way the TV works. </p><h2>  CRT </h2><p>  The television picture tube looks like a glass bulb, on one side of it there is an electronic tube, on the other - a screen.  The kinescope screen is provided with a special phosphorus-containing coating.  An electron tube shoots at him with a stream of electrons.  When the electron reaches the phosphor panel, the involved pixel starts to glow.  In the first black-and-white picture tubes they placed one tube, after which three color-separated receivers were installed immediately in color receivers.  One of them was red, the other was blue, and the third was green. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The electron beam, moving from left to right, outlines a line of pixels, and then moves down, creating a vertical line.  This happens continuously at high speed, while the eye sees the whole picture.  The oscillation frequency is measured in special units called hertz.  The first picture tubes always had a convex surface, later they began to produce more convenient models with a completely flat screen.  Thus, the TV screen device has always been considered a complex and important element.  And models with a flat screen were valued more expensive. </p><h2>  Plasma </h2><p>  What is the operating principle and device of this type of TV?  The principle of the plasma panel is the effect of ultraviolet radiation on charged particles called phosphors.  When an electric discharge moves through the field of a discharged gas, ultraviolet light appears and a conducting corridor, which consists of plasma, opens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV device" class="if uuid-3108979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3108979.jpg"></div><p>  Using conductors, some of which are arranged vertically and others horizontally, a frame scan and a horizontal scan are performed from the inside of the panel.  The television processor is able to adjust the distribution of frames at unprecedented speeds.  Due to this property, the eyes see the whole image from the outside of the screen. </p><h2>  Projection </h2><p>  The principle of operation of <span>projection TVs is based</span> on an algorithm for transmitting high-quality images from a minimized transmitter to a large screen.  The transmitted image is formed inside the projection TV itself, using a small source composed of electric tubes or a liquid crystal display.  Further, using mirrors and optical devices, it is projected onto the prepared screen. </p><p>  What is a TV device?  The whole structure consists of a sound system, a projector, a control panel and a screen.  In the models intended for home use, all components are enclosed in a common housing.  For this reason, they turn out dimensional.  The projection method of image transmission allows you to combine the softness and richness of the resulting image, as well as ample opportunities for color resolution.  In addition, the image transmitted by projection televisions is completely spared from graininess, which is a lack of picture tubes. </p><h2>  Liquid crystal </h2><p>  The device of LCD TVs is created on the principle of polarization of a given light flux passing through the crystals.  The LCD panel is presented in the form of two layers consisting of a special polarized glass that are connected together.  The first layer is coated with the desired polymer, which contains special liquid crystals.  Then a current of electricity passes through them, causing all the crystals to rotate along a specific path.  In the meantime, mobile crystals pass the necessary amount of light through the next layer of glass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="device repair" class="if uuid-3108983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3108983.jpg"></div><p>  To pass light through liquid crystals, you need an external source.  It is positioned outside the polarized glass.  Liquid crystals pass through the light of lamps, and since they are in a certain position, an image appears with a filter. </p><p>  LED TVs are different.  To illuminate the liquid crystal matrix, LEDs are used here.  They consume much less energy and also produce greater brightness.  These devices have better color reproduction and sharper contrast.  And also they have increased service life and work is accompanied by less heat.  By mistake, some people consider this system a digital TV device, however, digital TV is just a way to transmit a signal. </p><h2>  LG TVs </h2><p>  The South Korean company LG is considered one of the leading manufacturers in the world in the production of electronics for household use.  Products of this brand have always been in great demand among consumers in all world markets.  Such results were achieved thanks to the exceptional quality of corporate samples and the use of the latest technical developments.  This is well confirmed by the latest LG <span>LED TVs</span> .  They are distinguished by improved image quality, however, have a lower cost than competitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.revistagadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV repair" class="if uuid-3108976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3108976.jpg"></div><p>  The device of LG TVs unites a number of generations.  This includes the main models that were created on the basis of LED-technologies, and an even newer development of the company called OLED-TV.  The next model is distinguished by the use of the latest matrix, in which organic LEDs are used.  This approach to production has brought image quality to a new level. </p><h2>  Samsung TVs </h2><p>  From the Korean language, the word ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù is translated as ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù.  The company is a South Korean.  This name is well known all over the world.  Samsung is considered one of the main suppliers of electronics, as well as household appliances.  The company has many years of experience in the production of television products and is one of the main competitors of LG. </p><div class="photo" data-original="louisc.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv screen" class="if uuid-3108972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3108972.jpg"></div><p>  However, Samsung TVs, whose device is characterized by individual characteristics, are still in great demand. </p><h2>  Causes of Failure </h2><p>  Often the cause of breakdowns becomes improper handling of the equipment of the owners themselves.  The regulated observance of the basic rules of operation will allow for a long time to keep an expensive device in working condition.  Repairing a TV can sometimes be expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businesskorea.co.kr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV screen device" class="if uuid-3108975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3108975.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, you should not keep the device in a room where high humidity is not ruled out.  It is also necessary to protect the device from mechanical damage.  The optimal operating time of the TV is 6 hours, after which it is better to take a short break.  If you connect other devices to the television receiver, check them for compatibility. </p><p>  In the event of systematic malfunctions in the operation of electrical networks, it is necessary to install a voltage stabilizer, which insures the device against current surges during sudden switching on.  Handle the remote control carefully.  In most cases, it is a rather fragile design.  In the event of serious damage, a device such as a TV remote control is not always easy to pick up. </p>
