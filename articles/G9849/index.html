  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet toys for beginners. Little crochet toys: schemes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Little kids like <span>crocheted</span> mom's <span>toys.</span>  For beginners, it is better to pay attention to round and oval shapes.  It can be the sun, ladybug, penguin, chicken, bee, egg, smeshariki, mice, turtles.  Gradually move on to more complex models that are connected by patterns, have moving parts of the body.  Let's consider in more detail how to connect rattles, soft and developing models. </p><h2>  Crocheted round <span>toys</span> (for beginners a master class) </h2><p>  Rattles in the form of ladybugs or turtles are suitable for kids.  To do this, first knit the bottom with single crochet in a circle.  Gather a chain, close it and move in a circle, adding evenly loops (knit two loops in one base).  The diameter of the bottom will determine the size of the toy.  Knit the last row with black thread. </p><p>  Then, according to the same plan, knit the top of the ladybug.  As soon as the circle reaches the same size as the bottom, continue to knit without adding.  That is, the top will start to round and look like a hat.  The last row is also tied with black thread.  If ladybugs are five to seven centimeters in size, then they can be used as Christmas toys (crochet a loop and sew to the body). </p><p>  Then fasten the bottom to the top with <span>connecting posts,</span> fill with padding polyester.  The result was a semicircle.  Now <span>stitch</span> it in half with a black <span>stitch</span> in a stitched <span>seam</span> .  Knit small circles, spots, attach to the body. </p><h2>  Ladybugs, turtles </h2><p>  Next, from black threads, knit an oval-shaped head, like the bottom for booties.  That is, you type a chain of three to five loops and tie in a circle around the columns with a single crochet, adding two loops every other time.  Then fold the oval in half, sew it, fill it with a synthetic winterizer, sew it to the body.  Eyes can be embroidered with threads or sew beads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you put a bell inside, the toy will ring.  If you fill the toys with different contents (buckwheat, peas, beans), then they can be used in the sensory development of children.  Having imposed several ladybugs of different colors, you can learn colors with children, and numbers on the dots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet toys for beginners" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/596382.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  Now consider how to tie a turtle.  The carapace fits in with the plan described above.  For large turtles, add another thread to create spots on the shell.  If small <span>toys, crochet</span> multi-colored rows.  Next, do paws, tail and head.  The principle is one, only the number of loops is different. </p><p>  You start by knitting a circle and then with or without additions (tail), decreases (paws, head with neck) create the desired shape.  Paws and tail are stuffed slightly, if the yarn is dense, then do not use a synthetic winterizer.  Attach all parts to the shell.  Embroider eyes and mouth on the head. </p><h2>  Penguin </h2><p>  Such round toys beginner craftsmen knit not in whole, but in parts.  Consider the example of a penguin. </p><ul><li>  With a white thread from a chain closed in a circle, knit single crochet posts.  In each row, you add two loops each time.  The diameter of the circle indicates the volume of the toy.  Next, knit rows without additions to form the shape of a hat or semicircle.  Do not break the thread yet. </li><li>  Black thread similarly knit the second sphere.  If you lay them on top of each other, you should get a ball.  Otherwise, tie one or another half.  Sew both halves and fill them with padding polyester.  By the way, according to this plan, round Christmas tree decorations are knitted. </li><li>  Crochet knit small white circles for the eyes.  Sew black beads or buttons (pupils) right in the middle. </li><li>  Black thread, like leaves, knit wings.  To do this, draw a wing pattern on paper, with a constant overlay, it will be seen where to add or reduce loops.  Sew wings to the body (top is black, bottom is white). </li><li>  From brown yarn, knit three ovals (description as when creating the head of a ladybug), fold in half, fill with padding polyester, sew on paws and beak.  Fasten your eyes on either side of it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a toy" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/597191.jpg" width="517"></div></li></ul><h2>  Smeshariki </h2><p>  Now consider how to crochet a toy whole.  Smesharikov is made according to this plan.  You start to knit the body like a penguin, only when you reach half, continue to work, reducing loops and forming a ball.  So, do Nyusha as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  start knitting with a chain of two loops; </li><li>  add six columns in each row; </li><li>  make nine rows increase; </li><li>  the next eight rows are knitted without increases; </li><li>  from the nineteenth row you create a parting on the side of the face, changing the threads of different colors; </li><li>  from the twentieth row, you start to reduce six columns in each row; </li><li>  Fill with padding polyester; </li><li>  pull the last three loops with a thread. </li></ul><p>  Separately, knit cheeks in the form of hearts, legs, pens, eyes with eyelids, a patch, sew to the body.  A wire can be inserted into the arms and legs, the end of which is rounded into a loop, wrapped with a synthetic winterizer.  Then the limbs can be twisted, bent.  You make hair out of threads, pulling them through the loop, like a fringe.  Weave into a braid, decorate with a bow. </p><h2>  Toys for patterns </h2><p>  There are toys that are connected so professionally that they cannot be distinguished from factory ones.  But for beginners, models can be connected no worse, the main thing is to know a few nuances.  So, how to crochet a toy to get a "store" look. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet a toy for beginners" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/596383.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <ul><li>  Patterns for sewing soft toys.  Select the image you want to link.  Find patterns for sewing this toy.  Transfer to paper, this will be the pattern by which you will knit patterns.  Use regular single crochet posts or connecting loops.  Then you bind or stitch the patterns together, fill them with a synthetic winterizer - and the toy is ready. </li><li>  Constrictions.  To get the "dimples", "jumpers", you need to pull off the toys crocheted.  For beginners, ready-made toy kits are sold.  But you can practice on bees, bears and bunnies, and then proceed to making dolls.  For example, to make fingers on your paws, you need to wrap the thread from the middle of the palm, insert the needle at the same point and pull the thread. </li><li>  Amiguri.  These miniature toys are difficult to knit, as they require manual dexterity due to their small size (no more than ten centimeters).  But then you can get tremendous experience, which you transfer to the manufacture of large models. </li></ul><h2>  <span>Crochet</span> educational <span>toys:</span> schemes, description </h2><p>  The hook allows you to create a variety of analogues of real objects: animals, plants, products, food, insects, dolls, vehicles, dishes, shoes.  Such toys can be used as didactic material for the study of color, numbers, letters, time, for sensory and speech development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="toy crochet patterns description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/596387.jpg" width="235"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Here's how to make a weather study guide. </p><ul><li>  The sun.  Knit the halves of the ball, as described in the manufacture of the penguin.  Knit the rays with triangles or sew a special braid.  Sew the halves, fill with synthetic winterizer.  Embroider eyes, mouth, cheeks. </li><li>  Clouds, clouds.  Knit large and small circles, which overlap, forming a wave-like cloud.  If you need to add color, then the edging is done with blue or gray threads. </li><li>  Precipitation.  You knit rain with blue droplets, hail with white balls, and snow with snowdrops.  By the way, colorful rainfall is used as <span>Christmas tree decorations.</span>  Crochet (select schemes for beginners) to each element, knit a chain of different lengths. </li><li>  Rainbow.  You make colorful stripes, connect them together, insert a cardboard base, stitch the details. </li></ul><p>  Tie all the details for the strings to a wooden base or an arc on a cradle.  If each element is knitted in large sizes, sewn on arms and legs, then unusual toys are obtained. </p><h2>  Alarm clock </h2><p>  Here is another version of the didactic manual - an alarm clock.  Crocheting a toy for beginners according to the scheme is not difficult. </p><ul><li>  Knit the bottom of the clock in the form of a hexagon with single crochet columns.  Start with a chain of two loops.  In each row, add six columns in the same corner until you get 132 loops.  The last row is tied with a thread of a different color. </li><li>  You create a dial according to this sample.  In the last row, replace the thread and make the sidewall.  Dial a chain equal to the width of the alarm clock, knit it back and forth, attaching a knitted row with a connecting loop with a dial.  Sew at the end of the edge. </li><li>  Sew beads instead of numbers.  Do round eyes, nose, arrows. </li><li>  Knit separately hands in the form of gloves or mittens and legs in the form of booties. </li><li>  In the shape of the dial from cardboard cut out two basics. </li><li>  Now connect the crocheted toys.  For beginners, it‚Äôs easier to sew eyes, nose, arrows on the dial, and then stitch all the details.  Insert the cardboard into the watch, fill it with a synthetic winterizer, cover it with a second cardboard blank and a knitted bottom, sew it with a needle.  Sew hands to the sides, and attach legs below. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet toys with patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/596384.jpg" width="393"></div></li></ul><h2>  Vegetables, fruits, berries, food </h2><p>  Children willingly play in the store, and for this you need goods.  The foam analogue quickly becomes worthless, but knitted products are pleased with their variety: sweets, eggs, chicken, sausages, vegetables, beef steak, fruits, sandwiches, berries, pasta, fried eggs, greens, cakes, cakes, etc. The main thing is to choose the color of the thread, and you can tie any three-dimensional toys with a crochet (there will be no difficulties with schemes). </p><p>  Chocolate Cake with Berry: </p><ul><li>  From thick foam rubber (from a thickness of five centimeters), cut a circle. </li><li>  Divide it into pieces of cake and cut. </li><li>  Now tie the foam pieces. </li><li>  Start at the top.  With a white thread you knit a triangle, try on the foam rubber.  Pass the last row with brown thread and go to the sidewalls.  Try on a template periodically and change the thread color to highlight layers of biscuits. </li><li>  Finish with a brown triangle, which is tied from the side of the piece.  Attach to the template, sew the sidewalls. </li><li>  Thus, knit out all the pieces of the cake.  Then sew cream from the ‚Äúcream‚Äù edge (separately knit a chain with numerous arches with columns and picot). </li><li>  Sew Velcro to the pieces of the cake, which holds the culinary masterpiece together. </li></ul><p>  If you sew a loop to individual pieces and insert special blanks, you will get a keychain.  And if you make different colors, then you can use it as original New Year's toys.  Crochet (berry patterns are given below) knit strawberries, "cream" leaves, flowers and other culinary decorations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="small crochet toy patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/597502.jpg" width="153"></div>

    <h2>  Strawberry </h2><p>  Strawberry is knitted from 12 rows: </p><ul><li>  Chain of three loops. </li><li>  6 single crochet. </li><li>  Add 3 more rows for three columns. </li><li>  Next, add five rows of five loops. </li><li>  It should turn out 25 loops, knit without rows four rows. </li><li>  Reduce eight times, reaching 17 columns. </li><li>  Reduce five times, leaving 12 loops. </li></ul><p>  Turn the strawberries over, stretch them with your fingers, giving them the necessary shape.  Fill with padding polyester, tighten the thread.  Sew the leaves with a green thread, make white grains with a needle. </p><p>  Any fruits, vegetables fit in the original.  So, a banana consists of a milk core and a yellow peel, which diverges from the middle into four parts;  carrots knit in increments, like strawberries, only elongated;  radishes with beets are also similar to knitting sweet berries, only the base has a wider one. </p><p>  Crocheting a toy for beginners will be easy if you mentally divide it into sectors of geometric shapes.  For example, divide an apple into six petal parts.  When they are stitched and filled with syntepon, sharper forms are obtained.  The top and bottom of the apple are pulled together with a thread and decorated with a twig with a leaf.  A cut apple resembles the shape of a tortoise shell, only put a cardboard circle in the bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas toys crochet patterns" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/596380.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Crocheting allows you to create products in whole or in part.  Beginners can start with tying wooden or plastic blanks, then there will be an experience in knitting different geometric shapes.  And then you can create different toys yourself.  Also pay attention to yarn.  Now it is presented in different configurations (grass, lumps, ribbon-like, spools, flowers), which allows you to create fantastic images. </p>
