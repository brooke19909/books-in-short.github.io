    <p>  Trinity Bridge was built in 1824 on the site of the St. Petersburg bridge and at first it was also scaffold, that is, floating.  An interesting detail: at first they wanted to name this building in honor of <span>Suvorov, whose monument</span> is in close proximity, but later Troitskaya Square with the eponymous cathedral located on it was taken as a landmark. </p><p>  The city grew, so did its needs.  The bridge bridge did not meet the current moment, so it was decided to build a permanent one.  The final decision was made in 1892, after which not even the All-Russian, but the international competition of projects was announced.  G. Eiffel's company won, but she was never able to realize her plans.  The construction called the Trinity Bridge.  St. Petersburg "began to build another French company -" Batignolles ", whose project was favorably low cost, and it was assumed that both the workers and materials will be domestic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In parallel with the construction of the main structure, embankments that connected the Trinity <span>Bridge, Ioannovsky</span> and Sampsonievsky were covered with granite.  In total, about 1,100 meters of area were found under granite.  The grand opening of this part of the city was specially dedicated to the memorable date - the bicentenary of the founding of St. Petersburg.  This event, which took place in an extremely solemn atmosphere, was attended by the first persons of the city and state, as well as the President of France, for whose retinue a special tent was spread. </p>

    <p>  The revolution that took place in 1917 led to the fact that the Trinity Bridge was renamed.  A year later, he received the proud name of the bridge of Equality, and since 1934, for the long 57 years, became Kirovsky.  Only with the end of the Soviet era, this magnificent engineering building was returned to its former name. </p><p>  In the formidable 1941-1944.  Leningrad, as you know, was blockaded for a long nine hundred days.  During all this time, hundreds of thousands of shells, bombs and ammunition were fired at the city, but the Trinity Bridge suffered little.  Only twenty years later, the first serious reconstruction was carried out, which turned it into a modern engineering structure.  Also, quite serious work was carried out in anticipation of the celebration of the centenary of the city, the result of which was the return to the bridge of its former grace. </p><p>  Today, the total length of the structure exceeds 580 meters, and the part that rises above the river is about one hundred meters.  Trinity bridge on the map of <span>sights of St. Petersburg</span> takes its rightful place.  It is far from accidental that for several years now it has been an object of Russia's cultural heritage.  Thousands of tourists admire it both in the daytime and at night. </p>
