The question is not only how to distinguish a fake from a coin of two rubles of 1722, but how not to acquire the so-called remake.  This is the name of banknotes issued much later using original stamps.  Accordingly, the cost of such coins will be lower. </p><h2>  What does a coin look like </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bestmani.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Obverse and reverse coins" class="if uuid-2931883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2931883.jpg"></div><p>  These coins were minted in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Of course, stamps already existed at that time, making banknotes quite the same.  However, the technology of coinage was not perfect, so slight differences in coins are acceptable.  Knowing these differences, it is not difficult to distinguish the original from a cheap fake in a coin of two rubles of 1722. </p><p>  The weight of the original coin is 49.9 grams, the recognized remodelers have significantly less - 31.20 grams. </p><p>  On the obverse of the coin, we clearly distinguish the profile of Emperor Peter I face to the right.  On the autocrat‚Äôs head, a laurel wreath is a symbol of power.  On the rim of the coin is an inscription with the name of the emperor, divided by an eight-pointed star. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the center of the coin reverse is a monogram of the emperor, consisting of four intersecting letters "P".  Each of them ends with the imperial crown.  In the center of the monogram we clearly distinguish the year of coinage.  An inscription is made on the rim of the coin, telling about the face value and its novelty.  The letters of the inscription face inward. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="coins.lave.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin reverse" class="if uuid-2932033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2932033.jpg"></div><p>  Historians still can not come to a consensus on why this coin was issued in 1722.  It is known that they decided to issue it in addition to the then existing gold coin of this denomination.  However, the issue of silver two rubles was not massive.  It is still not known what exact circulation the first coins were issued. </p><p>  Some numismatists are even sure that the entire first circulation of this money was a trial.  In total, only two coins with a face value of two rubles of minting in 1722 are known for certain.  Studying them, you can find out how to distinguish two rubles of 1722 from more modern coins. </p><h2>  Trial samples </h2><div class="photo" data-original="antikvarus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin 2 rubles 1722" class="if uuid-2931908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2931908.jpg"></div><p>  The well-known numismatist S. I. Shoduar reported the existence of the first such coin stored in Kuntskamera.  This specimen, with a mesh notch on the edge and weighing 49.9 grams, was included in the catalog of coins and medals in 1745.  However, the author of the catalog "Description of Russian Coins and Medals", published in 1843, F.F. Schubert considered this coin a test sample.  Since 1927, this coin has been in the collection of the Hermitage.  It does not appear in catalogs and for all the time access to it had an extremely limited number of scientists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a second genuine coin with a face value of 2 rubles issued in 1722.  Its history can be traced to the collection of Grand Duke George Mikhailovich and is now kept at the Smithsonian Institution.  It is slightly different from the first sample: the weight of the coin is 54.44 grams, and it is minted on a thicker basis.  Surprisingly, it has a less clear image of Emperor Peter I and the very basis of the coin is far from ideal. </p><p>  This suggests that the first batch of coins was issued in a small trial edition.  Then the issue of coins was discontinued and resumed only at the beginning of the XIX century.  The circulation of new ones could be much larger and they can be seen at auctions of numismatists and in private collections.  Therefore, figuring out how to distinguish the original of two rubles in 1722, one should consider the characteristics of these later issued coins. </p><h2>  Coins of the beginning of the XIX century </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visual coin size" class="if uuid-2931937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2931937.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that coins issued in subsequent circulations are not so rare, their cost is quite high.  In order to understand how to distinguish a fake of two rubles of 1722 from a remake, you need to know the signs of a real coin. </p><p>  At one time, it was believed that new stamps made later than 1722 were also used to mint new coins.  This was also indicated by the lower weight of the new coins: from 31 grams.  Even the numismatists were embarrassed by the fact that on the new products in the portrait of the emperor there were no mustaches. </p><p>  However, in 1991, Hermitage employee E.V. Lepekhin, who studied the history of these mysterious coins, made an interesting suggestion.  Her research confirmed that the same stamps were used for the manufacture of the first coins, one of which is stored in the Hermitage, and for later circulations.  It‚Äôs just that they were stored in the mint's vaults for more than sixty years and were thoroughly cleaned before use.  Due to this crude process, some features of the genuine stamp have been erased or slightly changed.  For example, on the reverse of the coin, five points completely disappeared (under the four crowns and in the center of the coin), which the engravers of that time set for orientation.  Also, several letters were erased. </p><p>  After this discovery, additional studies were carried out, a large number of coins were checked and signs of stamp identity were found on each. </p><h2>  Where to buy coins </h2><div class="photo" data-original="auction.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ribbed Edge Coin" class="if uuid-2932023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2932023.jpg"></div><p>  These coins are considered quite rare and attract the attention of collectors.  Therefore, it is important to know how to distinguish the fake of two rubles in 1722. </p><p>  Do not focus on the different weight of the coins, in those days, they were still not able to mint absolutely identical counterparts.  The diameter of a genuine coin should be 49 mm, but deviations are also allowed in this parameter.  It is interesting that such instances do not have the concept of ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù, each genuine coin is unique. </p><p>  Experienced numismatists do not recommend considering the acquisition of such valuable and rare lots in online stores.  Most likely, high-quality fakes are offered there.  Sometimes fake coins are made with such skill that it is difficult for even an experienced one to distinguish two rubles of 1722 from a fake. </p><p>  It is much safer to entrust transactions with such a coin to the auction house, which will guarantee the authenticity of the banknote. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.numizmatik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sale of old coins" class="if uuid-2932020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2932020.jpg"></div><p>  For such rare coins, the main criterion for value is their safety.  Silver is a soft metal, so there are almost no old coins in perfect condition.  However, when such a banknote is found, its value may exceed 1 million rubles. </p><p>  And the cost of a rare commemorative coin exposed with the mark proof may well exceed 2 million.  Although these amounts only apply to copies in good condition, they offer lower amounts for the erased ones, it is useful to know how to distinguish a fake of two rubles from 1722 from a genuine coin and not be disappointed. </p><h2>  Check at home </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bestmani.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins 2 rubles 1722" class="if uuid-2931879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2931879.jpg"></div><p>  Before carrying the coin found to expert evaluators, you can conduct a first check on the authenticity of the coin at home.  There are several easy ways: </p><ul><li>  At the first visual inspection, check for scuffs and damage.  In a fake, foreign metal will be visible there. </li><li>  The ringing of a precious metal coin when it hits a stone slab will be melodic and clear. </li><li>  Silver does not have magnetic properties, therefore, if a coin has signs of magnetism, it contains an admixture of other metals, and it is fake. </li><li>  Excessive gloss or, conversely, excessive dullness of the surface of the coin may indicate the presence of extraneous impurities, such as zinc, in the alloy. </li></ul><p>  Professional experts know many more subtleties of how to distinguish a fake of two rubles in 1722, but they are not immune from mistakes.  To date, the only sure way to find out the true age of a coin is considered to be spectral analysis, but, due to the high cost, this expertise is not available to every collector. </p>
