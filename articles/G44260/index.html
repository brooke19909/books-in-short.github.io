Then, a little later - in Germany. </p><p>  The first Gothic building in architecture is considered to be the church at the monastery of Saint-Denis, located near Paris.  Built by the design of Abbot Suger, it is a typical Gothic structure with lancet arches.  She was distinguished from Romanesque fortresses by great grace. </p><p>  In general, the Gothic style in architecture inherited from the Romanesque primacy of architecture in the general system of arts and the main types of religious buildings.  In the art of Gothic cathedrals occupied a special place. </p><p>  The cathedrals built in <span>this style</span> were the highest synthesis of architecture with sculpture and painting.  The massive round arches of the <span>Romanesque style</span> replaced the arches with a pointed top characteristic for Gothic, tall and narrow columns and towers, lancet multi-color stained-glass windows, a generously decorated facade with an abundance of carved details (vimperga, tympanum, archivolt).  All elements were designed to emphasize the vertical. </p><p>  <strong>Gothic style in architecture</strong> was named after the Greek "gotos".  In antiquity, the Goths were called the barbarian tribes that invaded the territory of the <span>Roman Empire</span> from the north.  According to legend, this term was first used by Raphael. </p><p>  The cathedral and the cross became symbols of Gothic architecture, replacing the castle and the sword of the Romanesque style.  For the XII century.  a huge influence on the life of religion is characteristic. </p><p>  Gothic temples have been built for generations.  Notre Dame Cathedral was built over two centuries, the Roman Cathedral from 1211 to the beginning of the XV century, and Milan - until the XIX. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Gothic architecture</strong> was supposed to symbolize heavenly harmony in the temples.  Therefore, designs were invented that made it possible to overcome the roughness of the stone.  It was turned with the help of professional carving into "lace". </p><p>  The artistic secret was that the visual design of the Gothic buildings did not coincide with reality.  Huge heavy arches seem cloudy-airy, masterly altered traditional proportions make it difficult to navigate, understand the logic of the design and realize the real scale.  In the <span>Gothic cathedral,</span> it seems that the soil is leaving under the feet, and the man himself ascends into the bottomless infinity of the sky. </p><p>  Gothic style in architecture loves play with light.  The key point of this style is to create the effect of the ever-flowing Divine light, which symbolizes spiritual wisdom and enlightenment.  Stained-glass windows serve this purpose. </p><p>  Gothic style developed mainly in cities.  The prevailing colors of architecture are yellow, blue and red.  The lines of buildings and structures become lancet in nature, the arches are formed by crossing arcs.  The buildings are erected mostly rectangular in shape with numerous <span>lancet arches</span> turning into pillars. </p><p>  Mandatory interior details are faithful arches with supports, complex leafy ornaments.  The structures of the buildings are characterized by the openwork of the frame stone supports, windows elongated upward, underlined by the skeleton of the structure.  Stained-glass windows made of multicolor glass become an integral part of the design, sometimes there are round decorative windows.  Doors are decorated with lancet ribbed arches. </p><p>  The look of the buildings in the Gothic style takes on a certain fantasy, appearing at the sight of stone walls that seem light and airy.  This lightness, airiness, irrationality and mystical vision are the mandatory properties of any building in the Gothic style. </p><p>  Gothic style went through three historical stages of development - these are Early Gothic, Rise (High Gothic) and Late Gothic. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XVI century, the Gothic style in architecture begins to lose its position in connection with the advent of Renaissance traditions. </p>
