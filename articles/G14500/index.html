    <h2>  How is the regulator arranged? </h2><p>  An important element of the regulator is considered to be microcircuits.  In their parameters, they can quite differ.  If we consider professional models, then there are up to 100 different contacts.  Additionally, in the controller there is a controller that is engaged in changing the limit frequency of the device.  Capacitors cope with interference in the device.  In a simple model there are up to four of them.  You can usually find <span>ceramic capacitors</span> in the regulator <span>.</span>  Their frequency, as a rule, is indicated in the labeling. </p>

    <p>  In professional models, electrolytic capacitors are installed.  Their conductivity is much better, but they are expensive.  Resistors in the standard circuit can be found up to ten units.  They differ from each other in ultimate resistance.  The simplest models can boast a parameter of 2 ohms.  Resistors with such indicators are quite common.  Finally, the closing element should be called the last element of the regulator.  Most often it is presented in the form of a button, but there are models with a complex display system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Application of electronic model </h2><p>  An electronic volume control is installed on almost all sound devices.  In this case, fluctuations can be varied in various ways.  Most often, you can find smooth controllers that allow you to very subtly insist on sound, but there are jump systems.  In this case, the change of parameters is carried out step by step and sharply.  Recording studios have multi-channel devices for mixers.  They allow you to adjust many effects.  If we consider the combined electronic volume control, then a lot in this case depends on the speaker system. </p><h2>  Self-assembly of the regulator </h2><p>  In order to assemble a do-it-yourself volume control for an average power amplifier, you will need a chip of at least 8 bits.  Transistors for her are best used bipolar.  Usually they are presented in the store with the marking "2".  The resistance index of them fluctuates on average around 3 ohms.  The controllers are mostly linear linear.  They allow you to quite smoothly change the limit frequency.  In this case, the amplitude of the interference will depend solely on the capacitors. </p>

    <p>  For a normal controller, it will be enough to install three of them.  LEDs can only be used in conjunction with rectifiers.  In some cases, in order to make the volume control with your own hands, it is additionally recommended to use a zener diode at the beginning of the circuit.  This element significantly increases the performance of resistors and the regulator as a whole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How are headphone controls? </h2><p>  The headphone volume control has only two capacitors.  A distinctive feature of such devices can be called low bandwidth.  The signal in many models takes a long time.  This is due to the fact that transistors are not designed for high power.  Some regulator models have resonators.  They exist of different types and have their own parameters.  Most often you can find <span>quartz resonators.</span>  The resistance parameter in them reaches 4 ohms.  In turn, ferrite analogues can withstand only 2 ohms.  The volume control for headphones is connected to the speaker using a throttle. </p><h2>  Tone Control Circuit </h2><p>  Tone and volume controls The controller has an operating one.  It is suitable for amplifiers of different capacities.  Diodes in this case are installed quite rarely.  Rectifiers are only in models where there are less than three transistors.  Resistors in devices are turned on with the marking "BC".  Their <span>throughput</span> is pretty good, but they are sensitive to high temperatures.  Capacitors in many models are bipolar.  Extreme resistance tone and volume controls are able to withstand at 3 ohms.  In the standard model, the socket has a "PPA" for a conventional ring.  The inductor with the resistor are connected only through the converter. </p><h2>  How to configure the regulator in Windows? </h2><p>  Adjusting the controller is quite simple.  The icon for this item is located in the Start panel.  By clicking on it once with the left button, you can change the limit frequency.  In some cases, the user does not see the indicated icon.  This is due to the fact that the Windows volume control is not added to the notification area.  Usually it is transferred automatically by the operating system.  However, this action can also be performed manually through the control panel.  Also, the reason may be the absence of the Sndvol.exe file.  In this case, a copy of it must be saved on the computer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Stereo Settings </h2><p>  Their noise figure is in the region of 70 dB.  The nonlinear distortion parameter is usually 0.001%.  The range of operating frequencies ranges from 0 to 10000 Hz.  The input voltage of the device is 0.5 V. In many models, the controllers are installed reversible.  The output voltage in this case should be equal to no more than 0.5 V. The stabilizer stereo volume control usually has a pulse.  The device is powered through a unit with a voltage of up to 15 V. </p><h2>  Microphone Models with Controls </h2><p>  A microphone with a volume control is today a common device, and the microcircuit in it usually has the MK22 series.  The bandwidth of the models is quite high, the signal passes well.  There are two in the standard diode circuit.  One of them, as a rule, is located near the locking mechanism.  Capacitors are installed with various parameters.  This is necessary in order to control frequencies of various sizes. </p><p>  Their resistance is maintained on average up to 4 ohms.  Capacitors in the regulator should only be electrolytic.  In this case, this will give a big increase to the sensitivity of the device.  Resistors in the standard circuit have up to eight units.  They average resistance is maintained at 3 ohms.  The volume control has a direct locking mechanism in the form of a controller. </p><h2>  Button controller circuit </h2><p>  The button volume control (the diagram is shown below) differs from other devices in that its diodes are arranged in pairs.  As a result, the chip quickly transmits a signal to the resistor.  There are no rectifiers in many models, and this should be taken into account.  Condensers in the standard circuit provides up to three units.  Their maximum resistance is maintained at 2 ohms.  The noise figure for such models fluctuates around 50 dB on average. </p>

    <p>  The nonlinear distortion index, in turn, is 0.002%.  Among the shortcomings, certain problems with unevenness should be noted.  This is due to the small range of operating frequencies.  In some cases, it makes sense to install an amplifier with a voltage of more than 15 V. In this case, the sound parameters will increase. </p><h2>  Passive regulators </h2><p>  The passive volume control differs from other devices in that it is multi-channel.  Their resistance is maintained at an average of 3 ohms.  Locking mechanisms are installed standard.  In turn, the controllers in them are exclusively digital.  Thanks to this, the stereo sound in the device can be synchronized more accurately.  Thus, the problem with unevenness disappears by itself. </p><p>  Resistors in many models are trimmer type.  A distinctive feature of professional models is the presence of a resonator.  The output voltage of this element can reach 8 V. Most often, they are installed in the regulators of the quartz type.  There are two capacitors in the standard circuit.  The microcircuit in the system is designed for 8 bits. </p><h2>  Using Active Models </h2><p>  Active volume control, as a rule, is used for receivers whose power does not exceed 5 V. Resistors are available in it with a resistance of about 4 ohms.  Resonators are mounted quartz.  A distinctive feature of these regulators are signal relays.  Chokes, as a rule, are not used in devices.  Amplifiers are captured only operational type.  In this regard, there is no need for rectifiers.  Indication systems in devices can be found in a wide variety.  For mobile devices, such a volume control is not suitable. </p><h2>  Combined controller circuit </h2><p>  The combined volume control (diagram shown below) of the capacitors has no more than five pieces.  In this case, transistors can only be used bipolar type.  Their bandwidth is quite high.  Resistance is maintained at an average of 3 ohms.  Linear transistors are provided in the system.  Stabilizers are caught only in professional models.  The maximum frequency for them does not exceed 4000 Hz. </p>
