By that time, the first was already mature, was married to Olga.  According to legend, Prince Igor met his wife during a hunt.  Seeing Olga, he was captivated by her beauty and mind.  Subsequently, despite the permitted polygamy in Russia, Prince Igor had no more wives than his first.  This indicates not only his boundless love for Olga, but also her exceptional qualities. </p><p>  Prince Igor.  Biography </p><p>  According to historians, the Russian state was very lucky with the first rulers.  Characteristics of Prince Igor indicates the presence of such qualities as a bright mind, energy. </p><p>  After Oleg‚Äôs death, the state began to disintegrate.  Having revolted, drevlyans wanted to be separated from the Kiev power.  In addition, the Pechenegs increased their onslaught.  However, decisive Igor again conquered the Drevlyans, imposing a heavy tribute on them.  He sent a strong army to the Pechenegs, and they preferred to make peace. </p><p>  Along with this, the Rusich began to advance towards the mouth of the Dnieper, to the Byzantine guard posts.  Russian settlers appeared on the Taman Peninsula.  Igor contributed to the establishment of a colony around the city of Tmutarakan. </p><p>  In 941, a campaign was launched on Constantinople.  Part of the huge army moved on water, part on land.  However, on the approaches to the Constantinople, the Russians met the Greek fleet, armed with "fire."  Russian ships were burned.  However, most of the troops of Prince Igor survived and continued the battle on the coast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Returning home, Prince Igor decided to take revenge on the Greeks.  For this it was necessary to collect a large army.  To equip the troops needed money.  The loan was given by Jewish moneylenders.  From across the sea Igor called in the army of the Varangians, and also hired the Pechenegs.  Two years later, with cavalry and navy Igor again headed for Greece.  Roman Lakapin (Byzantine emperor) was not sure of victory.  In an effort to save his empire, he sends ambassadors to Igor with tribute, rich gifts and promises to give even more if he agrees to peace with them.  After meeting with the army, Rusich accepted the offer of the Greeks.  Having ordered the Pechenegs to ruin Bulgaria, Igor returned to Kiev.  In 944, an official peace was concluded. </p><p>  During the reign of Igor there was a further rallying and unification of the tribes of the Eastern Slavs.  Streets joined Russia.  At the same time, the concept of "Russian Land" arises.  That is how Russia was called in all documents signed with the Byzantine Empire. </p><p>  Igor, having freed the Slavic people from paying tribute to the Khazars, imposed his own tribute on the former.  Since it was allowed to give not only money, but also products and goods, the Slavs became a little easier to pay.  However, in this case too, it was a certain dependence on the Russians.  Repeatedly, the Slavs, dissatisfied with their sweetheart (tribute), revolted. </p><p>  It should be noted that in Russia there was no clearly established amount of tribute.  She was taken "by eye".  Polyud began in the late fall.  Together with the squad, the prince traveled around the state, stopping in small settlements and large cities.  Polyud continued throughout the winter, ending in early spring.  The tribute included not only craft goods and money, but also what was drunk and eaten during the stops of the squad and the prince.  Sometimes there was cruelty. </p><p>  In 945, Igor went for a tribute with the army.  As you know, he owed the Jewish moneylenders.  Unfortunately, military battles did not bring trophy troops.  Having collected tribute from the Drevlyans, on the way home, Igor suddenly decides to return with a small retinue and collect an additional tribute.  However, having warned him that they would not give anything else, the Drevlyans were already embittered and armed.  But Igor continued on his way.  As a result, the drevlyansky ruler Mal killed the entire retinue.  Prince Igor was tied to two bent tree trunks and torn in half. </p>
