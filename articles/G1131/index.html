This was an important stage in the end of the <span>Livonian War.</span>  At first it was signed for three years, then the parties were forced to extend it for another four years.  The negotiation process took place in several stages, which is explained by the duration of the war and the clash of interests of the two states. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Plyus truce summed up the debilitating confrontation between the two countries over the Baltic coast.  Our country turned out to be divorced from access to the sea from the north after the Mongol invasion, and until the 18th century it fought for the restoration of this right.  The Polish-Lithuanian state did not want to allow this.  This war ended unsuccessfully for our country and a year before the Plyus truce was signed, the Russian government signed an agreement on the transfer to the enemy of Livonia and the city of Polotsk. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the plus armistice" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1436805.jpg" width="593"></div></h2><h2>  Training </h2><p>  The negotiation process in 1583 stretched into several stages.  Initially, the parties signed a preliminary agreement for two months.  The final version of the contract was executed only in August this year.  But after 2 years, our country and the Swedish government concluded the so-called second Plyus ceasefire, which entered into force a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Provisions </h2><p>  It is indicative of the fact that at first the delegations were not able to come to a compromise on territorial issues.  The only thing they have achieved is consent to peace.  The second contract already contained specific provisions regarding the division of holdings.  The main difficulty for our country was that the Swedish delegation did not want to cede to Moscow the lands occupied by its army during the hostilities.  In the end, she managed to keep a number of cities, such as Yam, Koporye and others with their counties.  Our country managed to maintain access to the sea through a narrow passage in the Neva River. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plus armistice date" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1436797.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Value </h2><p>  The Plyus truce, whose date is 1583, summed up the outcome of the difficult war for access to the Baltic Sea.  Unfortunately, Russia did not achieve its goal, largely due to the aggravated domestic political situation (the country was weakened economically due to oprichnina).  Russia lost a number of strategically important territories, but retained the mouth of the Neva.  We must not forget that these land concessions were temporary.  Within a few years, the war began again for the northern regions, which were equally important for both sides. </p>
