  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get from Vienna to Salzburg: options, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The old woman Europe is several times smaller than Russia.  The cities there are sometimes so close to each other that funny incidents happen: a city from a neighboring country may be closer to your village than another city in your own country.  The distance from point to point here is always small and can be easily overcome.  Nevertheless, going on a trip from one city to another, it is worthwhile to think through your route in advance and find out what you can go on.  Here, for example, how to get from Vienna to Salzburg? </p><h2>  Departure Point: Vienna </h2><p>  Before telling which transport runs on this route, you should get acquainted with the cities themselves. </p><p>  So Vienna is the capital of Austria.  Standing on the Danube, at the foot of the Alps, it has a little less than two million inhabitants and is the seventh most populous <span>European city.</span>  Vienna is a truly ancient city, it was founded in the first century.  Now the so-called Old Town - the most ancient, centuries-old buildings - is the center of the Austrian capital, around which new streets lie in rings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marseille-airport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Vienna" class="if uuid-2591879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591879.jpg"></div><p>  Just a stone's throw from Vienna, borders with Slovakia and Hungary pass.  It is noteworthy that in the thirties of the last century, one could get to the capital of Slovakia, Bratislava, by the most ordinary city tram.  As for Hungary, it is worth recalling that Vienna was previously the main city of the Austro-Hungarian empire, was a major cultural center, had a certain authority (if I may say so in relation to the locality), but with the fall of the empire, all its former power had sunk into oblivion . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, in addition to the many research centers and universities located here, a large number of diverse international organizations are based in Vienna;  including this is the third city for UN headquarters. </p><h2>  Destination: Salzburg </h2><p>  From German, the name of the town is translated as Salt Fortress.  The Austrian fortress city, which is located five kilometers from the German border, is even older than Vienna itself, the distance with which, by the way, is almost three hundred kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wexas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beauty Salzburg" class="if uuid-2591893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591893.jpg"></div><p>  Salzburg ranks fourth in the country in terms of population, and almost one hundred and fifty thousand people live in it.  Previously, the city was called Yuvavum - even in those days when in its place there was just a small settlement.  As in Vienna, in Salzburg there is a central historical part with ancient buildings, which is of such value that it is even included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><h2>  From Vienna to Salzburg </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the distance between these two points is approximately three hundred kilometers.  How can they be overcome?  There are several options, each is worth disassembling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turistigid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vienna - Salzburg" class="if uuid-2592181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2592181.jpg"></div><h2>  Car </h2><p>  This is probably the easiest option that immediately comes to mind and seems to be the easiest and most convenient.  Indeed, what could be simpler - I got into the car and drove, the road would take only about three hours.  However, there are some difficulties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lesmauritanies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Austrian capital Vienna" class="if uuid-2591885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591885.jpg"></div><p>  Firstly, this is a car rental (of course, this item does not apply to those who have their own vehicle).  Secondly, this is gasoline - knowledgeable people say that they will need about twenty-four liters.  All this is quite expensive, and tiring - because all the time you have to stay in suspense while driving.  On the other hand, there is a definite plus on such a trip - the opportunity to admire the incredibly beautiful nature, stop wherever you want, and take pictures for memory.  So you need to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. </p><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  Another option for how to get from Vienna to Salzburg is the bus.  True, this is for inveterate adventurers and for those who do not mind their time - the thing is that there are no direct bus routes between these two cities.  You can leave with transfers from the <span>Vienna</span> Erdberg station, but there are also no suitable flights for every day.  The price of the issue will be approximately 20 euros, or slightly less than 1,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Vienna - Salzburg: train </h2><p>  The most simple and convenient transport that allows you to get in this case from point A to point B is a train.  Immediately on the benefits: </p><ol><li>  Beautiful views from the window, which you can enjoy at your pleasure, without being distracted by the road while driving. </li><li>  Convenient, comfortable trains with Wi-Fi, sockets for recharging laptops and phones, air conditioning. </li><li>  Frequent runs - trains run from Vienna to Salzburg every hour.  Sometimes even more often - once every half an hour.  You can find out the detailed and exact timetable of the Vienna - Salzburg trains on the station website or directly on the spot. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.parismatch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viennese Krsots" class="if uuid-2591889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591889.jpg"></div><p>  There you can buy a ticket at the ticket office (another option is to buy in advance online, in the most extreme case it is permissible to do this in the train itself from the controller).  The cost of the trip will cost about 19 euros (1400 rubles), and the whole trip will take about two and a half hours.  An interesting feature of the <span>Austrian railway</span> is that many types of tickets suggest the possibility of interrupting the route in order to get acquainted with some town on the way from Vienna to Salzburg.  Later, you can continue on another train, but on the same ticket. </p><h2>  Air travel </h2><p>  And finally, the last way to get from Vienna to Salzburg is by plane.  Not to say that it was too convenient an option - it takes no less travel time than by train or car (plus you need to add time here to get to and from the airport), and for money it will come out incomparably more - from 60 euros to at least 200 s superfluous (from 4420 to 14 700 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salzburg in Austria" class="if uuid-2591898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591898.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, this pleasure is very doubtful - except for those who cannot live without flights and sky.  Such amateurs can find the flying planes on the route Vienna - Salzburg and the schedule of their flights on the airport website of either of these two cities. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  If you already go from one settlement to another, then you need to know that it is definitely worth a visit there.  In Salzburg, this is the house in which Mozart was born - one of the most popular Austrian museums;  Amusing fountains and the Helbrunn Palace are the princes' summer resting place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirabell Palace Salzburg" class="if uuid-2591902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591902.jpg"></div><p>  Still, once in Salzburg, it is worth seeing the Mirabell Palace and Park - a favorite place for romantic dates and wedding ceremonies, which in the seventeenth century was built by one of the local princes for his beloved;  Getragedasse - the central street of the old part of the city;  Zoo, Cathedral Quarter, Nature House and many other amazing places and attractions.  By the way, it is worth visiting the vicinity of the city - there is also something to see there! </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ol><li>  The inhabitants of Salzburg from ancient times had the nickname "bull washers", which they probably got because of the habit of washing the meat of freshly slaughtered cattle right in the river. </li><li>  The famous musical Sounds of Music was filmed in Salzburg. </li><li>  The oldest newspaper in the world comes out in Vienna. </li><li>  Croissant is not a French invention.  It was first baked in Vienna and was then called the Viennese bagel. </li><li>  In Vienna there is a monument to Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.klook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salzburg, Austria" class="if uuid-2591895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2591895.jpg"></div><p>  Now everyone knows how special the city of Salzburg is and how you can get from Vienna to Salzburg. </p>
