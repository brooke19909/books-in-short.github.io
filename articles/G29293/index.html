The cost of rest on them is incredibly high, but this does not become an obstacle for moneybags.  The rich and famous, dreaming of loneliness, find him in a private territory owned by the British billionaire R. Branson. </p><h2>  The most expensive resort in the world </h2><p>  Many adherents of ecotourism would like to find themselves on an island lost in the Caribbean, but everyone is stopped by the fabulous sums that will have to be paid per night (from two thousand dollars per person and more). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="necker island" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1490236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, the most expensive and prestigious resort in the world is called Necker Island in honor of the commander of the Dutch squadron J. de Necker.  Surrounded by coral reefs, the azure sea, golden beaches, the island is an ideal place for a relaxed and secluded vacation. </p><h2>  Island Acquisition History </h2><p>  When today's billionaire was 26 years old, he fell in love with a girl without a memory and really wanted to make a favorable impression on her.  The young man pretended to want the island of Necker.  The Virgin Islands have always been considered a haven for the richest people in the world and have been associated with luxury.  The young man had no money at that time, but he vowed to himself that sooner or later he would acquire the pearl of the Caribbean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over time, all the dreams of <span>Richard Branson</span> come true: he is married to the same girl, and he owns the most expensive island in the world.  Necker Branson, who owns the largest corporation, went back to Virgin Islands in 1978 in search of promising real estate.  When he found out that the very island he dreamed about was put up for sale, he immediately bought an uninhabited piece of land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="necker branson island" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1490237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The government of the archipelago imposed stringent conditions on the owner: he must develop a resort, otherwise Necker (the island) will return to the state.  Sir Branson complied with the requirements and turned an abandoned tropical paradise with an area of ​​300 thousand square meters into the best vacation spot on earth, which many Hollywood celebrities and famous politicians seek to get to. </p><h2>  Luxury hotel </h2><p>  Designers and architects invited from different countries set up an uninhabited area, and the result of their work was a wonderful villa with 10 rooms in a colorful Balinese style.  Later appeared five more, smaller sizes, where guests can comfortably settle down. </p><p>  In 1984, one of the most luxurious hotels on our planet opened, which is part of the enormous Virgin Limited Edition chain owned by Branson. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It can accommodate 28 guests, and a team of 60 people will do everything so that the rest spent at the resort is remembered as the best adventure.  Trained staff will fulfill any whim of guests and provide a high level of service. </p><p>  True, you need to make an amendment and say that Necker (the island) is rented out entirely, and for 50 thousand dollars a day he turns into a private club for his own.  This gives a unique opportunity to those who rent it, relax in the company and arrange just such a vacation that everyone will like. </p><h2>  Wonderful climate </h2><p>  Vacationers are attracted not only by amazing natural landscapes, but also by a comfortable climate that allows splashing in the sea all year round.  In summer and winter, the water temperature does not drop below 26 degrees.  True, in the autumn, in October – November, slight precipitation is observed, but after short rains the sun again peeps out, delighting important people. </p><h2>  What does Necker offer its guests? </h2><p>  The island, which is an excellent refuge from all stresses and problems, offers a huge range of entertainment: </p><ul><li>  wonderful beach holidays; </li><li>  hydromassage baths; </li><li>  water sports with an instructor; </li><li>  sail cruises; </li><li>  swimming in the pool and in the submarine; </li><li>  kitesurfing; </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  windsurfing. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Guests of the island who have arrived on vacation with children can not worry that their child will remain unattended.  A personal nanny will allow parents to relax from worries about their babies.  There are all conditions for making children as comfortable as adults. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Necker (island) is known for its flamingos, the will of a billionaire who became part of his "family".  200 beautiful birds that are not afraid of people will delight with amazing grace. </p><p>  Once a year, a billionaire hosts a Celebration Week.  It was at this time that the island was available for booking by individual tourists or couples. </p><p>  Newlyweds fly to a paradise, having rented an island for the solemn ceremony.  Exotic weddings that are arranged for lovers are remembered forever, and young people who are not embarrassed by overwhelming emotions even stay on the island to spend their honeymoon in a real fairy tale.  Branson encourages such events, because he himself once made an offer to his future wife on Turtle Island, descending to her in a decorated helicopter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="necker virgin islands" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1490240.jpg" width="600"></div>
