    <h2>  Location, origin, description </h2><p>  Korostyshevsky quarry is located in the <span>Zhytomyr region of</span> Ukraine, near the town of Korostyshev.  It belongs to the enterprise of the same name.  Here, over millions of years, granite deposits have been formed.  The valuable breed began to be mined and used in industry and commerce.  Then the production was abandoned, and some of the quarries formed at the excavation sites were flooded with water coming from underground.  And these lakes of amazing beauty were formed.  There are three of them.  They are surrounded by rocky shores, seven to twelve meters high.  Therefore, the lakes are considered part of the so-called canyon.  Granite mining is ongoing now, but in other places.  No wonder Korostyshev is considered one of the largest enterprises for the production of monuments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Korostyshevsky quarry how to get there" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1667266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Korostyshevsky quarry is known for its beautiful landscapes and the amazing purity of its waters.  They are very transparent, because they enter the lakes from the ground through granite filters.  And this breed is extremely ancient - one of the oldest on earth.  Probably, the opportunity to swim in such water attracts the majority of ‚Äúsummer‚Äù tourists here.  They chose Granite and Pashinsky lake.  There are always many tents on the hillsides during the warm season.  Trees grow along the shores of the quarry, so the shadow is always provided.  The water is cool even in the heat, but comfortable for swimming.  And granite platforms on carved rocks form natural diving boards for diving.  The depth of the lakes is up to twenty meters.  In addition, you can jump from a wooden bridge.  And on one of the rocks there is a house, which local traditions call the "forester's dwelling".  It also gives picturesqueness to the landscape.  One of the most extreme types of water activities on a career is diving.  The water is clear and the lake is deep.  But one must be careful, because at the bottom there can be huge granite blocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Korostyshevsky quarry fishing" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1667273.jpg" width="494"></div>

From each new ledge - a completely different look and angle.  For tents nearby - a stream with drinking water.  And if you want to live in comfort, then at your service are several roadside motels that will give you shelter and a table and two or three hundred hryvnias per day.
