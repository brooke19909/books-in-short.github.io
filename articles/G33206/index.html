In this matter, attention should be paid to several factors at once, among them the detector resolution.  In most cases, infrared cameras have a lower resolution than conventional video or visible-spectrum cameras. </p><p>  There is also a difference between this parameter and the display resolution.  Manufacturers quite often focus on the high resolution display to hide the weakness of the detector in the device.  A high value will provide more accurate data and help provide a visual report, which is very important when working on site. </p><p>  You should also consider the presence of a built-in camera, laser pointer and backlight.  Even budget models today are often equipped with 3-5 megapixel cameras.  The function of saving data in formats supported by all devices will be quite convenient during operation, because quite often you have to immediately drop images on a PC or other device, such as a smartphone.  And some devices even connect to modern phones. </p><p>  Before choosing a thermal imager, you should consider whether you need communication with thermometers and moisture meters.  In order to make a choice, you can consider several models, but first you need to decide which manufacturer to prefer.  Thermal imagers "Flir" will be a great example, they will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Model Review: E8 </h2>
