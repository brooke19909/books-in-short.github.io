A multi-sport race consisting of swimming, cycling and running.  The bottom line is to go through all the stages in turn.  Recently gaining popularity among men and women.  For proper training, sports equipment and clothing are needed.  For swimming, swimming trunks or a wetsuit are required (which is selected depending on the temperature of the water. A bicycle, a bicycle helmet, bicycle glasses are used by athletes together with contact pedals for the best result. Sportswear for jogging and sneakers for a triathlon. For running in hot weather, it is recommended to use a hat to prevent heat stroke.To track the results, athletes often resort to a triathlon watch during training. </p><h2>  1. Garmin Forerunner 935 - the best watch of 2018 </h2><p>  This is the best watch for a triathlon.  This device is currently considered the top of the Garmin company.  The watch is equipped with the largest number of functions in this class of devices.  Slim case, light weight, excellent long-lasting battery, allow you to use the watch for the Garmin triathlon for 24 hours using GPS. </p><p>  Forerunner 935 can monitor swimming statistics.  Count the number of swings, speed and distance.  For running, tracking speed, distance and cadence (the number of feet touching the ground while jogging) is provided.  Manufacturers did not forget about golf, skiing, rowing and cyclists.  The watch accurately measures the height using a barometer, heart rate and can automatically download training results using Wi-Fi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The watch can take steps and help with routes thanks to navigation, and can also become an indispensable assistant in the fitness room.  The cost is from $ 500 on the manufacturer‚Äôs website.  The body is made of polymer with fiber reinforcement.  Display with a resolution of 240 x 240 pixels, protected by a strong glass, with increased resistance to damage.  Weight is 49 g. Built-in memory of 64 MB. </p><p>  Customer reviews are distinguished by the highest percentage of satisfaction with the watch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiwimultisport.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garmin forerunner 935" class="if uuid-2919190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919190.jpg"></div><h2>  2.Garmin Fenix ‚Äã‚Äã5 </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to this model from a renowned manufacturer, known for its quality products for athletes.  Fenix ‚Äã‚Äã5 is included in the rating of watches for a triathlon, as a more expensive replacement for the Forerunner 935. With almost identical capabilities, the cost on the model of the Fenix ‚Äã‚Äã5 series starts at $ 650.  The high price is due to the more robust case, but in our rating this watch for a triathlon with a heart rate monitor was in second place due to the greater weight and thickness, which is a minus for triathletes. </p><p>  Externally, the watch can hardly be distinguished from the Forerunner 935, but there is a difference - the 935 is made of polymer, this made the device thinner and lighter.  Fenix ‚Äã‚Äã5 made of stainless steel.  The display with a resolution of 240 x 240 pixels is protected by a sapphire crystal.  The weight is twice the predecessor and amounts to 98 g. Memory - 16 GB. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garmin fenix 5" class="if uuid-2919238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919238.jpg"></div><h2>  3. Garmin Forerunner 735XT </h2><p>  In third place are another watch for the triathlon from Garmin.  This model can be compared with 935, but with some simplifications.  The watch does not have a mode for golfers and an altimeter (height measurement).  But they are light, thin and have all the key "chips" necessary for triathletes, among which there are multisport modes, tracking movement in open water and in the pool.  The watch also supports accessories for force meter and bicycle cadence. </p><p>  The cost of this model starts at $ 350.  The 215 x 180-pixel display is protected by damage-resistant glass.  The case is made of silicone.  Weight is 40.2 g. </p><p>  The battery is pretty decent and allows the watch to work in GPS mode for up to 14 hours.  Using this model, you can create individual modes for training in the gym, in which you can measure cadence, running and stride length.  Measurement in swimming includes distance, speed, counting laps in the pool and tracking hand swings.  In all modes, you can enable the competition function and try to surpass your own achievements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bikebug.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garmin Forerunner 735XT" class="if uuid-2919275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919275.jpg"></div><h2>  4. Suunto Spartan Sport </h2><p>  The following hours are in the middle of the list.  Suunto's new triathlon watch line supports multi-sport mode.  Like the previous hours, this model is equipped with a heart rate monitor, tracking swimming in pools and in open waters, waved hands.  Spartan Sport comes with pre-installed modes for more than 80 types of activity for cross-training (circular, high-intensity training with almost no rest with minimal pauses).  Each of the sports that a person engages in can be programmed for the intervals between training and speed modes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The cost of watches varies at stores around the world, but the price tag starts at $ 550.  Spartan Sport weighs 70 g, a stainless steel frame, a polyamide case (plastics based on foundry high-molecular compounds used in aviation, engineering, medicine and the automotive industry), the protective glass of the screen (resolution 320 x 300) is made of mineral crystal, silicone thongs. </p><p>  The battery is not as hardy as we would like, the life time with GPS on is about 10 hours.  Not suitable for marathon training, but great for basic triathlon training. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varuste.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suunto spartan sport" class="if uuid-2919401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919401.jpg"></div><h2>  5. TomTom Spark 3 </h2><p>  This model has the functions of the main sports activities of the triathlon, including swimming, cycling and running functions.  The cost of a basic set starts at $ 130. </p><p>  The advantages of the watch include a lightweight custom design, lightweight and thin case.  The disadvantages include the lack of multisport mode, which is why you have to scroll down the menu and start a new activity when doing triathlon.  The disadvantages include incompatibility with bicycle force meters, therefore, you can forget about cadence. </p><p>  But Spark 3 is able to track swimming in pools (but not in open water) and measure distance, count the wave of hands and the number of circles.  In cycling mode, you can monitor the results both in the hall and in the open air.  For running, an accelerometer is provided for indoor use and GPS for outdoor running.  A light weight of 50 g is also a plus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.johnlewis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TomTom Spark 3" class="if uuid-2919438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919438.jpg"></div><h2>  6. Polar V800 </h2><p>  This model is not the newest, it is already a couple of years old, but during its existence the watch has established itself as a reliable device with accurate heart rate measurement for training analysis. </p><p>  Polar V800 has a standard set of functions for triathlon, including multisport mode, tracking swimming in pools and open reservoirs, support for bicycle accessories and slim design. </p><p>  Like other brethren in the rating of watches for a triathlon, this model supports activity tracking and smart notifications when paired with a smartphone, but what distinguishes them from other models is the fame for its accuracy in measuring heart rate.  In this watch, you can track your heart rate in real time even while swimming, and this feature is only available with Polar watches.  With the data from this watch, using the software from the company, you can track the load on the heart in each individual workout.  The price of the device at one time was $ 500, but since then it has fallen and is at $ 380 due to the experience in the market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theedge-sports.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polar V800 watch" class="if uuid-2919454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919454.jpg"></div><h2>  7. Timex Ironman Sleek 150 </h2><p>  The watches for the Ironman triathlon do not have GPS, which is undoubtedly a minus, but this model was included in the list of the best because of the company's reputation, due to its quality and availability (the price for them on the manufacturer‚Äôs website is $ 82).  Timex has been extremely popular with triathletes for 30 years, until the start of its dominance in the GPS watch market.  If you make a separate rating for watches without GPS, then this model will take first place. </p><p>  The watch case is made of polymeric material.  The device has a slim design, light weight (59 g).  Like all watches in the rating, the Ironman Sleek 150 allows you to dive to a depth of 100 meters.  The device has enough memory to remember 150 circles, as the name of the model hints at.  In the presence of a touch screen that allows you to touch the screen to start the timer for a new circle. </p><p>  The clock can be programmed to track the intensity during a race or training, for example, you run one lap in 5 minutes and, if necessary, the clock will soundly alert you that the time of one lap has already passed.  They can also be programmed to include a timer for eating, water, sports nutrition to comply with the intake regimen.  The intervals of sound alerts can be changed depending on preferences or the intensity of training. </p><p>  If you decide to buy a watch without GPS, then do not neglect the Ironman Sleek 150, as they are the best choice in their category today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.giftsandjewels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ironman Sleek 150" class="if uuid-2919476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919476.jpg"></div><h2>  8. Garmin Forerunner 735 XT </h2><p>  Another model of the eminent manufacturer is the best choice for beginners in the triathlon.  The watch contains almost all functions and modes.  You can buy them at a price of $ 350, if you choose only a watch, or a triathlete‚Äôs kit, worth $ 500 (the chest strap and a set for monitoring heart rate during swimming are included).  Belts are chemically resistant and comfortable for swimming in pools. </p><p>  The model features GPS performance, an excellent battery that allows you to work up to 14 hours in GPS mode.  Screen resolution 215 x 180 pixels.  The display is protected by reinforced glass.  The model's pluses include fine-tuning for running, support for accessories and a beautiful, lightweight design.  By cons - not the best battery and not the most accurate time to calculate laps in the pool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.garmin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garmin Forerunner 735 XT" class="if uuid-2919656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109244/2919656.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a choice? </h2><p>  Each watch model has a standard set of functions and not every one of them is necessary for your training.  But the more there will be, the more you can squeeze out of the clock.  However, you should not chase the most expensive sports watch for a triathlon, you should proceed from the sports that you intend to engage in or are already doing. </p>
