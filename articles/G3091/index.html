This forty-meter hill was inhabited since time immemorial.  Legends say that the mythological she-wolf in this place nourished Romulus and Remus, the twin brothers who founded the ancient state, with their milk.  This is where the story of the Eternal City began.  Therefore, if you like ancient ruins and romantic legends, be sure to visit it.  Moreover, almost all ancient mythical places were subsequently confirmed by archaeological excavations.  Today we will take a virtual tour of these legendary places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palatine in Rome" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1863308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the hill in ancient times </h2><p>  The Palatine in Rome is considered the place on which the "Eternal City" was built.  Romulus and Remus grew up here and were raised by Faustulus.  According to legend, the first stone was also laid on the Palatine.  But historians believe that cattle were originally grazed on this ancient hill.  No wonder the etymology of the name of the hill dates back to the goddess Palez.  She was a cattle guardian.  Perhaps, over time, altars for sacrifices to the goddess began to be erected here.  The first Romans began to settle here, and lived on the other six hills later.  In ancient times, the hill was the center of the empire, palaces and public buildings were erected here.  But after the collapse of Rome and its capture by barbarians, almost all of the ancient buildings were destroyed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Decline and rebirth </h2><p>  Oddly enough, even in the Renaissance, Palatine was overgrown with weeds.  Only in the 17th century did the papal Farnese family acquire this land.  It was landscaped, and even a rich villa was built, but the history of this place remained under wraps.  Until the nineteenth century, trees grew on this hill and the Farnese gardens were located.  Only in 1861, when the French emperor Napoleon the Third bought this land from the Roman government, he ordered archaeologists to do excavations on the hill.  So the remains of ancient buildings were discovered.  Since then, the name of the hill has become in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãa synonym for the palace (chamber). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palatine in Rome photo" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1863423.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What did the Palatine look like? </h2><p>  In ancient Rome, this hill was also revered and considered sacred.  Here was a sacred cave where a she-wolf fed the famous twins, and a tree under which a basket with babies was found.  Back in the fourth century AD, then travelers were shown different sights.  For example, the hut, where Faustul brought up Romulus and Remus, the house of one of the twins, the altar of Pan and the temple of Jupiter Stator.  There were numerous relics here.  This is the blackthorn that grew from the spear thrown by Romulus from the Aventine hill, and the rock where Hercules fought with the robber Kakom, as well as a monument erected in honor of this feat.  The original ‚Äútwin museum‚Äù was also located on the Palatine.  It was called the ‚ÄúSaliyev‚Äôs chicken.‚Äù  There was kept the rod of Romulus as the first Roman augur, as well as 12 famous shields of Mars.  Whatever it was, but archaeologists believe that the hill was inhabited from the thousandth year BC.  At the time of the legendary twins, the city was surrounded by a wall with two gates - Porta and Romanula - in the north and west.  There was also held a mysterious ancient holiday - Lupercalia, when naked youths circled around the hill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What does the palatine look like in rome" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1863300.jpg" width="600"></div>

Since he was surrounded by the charisma of antiquity and holiness, the rich and aristocrats and eminent people settled here mainly.  Therefore, the Palatine in Rome by the beginning of our era was built up with palaces.  The future emperor Augustus was born here, and a house for his family was erected immediately.  He built it in the center of the hill, made of marble.  The palace was surrounded on different sides by the temples of Apollo and Vesta.  This rich house burned down during a fire, but was restored in an even more luxurious form.  Propylaea was added to it, and a colonnade with statues was erected between the palace and the temple of Apollo.  There was also the house of Libya, the wife of Augustus.  Palaces and other emperors built themselves on the Palatine, in particular, Tiberius, Caligula, Domitian and the North.  They were all different.  The Caligula Palace and the Capitol Hill were connected by a specially erected bridge.  Domitian built himself the most luxurious and sophisticated house.  There were fountains, columns, basilicas dedicated to the gods, in particular, to Jupiter, the Throne Hall and an audience room.  There, the emperor often arranged field council meetings and received visitors.  Domitian built a stadium near his palace, and the box from where he contemplated the competition was connected to his chambers.  The North Palace was seven-story and was located at the foot of the hill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What does the palatine look like in ancient Rome?" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1863312.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Religious buildings on the Palatine </h2><p>  <span>Ancient temples</span> have been built here since <span>ancient</span> times.  But now, from the many structures dedicated to pagan gods, only the remains of the altars of the Great Mother Cybele, Apollo and several other ruins have survived to our times.  The most famous among them is the altar of the Unknown God, mentioned by the Apostle Paul.  It was found in 1820.  But the early, medieval and Renaissance Christian churches Palatine in Rome has preserved a lot.  The most famous are the temples of <span>Saints Sebastian</span> and Bonaventure, Theodoro and Anastasia.  The last church is one of the most interesting.  It was built at the foot of the hill in the fourth century.  At least her mosaic dates from this time.  In the Renaissance, the so-called Florentine dome was built on top of it.  Very ancient and the basilica of St. Anastasia, dedicated to one of the Christian martyrs.  But it acquired a modern look after many reconstructions, especially in the seventeenth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monuments of ancient rome palatine" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1863311.jpg" width="600"></div>
