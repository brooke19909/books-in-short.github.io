  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comprehensive economic analysis of economic activity in the face of uncertainty like a corporation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, not one of the modern classifications of <span>types of corporate</span> enterprises is complete, because it does not accurately describe the essence of the integrated structure.  And this is extremely necessary, as it allows not only to clearly identify the place of the company in economic activity, but also to carry out qualitatively many functions, for example, economic <span>analysis of the economic activity of an enterprise.</span> </p><p>  The classic integrated structure can be defined as an autonomously functioning business entity, the structure of which includes the central element and the enterprises interacting with it, with respect to which it carries out management functions. </p><p>  At present, a number of classical forms of associations have developed: a financial-industrial group, a concern, a holding, which, according to some criteria, correspond to the types indicated above, for example, conduct a comprehensive economic analysis of economic activity and carry out general management, but at the same time do not have a correspondence in the national economy. </p><p>  Based on an analysis of a number of sources, you can specify general criteria for use in this classification.  The basis for the classification of various types of classical integrated structures is advisable to use a combination of such characteristics as: </p><p>  - the symmetry of the configuration combining the elements of an economic enterprise; </p><p>  - the degree of economic autonomy of the structural elements of the corporation. </p><p>  A comprehensive <span>economic analysis of</span> economic activity shows that on the basis of this attribute three groups of associations are distinguished: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1) associations, divisions in which are completely autonomous in their <span>business activities</span> , the construction of such companies, as a rule, is symmetrical, that is, almost all members of the association have similar configurations and operating principles; </p><p>  2) associations in which the limited autonomy of participants is maintained while maintaining independence in management.  The configuration of such a union is also symmetrical. </p><p>  3) associations, where some functions, for example, a comprehensive <span>economic analysis of economic activity,</span> are transferred from one unit to another, with the loss of economic autonomy. </p><p>  However, none of the above classifications is complete, since it does not accurately describe the essence of the integrated structure. </p><p>  One of the main goals of enterprise transformation, which should include integration, capital consolidation, is development, which, like the growth of a company, can be carried out in two ways: by organic growth and by external stimulation of growth from external sources.  Almost all companies choose organic growth at the initial stages of the life cycle, but its limits do not allow maintaining the pace of development necessary for survival in the competition.  In this case, companies begin to grow through the acquisition or takeover of other companies, as well as through mergers and alliances. </p><p>  Thus, the key factors that influence the classification of corporate structures are the type of transformation and the degree of integration of capital.  In this regard, it seems possible to name a comprehensive <span>economic analysis of economic activity</span> as a criterion for such a classification <span>.</span>  This will allow us to consider enterprises not as formal legal entities, but as a real combination of economic resources.  Then, as a criterion underlying the classification, we can consider the degree of integration of the economic resources of the enterprise in the united business group and the stability of the educated structure, expressed in terms of its existence.  Moreover, one can ignore the fact that the company retains or loses legal independence. </p>
