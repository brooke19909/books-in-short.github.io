Sometimes quite low by modern standards characteristics are quite enough to use communication applications quite comfortably and without problems. </p><p>  It is for such cases that manufacturers are developing budget devices.  And after the development of flagship models, the price of state employees is constantly decreasing, thanks to which almost everyone can now afford them.  Today we will talk about the Blackview BV2000 model, the reviews and characteristics of which we will consider.  This is a phone that has proven itself as an inexpensive, but at the same time high-quality and user-friendly gadget suitable for most tasks. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The <span>Blackview BV2000S</span> smartphone <span>is delivered, reviews</span> speak of this particular delivery option, in a simple cardboard box without any frills in design.  The packaging contains brief specifications, as well as serial numbers and IMEI devices. </p><p>  The starter kit is extremely minimal.  In the box you will find the smartphone itself, a battery for it, a USB cable and a charging cradle.  No additional options are present, thanks to this, the smartphone can have a record low price in its segment.  As a bonus from the manufacturer, you can note the presence of a protective film, which is already attached to the display along with the transport. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Externally, the gadget is very similar to a device from another Chinese manufacturer, namely Meizu M2 Mini.  If you take gray devices, for example, the Blackview BV2000S Stardust Gray smartphone, the reviews mostly compare it, then they are generally very similar, and the person who sees them for the first time may even say that they are two identical devices.  In order to provide the buyer with variety, five color designs are provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The body is entirely made of smooth plastic.  Despite the absence of any texture, the smartphone does not slip out of hands and is quite pleasant to the touch.  At the top of the back cover is a hole for the camera and a dual LED flash.  Below is a traditional speaker hole. </p><p>  Interestingly, the manufacturer took care of the presence of an LED event indicator.  In most budget models, this convenient moment is simply missing.  It is located at the top of the display, along with proximity and light sensors, as well as a front camera.  The volume and power buttons are on the right side of the case, all the connectors are located at the top, and only the microphone hole is located below.  As they say reviews about the <span>Blackview</span> BV2000S <span>phone</span> , this arrangement of elements makes it ergonomic and generally comfortable to use. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The device received an IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280 √ó 720 pixels.  It has good color rendering, viewing angles are quite large.  It is worth noting a high margin of brightness, allowing you to comfortably use the gadget in bright sunlight.  If desired, the shades can be adjusted using the built-in firmware MiraVision. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sensor traditionally received a multi-touch with just two touches.  This is quite enough for comfortable typing, but may not be enough for active games, where you have to perform many actions at the same time.  The glass is strong, scratched with difficulty, but still does not have certified protection, so you should consider buying a case that protects the display.  This is often recommended regarding the Blackview BV2000S by owners who have been using the device for some time. </p>

    <h2>  "Iron" characteristics </h2><p>  By tradition, for modern state employees, the heart of the gadget is the MT6580 processor, which has four cores operating at a frequency of 1.3 GHz each.  The smartphone is equipped with 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of non-volatile memory, which is also the average value for this price segment.  Out of the box, a little more than 4 GB of space remains for the user to install programs and store personal files. </p><p>  These characteristics are enough to fully perform everyday tasks, such as watching videos and listening to music, working with instant messengers, surfing the Internet, playing lightweight casual toys.  Heavier gaming applications may start, but working with noticeable suspensions, and playing them will be uncomfortable, if not impossible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The well-known Antutu benchmark test gives the smartphone about 24-25 thousand points.  Pretty good result for a cheap budget employee.  On the well-known sites dedicated to smartphones, users write reviews on the Blackview BV2000S mobile phone, their reviews show, on average, the same values ‚Äã‚Äãon benchmark tests. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  On board the smartphone, Android 5.1 is installed, which received a slightly modified interface thanks to X Launcher.  The phone works quickly if it is not overloaded with a large number of programs.  Google services are installed out of the box, so there will be no problems installing new programs.  They also took care of a simple tutorial - on the desktop after switching on you can find a brief instruction called QuickStart, however, only in English. </p><p>  Of the interesting moments in the firmware, there is only the ability to unlock the device with gestures, otherwise it is, in fact, stock Android without any changes.  Given this, regarding the Blackview BV2000S, reviews emphasize that it‚Äôs not difficult to figure it out; there are no ‚Äútroubles‚Äù in the system.  There is currently no information on whether an update to version 6.0 of Marshmallow will be released. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless features </h2><p>  The smartphone received a Bluetooth 4.0 module that allows you to connect up to several devices at the same time.  Therefore, if you like to use a wireless headset or fitness bracelet, but you still need to transfer a file, this can be done without interrupting communication between gadgets. </p><p>  The Wi-Fi module supports b / g / n standards and has a fairly high-quality antenna, which ensures reliable reception even at a fairly remote distance from the router.  But with GPS, everything is not so clear.  It seems to be not bad, but without additional configuration through the engineering menu it can start indefinitely.  After making the settings, it works fine under any conditions, there is nothing to complain about either, but the manufacturer could have foreseen this point in advance. </p><p>  Regarding mobile communications, everything is standard for budget models with an MT6580 processor.  It supports only 3G communication, but at the same time provides a fairly high and stable level of reception.  Switching between 2G and 3G standards occurs almost without delay, there are no complaints.  To verify this, just read about the Blackview BV2000S Gray reviews, users do not miss to mention the signal quality among the positive aspects. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  It was the cameras that became the weak point of the smartphone, which the manufacturer saved.  The main module received a matrix with a resolution of 5 megapixels, and the front - only 2 megapixels.  Photos taken from these matrices are interpolated programmatically to sizes of 8 megapixels and 5 megapixels, respectively, but this does not save the situation much. </p><p>  To obtain more or less high-quality images, you need good enough lighting, for example, bright summer sun.  If this condition is not met, then the photos are fuzzy, sometimes blurred and with a lot of noise.  Taking this smartphone with a camera is definitely not worth it. </p><p>  The front camera is quite enough for video communication, but the quality of the selfie taken from it also leaves much to be desired.  In general, this is a rather familiar picture for budget models, and a similar situation is observed in many manufacturers.  However, as the Blackview BV2000S reviews say, it is in this model that the most sad situation is observed. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  The manufacturer claims the battery capacity is within 2400 mAh.  Judging by tests and reviews, this capacity is true, and some even got results higher than stated.  This compares favorably with the Blackview BV2000S rivals, reviews of other models often indicate that the battery capacity is too high. </p><p>  This capacity is enough for a smartphone to live a day in a mode of average use.  Interest is often shown a little incorrectly, and for the better for the user.  At the last charge, the phone can still work for a rather long time, although the system can swear at a critically low remaining battery capacity. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The smartphone is a good budget employee with its own pros and cons.  The positive aspects include the following: </p><ul><li>  High-quality screen with good viewing angles. </li><li>  Honest battery capacity. </li><li>  Low cost. </li><li>  Sufficient performance for everyday use. </li><li>  Pleasant appearance. </li></ul><p>  Of the minuses that are important when choosing, the following can be noted: </p><ul><li>  Very low quality of both cameras. </li><li>  Touchscreen with multi-touch just two touches. </li><li>  Uncertain GPS operation without additional configuration. </li></ul><p>  As a result, this model is perfect for those who are not looking for a toy, but a functional means of communication that supports all modern communication capabilities, including instant messengers and video communications.  It has negative aspects that are not critical and do not greatly affect the basic functionality, and at its cost, you can close your eyes to them. </p>
