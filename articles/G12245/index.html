Of these, three are expedited with such a departure schedule: </p><ul><li>  09:26. </li><li>  17:18. </li><li>  18:14. </li></ul><p>  In Gomel and Rechitsa, there are quite ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù train stations.  The first one is bigger, as it is located in the regional center, the second one is smaller, but also a beautiful railway station, which underwent reconstruction in 2007. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Paju, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station in Rechitsa" class="if uuid-3220373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3220373.jpg"></div><h2>  Long-distance train option </h2><p>  By train from Gomel to Rechitsa you can travel in 55 minutes.  A little faster than the train.  There are enough trains of the Belarusian formation between the cities, the schedule of their movement looks like this: </p><ul><li>  04:21. </li><li>  08:15. </li><li>  14:18. </li><li>  16:56. </li><li>  19:26. </li><li>  20:11. </li><li>  10:06 p.m. </li></ul><p>  The final destination of trains is the cities of Grodno, Minsk, Polotsk and Brest. </p><p>  Trains depart from Rechitsa to Gomel according to the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  04:46. </li><li>  07:11. </li><li>  08:02. </li><li>  18:52. </li><li>  22:15. </li><li>  23:24. </li></ul><p>  Given the small distance between the cities, it is best to take a ticket to a seated car, it costs 90 rubles (about 3 Belarusian).  The train follows non-stop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gomel Center" class="if uuid-3220378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3220378.jpg"></div><h2>  Bus ride </h2><p>  Buses from Gomel to Rechitsa are poisoned from the bus station, which is located on the same square as the railway.

The buses themselves can follow not only short distances, for example, only from Gomel to Rechitsa.  Longer directions are also very popular: to Svetlogorsk, Salihorsk or Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the opposite direction, from Rechitsa to Gomel, the first flight leaves at 6:20 in the morning, and the last at 19:22. </p><p>  The bus station in Rechitsa is located next to the railway. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gomel city" class="if uuid-3220380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3220380.jpg"></div><h2>  Car trip </h2><p>  By car, from Gomel to Rechitsa it is really possible to get in less than an hour, because traveling about 50 kilometers depends on which region of the regional center to leave. </p><p>  For example, you can leave Gomel‚Äôs Sovetsky District on the M-10 highway and after the bridge across the Dnieper turn onto R-32, it leads to the southeastern part of Rechitsa, the entrance to the city will be near the railway and Sovetskaya Street. </p><h2>  What to see in Gomel? </h2><p>  The city is a place worth visiting at least for the weekend.  A couple of days it is quite possible to walk, see its main attractions.  It is 5 years older than Moscow by age, but inferior, for example, to St. Petersburg, or maybe Grodno, in the number of interesting objects, as there are no castles in Gomel. </p><p>  Gomel has a very simple and attractive coat of arms: a golden lynx lies in a blue field. </p><p>  The largest number of attractions are located in the triangle between Sovetskaya, Lenin and Victory streets, between the station and the Sozh River. </p><p>  On the bank of Sozh is a palace complex of the 19th century, which is depicted on a new bill in 20 Belarusian rubles (about 600 Russian), as well as on the old one in 20 thousand. </p><p>  It is worth a visit to this palace and the Old Believers Museum nearby. </p><p>  From the center of Gomel, you can go to the Soviet district in the southeast of the city, where there are many funny monuments: Gulliver, giant crows, heroes of the fairy tale "Turnip".  A very photogenic place! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The historic center of Gomel" class="if uuid-3220477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3220477.jpg"></div><h2>  Why go to Rechitsa? </h2><p>  Rechitsa for Belarus is an interesting city in its own way.
