They are not inferior in quality and level of comfort.  Of course, many dream of acquiring their own housing in St. Petersburg, but cannot afford such an expensive acquisition.  And some are completely tired of the hustle and bustle of the metropolis, exhaust gases and dust and dream of getting an apartment in a suburb of the northern capital.  And in that and in another case, an excellent solution to the problem will be Sertolovo new buildings.  As part of this material, we will review the most worthy options. </p><h2>  About Sertolovo </h2><p>  <span>Before starting to consider new buildings in Sertolovo from the developer, I want to say a few words about the city, the advantages and disadvantages of living here.</span>  <span>So, from a geographical point of view, Sertolovo is a municipality of the Vsevolozhsk district of the Leningrad region.</span>  <span>In order to assess the level and quality of life here, it is better to refer to the reviews of those who managed to live in the city for a significant time period.</span> </p>
