    <h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  One of the main characteristics of any hotel is its location.  So, if we talk about the hotel "Atelika Nebug", the reviews suggest that its deployment is quite successful.  The facility is surrounded by trees in a park area, which is about 18 kilometers from the resort town of Tuapse, namely in the village of Nebug (where the name of the hotel comes from).  It is worth noting that the hotel is located on the first coastline, and therefore the sea is visible from the windows of most apartments.  If you arrived in Tuapse by train, then you will have to travel about 20 kilometers from the train station to the hotel.  But the nearest international <span>airport Gelendzhik is</span> removed from this area by as much as 110 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel "Atelika Nebug": reviews.  Advantages </h2><p>  Holidays by the Black Sea cannot be bad, especially if you choose the right place to live.  The Atelika Nebug resort hotel (Tuapse, Nebug) is quite popular.  Reviews about this place contain the following positive comments: </p><ul><li>  the restaurant has a very good assortment of dishes, and their taste is beyond praise; </li><li>  from the windows of the rooms there is a very beautiful view of the sea; </li><li>  the territory of the hotel is very beautiful, a large area is occupied by green spaces; </li><li>  Children‚Äôs animation deserves the highest rating - kids don‚Äôt have to get bored for a minute; </li><li>  due to the fact that the territory is very green, it is easy to breathe even in the most intense heat; </li><li>  there are many convenient benches and arbors around the buildings; </li><li>  the design of the hotel is very interesting and pleasant; </li><li>  the rooms have thick walls that provide excellent sound insulation; </li><li>  the pool is simply excellent - clean and does not smell of bleach at all; </li><li>  cleaning is done every day, and the maids work in good faith; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel is surrounded by forest, you absolutely will not hear the noise of the track, which runs nearby. </li></ul><h2>  Hotel "Atelika Nebug": reviews.  disadvantages </h2><p>  Since there are no ideal hotels, this institution was no exception.  Tourists have the following comments and complaints about the Atelika Nebug hotel: </p><ul><li>  dishes with cracks and chips spoil the whole impression of the restaurant; </li><li>  Until 11 a.m. loud music plays in the courtyard, which will not appeal to those who prefer to go to bed early; </li><li>  dishes are laid out in very small portions on the buffet, so visitors are in a hurry to get as much as possible, fearing that they will not get it; </li><li>  due to the fact that there is no partition between the balconies, there is no feeling of privacy, and it is somehow uncomfortable to sleep with the door open; </li><li>  the stairs that you need to go down to the sea are in poor condition and require urgent repairs, otherwise tourists risk being injured; </li><li>  the operation of air conditioners both in the lobby and in the rooms is regulated by the administration, and therefore, in the most intense heat, even in a room it is not always possible to escape from stuffiness; </li><li>  Hotel rooms are very cramped, especially in standard rooms; </li><li>  the plumbing in the bathroom is old and constantly dripping; </li><li>  since there are no mosquito nets on the windows, mosquitoes will constantly pester you (stock up on fumigators or special insect sprays; </li><li>  the dining room is very crowded, and the number of tables and chairs does not match the number of guests; </li><li>  in the dining room, quite often there is a situation where guests do not have enough plates and cutlery; </li><li>  if you arrive before checkout time, then even for an extra charge you will not be settled ahead of time (even small children will not pay attention); </li><li>  in order to have a satisfying breakfast, you need to come to the dining room as early as possible, otherwise there will simply not be any normal food at the distribution. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  A great place to relax is Atelika Nebug (Tuapse).  Reviews note that it will especially appeal to those who are not indifferent to nature, because the hotel is located in a park area, in the midst of dense coniferous plantings.  It is not only beautiful and pleasant, but also incredibly useful for those people who have problems with the health of the respiratory system.  Very close to the sea.  The beach is big enough and clean.  Whenever you decide to swim, you will never have problems with the availability of free sunbeds.  But the descent to the coast leaves much to be desired: the stairs are very dilapidated, they can even be called emergency.  Needless to say, to overcome more than 200 steps when returning to the hotel is quite problematic, especially for older people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atelika nebug holidaymakers reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1247687.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Atelika Nebug is positioning itself as an all-inclusive hotel.  But such an assessment is not entirely fair.  Three meals a day on the buffet system - this is not the whole list of services that are necessary for tourists.  It is worth noting that the food in the restaurant is quite high quality, varied and tasty.  But the catering of guests leaves much to be desired.  It seems that, in an effort to save on products, distribution workers lay out just microscopic portions.  Finally spoils the impression that there are not always enough empty seats and cutlery, queues are constantly being created. </p><p>  As for the rest, judging by the words of the guests of the complex, this hotel is ideal for active people who want to spend time away from the hustle and bustle of a big city, are not afraid of physical exertion (during a trip to the sea) and are nature lovers.  The city infrastructure is far enough from here, but because the rest will be quiet and quite calm. </p>
