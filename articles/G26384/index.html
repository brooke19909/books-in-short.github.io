    <h2>  US Plutonium-238 Production </h2><p>  To produce plutonium-238, it was necessary to carry out very laborious and dirty work.  For 150 kg of finished plutonium accounted for as much as 50 thousand containers with waste.  The era of President Gorbachev was distinguished by altruism.  The perestroika elite decided that it was worthless to litter the lands of the American brothers.  Since 1988, plutonium-238 has been produced only in Russia. </p><p>  In 1992, a production association called Mayak signed an agreement to ship to America five kilograms of a substance known as plutonium-238.  Production in Russia is located in the distant city of Ozersk, better known as Chelyabinsk-40.  The profit from this contract was estimated at about $ 6 million.  The amount of plutonium produced could be enough to launch from 3 to 6 satellites with nuclear facilities.  Many researchers believe that virtually all such launches of America after the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred only on the isotope produced in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Collaboration or meanness? </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a small but still significant scandal.  The fact is that the United States used nuclear-powered satellites to spy on Russia.  They were made on the Russian isotope.  Despite everything, the production of plutonium-238 did not stop, and supplies to America continued.  In addition, by 2003, a contract was signed between the Russian company Techsnabexport and the American representative office to provide this isotope with dioxide. </p><p>  However, the plutonium-238 that was produced on the territory of Russia no longer satisfied the insatiable American appetite.  After all, the States needed to start developing missile defense in outer space.  Therefore, they decided to restart production of the isotope at home. </p>

    <h2>  Reasons for isotope production by America </h2><p>  The isotope production program was designed by the States for 30 years, during which it was supposed to produce about 158 ‚Äã‚Äãkg of this dangerous substance.  Both Russian and foreign media managed to draw attention to the fact that this is the first time since the end of the Cold War with the United States.  One way or another, this start of production is associated with possible US military programs in outer space.  The fact that the start of isotope production in time coincides with the start of the development of missile defense does not add calm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Different countries, different prices </h2><p>  Interestingly, under the terms of the contract with the Russian company Techsnabexport, the price of one kilogram of the isotope is $ 1 million.  While America allocates a hundred times more funds for plutonium-238.  Production in Russia all this time took place at dumping prices - such is a disappointing conclusion.  In Russian society, different opinions were expressed about such "cooperation" with the States.  The Federal Atomic Energy Agency believes that these sales are somehow profitable and necessary for the economy.  In addition, Russia can sell plutonium-238 to 32 countries around the world.  What explains this demand and why is this isotope needed? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plutonium 238 characteristics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42514/1687954.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Plutonium 238: application </h2><p>  In fact, this isotope is a by-product of plutonium-239.  And he, in turn, acts as the main component in the composition of nuclear weapons.  In the era of the Cold War, which served as the cause of the space race, from one side it was very convenient.  For example, plutonium-239 was made in South Carolina to create nuclear bombs.  And its by-product was given to the production of space satellites and probes.  After the South Carolina-based producer Savannah River was closed, the United States began to purchase isotope from Russia. </p><p>  Plutonium-238 is an ideal fuel used for space research.  Its radiation is radioactive.  But, being in another material, the isotope is relatively safe.  For example, plutonium-238 is often enclosed in iridium granules.  They glow in red, and a large amount of heat emanates from them.  As long as iridium granules remain intact, the isotope is safe.  Pellets are placed in special generators, which contribute to the conversion of heat into electricity.  Thanks to this, space satellites are still exploring space, because the process of generating electricity in this way can last for decades. </p>

    <h2>  Modern plutonium-238 reserves </h2><p>  According to many sources, the reserves of this substance on Earth are rapidly decreasing.  Recently, an article was published in the American journal Nature, according to which now NASA has only 35 kg of isotope left.  And only half of the total amount can be used as fuel.  The planned flight to Mars will already take 5 kg of plutonium-238.  Russia is also no longer selling this isotope.  Perhaps we, too, are running out. </p><h2>  Catastrophic risks when using isotope </h2><p>  Not so long ago, the US military shot down a space satellite.  They did it allegedly in order to prevent its uncontrolled fall.  The Pentagon reported that a satellite weighing 5 tons scattered into three thousand fragments over the Pacific Ocean.  Each of the fragments in size was approximately comparable to a soccer ball.  On board the spy satellite was about 500 kg of hydrazine - rocket fuel, which has high toxicity.  And also there was a certain amount of the plutonium-238 isotope in it - the Pentagon did not give exact figures. </p><h2>  Threat to all mankind </h2><p>  But in fact, one of the most dangerous threats to the whole earth is the plutonium-238 isotope.  Its characteristics are such that only 450 grams of this substance can cause cancer in all of humanity.  <span>The half</span> - <span>life of</span> plutonium-238 is about 90 years.  So these "soccer balls" will poison the planet and its inhabitants for a long time to come. </p><p>  However, this is far from the first nuclear strike from space in history.  For the entire space research, 49 satellites with nuclear installations were launched.  36 of them were launched by Russia and the Soviet Union, 13 - by the States.  Now in orbits at an altitude of 800 to 1000 km are 50 satellites with nuclear fragments.  In order not to leave nuclear death as a ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù to the descendants of mankind, Doctor of Technical Sciences Hussein Chechenov proposes replacing plutonium-238 with less hazardous uranium-235. </p><h2>  The threat, fortunately, passed Russia </h2><p>  In the fall of 2016, the fall of an American satellite called UARS was already expected, which, by a lucky chance, flew by.  It was supposed several dates of the fall of the object - first it was September 17, then the 23rd.  For some reason, the news did not say that in fact it was not even a satellite, but a real nuclear bomb.  Most likely, this was done so as not to spread panic among the population.  After all, this satellite filled plutonium-238.  The photo of the space object suggests that the size of the UARS is comparable to the size of the trolleybus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plutonium 238 photos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1688303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to NASA forecasts, it was supposed to fall in central Russia.  If this really happened, within a few days about 300 thousand people in Moscow could die from pulmonary edema.  But the UARS for some reason lingered and fell to the ground only on September 24, collapsing into the waters of the ocean near Canada.  Plutonium-238 in it was about 30 kg.  This is not the first time Canada has visited a deadly space satellite.  For the first time, the government managed to bring down an approaching object on approaching the continent, and it also fell into the ocean. </p>
