Journey to the ancient holy city of Murom</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Traveling across immense Russia is very exciting.  This article is devoted not only to the Moscow-Murom route, but also to some interesting information.  How to get to Murom on your own by car or public transport will be described below.  It is recommended before the trip to always clarify all questions, nuances, doubts, since the road will be long. </p><h2>  Sightseeing bus ride </h2><p>  Of course, the best option for visiting Murom is precisely an excursion or a pilgrimage trip by bus, where the guide along the route will tell not only the history of the city, but also show interesting places.  And there will also be two or three stops to rest.  The Moscow-Murom route is quite long.  If you go on a sightseeing bus without traffic jams, it will take about 6 hours.  It is recommended to leave Moscow no later than 7 a.m. in order to arrive in Murom at least by 13.00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Murom" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1087143.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What will the trip along the Moscow-Murom route look like?  The distance between cities is about 300 km. </p><h2>  By public transport to Murom </h2><p>  In this section, we determine what types of public transport are on the Moscow-Murom route.  There are two most convenient options. </p><p>  <em>The train</em> .  All long-distance trains passing.  There is no such route that the city of Murom was the final destination.  It is necessary to take this point into account.  Travel time for all routes is slightly different.  For example, train 142 "Moscow-Cheboksary" arrives in Murom in exactly 5 hours.  Departure from Moscow at 00.15.  Most likely, this is not the most suitable option, on the one hand.  Yes, it looks tempting, already at 5 in the morning we will be in Murom.  But, unfortunately, you can‚Äôt get enough sleep.  You will not be able to sleep before 1 o'clock in the morning.  The conductor will wake up at 4.30.  A maximum of 3.5 hours will be allocated for sleep.  But in the ancient and beloved city I want to stay awake.  It is better to pre-book a room in a hotel or arrange a deal with private owners. The second option is more profitable, since you can come almost at any time of the day.  At 16.20 a train 58G departs from Moscow, arriving in Murom at 20.57.  All trains passing through Murom depart only from the Kazan station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Murom how to get" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1087146.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Bus.</em>  All buses from Moscow go from the <span>Shchelkovo bus station.</span>  There are only 5 flights and all are extremely inconvenient for tourists.  An exception is only for those traveling with a booked overnight stay.  Another disadvantage of bus travel is the constant traffic jams on the Gorky highway. </p><h2>  How to get there by car? </h2><p>  And again, let's talk about the Moscow-Murom route.  How to get by car?  You need to leave Moscow along the Enthusiasts Highway.  The easiest way will be to those who live in the center, on Aviamotornaya, in Novogireevo.  Residents of the eastern and south-eastern districts do not need to go to the Moscow Ring Road.  Highway Enthusiasts outside Moscow quietly goes into the Gorky highway <span>(highway M7 "Volga").</span>  There is a direct road to the exit to Vladimir.  We drive through Reutov, Noginsk, and Pokrov.  The city of Murom is located in the Vladimir region.  Approaching the regional center and the famous ancient city of Vladimir, you need to prepare for the fact that you need to stay to the right.  The M7 highway ends for us at the next roundabout in the Baigushi and Vyatkino districts.  Again go to the right.  Everywhere there are signs for Murom.  You need to follow them.  The road to the city itself is direct. </p><h2>  How to navigate in Murom and what to see? </h2><p>  In order not to get lost in the city, it is better to take a navigator with you.  Moore is big and very difficult for beginners.  A plain paper map is also useful for backpackers. </p><p>  The story tells that Ilya Muromets, having extraordinary strength, with roots rooted centuries-old oaks from the ground.  It is in the Murom forests that we will see when driving along the Moscow-Murom route.  The guests will be impressed by the face of Ilya Muromets made of stone, while an armored train named in honor of our hero and the patron saint of the city stands nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Murom distance" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1087145.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are other shrines.  For example, St. Julian Lazarevskaya also pray for family well-being in the Church of St. Nicholas.  Nicola Wet called this church. </p><p>  If a tourist is indifferent to Orthodoxy, then he will find other interesting places.  You can admire the Oka from a high mountain, go to a museum, parks. </p><h2>  The return trip to Moscow with good impressions </h2><p>  In order to really succeed, despite the numerous traffic jams near Moscow, you need to <span>make a route</span> in advance <span>.</span>  Various sites abound with information about the city, attractions.  There are addresses, and sometimes driving directions.  Be sure to make a plan with a detailed description of how to get or drive to one place or another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Murom by car" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1087144.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <p>  Here is <span>a</span> 300-kilometer <span>-long Moscow-Murom highway</span> .  It is worth overcoming to be in a truly holy city, which has a lot of patrons.  After all, almost everyone who ruled this city are holy people.  Their relics rest in the monasteries and temples of the city.  A lot of people come to them for help not only in family matters, but also in others. </p><p>  Having come a long way to Moscow-Murom by car, bus or train, you should definitely not only visit the city, but also buy kalachs, souvenirs, gifts for relatives.  Let your trip be unforgettable and happy! </p>
