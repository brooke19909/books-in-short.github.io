Which is better to choose?  Consider the features, advantages and disadvantages of each of them. </p><h2>  What does an active subwoofer mean? </h2><p>  For high-quality sounding music you need a subwoofer.  These devices can be divided into two groups: active and passive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.vibeaudio.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of Acoustics" class="if uuid-2356416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2356416.jpg"></div><p>  In order to understand the difference between an active and a passive subwoofer, you need to figure out what each of them represents. </p><p>  So, the active analogue is a <span>speaker system</span> with a built-in amplifier and a separation filter, which has several speakers at once.  An active subwoofer is easily connected, but it is important to know the correct system settings so that the sound is reproduced as qualitatively as possible. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of an active subwoofer </h2><p>  In order to understand what is the difference between <span>active</span> and passive <span>subwoofers</span> , you need to weigh all their pros and cons.  So, the active version has distinctive positive features due to the fact that this system consists of a filter, amplifier and speaker - all in one box. </p><p>  It can work well in automatic mode and does not require additional settings.  But it all depends on the price.  Not all budget models of active subwoofers provide high-quality sound.  The same systems that reproduce sound quality are in the high price category. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to reduce the cost, many manufacturers simplify the speaker system, which affects both the quality of the reproduced sound and the reliability of such equipment.  Also, many companies are trying to recreate high power in a compact device.  But in practice this is far from the case.  Small speakers cannot reproduce more power.  For a powerful amplifier, you need a diameter of the appropriate size - more than 10 inches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.conrad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speakers" class="if uuid-2356417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2356417.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>What does a passive</span> subwoofer <span>mean</span> ? </h2><p>  Having understood the features and characteristics of an active speaker system, you can begin to study a passive analogue.  This is necessary in order to understand what the difference is and which subwoofer to choose: active or passive. </p><p>  A passive subwoofer is a box made of wood, MDF or plywood, where several speakers operating at a low frequency are located.  An external amplifier and a separation filter, which are necessary for good sound reproduction, go separately from the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.conrad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound in a car" class="if uuid-2356420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2356420.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of a passive subwoofer </h2><p>  To understand what is the difference between an active and a passive subwoofer, you need to consider the pros and cons of the latter option.  Among the advantages of the passive analogue, it is worth noting the low price, since in fact it is just a box, to which additional elements are needed to obtain high-quality sound.  Depending on this, each user can assemble exactly those components that satisfy him in quality and price category. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But here it is worth remembering the minuses, since a passive speaker system can go in different cases, which may not be suitable for additional elements.  And this must be considered when choosing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Good acoustics in the car" class="if uuid-2356421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2356421.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the difference between active and passive subwoofer? </h2><p>  Consider the features of these two main speaker systems that every customer should consider when choosing: </p><ul><li>  an active subwoofer is more expensive, since it already includes additional components suitable for this model that provide high-quality sound; </li><li>  with respect to installation, passive subwoofers are a little more complicated, in addition, they require additional space for arranging the amplifier, and in active ones this is already inside the box itself; </li><li>  ease of operation - active acoustics is the leader here; </li><li>  regarding the sound, which subwoofer is better active or passive, and what is the difference - it all depends on the system settings: with correct and high-quality playback settings in a passive speaker system, the sound can be even better than in an active one; </li><li>  in the active <span>speaker system the</span> sound is more even, while in the passive one it is voluminous and dense; </li><li>  bass frequencies and rhythmic music sounds better with active acoustics; </li><li>  usability - active options have more diverse settings options, but if there is a good external amplifier in a passive subwoofer, then it will not differ in sound reproduction quality. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speaker Components" class="if uuid-2356423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2356423.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to make an active analogue from a passive subwoofer? </h2><p>  Having figured out what is the difference between a passive and active subwoofer, some users want to know if it is possible to make another one from one option that already exists.  In addition, if this additionally saves money - it will be a plus. </p><p>  The idea is interesting and quite doable.  It is possible to remake just a passive analogue into an active speaker system.  If you do an active installation first, then you need to download from the Internet or take from another source a program with which you can calculate the acoustic design.  They are needed, because the emitters that are already installed in the system in dynamics may not correspond in parameters. </p><p>  The case itself will also have to be redone, since high-quality sound depends on the entire installation.  To begin with, the size and parameters of the future system are determined.  Then a wooden case is made, in which the necessary holes are drilled. </p><p>  Experts believe that it is much more difficult to remake a passive speaker system in the opposite version than to make this installation initially independently. </p><p>  The casing of the active installation consists of a pair of compartments.  One is a loudspeaker, and the other a crossover and a power supply.  The power supply, amplifier and isolation filter are glued to the foil, which is then glued to the inner walls of the box.  This in turn minimizes noise. </p><p>  But the process of transforming a passive installation into the opposite speaker system is not so simple.  Due to time saving, it is better to purchase an already finished product with an acceptable price-quality ratio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound quality and power" class="if uuid-2356424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2356424.jpg"></div><h2>  What to look for when choosing a subwoofer in a car? </h2><p>  Having figured out what is the difference between active and passive subwoofer, experts give some useful tips when <span>choosing speakers</span> in a car: </p><ol><li>  You should not choose a speaker system only in terms of power - some manufacturers knowingly underestimate or overestimate it. </li><li>  The optimum speaker size for high-quality sound is 12 inches (30 cm). </li><li>  Choosing a product is only from trusted manufacturers. </li><li>  Knowing the size and height of the voice coil, you can easily check the real power of the speaker. </li><li>  The amplifier for a car should be less powerful than a subwoofer. </li><li>  It is worth choosing an aluminum box and an upper rubber suspension. </li><li>  Depending on the location of the subwoofer in the car, it is worth taking an additional amplifier.  If the speaker system is located in the trunk, then the sound may be somewhat distorted. </li></ol>
