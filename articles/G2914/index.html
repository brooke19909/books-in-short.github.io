Most tourists stay here only to be able to enjoy plenty of beach vacations and magnificent views of the cliffs, steppes, bays and cliffs. </p>

    <p>  If for some reason the hotel’s food doesn’t suit you, and you don’t want to cook on your own, you can always use the cafe services, which are numerous in the district.  So, many tourists celebrate delicious dishes and affordable prices at La Note and Europe cafes.  Having lunch or dinner in the local cafes, do not neglect the local dishes, as they are truly delicious and unusual. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  Villaggio Hotel Agrumeto (Calabria) provides all the conditions for a pleasant and eventful pastime.  The hotel has two outdoor pools (one for adults, the second for the youngest vacationers), two volleyball courts - on the beach and next to the hotel, aerobics classes, a tennis court, however, equipment for the game and lessons are paid.  There is also a TV room where every guest at Villaggio Agrumeto can relax and watch an interesting movie.  The hotel also offers bike or car rental.  In the evenings, tourists are entertained by professional animators, however, all events are conducted exclusively in Italian, which often upsets tourists from Russia.  Although, on the other hand, this is a great way to practice learning a new language. </p>
