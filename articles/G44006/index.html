    <h2>  About location </h2><p>  Hotel Palm Oasis <span>Boutique Hotel 4 * is</span> simply impossible not to notice.  It stands out very much from the rest of the buildings and places available nearby.  After all, this is a real botanical garden.  The whole hotel is just surrounded by greenery and exotic vegetation!  And the hotel itself was located in close proximity to Nai Harn Beach.  By the way, one of the cleanest and most spacious in Phuket.  Honestly, many tourists choose the hotel precisely on this principle: the main thing is to be closer to the beach.  The distance to the famous Nai Harn Lake is small - less than a kilometer, so you can walk about ten minutes on foot to it. </p><p>  And not so far is Phuket Airport.  35 kilometers is not a lot and not a little.  But enough to not hear the noise of airplanes and still not go out a few hours before leaving home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, nearby is also Rawai beach, Promtep cape and Kata beach.  These are the places that you just need to visit while staying here on vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Popular numbers </h2><p>  Tourists, before flying on vacation, decide to reserve apartments in advance.

    <h2>  About booking </h2><p>  Well, as you could already understand, Palm Oasis Boutique Hotel 4 * received extremely positive reviews.  There is every reason for this: excellent rooms, extremely low prices for Thailand, good attitude to guests and top-level service. </p><p>  But there is a minus.  And it consists in the fact that the numbers here are bought up too quickly.  Therefore, if there is a desire to stay in this particular place, then you need to be puzzled by the issue of booking in advance - at least two months in advance.  In addition, having booked the apartments earlier, you will be able to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù the best price, since usually the later the room is booked, the more expensive it is.  In general, you should be cautious. </p>
