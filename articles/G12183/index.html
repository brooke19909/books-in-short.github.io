This <span>memorial complex is</span> dedicated to victory in the war of 1941-1945.  He appeared not so long ago.  It was opened on May 9, 1995, when the 50th anniversary of the Second World War was celebrated.  The article suggests learning about the hill on which the memorial is located, about the monument itself, as well as some information regarding the ensemble. </p><h2>  Mount of Bows </h2><p>  There is a Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Hill.  Once this place was not part of the city.  Moscow is the capital of Russia, which is growing and developing together with our state.  Today, this hill is located in the historical center of Zlatoglava.  Poklonnaya Gora was surrounded by two rivers under the bizarre names of Filka and Setun. </p>

    <p>  In the distant days, when the mountain was outside the city, travelers very often made a stop at this place, since the visitors of the city had a beautiful view from the top.  Guests of the capital left their wagons, examined the city from a height, then bowed low to the ground.  And so the mountain got its name. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  This hill was first mentioned in 16th century papers.  Then her name was a little longer.  The name of the tract on which it is located was added to Poklonnaya Gora.  In the end, this name looked like this: "Poklonnaya Gora on the Smolensk road." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Surprisingly, 200 years ago, Napoleon also stood on this mountain.  But not to bow.  The French commander in 1812 was waiting for the keys to the capital. </p><p>  Once upon a time, M.I. Kutuzov ascended here after the battle of Borodino.  And after another 50 years, during the years of World War II, our army moved to the front through this place in order to defend the country's borders and fight the fascist army.  In other words, the Victory Monument on the mountain symbolizes the valiant feat of our people. </p>

    <h2>  And what is on the hill today? </h2><p>  Nowadays Poklonnaya Gora is a huge architectural and <span>memorial complex,</span> but it‚Äôs crowded there not only on holidays.  Walks near the memorial are made not only by Muscovites, but also by guests of the city.  At the moment, the park area is 135 hectares.  Of these, 20 hectares is occupied by the ensemble of the monument. </p><p>  Already in 1942, it was decided that the Victory Monument would be located in this place. </p><p>  Later, in 1958, the builders of the city erected a memorial sign on which it was written that a monument would be erected here in honor of the victory of the Soviet people over the Nazis. </p><p>  Part of the funds for the construction of the memorial was allocated by the city treasury, and the second amount is donations from citizens and guests of the city.  The Victory Monument is surrounded by a museum dedicated to the Great Patriotic War, three temples, an obelisk (the highest in Russia), as well as an exhibition of military equipment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Symbolic obelisk </h2><p>  Strict and majestic Victory Monument.  Moscow is a record holder for high-rise monuments.  The obelisk stands on Victors Square.  It is considered <span>the highest monument in Russia.</span>  Its height is symbolic - 141.8 meters.  This is a kind of reference to the war, because 1,418 days lasted during the Second World War.  The stele is the main part of the monument.  It was made of high strength metal.  To mount the structure, I had to resort to the help of telescopic aerial platforms.  At the base of the obelisk are control rooms that monitor the lighting and ventilation of the monument.  At the foot of the stele stands on a granite statue of George the Victorious, who dealt with the serpent - a symbol of evil.  The weight of this whole structure is about 1000 tons! </p><p>  The foundation of the tallest statue of Russia required 2,000 cubic meters of concrete.  At an altitude of 100 meters, the obelisk is crowned with a statue of the victory goddess Nika with small cupids.  Their weight is 25 tons.  The obelisk got its name - ‚ÄúBayonet‚Äù, as it symbolizes this edged weapon. </p><p>  From the base to the 100 meters mark where Nika is located, three main stages of the war are depicted: </p><ul><li>  Battle of Stalingrad. </li><li>  Battle of Kursk. </li><li>  Belarusian operation. </li></ul><p>  To service such a stele, the city authorities had to install an elevator, which was ordered in Sweden.  He raises the masters to a height of 87 meters.  How long do you think it took to erect an obelisk?  Surprisingly, it was built in record time - 9 months.  The architect of the two sculptures (‚ÄúBayonet‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeorge the Victorious‚Äù) is Zurab Tsereteli. </p><h2>  Confrontations and Oscillations </h2><p>  Be that as it may, such a massive and tall statue without special devices should not have survived.  Project engineers S. S. Karmilov, B. V. Ostroumov and S. P. Murinov provided for this.  They equipped the obelisk with devices that damp vibrations, because by all laws of aerodynamics it has an unstable shape.  Engineers hid 19 dampers in it.  The main one was hidden behind Nicky, he dampens vibrations weighing 10 tons! </p>

    <p>  If you will ever be in Moscow, then be sure to visit the Victory Monument.  Moscow is supposedly guarded by three standing soldiers of various centuries of our state: </p><ul><li>  Slavic warriors; </li><li>  soldiers of the battle of Borodino; </li><li>  Soviet fighters-winners of 1945. </li></ul><p>  The monument is famous far beyond the borders of the country.  The feat of the people is glorified, as is the Victory Monument.  You need to take a photo and show it to your children so that they know the story and remember the feat of their ancestors! </p>
