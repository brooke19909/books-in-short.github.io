Shrouding haze of mysticism and magnificence, these beautiful buildings return modern tourists to those ancient times when formidable feudal lords ruled in Europe, the royal heirs to the throne sought their beautiful princesses around the world, and fearless knights went on long journeys to meet new dangers and adventures.  <span>White castles of the</span> world beckon with their beauty and charm, inviting visitors to the historical past. </p><h2>  Neuschwanstein (Germany) </h2><p>  One of the <span>most beautiful castles in the world.</span>  The fairy-tale palace, which has earned crazy popularity among travelers, stands among the dense forests of the Bavarian Alps.  Translated from German, Neuschwanstein means ‚ÄúNew Swan Stone‚Äù.  By the way, this feathery motif permeates the whole architecture - from the snow-white color of the walls to the heraldic symbol of the old Schwangau family.  The construction is relatively ‚Äúyoung‚Äù: it was built at the end of the 19th century. </p>

The main decoration of the entire architectural ensemble - the cathedral in the Gothic style - was never built.  Despite this, the splendor and glamor of the royal residence do not fade.  Having been here, you will be delighted with the stunning spectacle: the sun is reflected in the pearl walls, penetrating the rays into the rich throne room, decorated with frescoes and tapestries.  Another attraction is the grotto.  This fabulous room, arranged on the third floor, looks like a real cave of Ali Baba.

In ancient times, kings and court nobles built suburban residences in this place: there are about 300 of them here. Of the total mass of original and wonderful castles, Chambord stands out, according to legend, Leonardo da Vinci himself had a hand in the construction of it.  In addition, it was here that the famous playwright Moliere loved to retire, who wrote more than one play in the walls of the palace. </p>

But in Chambord, the interior decoration with its splendor and diversity surpasses the design of other palaces.  Here you can see a large number of paintings, which depict paintings from the life of glorious Paris, the exploits of Don Quixote and the alluring glow of Andromeda.  Ancient candelabra on the walls, marble decorations, cozy chapels and spiral staircases take visitors to the Renaissance.  The charming pearl of France is also famous all over the world for dog hunting, which is carried out as an attraction in neighboring forests today.

    <h2>  Lednice (Czech Republic) </h2><p>  One of the most famous castles of this country.  Situated in a picturesque park on the Dyy River, it has long become the cultural heritage of Europe and the object of enhanced UNESCO protection.  Lednice is mentioned in chronicles as early as the 13th century.  Once it was the property of the old Liechtenstein family, now this pearl of architecture belongs to the state.  The palace was given a modern look by the famous Austrian architect Ji≈ô√≠ Wingelm√ºller: he decorated the facade with battlements, fancy columns, aerial arches and miniature balconies. </p>

And Ukraine is no exception.  In the northeast, the chic Sharovsky Palace is located - the brainchild of Leopold Kening, the sugar king of tsarist Russia.  For elegance and charm, the building was called the "White Swan".  The two-story building of the Neo-Gothic style has three large halls and 26 rooms.  The main entrance is decorated with sophisticated spiers and turrets. </p>

The Green Zone is the brainchild of architect George Kufaldt, who spared no effort and money on arranging the territory.  Under his leadership, more than a hundred species of exotic plants were planted.  The crown of the park was a <span>linden alley,</span> the tree branches of which are located unusually: they grow vertically.  Not far from the castle is Sugar Hill.  Legend has it that the hill was created artificially at the request of the landowner's wife.  When she wanted to go sledding in a snowless winter, he ordered one of the nearest hills to be filled with sugar.

    <h2>  White Heron Castle (Japan) </h2><p>  The name speaks for itself.  Listing the most stunning white castles in the world, one cannot but mention this palace, graceful and neat.  Like a bird, it rises above the terrain.  The castle was built in the Harima area at the foot of Mount Hime.  The complex consists of 83 buildings that present the gaze of tourists with carefully-whitewashed walls, formidable loopholes and loopholes.  The palace, built in the 14th century, more than once passed from one clan of samurai to another, civil wars were constantly fought for it, destroying the ancient architectural ensemble.  Despite this, the modern version of the White Heron was completely renovated and supplemented with new facilities. </p>

The design was invented for the enemies: while they wander in the impassable slums of the garden, the guards will be able to prepare for the attack and open fire.  The park did not pass the battle test, since after the construction was completed in Japan, relatively peaceful times came.

    <h2>  Cape Coast (Ghana) </h2><p>  White castles are found not only in Europe and Asia, but even on the African continent.  The most charming was erected by the Portuguese in Ghana, on the west coast, where at that time they were actively engaged in trade in gold and wood.  At first it was just a miserable wooden fort, which after more than one hundred years turned into a white stone castle.  Nowadays, it is under the relentless care of UNESCO. </p>

In one of the many wings is a museum, the exhibits of which tell about the history of the struggle for land of local tribes and European conquerors.  One of the halls is dedicated to the pre-colonial history of the region: here you can see stone tools for hunting, primitive swords and very ancient scales for measuring precious metals, as well as African musical instruments, canoes and primitive dishes.  For extreme people, they offer a chilling tour of the dungeons, where many years ago death row cells were equipped with numerous tools for excruciating torture.

    <h2>  Cinderella Castle (USA) </h2><p>  No, this is not an old palace or a medieval temple complex.  Despite all its modernity, it is no less beautiful than other white castles in the world.  Photos and other images of the palace are striking: the structure exudes magic and splendor of past centuries.  It is located in Walt Disney Park in Orlando, which is the largest entertainment center on the planet.  Of course, the highlight of the object is Cinderella's Castle with its slender spiers, richly decorated towers and flickering lights. </p>

But the optical trick used here makes it even bigger and more massive.  For example, the height of the spire is half the total area, the angular elements are expanded, which creates the illusion of distance and height.  The snow-white castle with blue towers resembles a medieval fortress.  The creator of the complex, the architect Herbert Riemann, drew sketches under the impression of viewing the real palaces mentioned above.  This building serves as proof that in our time it is possible to build a grand and charming castle, there would be a desire and appropriate funding.  Like its ancient counterparts, Cinderella Castle is an architectural gem loved by tourists and revered by travelers.
