These are beautiful snow-white beaches, and the gentle sea with crystal clear turquoise water, and picturesque <span>coral reefs,</span> and shallows suitable for fishing, etc. Vacationers will be amazed by the beauty of the local nature: multicolored plains, neat hills and fanciful shapes of mountain ranges, lush ribs <span>tropical forests</span> and smoothly defined savannas, lush and brightly flowering exotic plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="islazul varazul 3" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/702172.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Cuba </h2><p>  In addition, in Cuba there are many comfortable hotels and hotel complexes that provide tourists with a fairly high level of rest, at the same time at relatively low prices.  Democratic hotels include treshki built before the 60s of the last century, for example, Slazul Varazul 3 * (Varadero).  Affordable prices are a good compensation for the high costs of the flight.  But, once on the island of Freedom, you will forget about everything in the world and immerse yourself in the pleasant atmosphere of bliss.  On the magnificent beaches of the Caribbean, you can get the perfect tan, soak up the gentle waters of the southern sea, enjoy water sports, go fishing or explore <span>the seabed.</span>  And in the evenings - it’s wonderful to relax with a glass of the Cuban famous rum, smoking a Havana cigar to the rhythmic sounds of salsa and watching the sultry dances of beautiful cubes and local machos.  And lovers of the excursion program can have an interesting time, signing up for entertaining excursions to the historical and natural attractions of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slazul varazul 3 varadero" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/702168.jpg" width="600"></div>

This means that, despite the geographical location, there is no sharply defined seasonality.  The climate in Cuba is tropical, under the influence of the trade winds.  The hottest month is July, when the thermometer reaches a 36-degree mark, and the coldest is January, when the air cools to + 20-21 degrees Celsius.  One of the features of the local climate is its very high humidity.  Which for tourists with high blood pressure can cause discomfort.  However, due to the sea wind, it is tolerated quite easily.  As for the water temperature, the sea does not cool below year-round +24 ° .  So, dear tourists, you can buy a ticket to Varadero.  Varadero Islazul Varazul 3 * even during off-season will give a few pleasant days in all respects. </p><h2>  What is interesting vacation in Cuba </h2><p>  The Caribbean already have a great <span>beach holiday.</span>  For this, there is almost everything.  And superbly equipped areas for a civil, comfortable stay, as well as wild beaches in quiet charming blue lagoons, the view of which is simply breathtaking.  Everyone chooses a place to their liking.  In addition <span>,</span> diving <span>,</span> diving and snorkeling enthusiasts come to Cuba.  They do not chase too much for comfortable living conditions and settle in hotels like Islazur Valazur or Islazul Acuazul Varazul 3 *, which belong to the same hotel chain.  The coastal zone of the island is as if created for underwater walks.  Not far from the coast, fabulous coral gardens "grow" under water.  By the way, for those who are going to make their first underwater trip, there are special diving schools on the island, in which instructors teach everyone the basics of it.  The same goes for wind surfing.  As already noted, Cuba is often attacked by winds of various intensities, which, of course, cause unrest at sea, which is a find for conquerors of waves.  However, they must take into account that all equipment, that is, a wave board, must be brought with them, since it will be impossible to rent it in Cuba.  The best resort among the Cuban, designed for sea hunting, windsurfing and diving, is Varadero.  It is here that the Islazul Varazul 3 * hotel is located.  By the way, it is located on the first beach line.  This is a fairly rare occurrence, as the island is primarily occupied by 4 and 5 star hotels on the first line.  However, this hotel was built a long time ago and was one of the best in the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="varadero varadero islazul varazul 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/704000.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Islazul Varazul 3 *: reviews and ratings of vacationers </h2><p>  In their comments, guests of the hotel we are reviewing speak of him mainly in a positive way.  They advise you to remember that this is a three-star hotel, and therefore you should not expect any special service from the establishment.  Nevertheless, everything is in order: the staff are good-natured, helpful, trying to please and help.  Clean, comfortable, without frills, of course, but everything is pretty nice, in a word, as it should be in a hotel of this category.  In addition, Cuba itself, and the resort of Varadero, are so hospitable and friendly to tourists that this can compensate for any shortcomings in the service. </p>
