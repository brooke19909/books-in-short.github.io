  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hierarchy Analysis Method</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to make certain <span>decisions of a managerial</span> nature, as well as in order to preliminary predict the likely results, the person who is responsible for making the decision often encounters a significant number of interdependent elements, the system of which is rather complicated. </p><p>  Existing resources, expected results or intended goals should be reviewed.  In the case when economic elements are reduced to numbers (monetary, quantitative equivalent, as well as weight and time), it turns out that human capabilities are directly dependent on the measured factors. </p><p>  If the built-up probability model does not work well, then this means that significant details were missed during the adoption of various assumptions.  Thus, <span>social sciences</span> blame the negative results on political figures, on the weakness of the human nature, as well as other factors that are considered as temporary unfortunate misunderstandings.  However, they are precisely the fundamental elements that must be measured to obtain a reliable result. </p><p>  In modern society there are a large number of technologies of an informational nature, the use of which allows us to make our life as easy as possible and provide assistance in the event of a problem related to a specific decision in various fields of activity.  One of the most common goal approval systems currently used is the hierarchy analysis method.  It was developed by T. Saati, an American scientist. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A hierarchy is a certain type of system, which is based on the assumption that its elements are capable of forming sets of an unrelated nature.  The components of each sector are influenced by members belonging to a particular area, and other groups are affected.  The hierarchy analysis method allows the independence of elements at each level and is performed in the form of the following scheme: </p><p>  - distribution of the existing problem in the choice, which is a network or hierarchy; <br>  - highlighting the priorities, assessments, as well as the criteria of all alternative solutions; <br>  - calculation of the importance factors applied to elements of all levels, taking into account the consistency of judgments; <br>  - calculation of the combined weight coefficient and determination of the best solution. </p><p>  The hierarchy analysis method as its key task puts forward the highest level assessment taking into account the interaction of different levels.  The direct dependence of the elements is not taken into account.  Currently, the construction of a system in the form of hierarchical steps appears in various sciences.  The problem is divided into the simplest components, which allows us to more accurately process the sequential actions of people who make a certain decision. <br>  The method of analysis of hierarchies, an example of which can be used to analyze the <span>production cycle</span> in the form of grouping employees into workers, craftsmen, managers, and so on, provides for linear subordination. </p><p>  Sometimes the upper level can be in a dependent position, at the same time exerting a certain influence.  Such an example of a hierarchy is non-linear.  The analysis method of this type in its simplest form is based from the very top, passing through intermediate criteria to the lowest level.  She is a complex of alternatives. </p><p>  The hierarchy analysis method involves the following steps: </p><p>  - finding problems; <br>  - building a hierarchical ladder, which consists in splitting the task into separate components; <br>  - determination of the weight of alternatives; <br>  - an assessment of the priority of each available item; <br>  - checking consistency between priorities; <br>  - solution. </p>
