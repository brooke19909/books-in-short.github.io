Many tour operators say that the complex is located on the first line, but in fact it is the second line.  However, to go to the beach is not far away - about five minutes.  The coast is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  The sandy beach is very clean, workers clean it daily.  From time to time, algae appear in the water after sea disturbance, which are quickly removed.  There is a bar on the beach serving refreshments to guests.  Towels for trips to the sea are issued against a deposit returned at the end of the stay. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Hotel Cedriana Djerba 3 * (Djerba, Tunisia), as we have already mentioned, is located in the northern part of the island of Djerba, which is the southernmost sea resort of the country.  It is always a little warmer here than on the continent.  The island is famous for its fine sand beaches, a huge selection of modern hotels for every taste and wealth, as well as the best centers of thalassotherapy. </p><p>  Sea vacations can be combined with sightseeing of local attractions, which are abundant in Djerba.  The capital of the island is Houmt Souk, and the second largest city is Midoun.  All other settlements on Djerba are small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caribbean world cedriana 3 tunisia djerba" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1530674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The island is good for a measured and relaxing holiday, the local climate and the coast are great for children.  On Djerba you can see blooming lotuses, which are considered its symbol.  In addition, the island has interesting places that are worth visiting for tourists. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Tunisia attracts vacationers primarily for its prices.  And Djerba is interesting for tourists in terms of climatic conditions.  The island is located in the <span>Bay of Gabes</span> and is close to the Sahara, where additional heat comes from.  As a result, its climate is warm and mild, and the swimming season lasts almost the entire year. </p><p>  The high season begins in April and ends in November.  During this period, the air temperature rises to 22 degrees.  But from December to March, the thermometer does not drop below 15-17 degrees in the daytime, but at night it can be quite cool (5-7 degrees). </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing on the island, you can visit the most interesting sights.  There is public transport on Djerba, but it usually does not reach the right places, so if you plan to move around the island on your own, it is better to rent a car or take a taxi.  Such trips will be much cheaper than tours of tour operators. </p><p>  Tourists will be interested to see the Gazi Mustafa fortress, which is located in the capital of Houmt Souk.  It was built back in the ninth century to protect against pirate raids.  The fortress is made of local sandstone and is very beautiful in the rays of the setting or rising sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cedriana djerba 3 reviews" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1530678.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Jerba Lagoon is a stunningly beautiful place inhabited by pink flamingos.  Feathered birds have long chosen salty shallow water in the north-east of the island.  In winter, the lagoon is a swaying pink carpet of birds. </p><p>  The La Griba Synagogue is popular with tourists.  It is located in a small village and on the outside is nothing interesting.  But her interior is worth a look.  In its walls are stored the oldest books and documents. </p><h2>  Cedriana Djerba 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of guests who visited it.

    <p>  Hotel workers are fluent in French, they also know the duty phrases in Russian.  You can always explain.  If you have any difficult questions that cannot be resolved without a good knowledge of the language, you can contact the hotel manager, Selim.  He is fluent in Russian and solves any issues. </p><p>  Check-in at the hotel occurs immediately upon arrival, subject to availability.  There are situations when all apartments are occupied and you have to wait until they are released, but this happens infrequently. </p><p>  The furnishing of the rooms is quite simple, but all the equipment is in working order.  The apartment is clean and comfortable.  Attentive discussion staff clean the rooms daily, towels are changed as needed (when you throw them on the bathroom floor).  The wardrobe has an extra pillow and warm blankets that may be needed during low season. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  According to vacationers, Cedriana Djerba 3 * (Djerba) has very good food.  The main restaurant serves excellent food without specific seasonings, which is suitable even for children.  For breakfast, the buffet has pancakes, omelets, scrambled eggs, vegetables, fruits, cheeses, sausages, boiled eggs, pasta, yogurts, pastries. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner there are meat dishes, several varieties of fish, salads, side dishes (potatoes, pasta, rice), fruits, vegetables.  On a separate table there are always national dishes that are worth a try. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caribbean world cedriana 3 djerba" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1530684.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sweets and desserts deserve special attention, they are always very tasty and are present in large quantities.  Of the fruits, the restaurant serves melons, watermelons, citrus fruits, apples, peaches, grapes and plums.  There is no separate menu for children, but all food is quite acceptable for kids.  In addition, there are yogurts, granola and milk that children love.  In general, the food is adapted for Europeans, because there are cereals and various side dishes. </p><p>  Ice cream at the hotel is served twice a day, which is very pleasing not only for adults, but also for children. </p><p>  For breakfast, tourists are offered tea and coffee, but for dinner they have to go to the bar.  The fact is that Europeans prefer to take wine (both have a separate wine rack) and carbonated drinks for food, day and evening, and tea and coffee at this time are mainly consumed only by our compatriots. </p><h2>  Animation Reviews </h2><p>  Cedriana Djerba 3 * (Tunisia) boasts excellent animations.  The team of young people throughout the day offers a variety of activities for guests, and does it completely unobtrusively, skillfully luring even the most lazy tourists.  Vacationers can attend dance and yoga classes, shoot archery, play darts.  Rackets and tennis balls are available.  There is a mini club for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cedriana djerba 3 jerba" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1530686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the beach, guests can play volleyball and bocce.  In the evenings, on the venue between the bar and the pool, the entertainment program begins with a children's disco, which gradually flows into the show for older guests.  According to tourists, the animation in the hotel is up to standard, a similar range of entertainment can not always be seen even in more expensive complexes. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Club Cedriana Djerba 3 * (Djerba) has its own beach.  However, in Tunisia, 30 meters of the coastline are considered municipal, and therefore it should not be surprising that camels roam the beach and scurry about with merchants.  However, sellers of souvenirs here are completely unobtrusive, just say the word ‚Äúno‚Äù, and no one will bore you with idle persuasion.  The local coast is covered with fine sand, the entry into the sea is very convenient and shallow.  Sometimes algae appears, which are quickly removed by the caretakers.  There are a lot of water activities on the beach. </p><p>  The hotel has representatives of all tour operators.  All of them offer different excursions.  You can use their services, or you can travel around the island by taxi or rented car. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Cedriana Djerba 3 * is a great place to relax, which in the best way meets the principle of a successful combination of "price - quality".  At an acceptable cost of tours, vacationers get excellent food, a good room, a rich entertainment program and, of course, a beautiful sea. </p>
