There are several ways, however, one of them will be described in detail in this article.  It should be noted right away that activation of a Beeline SIM card on a tablet is almost similar to this process on a phone, but, despite this, several features and differences will be described.  The whole process will take place in several stages.  Let's get down to the first method! </p><h2>  Activation by USSD request </h2><p>  Activating a Beeline SIM card is the easiest and most effective way.  Moreover, it is the most common. </p><p>  In general, the USSD code is an interactive command that allows the user to begin direct interaction with the operator of a particular network.  There are a great many of such codes, and each of them is different. </p><p>  So, we directly proceed to activation. </p><h2>  First step </h2><p>  Take the plastic panel and separate the Beeline SIM from it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meshok.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastic panel" class="if uuid-3208661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3208661.jpg"></div><p>  Do this as carefully as possible so as not to damage it.  After doing this, in no case do not discard the plastic panel, as it contains a lot of important information that you will need more than once in the future.  Here is the PIN code, some other unlock codes, a number of requests are listed that will be useful to you when using and activating the Beeline SIM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Second step </h2><p>  Insert a SIM card and launch your device.  You will immediately be greeted by a window for entering a PIN code.  You need to enter the one that is indicated on the same plastic panel.  Be careful when entering this code, because if you enter it incorrectly the third time, then most likely your SIM card will be blocked without the possibility of unblocking it yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablyk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PIN problem" class="if uuid-3208655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3208655.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth knowing that the PIN code contains only four digits.  If you see several codes of different lengths, then you need to choose the four-digit one.  If you see several four-character codes, then select the one above which the "PIN code" is written. </p><h2>  Final step </h2><p>  As soon as your device fully boots up and connects to the cellular network, go to the dialer menu and enter * 101 * 1111 #. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pro-beeline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSD Code" class="if uuid-3208670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3208670.jpg"></div><p>  This code will put your card in a state of complete readiness for use.  Be careful when entering these numbers, because if you make the wrong request, you will either get a completely different result that will not be useful to you, but on the contrary, it can be harmful or you won‚Äôt get anything at all!  If you nevertheless entered the wrong request, it is highly recommended that you contact the Beeline network office directly.  There you will be provided with highly qualified assistance and a detailed description of the solution to your problem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tablet Activation </h2><p>  Beeline SIM card activation on Android tablets can differ by only two factors, which will be described below. </p><ol><li>  There is a possibility that the device will not read the card, but this happens extremely rarely.  If this still happened, you need to ask for help at any nearest Beeline office.  And there they either completely replace the SIM, or adapt it for the tablet and activate. </li><li>  It is possible that the USSD code that you used on the phone will not work.  There are almost no such cases.  And if you suddenly find yourself in such a situation, then the only right decision will also be to contact the Beeline office.  The operator owns information about all the new Beeline SIM activation codes.  Of course, you can try to configure everything yourself using the Internet, but you need to be clearly aware that there is an extremely high risk of SIM card blocking, as well as violations of some functions of the tablet. </li></ol><p>  Despite all this, you should not worry too much, because these factors have largely become relics of the past.  Nowadays, phones are as close to tablets as possible.  So all the processes on these devices have become absolutely identical, including the activation of the Beeline SIM! </p><h2>  If it doesn‚Äôt work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Got a question" class="if uuid-3208671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3208671.jpg"></div><p>  If you still couldn‚Äôt solve the problem of activating the Beeline SIM on your phone, then there are several scenarios: </p><ol><li>  Once again, carefully review the instructions above.  It often happens that even the smallest deviation from these actions brings not the best consequences.  Meanwhile, remember that absolutely every phone has its own characteristics, which can be both positive and negative, so the process may vary slightly.  For example, the number of attempts to enter a PIN code may be more or less.  If you differ from the instructions, you should be more careful.  However, despite this, the guide to action described above is suitable for the majority of users. </li><li>  Check if you entered all the data correctly.  This problem haunts a great many users.  It would seem that everything was done according to the instructions, but nothing works!  In this case, the human factor plays: most likely, you entered some data incorrectly.  In particular, pay attention to the request you entered (USSD code).  Often it is precisely because users enter it incorrectly, and the whole clue lies. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Important!</strong> </p><p>  Never be lazy to double-check the entered data and compare them with the instructions!  It‚Äôs not for nothing that they say the phrase: ‚ÄúMeasure seven times, cut one.‚Äù </p><h2>  In case of emergency </h2><p>  If even after all these actions the activation of the Beeline SIM card on the phone did not occur, then the only right solution for you would be going to the office of this network.  There you can talk with the operator and find out the answer to all your questions.  Right on the spot, you can activate your SIM card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cityreporter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline office" class="if uuid-3208674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3208674.jpg"></div><p>  When talking with the operator, some rules must be observed in order for him to be able to provide you with quick and qualified assistance: </p><ul><li>  Have patience!  In addition to you, the operator can have a great many clients whose problems can be even more serious than yours.  In no case should you raise your voice at him and be rude to him.  Remember that this will not lead to anything good, but it will be unpleasant for him to serve you! </li><li>  Remember that the operator is not omnipotent!  Of course, he has some data, information and skills that are not accessible to ordinary users, but not every problem can be solved.  So to be offended by the operator, because the problem has not been solved or has been solved slowly, is not an option!  Try to solve it in another way, for example, by replacing a SIM card.  In large Beeline offices, operators themselves propose replacing it if they cannot activate it manually. </li><li>  Describe your problem in as much detail as possible.  Every detail is important and will play a role in fixing it.  Even the seemingly smallest details can become the key to its solution.  Remember that the more fully and fully you describe the situation that happened to you, the faster they will help you deal with it.  In any case, you will be given a truly correct answer. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to note that activation of a Beeline SIM card is not such a complicated process.  If you follow the instructions above one hundred percent, then be sure that you will not have any problems and difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kmw.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM card &quot;Beeline&quot;" class="if uuid-3208678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/140623/3208678.jpg"></div><p>  If they do arise, then this article also described how to solve them.  It should be noted that even though the trip to the office is in the last paragraph, it is one of the most effective and working ways to solve absolutely any problems of users of this network. </p><p>  Never neglect help and feel free to ask for it.  After all, often the problem is simply impossible to solve on your own! </p>
