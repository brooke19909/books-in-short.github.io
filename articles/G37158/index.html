    <h2>  First way </h2><p>  The first method includes such quick money counting techniques as: </p><ul><li>  <em>Card</em> .  This technique came from the world of card games.  To check which cards are missing in the deck for any reason, the cards are piled in suits.  In the same way, bills are laid out, but not by suit, but by face value. </li><li>  <em>Fan</em> .  Banknotes are held in hand or laid on a table, fan-shaped so that the edge of each banknote with the indicated denomination is highlighted.  At this value and consider. </li><li>  <em>A pile of</em> .  How to count money in this way?  A pack of notes is placed on the table.  The right hand is placed on top of the middle of the pack, the left corner is bent and considered at face value.  Professional cashiers can count a bundle of bills in 1-2 minutes. </li></ul><p>  To increase the counting speed, all bills must be folded with the same side up or down.  These money counting techniques are suitable when you need to calculate large amounts.  They are suitable only for calm conditions - when there is no risk that people who are indoors can steal money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Second way </h2><p>  With this method of calculation, the following techniques are used: </p><ul><li>  <em>In size and color.</em>  Coins and banknotes of different denominations differ in size and color.  Chervonets are gray, fifty-ruble are blue, hundredths are khaki, five hundred ruble are purple, thousandths are green, five thousandths are red.  Coins differ not only in color, chervonets - yellow, but also in size.  The five-copeck coins are larger than the two-ruble, dozens are smaller in diameter, but thicker and heavier. </li><li>  <em>The corner</em> .  The bills are counted at face value, holding them with one hand in a pile, and the other bend the corner. </li></ul><p>  Usually the change given out consists of a small number of bills, and it is often possible to calculate it simply by looking at the money.  Since it is necessary to count money by weight, both hands are used to make the speed as high as possible. </p><p>  If everything is clear with paper money, then how to count electronic money?  Although they are automatically calculated on the server, however, in the store, especially in the supermarket, the money on the card may not be enough to pay for all goods. </p>

    <h2>  Devices for quick money counting </h2><p>  In banks and in enterprises where the speed of cash counting is of particular importance, since the amounts received are often simply huge, from the point of view of a simple layman, they use special equipment.  These are cash machines.  How to count money on a calculating machine depends on what operating principle is used.  Depending on this, they are divided into vacuum and roller-friction.  The difference between them is not so much in the size of the device and the speed of counting (almost all models on the market are easily placed on the desk), but in the price per machine.  Before counting bills on a vacuum apparatus, the bundles are previously unpacked - torn paper tapes and placed in a special tray.  Roller-friction can consider money in batches. </p><p>  Only large banks and enterprises can afford a cash machine or several devices.  Therefore, the skills of quick money counting will be in demand for a long time among sellers and cashiers.  Despite the fact that more and more people pay with a bank card, the share of paper money is still high simply because banknotes are trusted more.  How to learn to count money fast?  Practice and only constant practice will help develop this skill. </p>
