  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Psychological analysis of the lesson - features, requirements and sample</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A lesson is the basic unit in the educational process.  This is an organized form of training in which the teacher oversees the cognitive and other activities of the team for a clearly defined time.  In this case, the characteristics of each student are taken into account.  Methods and means of work are used that create favorable conditions for students to master the fundamentals of the subject being studied.  This whole process is called a psychological analysis of the lesson.  Our material will describe in detail about this procedure. </p><h2>  Lesson as a unit of the educational process </h2><p>  To begin a psychological analysis of the lesson, you should provide a definition of this form of training.  A lesson is called one of the forms of the educational process in which the teacher oversees the activities of his students for a certain amount of time in order to learn certain information.  Each lesson is made up of certain elements - stages and links.  All of them are characterized by various types of teacher and student activities.  The available elements can appear in different combinations, determining the structure of the lesson.  It can be simple and complex, which depends on the content of the educational material, on the objectives of the lesson, age characteristics of students and class features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easternchristian.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="psychological analysis lesson example" class="if uuid-2552293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43355/2552293.jpg"></div><p>  The psychological analysis of the lesson involves the identification of the main features of this form of the educational process.  It should be noted here: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The presence of a permanent group of students. </li><li>  The activities of students, taking into account the characteristic features of each of them. </li><li>  Mastering the basics of the material studied. </li></ul><p>  It is necessary to conduct timely psychological analysis of the lessons in order to improve their quality and effectiveness.  For a long time, the lesson will remain the only and irreplaceable unit of instruction.  At the moment, this is the most convenient form of the educational process. </p><h2>  Types of Lessons </h2><p>  The next stage of the psychological analysis of the lesson is the formation of a classification of forms of the educational process.  There is no generally accepted system to this day.  This is explained by a number of circumstances.  One of them is the versatility and complexity of the relationship between student and teacher.  The most common classification is that proposed by Boris Petrovich Yesipov, a Soviet doctor of pedagogical sciences.  He highlights: </p><ul><li>  Lessons of the mixed (combined) type. </li><li>  Introductory lessons, aimed at the accumulation of initial facts and ideas about specific phenomena, understanding and mastering generalizations. </li><li>  Control and fixing lessons needed to repeat the material. </li><li>  Classes in which students develop skills and consolidate the knowledge gained. </li><li>  Lessons verification. </li></ul><p>  The psychological analysis of the lesson in elementary school showed that the main emphasis is on the principle of concentration.  It involves a phased study of the material with regular repetition of the information passed.  Children in primary school should combine primary knowledge with already learned.  This will give the necessary fixing effect.  Lessons based on the principle of concentration are most often combined.  Within the framework of the academic hour, lecture materials, consolidation of the studied, control and independent work can be combined. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Introductory lessons involve the study of new, previously unknown material.  The study can be carried out both under the guidance of a teacher, and in the form of independent work.  At the end of the lesson, a task is given to repeat the learned information. </p><p>  Consolidation lessons involve the understanding of previously learned knowledge with the aim of assimilating them firmly.  Students deepen their understanding of a particular field by performing home, creative, written, or oral exercises. </p><p>  The last <span>type of lesson</span> is called the verification test.  The teacher assesses the degree of knowledge of the information provided. </p><p>  Thus, a psychological analysis of a lesson in a school can be applied immediately to several forms of the educational process.  Next, you should consider the structure of the school lesson. </p><h2>  Lesson structure </h2><p>  A school lesson consists of several stages, so it can be represented as a diagram.  The psychological analysis of the lesson involves a description of its ten main stages. </p><p>  The first is related to the organization of the beginning of the lesson.  Students are preparing for work in the class: this is a greeting, a test of readiness for the class, a quick inclusion in the business rhythm, etc.  The first stage requires the teacher of such qualities as exactingness, friendliness, composure, organization.  It is also required to check the readiness of the equipment for the lesson, etc. </p><p>  The second stage is related to checking homework.  The accuracy and awareness of the performance of work by all or most students should be established.  Discovered gaps should be addressed and knowledge gaps closed.  The ground should be cleared for further work by the teacher.  The psychological analysis of the lesson shows that the second stage is one of the most important for the entire lesson.  The teacher can evaluate the results of their work by the quality of students doing homework. </p><p>  At the third stage, there is an active preparation for the further activities of the teacher and students.  Basic skills and knowledge should be updated, cognitive motives should be formed, goals and objectives of the lesson should be disclosed. </p><p>  At the fourth stage, new knowledge is acquired.  The teacher‚Äôs goal is to form specific ideas about the phenomena, facts, processes and relationships studied by students. </p><p>  At the fifth stage, an initial test of students' understanding of the new educational material takes place. </p><p>  The sixth stage is associated with the consolidation of knowledge by solving problems and exercises.  As the psychological analysis of the lesson shows, an example, exercises and tests are the most effective tools for remembering new information. </p><p>  At the seventh stage, the knowledge gained is subject to generalization and systematization.  Additional concepts, secondary connections and other educational elements are introduced that will help to form an idea on the topic studied. </p><p>  The eighth stage involves self-testing of knowledge.  Here, shortcomings in the study of the material and the causes of these shortcomings are revealed.  The search for specific problems will encourage students to test the completeness, awareness and strength of existing skills. </p><p>  At the ninth stage, the results of the lesson are summarized.  The teacher builds a brief outline of the psychological analysis of the lesson.  It characterizes the work of the class, directs children to further development, evaluates the success in achieving certain goals. </p><p>  At the tenth (final) stage, the teacher gives information about homework, as well as a brief briefing on its implementation. </p><p>  Classification of lessons by type and identification of the most complete structure of the classic lesson are included in the psychological analysis of the lesson.  In the activity of a teacher of this kind, analysis also occupies a special place.  The teacher is able to independently characterize the constructed unit of the educational process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.the74million.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lesson psychological analysis scheme" class="if uuid-2552296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43355/2552296.jpg"></div><h2>  Lesson objectives </h2><p>  What goals does the teacher set for himself, forming the next training lesson?  These are educational, educational and developmental tasks.  The group of educational goals includes the following points: </p><ul><li>  The formation of special knowledge and skills in the subject. </li><li>  Providing information about concepts, laws, theory and scientific facts during the lesson. </li><li>  The formation of students' skills and abilities. </li><li>  Filling the gaps in knowledge, special and general scientific skills. </li><li>  Providing control over the assimilation of knowledge and skills. </li><li>  Teaching students self-understanding of the essence of the material being studied. </li><li>  The formation of academic work skills, thinking over the course of its implementation, preparation for active work, compliance with a rational labor regime, etc. </li></ul><p>  The group of educational goals includes the following types of criteria: </p><ul><li>  Influence on professional self-determination. </li><li>  Promotion of labor education of students. </li><li>  Military-patriotic education. </li><li>  Aesthetic perception. </li><li>  The inculcation of moral and humanistic ideals and principles. </li><li>  Education of responsibility for the results of academic work, awareness of its significance, observance of safety measures and sanitary-hygienic service conditions. </li><li>  The requirement from students of perseverance, accuracy, perseverance, ability to overcome difficulties, etc. </li></ul><p>  The group of developmental goals includes the development of students' motivational qualities, creating situations of entertainment, joy, surprise, discussion and much more.  Here it is necessary to highlight the ability to reason logically, to briefly and clearly state your thoughts.  Of particular importance is the development of cognitive interest, the formation of alternative thinking, the ability to separate the main from the secondary, the assessment of events and much more. </p><p>  The plan of the psychological analysis of the lesson is drawn up based on the designated goals.  It is necessary to understand exactly what tasks the students should face. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.education.gov.gy" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="psychological analysis of the lesson in elementary school" class="if uuid-2552298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43355/2552298.jpg"></div><h2>  Psychological analysis procedure </h2><p>  One way to objectify teacher work is a psychological analysis of the lesson.  In the activities of the teacher, this process is quite important.  The analysis allows you to look at the school lesson from the outside, highlight its advantages and disadvantages, analyze the main directions of optimization of the lesson sphere.  A rather large number of studies and methodological works are devoted to the characterization of the lessons.  Scientists emphasize the versatility of the analysis of the lesson, the importance of the teacher taking into account all aspects of pedagogical interaction, the characteristics of its subjects and activities. </p><p>  Psychological analysis consists of several stages.  The first four stages have already been presented above.  This is a characteristic of the concept, identifying the main types of the lesson, the formation of the structure and the designation of goals.  Having examined the school lesson from all sides and providing a description of its main elements, attention should be paid to its main psychological approaches. </p><p>  The subject of psychological analysis is multifaceted.  These are psychological traits of the personality of the teacher himself, the laws of the learning process, the specifics of the educational process, the analytical abilities of students, their skills and much more. </p><p>  All analytical procedures are carried out by external experts in the field of pedagogy, or by the teachers themselves.  A special form of psychological analysis of the lesson is being compiled, which may vary from school to school.  The form is executed in the form of a small document, which indicates the goals and results of the procedure. </p><p>  GEF standards have developed a form for filling out the introductory lesson in elementary school.  The heading of the document indicates the class, topic of the lesson, goals and <span>objectives of the lesson,</span> as well as the relationship of the lesson with previous and future classes.  Next, a table of students' knowledge levels is built.  High, sufficient, medium, satisfactory and low levels should be highlighted here.  Nearby is a table with motivation data: low and high.  The last column is aimed at monitoring and evaluating the quality of knowledge and skills.  The main stages of the lesson, methods and types of control, control functions and the procedure for assessing knowledge are indicated. </p><p>  Next, we will talk about the main examples of the psychological analysis of the lesson. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rand.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lesson psychological analysis plan" class="if uuid-2552294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43355/2552294.jpg"></div><h2>  Analysis forms </h2><p>  According to S.L.  To Rubinstein, an analysis of schoolwork is a mental dismemberment of a phenomenon, subject or situation and a search for its constituent parts, elements, moments and sides.  The forms of the analytical procedure are quite diverse.  A common example of a psychological analysis of a lesson in elementary school is the restoration of a disassembled into a whole.  The teacher sees specific elements, forms connections between them, and then builds an integrated system with many different phenomena and stages. </p><p>  The main "components" of the lesson are the students themselves and the teacher.  Both of these elements are interconnected and interdependent.  Psychological analysis can be presented in the form of analysis through synthesis.  As a person unfolds the system of connections and relations in which the analyzed object is located, he begins to notice, analyze and discover new, still unknown attributes of this object.  There is also a form of analysis through synthesis.  It reflects the whole variety of connections between the lesson components, that is, it contributes to a deeper knowledge of the teacher of the most complex psychological aspects of learning. </p><p>  The purpose of the psychological analysis of the lesson is to identify the main shortcomings in the work of the teacher and further work on their correction. </p><h2>  Objects of psychological analysis </h2><p>  Pedagogical reflection has as its objects the motives of teachers.  Along with positive motives of a socially significant nature, one should also single out motives associated with the influence of external circumstances.  So, if positive motives are an understanding of the social significance of their work, a desire to work with people, etc., then external motives are associated with interest in the profession, the ability to engage in a favorite subject and work. </p><p>  The object of reflection can also be the result of pedagogical activity.  As a result, a documentary sample of the psychological analysis of the lesson should be compiled.  It should indicate the main disadvantages of the work done. </p><p>  We present a sample showing how the analysis of the lesson in the Russian language should look like (in accordance with GEF: </p><div class="photo" data-original="nsportal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lesson analysis sample" class="if uuid-2552745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2552745.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, the objects of psychological analysis of the lesson are the various motives of the teacher‚Äôs performance, or the results of the work done.  However, you need to understand that objects act as weaknesses and strengths of the implemented activities. </p><h2>  Preliminary analysis </h2><p>  The first level of psychological analysis of schoolwork is a preliminary analysis.  Initially, a protocol of the psychological analysis of the lesson is compiled, which contains three columns: about the preliminary, current and retrospective analysis of the lesson. </p><p>  At the first level, an analysis of the preparation stage for the lesson is conducted.  The teacher has an "image-design" of the future lesson, still "faceless", without spatial and temporal boundaries.  Then the teacher proceeds to a thorough and comprehensive characterization of everything that is connected with the future training session.  This is the collection of teaching aids, the formation of programs, a set of methods, techniques and methods of working with material, etc.  In the process of analysis, the teacher prepares a plan or compendium of a specific lesson, that is, the "model performer" that should be implemented. </p><p>  In the analysis of the lesson, the teacher must consciously and purposefully use theoretical ideas from general, age, pedagogical and social psychology.  The teacher faces the main psychological problems of organizing the educational procedure.  The productivity and success of the lesson will largely depend on the analysis and consideration of several factors: what, whom, who, and how to teach. </p><p>  The most common form of a psychoanalysis lesson is: </p><div class="photo" data-original="pasparolehor.lark.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of psychological analysis of the lesson" class="if uuid-2552622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43355/2552622.jpg"></div><p>  The first factor is the specificity of the subject matter - that is, how it acts as the goal and means of the learning process.  The second factor affects the absorption of knowledge.  We are talking about the professional features of the teacher and his individual psychological characteristics.  Finally, the third factor is associated with the personality of the learner, his age and individual psychological characteristics.  The influence of this factor is manifested in all psychological components of assimilation.  This is a positive attitude of students to the subject, active comprehension of the material, direct familiarization with the information through feelings, as well as remembering and saving acquired and processed information. </p><p>  It is from the preliminary stage that the rest of the process of psychological analysis of the lesson depends.  Organization of students' attention, planning and distribution of material - all this will be associated with the preliminary stage. </p><p>          ,    . </p><h2>   </h2><p>            .         .     .       ,    .        ,      .        .         .           . </p><p>  Here are the highlights: </p><ul><li>   . </li><li>    . </li><li>    . </li><li>      . </li><li>       . </li><li>    . </li><li>     . </li><li>  ,    :  , , ,   .. </li><li>        . </li></ul><p>            . </p><h2>   </h2><p>        .     .   ,        .              . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cambridge.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="     " class="if uuid-2552300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43355/2552300.jpg"></div><p>         ,        .  ,          . </p><p>         .             . </p><p>             .        ,     .      ,          .   ,    (     )    .          ,      . </p><p>        .         . </p>
